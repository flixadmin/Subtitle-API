1
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,501
Yes?

2
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:55,459
Hello.

3
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:57,084
- I'm going down.
- Me too.

4
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,834
CUSTODY

5
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,584
I'll read Julien's statement.

6
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:47,542
This hearing was postponed to take it.

7
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,084
A word about his statement.

8
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:54,251
When we send children
to family mediation services

9
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:57,209
- I'll explain if you don't know -

10
00:02:57,376 --> 00:03:02,417
we tell them that what they say
will be shared with their parents.

11
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:06,626
If they don't want something shared,
they mustn't say it.

12
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,917
It's a matter of due process.

13
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:11,834
Everyone must be fully informed.

14
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:17,626
Julien is 11. He's in 6th grade
at Monod Junior High in Saint-Dumont.

15
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:19,042
He said:

16
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,959
"My parents separated a year ago.
I live with Mom and my sister.

17
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:26,209
"There's a party
for my sister's 18th birthday.

18
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:28,959
"We live with Papy and Nana
except my father.

19
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,667
"Mom doesn't help with homework.
I'm a good student.

20
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:36,167
"I have lots of friends
and get by fine."

21
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,459
Where was I?

22
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,001
"...lots of friends and get by fine.

23
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:49,334
"I can't play outside.
We're scared that man will come.

24
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,376
"Papy screams. It's not good for him.

25
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:55,792
"When he comes, I worry about Mom.
All he wants

26
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,292
"is to harass her."

27
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,376
Listen to what I'm saying.

28
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:02,709
You can speak to your lawyer later.

29
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:08,042
"I worry about Mom.
He wants to hurt her.

30
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,959
"He's no father.
I'm glad they're divorcing.

31
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,751
"I can't leave my mom and sister alone."
Bad reason.

32
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,334
"Josephine dislikes him
but she's old enough to not see him.

33
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:21,334
"I won't see him either

34
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:24,459
"or be forced to
every other week

35
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:25,626
"or weekend.

36
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,959
"I won't see him again.
That's all."

37
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,876
Counselor, you may speak.

38
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,459
So...

39
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,334
Mrs. Besson receives...

40
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:37,876
an unemployment check
of 981 euros a month.

41
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:43,292
She's married to Antoine Besson,
who's in charge of fire safety

42
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,251
at Lecorney hospital.

43
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:48,542
He makes 2,200 euros a month.

44
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:50,542
They have two children.

45
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:54,834
Josephine will be 18,
so custody doesn't concern her.

46
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,792
But we have to establish
a new life for Julien.

47
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,251
It's why we took his statement.

48
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,709
We don't agree
with the other side's request.

49
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:10,834
Mr. Besson wants joint custody
once he moves to the area,

50
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,584
now that he was transferred here.

51
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:16,376
But as we can clearly observe,

52
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,792
the children don't want
to see their father again.

53
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:21,751
It's true that...

54
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:25,709
Julien expresses this desire
a bit forcefully.

55
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,876
He rejects his father.

56
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:32,126
His statement indicates tension
between the spouses,

57
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:34,834
but also extreme insecurity.

58
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,417
His own.

59
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:39,959
The case shows
why these children feel unsafe.

60
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:43,292
I provided
Josephine's medical certificate,

61
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:46,334
which shows the violence
she was subjected to

62
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:47,626
by her father.

63
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:52,709
So we ask that the children
reside permanently with their mother.

64
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:56,084
Josephine is almost an adult.

65
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:59,167
She can visit her father
as she wishes.

66
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:02,334
But we also ask
the same thing for Julien.

67
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:04,501
Until things calm down

68
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:07,792
and until he wants
to see his father again.

69
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,042
All this increases stress.

70
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:14,042
My client withdrew her complaint
to be conciliatory.

71
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:17,626
He threatened her
to make her withdraw it.

72
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:21,876
He'd call, go to her parents' house,
sleep in his car.

73
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:23,751
Do you have proof?

74
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,167
Her parents testified that he came...

75
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,417
I mean proof of threats.

76
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:33,584
No witnesses of course.
No messages saved.

77
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:35,792
She changed numbers repeatedly.

78
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,501
So, to be conciliatory yet again,

79
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:42,167
my client is not asking for alimony.

80
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:46,001
However, she is living with her parents.

81
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:50,667
She left everything she owned
personally and jointly

82
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,376
in their former home.

83
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:56,126
She must start from scratch.
She has no savings.

84
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,334
Yes, she's at her parents',

85
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:03,667
but she pays rent, helps out
and bears the cost of the children.

86
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:07,792
She has immediate
and essential expenses

87
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,709
to find a place to live.

88
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:12,001
So she requests an advance

89
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:15,167
of 5,000 euros
on her share of common property.

90
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:20,834
We request that you obligate
her husband to pay this.

91
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:24,584
Otherwise, we agree

92
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:28,876
to child support
totaling 110 per month, per child.

93
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,709
That's all I have on behalf of...

94
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,834
both the children and their mother.

95
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,834
Your turn, Counselor.

96
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,167
Thank you, Your Honor.

97
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,959
Julien said certain things
against his father,

98
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:51,542
but much has been read
into his statement.

99
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:54,792
I don't understand
the point of this hearing.

100
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:58,001
Nothing here is black and white.

101
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:02,292
Education is the responsibility
of both parents.

102
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,459
I'm shocked by what I just heard.

103
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:09,667
Mr. Besson was transferred
and requests joint custody

104
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,834
only to be accused of harassment,

105
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:16,292
of threats,
of violence against his daughter,

106
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:19,626
with a note from a school nurse
as proof?

107
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,126
I find it stupefying

108
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:24,792
and extremely inappropriate.

109
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:28,501
In my file,
you'll find several affidavits.

110
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,334
My client's parents,
also victims of her whims,

111
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:36,459
deprived of their grandkids
since the separation.

112
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:39,501
His colleagues, who describe him

113
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:44,251
as an excellent team leader,
well-balanced, calm, even-tempered.

114
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:47,792
Affidavits from members
of his hunting club,

115
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:54,542
describing him as generous, obliging,
a nature lover who doesn't drink.

116
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,459
A normal man,

117
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:59,626
who bears no resemblance

118
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:03,542
to the violent, threatening boor
portrayed here.

119
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:07,042
If Mrs. Besson has proof of threats,

120
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,667
let her show them
and the police can investigate.

121
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:14,334
But "harassment" and "threats"
don't describe

122
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:17,584
a hurt father reaching out
to his kids.

123
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:20,959
And I'm measuring my words.

124
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:25,376
Mrs. Besson severed all ties
with my client overnight.

125
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:27,251
And since then,

126
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:30,917
she's refused to let him
talk to his children.

127
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,459
Her parents' number is now unlisted.

128
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:36,126
Yes, it's true.

129
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:39,584
Mr. Besson did indeed sleep in his car

130
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:43,167
in front of her parents' house.
It's true.

131
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:49,084
Hoping to see his children,
not for the fun of sleeping in a car.

132
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:52,501
I can assure you that Mr. Besson is...

133
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,667
astounded to hear what Julien thinks.

134
00:09:55,834 --> 00:10:00,084
His son's words don't reflect
their time together.

135
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:04,792
Given the context,
we can suspect they're someone else's.

136
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,667
This is what Mr. Besson says now:

137
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:09,917
"My daughter is an adult.

138
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:13,667
"She'll make up her mind
about seeing me.

139
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,876
"But I won't abandon my son.

140
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,209
"I love him. He loves me.
And he needs me.

141
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,084
"I'm leaving my job,
colleagues, friends.

142
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:25,126
"I'm selling my house to be near my son,

143
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,917
"to keep enjoying time together."

144
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:33,542
Mrs. Besson can't take that away.
It's a child's basic right.

145
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,709
She claims he wasn't a good husband

146
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:40,001
but it doesn't mean he's a bad father.

147
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:44,251
The law doesn't allow us
to break the father-son bond.

148
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:47,376
So we still request the same thing.

149
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:50,084
A standard visitation schedule.

150
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:54,084
Every other weekend,
from noon Saturday to Sunday at 6 pm.

151
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:57,209
And when my client lives in the area,

152
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:59,917
joint physical custody:

153
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:03,084
every other week and shared vacations.

154
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:05,709
So we need her future address.

155
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,459
Unless she leaves on a whim again.

156
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:13,834
This is all to make
Julien's new life easier.

157
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:17,834
Otherwise, we agree to their request
for child support.

158
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,834
But we ask that you rule, Your Honor,

159
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,792
on paragraph 7 of article 255:

160
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:27,126
"A spouse may receive an advance

161
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:31,417
on the liquidation of marriage property
if necessary."

162
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:35,084
I'd like to know
if it's necessary or not.

163
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:39,334
One spouse worked full-time
and is now unemployed,

164
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:43,626
but it was her choice
to leave and come here.

165
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:47,459
Each time my client asked
to see his children,

166
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:50,417
he was told
they left for the weekend.

167
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:54,167
She claims she's broke,
just 900 a month,

168
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:58,251
yet takes weekend trips
and plans a big birthday party.

169
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:02,292
The situation
doesn't justify this advance.

170
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,834
- Did you provide a balance sheet?
- Yes, Your Honor.

171
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:07,126
All right.

172
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:26,626
Let's begin
with Josephine's medical certificate.

173
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,626
What happened?

174
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:31,584
She was in 9th grade.

175
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,292
He kept an eye on her,
wouldn't let her date.

176
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,751
He saw her kissing Samuel
at the Conservatory.

177
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:42,376
She plays piano since she's 6.
Samuel is her boyfriend.

178
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:46,542
That day she skipped school
to go see him.

179
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,834
He caught them by surprise.

180
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:53,709
He waited till she got home that night
and he hit her.

181
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:58,459
I was at work and he called,
threatening to break her hands...

182
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,917
if I didn't go straight home.
And so...

183
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:05,084
she was in pain, and...

184
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,876
The next day she saw the nurse

185
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:11,001
to tell her about the problems at home.

186
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,209
All right.

187
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:14,917
Sir?

188
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:18,876
She sprained her wrist at the gym.
What can I say?

189
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:22,084
Which of you is the bigger liar?

190
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:29,167
Look at the certificate, Your Honor.
3 years later.

191
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:31,584
"I, Stephanie Bossel,

192
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:36,126
"examined Josephine Besson
on October 12, 2013.

193
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:40,542
"She had pain in the left wrist,
resulting in limited movement.

194
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,709
"Pressure on the scaphoid
and 5th metacarpal

195
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:47,376
"caused pain and a bruise
on the inside of the wrist.

196
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,251
"She mentioned problems
with her father.

197
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:53,501
"After discussion,
she decided not to use this note,

198
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,709
"written at her request
and sent by mail."

199
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:59,376
Mrs. Besson's former boss
also testified

200
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:02,792
that he often spied on her
at her workplace.

201
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:05,792
- Unbelievable!
- Please.

202
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,209
Your children have turned against you.
Can you explain?

203
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,167
No.

204
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:21,042
I'd like to understand.

205
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,584
I don't know what they're told.

206
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:49,334
We can see
Julien is not ready to see his father.

207
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,042
It's too stressful.

208
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:53,709
- You make things worse.
- Stop, Counselor.

209
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,626
You're the only person
losing your temper.

210
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,209
Mr. Besson bought Julien a phone

211
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:07,709
and yet he still has no contact.

212
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:09,126
Julien won't answer.

213
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:12,709
He tells Julien to put me on.
Julien stopped answering.

214
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,292
We just want peace.

215
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,334
I just want news of my kids.

216
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,876
Who just wants peace?

217
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:23,876
Excuse me?

218
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,251
"We just want peace."
Who's "we"?

219
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:29,542
Julien...

220
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,251
me, my daughter too.
Ask her, you'll see.

221
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:34,834
"Ask your daughter".

222
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,917
Your children seem to be on your side.
That's unfortunate.

223
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:43,042
Julien asked to give a statement

224
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,751
when he learned
his father was moving here.

225
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:48,584
I just want everything to go well.

226
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,626
I think of my kids' well-being.

227
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,501
May I speak?

228
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,084
Sir?

229
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,917
I think of his well-being too.

230
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,792
He needs supervision.
Taking away his father won't help.

231
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:21,251
Your lawyers will receive my decision
on May 29th.

232
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:23,001
Goodbye.

233
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:31,959
Thank you.

234
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:41,376
Hearings like this are always grueling.

235
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,209
I'll call you once I have her decision.

236
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:47,626
I'm confident.
She understands how the children feel...

237
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:53,542
Antoine!

238
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:55,334
- So?
- What a jerk.

239
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:57,542
I'll be contacting you.
Goodbye.

240
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,792
It went well.

241
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:01,167
Miriam!

242
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:05,084
For the kids.

243
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,334
It's up to the judge now.

244
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,209
- When will we know?
- A week.

245
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,584
- Go on. She'll kill you.
- I don't care.

246
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:52,167
<i>- I'm at the Conservatory.</i>
- I'm coming, Mom.

247
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:56,126
We got out early so I saw Samuel off.

248
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,834
<i>Stop lying.
Your teacher said you never came.</i>

249
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:04,334
<i>Fifth time in 2 months.
Each time Samuel comes.</i>

250
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,709
<i>Why do I pay for your classes?</i>

251
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:10,209
- I've had enough.
<i>- I don't trust you anymore.</i>

252
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:13,167
<i>We'll have a serious discussion,
believe me.</i>

253
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,501
It's over here.

254
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:43,792
Come in...

255
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,876
So, there are three bedrooms.

256
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:50,584
About 840 square feet.

257
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:54,751
This is the foyer.
A separate toilet there.

258
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:59,167
In the foyer, the intercom,
an electricity meter.

259
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:00,959
Separate toilet.

260
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:05,001
Wardrobe, closet... and the living room.

261
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,792
This is my room.
I'll have a double bed.

262
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,417
You sleep together?

263
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,376
What the hell do you care?

264
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,626
Is it him?

265
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:53,334
So?

266
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,792
- This is my room.
- Dream on!

267
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,626
Samuel can't come over,
so why a big bed?

268
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,126
Just like that man.

269
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,042
Don't start up.

270
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:04,792
Auntie?

271
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:08,084
- Who's he?
- Cyril, a colleague at City Hall.

272
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,292
He found this apartment for you.

273
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,209
- What is it?
- I won't make it.

274
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:20,001
You'll see him soon.
At your birthday.

275
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,376
- She's so unfair.
- You need to concentrate.

276
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,751
I promised I'd stop skipping class.

277
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:27,209
Come on.

278
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:28,917
I don't see myself here.

279
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:32,959
Come on, you'll fix up your room.
It'll be fine.

280
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:34,126
Come.

281
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:36,167
You can go have a look.

282
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:40,334
You're only 10 minutes from downtown.

283
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:43,084
There's a bus station below...

284
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:44,251
Excuse me.

285
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:47,084
- It's available?
- First of the month.

286
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:48,292
Hello, Counselor.

287
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,292
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

288
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,084
Yes, Counselor?

289
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,626
Really?

290
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,876
Why?

291
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:37,126
<i>Miriam?</i>

292
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:41,959
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- He doesn't feel well. He can't come.

293
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:44,542
<i>Come out to talk.</i>

294
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,834
- He has a stomach ache.
<i>- I'll take him to the doctor.</i>

295
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:50,542
- But...
<i>- Come give me the address.</i>

296
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:53,042
I don't want trouble.

297
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:55,709
<i>No trouble.
The judge ruled, period.</i>

298
00:21:57,626 --> 00:21:59,584
Antoine, he's really sick.

299
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,626
<i>Come out and we'll talk.</i>

300
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:05,126
No, I won't come out.

301
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:10,001
<i>I have him this weekend.
If he doesn't come...</i>

302
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,042
<i>I'll file a complaint.</i>

303
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,917
<i>Am I being clear?</i>

304
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:22,667
What did he say?

305
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:48,126
Bye-bye, Juju.

306
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:22,834
Hello, sweetie.

307
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,542
Hello.

308
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,751
So I hear you're sick?

309
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:56,376
Your mom said you were sick.

310
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,376
Do you have any medicine?

311
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:08,917
Talk to me.

312
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,376
Put on your seatbelt.

313
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,209
- You're a growing boy!
- You barely ate.

314
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:54,167
We're going hunting early.

315
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:58,001
No, next time.
He's not feeling well.

316
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,792
Then there's no use insisting.

317
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,334
Bring us our coffee.

318
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:06,292
Blandine asked about her wedding again.

319
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:08,292
- When is it?
- Next Saturday.

320
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:11,709
I don't have Juju.
I can't drive another 600 miles.

321
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,667
Answer her.
So she can plan.

322
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:17,959
We can switch weekends.

323
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,459
You see?

324
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:22,292
She'd love to see you two.

325
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:25,126
I made a surprise for you.

326
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:28,584
Dad?

327
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:30,626
Let's switch weekends.

328
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:37,376
I'd like to go to Josephine's party
the weekend after.

329
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:42,876
You want to?

330
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:32,459
We have an hour.

331
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,667
Because I picked you up an hour late.

332
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,209
Who calls me "that man"?

333
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,417
Me.

334
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,667
Does your mother say it too?

335
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,376
No, just me.

336
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,792
And your sister?

337
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,376
Want to go to her party?

338
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:59,251
Why is your mother using you to ask me?

339
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:01,042
She can't ask me?

340
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:06,167
With a normal mom,
we can discuss things, don't you think?

341
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:10,459
She should ask.
Why doesn't she?

342
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:16,334
She has no cell phone.

343
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,667
Give me your notebook.

344
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,251
Give it to me.

345
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,126
Her number doesn't work.

346
00:29:40,251 --> 00:29:42,084
Give me your notebook.

347
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:49,709
Julien, your notebook.

348
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,834
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's that man.

349
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:31,501
<i>- Is Julien with you?</i>
- Yeah, he's here.

350
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:35,792
He asked to switch weekends
so he can go to the party

351
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,501
in two weeks.

352
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:40,376
<i>- Where did you get my number?</i>
- Answer me.

353
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:43,959
<i>It would be nice if he could go.</i>

354
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:47,459
Don't you think
you should ask me yourself?

355
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,292
<i>- Listen...</i>
- It's not that hard.

356
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:53,876
<i>Can we switch weekends
so he can go?</i>

357
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,251
Please.

358
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:57,584
<i>Please.</i>

359
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:01,417
I'm on my way. We'll discuss it.

360
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,251
Hey, Juju. How are you?

361
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,084
- He won't switch weekends.
- He said so?

362
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:09,167
- Because of his job.
- Fuck!

363
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:10,167
Asshole!

364
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:11,417
Why is he still there?

365
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:13,876
- Relax!
- Must I go outside?

366
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,001
I forgot my bag. I'll go get it.

367
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:32,334
She's not home.

368
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:48,584
<i>You've reached 06 14 87...</i>

369
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:55,542
Didn't I say she's not normal?

370
00:32:56,584 --> 00:32:59,334
- She's not home.
- Where is she?

371
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:02,251
Can I get my bag?
I forgot it.

372
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,542
You won't go to the party thanks to her.

373
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:09,001
You'll be with me.

374
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:41,709
<i>Tell me once you've done it.</i>

375
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:47,126
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

376
00:34:24,126 --> 00:34:25,834
<i>Erase contact "Mom"?</i>

377
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:16,667
Hey sweetie, how are you?

378
00:37:20,126 --> 00:37:22,167
Can you get your mother, please?

379
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:24,334
Julien?

380
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:38,834
I'll let you go to the party tonight.

381
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:43,209
She needs to tell me
when to drop you off.

382
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:46,042
She's not home.

383
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,501
Yes, she is.

384
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,626
She's not home!

385
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,126
Then where is she?

386
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:13,042
Where is she?

387
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:17,917
Where is she?

388
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:20,626
Up your ass!

389
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,501
- Can you help?
- I'm going to drop my bags.

390
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,959
Hello, my boy.

391
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:10,626
- How long are you leaving this?
- Until I get the keys.

392
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:14,417
Your mother made you rabbit.

393
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:23,751
So where is your apartment?

394
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:28,584
10 minutes from the new hospital.
It's nice.

395
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:31,001
A balcony, a room for Julien.

396
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,334
When does the hospital open?

397
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,376
I already told you. September.
And I'll start then.

398
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,501
Will you still come visit?

399
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:58,626
The Dutrieuxs say hi.
We saw them at the wedding.

400
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:01,876
Are they doing okay?

401
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:06,126
We saw Laetitia too. My God...

402
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:11,126
She won't find a guy like that.

403
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:14,709
Last time we saw her
was two years ago.

404
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,542
Regis' birthday party.

405
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,251
God knows how much she weighs.

406
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:23,084
She let herself go.

407
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:26,167
She doesn't have an easy life.

408
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:28,584
She lives all alone.

409
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:32,001
- No excuse.
- Works nights.

410
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:35,626
When she gets home,
it must be... 7am.

411
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:39,917
She said she saw you.

412
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:43,042
On her way home, with Josephine.

413
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:45,959
- Where does she live?
- The projects.

414
00:40:46,459 --> 00:40:47,917
Why were you there?

415
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,501
Remember Laetitia?

416
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:53,251
It wasn't us.

417
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:55,667
You got in a bus.

418
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:57,334
Why were you there?

419
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:02,042
- What were you doing?
- No big deal.

420
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,917
Why where you there?

421
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:07,459
To see Josephine's friend.

422
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:10,667
But you got in a bus.

423
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:13,792
We were leaving her place.

424
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,251
To go where?

425
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:18,334
- Stop, Antoine.
- To go where?

426
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:19,626
School.

427
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:21,834
- Stop, Antoine.
- Shut up.

428
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:24,751
You saw her friend before school?

429
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,001
Answer me!

430
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:28,751
Stop it!

431
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,459
You always have to fuck things up!

432
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:36,501
Stupid idiot! You spoil everything!

433
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:40,417
It could have been nice.
You make it impossible!

434
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:43,251
Why must this happen each time?

435
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:47,834
It's no surprise
that your kids won't see you!

436
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:49,709
What'll you do now?

437
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:56,751
- What are you doing?
- Get your stuff.

438
00:41:58,376 --> 00:42:01,584
Don't you ever set foot here again!

439
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,042
Julien!

440
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:54,376
Are you happy now?

441
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:05,334
Do you think I'm a fool?

442
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:15,126
You live in the projects?

443
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:17,459
No.

444
00:43:28,126 --> 00:43:30,501
You're as big a liar as your mom.

445
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:34,417
You're no dumber than before, are you?

446
00:43:36,376 --> 00:43:38,251
Look at me when I talk.

447
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,501
Is it her boyfriend's place?

448
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:50,667
She's holding a bomb
that'll blow up in her face.

449
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:55,834
She's not allowed to do any of this!

450
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,417
Understand?

451
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:02,751
She'll pay for it big-time
if she keeps playing me for a fool!

452
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:06,292
I'm your father!
I need to know where you live!

453
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:10,834
Look at me when I talk!
Look at me!

454
00:44:15,709 --> 00:44:17,084
Where is it?

455
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:22,167
Straight ahead.

456
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:44,292
And now?

457
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:46,126
Straight.

458
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:54,667
Left.

459
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,751
What floor are you on?

460
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:05,417
Second.

461
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,126
Right.

462
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:18,251
Left.

463
00:45:25,584 --> 00:45:26,917
Right.

464
00:45:34,376 --> 00:45:36,042
It's her boyfriend's place?

465
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,001
She has no boyfriend.

466
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:52,334
Over there.

467
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,209
That one? There?

468
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:00,251
This one?

469
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:07,209
Give me your keys.

470
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:11,459
Give me your keys.

471
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:33,292
Come with me.

472
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:36,251
Leave your bags. Come.

473
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:55,917
<i>Entrance refused.</i>

474
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:57,167
Wait!

475
00:46:58,459 --> 00:46:59,459
Stop!

476
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:06,417
Stop!

477
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:38,001
Come on.

478
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:41,834
I'm driving you back.

479
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:47,667
Sweetie, I don't want trouble
every weekend.

480
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:51,001
Get in!

481
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:55,167
Come on, get in.

482
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:57,626
Where are we going?

483
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:01,251
Didn't you want to go
to your sister's party?

484
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:40,501
Can I have my keys?

485
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:21,667
Can I have my keys?

486
00:50:54,209 --> 00:50:56,042
I just called Laetitia.

487
00:50:58,042 --> 00:51:00,292
She said she saw you here.

488
00:51:01,751 --> 00:51:03,751
I don't want you to hit Mom.

489
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:14,126
I'll find it by myself.

490
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:31,501
What floor are you on?

491
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,084
Eighth.

492
00:51:40,626 --> 00:51:41,959
Hello, ma'am.

493
00:52:35,792 --> 00:52:37,459
I'm not interrupting?

494
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,251
What do you want?

495
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:32,209
To see where my kids live.

496
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:40,792
I have to go now.

497
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:22,876
- Where's my daughter?
- At the reception hall.

498
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:41,042
I've changed.

499
00:56:08,792 --> 00:56:10,376
I've changed.

500
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:01,709
I have to go.

501
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:32,584
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

502
00:57:34,126 --> 00:57:35,417
No problem.

503
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,209
What time should I come?

504
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:54,917
We're sleeping at my parents'.

505
00:57:57,334 --> 00:57:58,709
11 o'clock?

506
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:00,626
All right.

507
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:29,292
Don't say he came.

508
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:31,751
Say I bumped into you in town.

509
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:57,292
- What's that?
- You don't make the law here.

510
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:13,376
Where's Julien?

511
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:21,376
At his mom's.
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

512
00:59:23,251 --> 00:59:24,751
Staying for dinner?

513
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,959
It seems I'm not welcome.

514
00:59:41,459 --> 00:59:42,542
Do as you please.

515
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:17,959
What did you and Josephine decide?

516
01:00:19,376 --> 01:00:21,917
A song before or after the cake?

517
01:00:22,084 --> 01:00:23,251
After.

518
01:00:23,709 --> 01:00:25,292
Can we serve it now?

519
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:27,292
She wants to wait for Manon.

520
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,042
Where's Manon?

521
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:33,501
She'll call
when she gets off the highway.

522
01:00:35,626 --> 01:00:38,167
You can't drive 300 miles tonight.

523
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:40,209
It's fine. I can drive.

524
01:00:40,376 --> 01:00:42,417
You can stay at Nana's.

525
01:00:42,584 --> 01:00:45,584
Don't worry. It's kind of you.

526
01:00:45,751 --> 01:00:48,042
I prefer to drive. I planned on it.

527
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:55,126
You two can see each other,

528
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:57,209
but she can't skip classes.

529
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:59,792
She has to graduate.

530
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,626
You understand?

531
01:01:02,251 --> 01:01:03,709
Yes, of course.

532
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,251
So we'll wait for Manon.

533
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:27,667
What are you doing, Miriam?

534
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:29,376
Have you seen Julien?

535
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:31,292
He must be inside.

536
01:05:45,084 --> 01:05:47,709
Come on,
Josephine is going to sing!

537
01:07:39,376 --> 01:07:41,876
Why are you here?
My dad mustn't see you.

538
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:44,126
I have a gift for Josephine.

539
01:07:44,876 --> 01:07:46,667
I'll give it to her.

540
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,751
I left it in my car.

541
01:07:49,751 --> 01:07:52,792
Give it to her tomorrow
when you get Julien?

542
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:56,501
Isn't it humiliating enough
for me to be here?

543
01:09:10,751 --> 01:09:12,251
What am I?

544
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:17,584
What's that stare?

545
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:21,584
What am I to you?

546
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:24,084
I can't reach you.

547
01:09:24,251 --> 01:09:27,292
You change numbers.
You run away from me.

548
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:29,792
Who am I for you?

549
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:32,667
I won't talk about the same old stuff...

550
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:35,376
You will, because we had two kids!

551
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:39,167
When you vanish, you hurt me.
You know it.

552
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:42,042
You need help.

553
01:09:42,251 --> 01:09:45,334
The nerve of you!
You're the one who needs help!

554
01:09:47,459 --> 01:09:48,459
Coming!

555
01:09:48,626 --> 01:09:49,792
Who's he?

556
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:52,792
My sister's friend.
I'm coming.

557
01:09:53,209 --> 01:09:55,292
Why is he at my daughter's party?

558
01:09:55,459 --> 01:09:57,209
I'll deal with the cake.

559
01:09:58,417 --> 01:10:00,542
Cyril... Nice to meet you.

560
01:10:01,542 --> 01:10:03,376
I'm talking to my wife.

561
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:08,959
- Have a nice evening.
- I'm coming.

562
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:49,709
Give me Josephine's present.

563
01:10:52,376 --> 01:10:54,126
You're such a tease.

564
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,084
Let go of me!

565
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:57,251
Who is he?

566
01:10:57,626 --> 01:10:59,209
- Who is he?
- Stop it.

567
01:10:59,376 --> 01:11:01,251
Have you fucked him?

568
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:02,834
- Stop.
- Tell me.

569
01:11:03,001 --> 01:11:04,001
Let go of her!

570
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:07,959
We're just talking.

571
01:11:09,126 --> 01:11:11,126
Leave her alone! Fuck off!

572
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:12,792
I'm very calm.

573
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:14,542
Beat it, prick.

574
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:17,292
Touch her again and I'll kill you!

575
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,167
- Kiss the kids for me.
- Fuck off!

576
01:11:22,334 --> 01:11:23,876
I'm not talking to you.

577
01:11:24,042 --> 01:11:26,626
Fuck off
or I'll call the cops, asshole!

578
01:11:38,667 --> 01:11:40,084
What a loser.

579
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:50,292
- The prick left. He hit you.
- I'm fine.

580
01:11:50,459 --> 01:11:52,084
- File a complaint.
- What for?

581
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:55,042
I'll come with you.
This has to end.

582
01:11:55,209 --> 01:11:56,626
Come on...

583
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:03,292
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

584
01:12:12,584 --> 01:12:15,042
Maybe I shouldn't come over tonight.

585
01:12:16,792 --> 01:12:19,667
Hi, ma'am.
What a pain to find this place.

586
01:12:20,209 --> 01:12:22,709
- Hey, Manon. Hungry?
- Starving.

587
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:24,792
There's plenty to eat.

588
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,667
It's up to you.

589
01:13:11,459 --> 01:13:12,501
My granddaughter!

590
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:19,876
What is it now?

591
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:21,876
I just don't want to.

592
01:13:22,959 --> 01:13:25,001
Let's say goodbye to your sister.

593
01:13:27,959 --> 01:13:29,292
See you tomorrow.

594
01:13:31,834 --> 01:13:34,042
- Can I drop you off?
- Cyril will.

595
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,917
Julien's staying with you?
Pick you up at 10.

596
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:38,251
You'll be okay?

597
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:39,667
Goodnight.

598
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:45,376
- He's not coming to Nana's?
- Not anymore.

599
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:48,001
Go to sleep. I'll clean up tomorrow.

600
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:51,959
I'll just straighten up the equipment,
the cables...

601
01:13:52,126 --> 01:13:54,917
- Don't keep Papy up.
- We have a key.

602
01:13:55,084 --> 01:13:56,876
Sleep well, kids.

603
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:58,501
Goodnight, Mom.

604
01:13:59,042 --> 01:14:00,084
Goodnight.

605
01:14:00,959 --> 01:14:02,167
See you tomorrow.

606
01:16:20,334 --> 01:16:22,584
- Is it him?
- What do you think?

607
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:07,959
- Go to sleep.
- Can I sleep with you?

608
01:17:08,126 --> 01:17:09,292
Come.

609
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:54,126
When he gets fed up, he'll leave.

610
01:18:39,751 --> 01:18:41,334
Did he leave?

611
01:18:43,209 --> 01:18:44,584
I think so.

612
01:20:28,542 --> 01:20:29,626
Mom...

613
01:21:12,709 --> 01:21:14,709
Our conversation isn't over.

614
01:21:26,792 --> 01:21:28,126
Open up!

615
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:34,501
Open!

616
01:21:35,876 --> 01:21:37,251
Open the door!

617
01:21:39,876 --> 01:21:44,084
B-O-U-H-A-D-D-I.

618
01:21:44,251 --> 01:21:46,626
- Bouhaddi.
<i>- We're on the way.</i>

619
01:21:50,042 --> 01:21:52,917
TN-821 for 71...

620
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:57,126
<i>Yes?</i>

621
01:21:57,251 --> 01:21:59,876
Saint-Dumont, 9 rue Winston Churchill.

622
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:02,209
I repeat: Saint-Dumont,

623
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,251
9 rue Winston Churchill.

624
01:22:04,542 --> 01:22:07,084
Someone is forcing open a door.

625
01:22:07,251 --> 01:22:10,292
The neighbor says he has a large weapon,

626
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:12,126
like a hunting rifle.

627
01:22:12,292 --> 01:22:16,084
It's taking place on the 8th floor.

628
01:22:16,834 --> 01:22:19,626
Use the intercom to enter the building.

629
01:22:19,792 --> 01:22:22,251
The name is "Bouhaddi".

630
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:25,209
Bravo-Oscar-Uniform...

631
01:22:25,376 --> 01:22:26,459
Dad, stop!

632
01:22:26,626 --> 01:22:29,209
Antoine, please stop!

633
01:22:29,959 --> 01:22:31,917
- Open up!
- Antoine, stop!

634
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:41,042
Mommy, I can't hear anything!

635
01:22:48,501 --> 01:22:50,542
I can't hear anything, Mommy!

636
01:22:55,334 --> 01:22:57,626
<i>- What's the emergency?</i>
- He fired!

637
01:22:57,792 --> 01:22:59,334
What's the address?

638
01:23:00,292 --> 01:23:01,792
<i>He'll kill us!</i>

639
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:03,542
Where are you?

640
01:23:04,251 --> 01:23:05,626
<i>He shot at the door!</i>

641
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:08,251
I need your address. What address?

642
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:10,917
- Antoine, stop!
- Open up!

643
01:23:12,167 --> 01:23:13,459
<i>I need your address.</i>

644
01:23:13,626 --> 01:23:16,251
9 rue Winston Churchill.

645
01:23:16,417 --> 01:23:17,667
<i>A car is coming.</i>

646
01:23:17,834 --> 01:23:19,667
Do you know who fired?

647
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:21,001
My husband.

648
01:23:21,584 --> 01:23:24,001
<i>- You're not alone?</i>
- With my son.

649
01:23:31,584 --> 01:23:32,584
Antoine, stop!

650
01:23:34,959 --> 01:23:35,959
Keep calm.

651
01:23:36,001 --> 01:23:38,084
Do you have a room that locks?

652
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:39,501
<i>Yes.</i>

653
01:23:39,626 --> 01:23:41,709
Go lock yourselves inside.

654
01:23:41,876 --> 01:23:43,084
Open up!

655
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:47,501
<i>Help is on the way.</i>

656
01:23:55,709 --> 01:23:56,959
<i>Where are you?</i>

657
01:23:57,126 --> 01:23:58,542
In the bathroom.

658
01:23:58,709 --> 01:24:00,209
Did you lock the door?

659
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:04,334
Can you block the door?

660
01:24:26,751 --> 01:24:27,751
He's inside.

661
01:24:27,917 --> 01:24:29,751
Listen to me, ma'am.

662
01:24:29,917 --> 01:24:31,667
Do you have a bathtub?

663
01:24:32,626 --> 01:24:34,584
Lie down in it with your son.

664
01:24:34,751 --> 01:24:35,792
Take cover.

665
01:24:35,959 --> 01:24:38,334
Get inside. Hurry up...

666
01:24:39,959 --> 01:24:41,417
Get down.

667
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:43,501
More, more.

668
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:48,667
<i>Stay on the phone.</i>

669
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,751
<i>You're not alone. I'm with you.</i>

670
01:24:59,167 --> 01:25:01,126
I'm with you. Don't worry.

671
01:25:01,292 --> 01:25:02,334
A car is coming.

672
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:05,334
<i>Just a few seconds. It's almost over.</i>

673
01:25:18,751 --> 01:25:21,459
<i>Stay in the tub. Don't come out.</i>

674
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:51,084
Open up.

675
01:26:02,167 --> 01:26:03,959
Police! Drop your weapon!

676
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:10,667
<i>Stay put. The police are there.</i>

677
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:14,376
<i>You're in a safe place.
Don't move, okay?</i>

678
01:26:15,209 --> 01:26:17,667
You're under arrest. Calm down!

679
01:26:17,834 --> 01:26:18,876
Don't move!

680
01:26:19,626 --> 01:26:20,876
<i>It's over, ma'am.</i>

681
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:25,959
<i>Stay on the phone with me.</i>

682
01:26:28,834 --> 01:26:30,959
She's my wife!

683
01:26:31,251 --> 01:26:33,334
Don't let them do this to me!

684
01:26:36,959 --> 01:26:38,792
Get him out of here!

685
01:26:53,376 --> 01:26:54,917
It's over, ma'am.

686
01:26:57,542 --> 01:26:58,542
<i>Hear me?</i>

687
01:27:00,084 --> 01:27:01,417
It's over.

688
01:27:04,334 --> 01:27:05,709
It's over.

689
01:27:07,042 --> 01:27:10,167
<i>I'll hang up.
The officer will take care of you.</i>

690
01:27:10,834 --> 01:27:11,834
<i>All right?</i>

691
01:27:40,292 --> 01:27:42,084
Ma'am, can you hear me?

692
01:27:46,584 --> 01:27:48,584
Ma'am, can you hear me?

693
01:27:56,959 --> 01:27:58,876
Can you please open the door?

694
01:28:10,501 --> 01:28:12,584
It's over. You can come out.

695
01:28:40,001 --> 01:28:42,334
Are you okay? Are you wounded?

696
01:28:42,501 --> 01:28:44,751
Call an ambulance. Come...

697
01:29:20,001 --> 01:29:23,376
We've secured the premises.
Two victims.

698
01:29:23,709 --> 01:29:25,167
One is wounded.

699
01:29:25,334 --> 01:29:27,709
Send us an ambulance. Thanks.

700
01:29:28,292 --> 01:29:29,876
<i>Copy that.</i>
