1
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,333
Hey!

2
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,750
What happened to him?

3
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,875
Where did you get that?
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,625
I just want to go home.

5
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,875
Maybe he's a returned POW.

6
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,458
Looks like you've been roughed up.

7
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,416
I guess you could use something to eat.

8
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,833
I'm fine, thanks.

9
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,416
Nonsense.
Erna has a soft spot for fellas like you.

10
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,833
Come along.

11
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,375
Agnes, go and let Erna know.

12
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,291
Run.

13
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,291
Where were you stationed?

14
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,041
Eastern front.

15
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,458
-Labor camp.
-Those people aren't human.

16
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,750
We should have won the war.

17
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,541
Do you have a place to sleep?

18
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,458
Tell your brother
to get the chamber ready.

19
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,625
But just for a few days.

20
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,958
Until you're back on your feet.

21
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,708
I know this sounds strange.

22
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,958
But what year is it?

23
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,833
They did quite a job on you, didn't they?

24
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,125
1921.

25
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,208
1921...

26
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,333
JUNE 24, 2020

27
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,833
THREE DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

28
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,458
I think we're a perfect match.

29
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,541
Never believe anything else.

30
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:10,916
Yes?

31
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,708
Mrs. Doppler called in. She's sick.

32
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,625
What's wrong with her?

33
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,125
She didn't say.

34
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,083
Hold on.

35
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,166
-You're Mr. Wöller, right?
-Yes.

36
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,500
Then the pleasure is ours today.

37
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,000
-You do have a car, right?
-Mm-hmm.

38
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,458
Wonderful.

39
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,625
CALL FROM
HANNAH KAHNWALD

40
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,041
Where did you get this?

41
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,291
-Who is this?
-It's complicated.

42
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,708
Mom, why do you have that?

43
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,625
Should I make us breakfast?

44
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,250
What are we going to do with Mom?

45
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,791
I don't know.

46
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,583
What do you want?

47
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,875
-Martha.
-Franziska.

48
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,041
-What do you want?
-We have to talk.

49
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,708
-What?
-If you expect an apology, forget it!

50
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,000
You fucked up.

51
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,375
But I shouldn't have said what I said.
We're even.

52
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,416
Am I supposed to babysit
while you make out?

53
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,333
Why did you bring her along?

54
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,041
My parents haven't been home in two days.

55
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,208
I can't leave her alone.

56
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,333
Why is everyone acting so weird?

57
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,583
-I want to know what's up.
-What? You want to go into the caves?

58
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,083
You can stay here.

59
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,458
You slept nearly 24 hours.

60
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,125
Who are you?

61
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,333
People say Erna can't say no
to any stray dogs.

62
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,875
I'm in the wrong place.

63
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,958
This isn't right.

64
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,416
I pictured you differently.

65
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,708
Why did you just say that?

66
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,250
What does it mean?

67
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,833
Sic mundus creatus est.

68
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,666
Can I help you?

69
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,916
I'm looking for someone.

70
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,833
She used to work here.
It was a while back.

71
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,458
Tiedemann. Claudia Tiedemann.

72
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,750
She used to run the plant.

73
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,166
-Where can I find her?
-There's only one Tiedemann here.

74
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,458
Aleksander Tiedemann.
He runs the plant.

75
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,500
Aleksander Tiedemann?

76
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,750
So that's why you didn't want to let
Ulrich Nielsen onto the grounds?

77
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,833
After Fukushima
safety standards were raised.

78
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,625
I can't just let anyone stroll in here.

79
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,666
His suspicion that his son might be
on the grounds was totally unfounded.

80
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,875
You know about the door in the cave?

81
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,791
It was installed in the 1980s.

82
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,458
It was already welded shut back then,
as a security measure.

83
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,875
-It's still sealed shut.
-You know what I find strange?

84
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,500
Everyone who was born here stays.

85
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,458
Seems odd, in a town of this size.

86
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,125
What do you think?

87
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,625
Why is that?

88
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:40,625
The nuclear power plant always took care 
of people. There's work.

89
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,291
Prosperity, security.

90
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,458
That'll probably change now.

91
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,541
When the plant closes.

92
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,500
-You're not from here.
-No.

93
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,291
Why?

94
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,000
You came to Winden in 1986.

95
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,458
At the same time the boy disappeared.

96
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:11,791
Mads Nielsen.

97
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,791
Ulrich Nielsen's brother.

98
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,208
No. It was a bit later.

99
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,416
A few weeks.

100
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,541
Why does that matter?

101
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,791
It probably doesn't.

102
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,791
Just one more question.

103
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,958
Why did you take your wife's name?

104
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,208
I don't understand.

105
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,708
Pretty unusual for the time.

106
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,500
The Tiedemanns shaped this town.
Especially Regina's mother.

107
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,041
Regina has no siblings.
We wanted to keep the name alive.

108
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,875
What's your real name?

109
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,541
Köhler. Aleksander Köhler.

110
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,250
Who's next on the list?

111
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,083
Mr. Wöller?

112
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,916
Hannah Kahnwald.

113
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,541
Why do you have a gun
and someone else's passport?

114
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,333
It's insurance.

115
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,750
What do you mean?

116
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,666
Someone needs
to keep both things hidden.

117
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,291
You're blackmailing someone?

118
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,125
Who are you?

119
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,791
Who I am?

120
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,875
Who are you?

121
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,708
Hannah?

122
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,416
I'm sorry.

123
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,125
But we have to tell someone.

124
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,791
Thanks for getting here so soon.
I know none of this makes sense, but...

125
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,708
This is Jonas. He...

126
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,166
He's much older,
and he knows where my Jonas is,

127
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,541
and where Ulrich is.

128
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,166
You're the man from the hotel
Regina talked about.

129
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,916
Who are these people?

130
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,250
This man here. The priest.

131
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,875
Do you know who he is?

132
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,708
That's Noah.

133
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,708
You know him?

134
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,791
What do you know about him?

135
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,000
-He's one of them.
-What is all this?

136
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,333
One of whom?

137
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,208
Sic Mundus.

138
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,416
The travelers.

139
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,666
The travelers?

140
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,958
Sic mundus creatus est?

141
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,166
What are you talking about?
You knew all of this?

142
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,750
The time travel?

143
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,000
There's something you should both see.

144
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,666
Okay.

145
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,416
You want to go in there?

146
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,791
After four kids disappeared here?

147
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,708
You stay with me.
Do what I tell you. Okay?

148
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:31,708
WINDEN MUNICIPAL LIBRARY

149
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,416
Excuse me.

150
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,125
I am interested in...

151
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,625
the town's history.

152
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:54,791
Where can I find articles and publications
from the past 30 years?

153
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,541
It's all been digitized.

154
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,250
And where do I find that?

155
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,083
Excuse me.

156
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,125
Where's the keyboard?

157
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,583
There isn't one.

158
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,666
SEARCH

159
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,166
CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN

160

CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN FIRST WOMAN
TO HEAD A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

161
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,625
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BOSS
DISAPPEARS WITHOUT A TRACE

162
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,541
You informed her about the meeting?

163
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,000
Yes.

164
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,041
APPOINTMENTS

165
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,833
Anything about Hannah Kahnwald?

166
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,166
Her husband killed himself last year.

167
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,875
He hanged himself.

168
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:17,708
Actually, no one here understood
why she married him. She's very pretty.

169
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,500
She could've had any man she wanted.

170
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,416
It was rumored she had an affair
with Ulrich Nielsen.

171
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,875
Did Mrs. Nielsen know about it?

172
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,166
May I ask you something?

173
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,000
Go ahead.

174
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,083
How did you get this position?

175
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,041
Special task force.

176
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,333
Did you volunteer for it?

177
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,708
Oh, yes.

178
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:05,666
I did.

179
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:30,791
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

180
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,625
She told Tronte and me what to do.

181
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,125
Claudia Tiedemann.

182
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,833
She knew the exact time
things would happen.

183
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:53,000
It made no sense. And yet 
it was the only thing that made sense.

184
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:55,750
You knew all this?

185
00:25:59,041 --> 00:25:59,916
Michael?

186
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,541
Mikkel? Ulrich?

187
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,041
You knew it all?

188
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:13,625
This here.

189
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:15,958
She gave it to us.

190
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,375
It's all in there. About the children...

191
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,125
Who disappeared when.

192
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,583
Things about time travel.

193
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,000
Symbols and tables
we don't really understand.

194
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:31,500
The last few pages were ripped out.

195
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,125
Does Katharina know about this?

196
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,500
You have to tell her.

197
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:48,750
Okay.

198
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,583
But I'll do it.

199
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,583
REGINA AND ALEKSANDER TIEDEMANN
TO WED

200
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,583
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
REGINA TIEDEMANN - ALEKSANDER TIEDEMANN

201
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,750
WALDHOTEL WINDEN OPENS

202
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:20,041
WALDHOTEL WINDEN CLOSED

203
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,000
EGON TIEDEMANN

204
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:35,125
NO TRACE OF MADS NIELSEN
CHIEF INSPECTOR EGON TIEDEMANN...

205
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:43,625
FORMER WINDEN CHIEF INSPECTOR
FOUND DEAD IN HIS APARTMENT

206
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:44,833
ON JUNE, 26 1987

207
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,208
Excuse me.

208
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,208
Can you print from these things?

209
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,916
Sometimes I dream about him.

210
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,208
Jonas.

211
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,916
It feels so real.

212
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,250
As if he were still alive.

213
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,750
How can it feel so real if he's dead?

214
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,708
Do you think he knew something?
Before he disappeared?

215
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:15,666
What do you mean?

216
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:20,833
That he found out something
he wasn't supposed to.

217
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,000
The door has to be here.

218
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,875
Where are we going, Charlotte?

219
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,833
Tell me where we're going.

220
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:07,416
Damn it, Charlotte! Where are we going?

221
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,333
It's easier to explain it
if I show it to you.

222
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,833
Have you found them?

223
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,625
You found them.

224
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:31,000
We found them. Both of them.

225
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:35,416
They're not dead. They're alive.

226
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:41,916
But they're not here.

227
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,458
What does that mean?

228
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:50,041
They're alive, they're not here?

229
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,041
You better see it with your own eyes.

230
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,666
What's she doing here?

231
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:25,416
What is this, Charlotte?

232
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,875
You said you thought Mikkel
was in the cave. You were right.

233
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:33,375
Mikkel was in the cave,
and Ulrich was looking for him there.

234
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,416
But there was something in the caves.

235
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,125
A kind of

236
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:45,375
crack in time.

237
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,583
Are you screwing with me?

238
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,500
What is all this bullshit?

239
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,708
-Where are Mikkel and Ulrich?
-It's true...

240
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,166
Shut your face!

241
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,916
No one asked for your opinion.

242
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,875
Charlotte is right.

243
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:22,708
Another one.

244
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,166
Who are you? Her new lover?

245
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,083
I'm Jonas.

246
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:34,750
Her son.

247
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,208
Your grandson.

248
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,458
She says it's shaking.

249
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,958
-What is it?
-There's someone there.

250
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,083
Go, go!

251
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:57,750
Flashlights off!

252
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,333
Bartosz?

253
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,500
Why are you here?

254
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:32,458
What the fuck?

255
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,708
What are you doing here?

256
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:46,375
My husband is caught in the 1950s,
and my son in the 1980s?

257
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:51,041
You left him there
because Mikkel is your father. Right?

258
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:53,750
Yes.

259
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,125
I can't believe it.

260
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,666
That you're buying all his bullshit.

261
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,458
What do you want? Huh?

262
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,375
Money?

263
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,250
Can you talk to the dead? Hm?

264
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:19,958
Katharina.

265
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,458
I was there.

266
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:26,791
I saw him.

267
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:29,791
Mikkel.

268
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:43,833
You've all lost it.

269
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,458
No.

270
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,541
If you have anything to do
with this shit...

271
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,875
Fuck you!

272
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,125
Stop it. Just tell us why you're here!

273
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,833
Come here.

274
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:34,458
What is that?

275
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,833
What is it?

276
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,250
Hands off. It's not your business.

277
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,375
If you have anything to do
with Mikkel or Dad...

278
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,291
I'll kill you.

279
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,666
What are we going to do now?

280
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,666
We're taking it.

281
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,250
And him?

282
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,416
We'll leave him here.

283
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,166
Maybe he'll change his mind.

284
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,250
Shit!

285
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,541
You can't do that.

286
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:16,916
Martha!

287
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:18,541
You can't do that!

288
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,583
Hey. Fuck... Hey!

289
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:24,583
Magnus!

290
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,583
Hey! Magnus!

291
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,125
Magnus!

292
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,541
What's your take on all of this?

293
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,916
We have a man-eating cave.

294
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:45,833
An NPP with a boss
who is obviously hiding something.

295
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,750
An inspector who has gone into hiding.

296
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,041
And a town full of people

297
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,500
who lie, cheat and betray one another.

298
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:59,375
And who are all only concerned with
concealing what's really going on here.

299
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:02,750
So, Mr. Wöller?

300
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,125
What do you make of it?

301
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,583
I don't know.

302
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,833
What happened to your eye?

303
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:31,208
Okay.

304
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:34,791
But...

305
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,708
you can't tell anyone.

306
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,125
Well...

307
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,083
-Last summer...
-Watch out!

308
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:06,958
Interesting.

309
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,500
TEACHER'S LOUNGE
PLEASE KNOCK

310
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,541
1986, 1986...

311
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:51,875
KAHNWALD, MICHAEL - 6B

312
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:53,208
6b.

313
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,625
6b...

314
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,291
6b.

315
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,541
CLASS REGISTER

316
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:40,541
It's not open yet.

317
00:42:56,708 --> 00:43:00,041
It's going to take
nearly 32 more years until it opens.

318
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:02,666
So you know about it?

319
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:11,666
They're waiting for you.

320
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:18,625
Who?

321
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,791
Sic Mundus.

322
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:26,625
You want to go home, right? 
That's what they say, anyway.

323
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:28,791
Who are "they"?

324
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:34,166
The travelers.

325
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:53,666
And now?

326
00:43:58,375 --> 00:43:59,500
It doesn't matter.

327
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:03,541
Everything will happen as it always has.

328
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:08,416
Then why are you here?

329
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,625
-He said there's a loophole.
-Who?

330
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:16,625
Adam.

331
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:17,958
Who's Adam?

332
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,000
The leader of Sic Mundus.

333
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:22,833
The people in the photo,

334
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:24,458
the travelers?

335
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:25,875
Yes.

336
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,833
He wants the last cycle to begin.

337
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:31,583
In three days.

338
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,458
I have to stop him.

339
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:41,500
That's why I'm here.

340
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,125
She tried.

341
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:56,083
But in the end she became
what she wanted to fight.

342
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,333
What are we doing here?

343
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,291
You're one of them.

344
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,083
A traveler.

345
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,583
Not yet.

346
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,875
But I will be soon.

347
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:23,916
It must be strange for you to see me here.

348
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:28,125
Especially after our last encounter.

349
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,166
You've already made my acquaintance.

350
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:48,583
You finally want answers, don't you?

351
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:21,625
ALEKSANDER KÖHLER?

352
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:20,875
SIC MUNDUS CREATUS EST

353
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,541
What are you doing here?

354
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:58,625
What is that in there?

355
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:02,875
You knew it was here!

356
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,375
You were

357
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,041
lying to us the entire time.

358
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:11,041
What is that?

359
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:13,958
What is that?

360
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:22,791
They say it's a piece of God.

361
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,291
But it's really a piece of the devil.

362
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,125
The prophecy.

363
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:46,666
How did it arise?

364
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,875
The book. Who wrote it?

365
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,916
Whoever it was who wrote it...

366
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:24,833
had already seen the future and the past.

367
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,166
What will happen next?

368
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:47,166
Adam will send him on the path
that has been predetermined for him.

369
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,666
So the last cycle can begin.

370
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:47,208
You must have a lot of questions.

371
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:15,166
Traveling doesn't leave one unscathed.

372
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:20,625
The human body isn't equipped for it
on a continual basis.

373
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,458
What is this place?

374
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,083
Shall we begin?

375
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:43,250
I don't want to begin anything.
I want this to finally end. All of it!

376
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:46,333
Don't worry. It will end.

377
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:48,541
That is inevitable.

378
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:50,750
Your end.

379
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:52,875
My end.

380
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:58,250
Upon closer examination, everyone's end.

381
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:10,208
Who are you?

382
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:23,166
Don't you know?

383
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,333
That can't be.

384
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:47,625
I am you.

385
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,125
Every stone is once again
where it belongs.

386
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,750
Everyone in the place
they were destined to be.

387
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,833
Now all that's needed is a little push.

388
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:25,791
