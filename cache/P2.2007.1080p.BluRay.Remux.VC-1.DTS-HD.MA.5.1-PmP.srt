1
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,442
Yes. I redrafted the contracts
to include the new stipulations.

2
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:34,028
- Then where are they?
- I'm faxing the revisions now.

3
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:37,573
Did you make all the changes I asked for?
- Yes, I included the 4 % increase...

4
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,243
and the extra two million.
- No. If it's a 4 % increase,

5
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,704
then you have to add
at least three million dollars.

6
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,916
No. That's not what I was told.
- And who told you that?

7
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,085
Their lawyers.
- They're all idiots.

8
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:53,422
This is a total lack of communication.
- You know what? If's ok.

9
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,592
I had no way of knowing, sir.
- Ok, look. This is what I need you to do.

10
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,803
Sir, can I put you on hold for a second?
- Ok.

11
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,888
Thanks. Hi, Jody.

12
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,266
Mr. Harper wants to see you in his office.
- Great. Of course.

13
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,645
You still want me to fax those?
- It's ok. You don't have to.

14
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:10,064
I'm not even done yet. You should go home.
- Are you sure?

15
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:13,734
Yeah. It's late. I don't want your parents
to worry. Get out of here.

16
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:18,197
Ok. Merry Christmas, Angela.
- Merry Christmas, Jody.

17
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:32,169
Hi, Lorraine.
Yeah, of course I'm going to make it.

18
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,256
Just let me call you back. Ok?

19
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,676
In a few minutes. I promise. OK.

20
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:44,724
Still on the Morgan deal, hm?
- What can I do for you, Jim?

21
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,684
I...

22
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:52,356
I don't know how to...

23
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,318
Angela,
I feel terrible about what happened.

24
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,697
It's ok. It's fine.
Let's just not worry about it, ok?

25
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,658
No, no, no. It's not ok.

26
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,912
I acted like a real jerk.
I'd had too many drinks and...

27
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,416
you know
how these Christmas party's can be.

28
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:13,627
You know we had a baby last year.

29
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:18,507
And it's been a hard year.
- I'm sure that it has.

30
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:23,387
I simply want to tell you
that I'm just really, really sorry. Ok?

31
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,098
Apology accepted.

32
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,893
Ok. Thanks.

33
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,271
Merry Christmas, Angela.
- You too, Jim.

34
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,245
You calling me from work?
I thought you were going home first.

35
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:53,000
I brought everything with me. Don't worry.
- God, I am so late with this dinner.

36
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,753
Did you pick up the Santa Claus costume?
I hope you didn't forget it.

37
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:58,297
I didn't forget it. It's in the car.

38
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,633
I think Dad is more excited than the kids.

39
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:03,969
Believe me, I can't wait
to get out of here and see you guys.

40
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,807
Jimmy, Put that back.
Do you want Santa to come tonight or not?

41
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,727
- Hey, Mommy. I want Santa to come.
- Well, then help me set the table.

42
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,980
Ok. Please don't be late.
- I won't. I promise. I won't.

43
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,775
Ok, bye.
- Bye.

44
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:23,572
Ok.

45
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,531
Jesus!
- My God.

46
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:08,200
Sorry, Angela.

47
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,412
I was just locking up the floors.
I didn't know anybody would be working...

48
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:13,706
this late on Christmas Eve.
- Yeah, me neither.

49
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:18,002
Sorry. I'll come back later, alright?
- Actually, if you wouldn't mind waiting,

50
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:21,130
I'll lock up my office
and I'll take the elevator down with you.

51
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,507
Ok. Sure.
- Ok. Two seconds.

52
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,094
Do you work all night?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:30,222
But they're closing the building
for the next three days.

54
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,391
Besides, I get New Year's Eve off.
- Oh, that's good.

55
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:35,519
Yeah, I hope to get home in time
for the girls to open up the presents.

56
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,688
How are they?
- Great.

57
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:42,318
Come on, your parents can't stand me.
- You're wrong, Doug. They love you.

58
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:46,447
So, where are you going this evening?
- To my sister's house in Jersey.

59
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,576
Jersey? I thought of you more
as an Upper East Side girl.

60
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:55,080
Yeah, upper east side of Maine, actually.
I grew up on a farm, Karl.

61
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:59,084
Now I'm having trouble believing that.
- Don't let the fancy clothes fool you.

62
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:03,255
- I keep it real. Come on.
- If that's what you call it, ok.

63
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,800
Keeping it real.
- Good night, Karl.

64
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,261
Merry Christmas, Angela.
- You too. I'll see you soon.

65
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,471
Yeah.

66
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,818
Yes. No. I promise you.
I'm leaving right now. I know. I know.

67
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:29,698
I'm sorry, but I'm in the elevator.
25 minutes tops.

68
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,912
I can't hear you. What?
Lorraine, you're breaking up.

69
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:36,872
Hello?

70
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:40,394
You've got to be kidding me.
You've got to be kidding. Ok.

71
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,696
Come on. Come on. Come on!

72
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,577
Oh God. What am I going to do?

73
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:11,717
I'm going to get out of the car.
That's what I'm going to do.

74
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,032
Shit.

75
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,590
Hello?

76
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:56,678
Jesus.
- Rocky. Rocky. Rocky.

77
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,431
What are you doing? Heel. Stay.

78
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,599
Down. Down.

79
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,812
Sorry about that.
- That's ok.

80
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,607
Look, can you unlock the door
to the elevator room? My car won't start.

81
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,444
And I need to get upstairs and get a cab.
- Yeah, I can.

82
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,989
I just have to find my key cards. Sorry.

83
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,159
Where are those darn keys?
I was about to do my rounds, anyway. So...

84
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,662
Ok.
- What happened to your car?

85
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:24,832
I have no idea.
- You probably left the lights on.

86
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,918
No, I don't think so. I'm usually
pretty good about that kind of thing.

87
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,129
People do it all the time.
It's instinctive.

88
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,424
I mean, you drive down here and it's dark.
It happens. Ah. Here we go.

89
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,593
Great.
- You know, actually, I just thought.

90
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:40,430
I have a charger in the back, so if it is
your battery we could probably...

91
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,183
You could use that.
- Oh, thank you.

92
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:47,187
But I really should just take a cab.
I'm so late as it is. - I don't know.

93
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:51,358
It'll probably take longer to get a cab.
It's Christmas Eve, so, I don't know.

94
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:56,280
It's up to you. Whatever you want.
- How long will it take?

95
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,908
Just a few minutes. Give me one second.
It doesn't look...

96
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,828
like New Yorkers are actually going to be
able to celebrate a white Christmas.

97
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:05,956
Maybe next year. Now, with the beautiful
metropolitan opera in the background,

98
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,001
let's check out the temperatures
for the tri-state area...

99
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:12,504
Alright. Which way to your car?
- Over there.

100
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,755
Ok.

101
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,470
Working late, hm?
Yeah, I know how you feel.

102
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:25,434
Yeah, these are pretty reliable cars
for the most part, right?

103
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,812
They're supposed to be.

104
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,607
Right. Positive.

105
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,360
Negative.

106
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,618
Ok, alright. Try it. Turn her over.
- Ok.

107
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,829
Strange.

108
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:50,000
Ok. Hang on.
Can you turn your headlights on?

109
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,880
Weird. Try turning the keys again.

110
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,968
Damned.
- Ok. I guess turn the headlights off.

111
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:02,471
You know what? That's it.

112
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:06,016
I...
You've been a great help, but I give up.

113
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,394
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what happened.

114
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,648
I thought I could do something about it.
- That's ok. You've been great.

115
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:17,402
Can you just let me in the elevator room?
- I was just trying to help.

116
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,864
I know, and I appreciate it. Thank you.

117
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:33,126
Hey, listen, I know you're upset
about your car not starting,

118
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,088
but it's the holidays, you know?
It's time to be thankful.

119
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:40,342
No. You know what? You're right.
I should be thankful.

120
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,558
I...

121
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,563
I prepared
a small Christmas meal for myself.

122
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,858
You could join me if you want.

123
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,283
I'm just kidding.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm exhausted.

124
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,910
But really, thanks for your help.

125
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,872
Oh, you're welcome.
Maybe some other time, yeah?

126
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,249
Yeah, sure.

127
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,460
Alright. Here you go.

128
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,839
You don't want me to call you a cab?
- No. I've got a number in my bag.

129
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,050
Alright, suit yourself. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

130
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:42,696
Karl?

131
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:07,929
Hi. Can I get a car
at 2370 Park Avenue, please?

132
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,768
Are you sure? No, that's ok.
I'll wait. Thanks.

133
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,823
Hey, Lorraine.
You're not going to believe what happened.

134
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:31,912
No. Actually, my car wouldn't start.
Look, just start without me.

135
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:36,083
I'll be there within the hour
and I'll make it up to them.

136
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,960
Ok. I'll see you soon. Bye.

137
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,809
Hello?

138
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,312
Oh, oh, great. Thank you. Thank you.

139
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,356
Ok. Ok.

140
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,324
Oh, come on. What?

141
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:56,746
This is not happening. Is this a joke?

142
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:01,751
No, no. You've got to be kidding me.
Karl? Karl, where are you?

143
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,881
Is anybody here?
Come on, come on, come on.

144
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,057
What?

145
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:21,563
Just one second. Ok?
I'll be right back. One second.

146
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,711
Hello. Can you hear me? Look,
I've got a cab waiting for me out front.

147
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:48,048
Can you open the front gate, please?
Hello?

148
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,762
No. No. No, no, no, no. No.

149
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,932
No. Damned.

150
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,018
Why would you leave me here?

151
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,903
Wake up, damned. The cab just left.

152
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:34,135
Hey! I'm still in here. Wait!

153
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,984
Great.

154
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,703
It's ok. Just...

155
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,631
Hello?

156
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,762
<i>OK. Stop being paranoid.</i>

157
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,600
Just go down to the office.

158
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,308
Hello?

159
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,159
Ah. Oh, fuck!

160
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,453
Goddamned!

161
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,280
No!

162
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:49,581
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
You've been a good little girl.

163
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:58,715
Oh, it's ok. It's ok. You're alright.
You're alright. You're alright. Ok?

164
00:20:58,798 --> 00:20:59,966
Alright?

165
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:06,222
You're not looking so good. Are you ok?
Take it easy. It's ok.

166
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,937
What happened to me? What time is it?

167
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,149
You just fell. You'll be alright.

168
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:20,487
I don't feel good. I'm going to be sick.
- I'll get some water.

169
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:25,575
I'll get you some water.
- Watch out! Be careful!

170
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:31,080
You're going to hurt yourself.
Try and stay calm. Oh, oh.

171
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:32,582
Ok.

172
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,754
It's ok. It's ok. Here. Here.

173
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,381
Ok? Alright?

174
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,928
I'm going to help you up. Ok, now?
I'm going to help you up.

175
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,722
Here you go. Ready?

176
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,684
Alright. Here you go. It's ok.

177
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,979
Alright. Ok. Try to relax.

178
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,233
I'm going to clean this up. Ok.

179
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,245
Clean this up. Ok. Ok.

180
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,381
Alright. I'll be right back.

181
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:35,937
Hungry?

182
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,731
I got turkey,

183
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:44,612
mashed potatoes. I got cranberries
and I even got some cornbread.

184
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:50,577
Oh man. I am... I'm sorry about this.

185
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,998
I was just teasing.
I didn't mean to scare you.

186
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,458
Oh man.

187
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:02,046
I hope it's still warm.

188
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:08,595
If not I have the microwave, so...

189
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,849
Are you feeling any better?

190
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:16,936
What happened to my clothes?

191
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:22,525
Like I said, you fell,
and your clothes got dirty, so...

192
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,574
Maybe you'd like some wine.

193
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,412
It'll help you relax a little, you know?
- Look, I don't know what you're doing,

194
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:37,624
but you'd better just fucking untie me.

195
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:45,465
This is a California wine.
It's a Sonoma County.

196
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:50,011
That's where I'm from.
It's beautiful up there.

197
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,892
Where are you from?

198
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:02,732
What do you want?
- I want to know where you're from.

199
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,779
I'm from Readfield.

200
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:13,618
Where's that?
- Why don't you tell me what you want?

201
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:18,873
I just want to know where Readfield is.
And I want you to relax.

202
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,141
Cheers.

203
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,229
Ok. I'll make a toast.

204
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:46,943
Here's to good friends and hometowns
and Readfield, wherever that is.

205
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,117
Listen.

206
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,077
Tom.
- Tom.

207
00:24:57,578 --> 00:25:02,000
I have some place to be.
You know, I have obligations.

208
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,211
Yeah. I know.

209
00:25:05,294 --> 00:25:09,132
Way too many. You don't make time
for yourself, you know?

210
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:13,261
You don't need
to be at everyone's beck and call.

211
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:19,100
So, then maybe we should get a drink
in the new year.

212
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:24,230
Now, look.
I've already prepared everything.

213
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:28,109
It's all here.
- I know, and it looks really good.

214
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:31,195
Yeah? Great. Well let's eat.

215
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,700
I'm starving.
- Tom, this is really sweet of you.

216
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:39,078
And I mean that, but my whole family's
expecting me. I have plans.

217
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,915
I guess some plans are made to be broken.

218
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,129
Do you want to say grace, or should 1?

219
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:54,802
Hell, skip it.
I've never been religious, anyway.

220
00:25:57,346 --> 00:26:00,058
Bon appetit.

221
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:08,399
What do you like to do?

222
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,447
You know, I have to work and stuff.
It's hobbies.

223
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,950
That's a mundane question, but I guess
people ask that just to get...

224
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,162
to know each other, right? I read.

225
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:25,750
Right now I'm reading Hemmingway,
"The Sun Also Rises".

226
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,126
And...

227
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,964
You really should eat.
It's going to get cold.

228
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:34,342
Anyway, so, in the book,

229
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:37,095
this guy, he loves this girl so much...

230
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,182
that he's willing to forgive
everything that she does.

231
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,186
Even her infidelities.

232
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:49,273
That's a pretty intense story, but...

233
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,820
that's what love is supposed to be, right?

234
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:03,830
My boyfriend's going to get worried and
he's going to come looking for me, Tom.

235
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:17,844
If I don't show up he's going to come
looking for me. He knows where I work.

236
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,308
How long have you guys
been dating or hanging out?

237
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,937
Two years.
- Two years?

238
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:34,068
Do you guys live together?
- It's none of your fucking business.

239
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:38,030
That's not very nice dinner talk.

240
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,410
Yeah, we live together. Ok?

241
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:47,707
Two years.

242
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,962
That's more than a boyfriend, that's a...

243
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:57,216
It sounds like wedding bells.
Do you guys have any plans?

244
00:27:57,633 --> 00:28:01,345
Yes.
- What does your fiancé do?

245
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,349
He's a journalist.
- Journalist.

246
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,477
See, I knew he had to be smart.
What kind of journalist? - Sports.

247
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,063
Sports? What paper?
- "The Post".

248
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,774
"The Post"? I read "The Post".
What's his name?

249
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,986
Mark Clayton.
- Clayton? Clayton.

250
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:20,656
I don't remember that name.

251
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:26,078
You know, I have one over here.
- It's online. It's "The Post online".

252
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,799
You know, it is amazing that you're able
to keep a relationship...

253
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,011
with the amount of hours that you work.

254
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:47,016
He must get really lonely
when you have to work late, right?

255
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,187
Do you love him?

256
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,981
Does he love you?

257
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:04,283
I'm only asking, because I'm worried
about how quickly he's going to get here.

258
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,495
I'm sure he's already on his way.

259
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:12,083
Right.

260
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,544
He's probably on the Harlem River Drive
as we speak.

261
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,797
What kind of a car does he drive?
- I don't know.

262
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,049
You don't know? You don't know
what kind of car your fiancé drives?

263
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:24,303
Toyota, I think. I don't know.
- Toyota, what a fast car.

264
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:28,641
He could be here a lot sooner
than I was thinking.

265
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:32,895
He could be coming down this ramp
right now as we speak.

266
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,907
You know, you haven't been
very talkative since we met,

267
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,494
but now...

268
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,582
you're telling me all
about your boyfriend.

269
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,669
Oh, sorry, your fiancé.

270
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:02,425
So either we've become best friends
over dinner or you're lying to me.

271
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:06,262
I'm going to guess.

272
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:09,056
You're lying to me.

273
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:16,647
You don't really have a boyfriend, do you?
But you want one.

274
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:22,820
You want somebody who cares about you,

275
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:28,200
worries about you.
- Please, don't.

276
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:31,829
You've got a great family.

277
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,959
You know, you've got Lorraine.

278
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,254
And Jimmy and Rose. They love you.

279
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:46,385
They're probably
getting worried about you.

280
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:48,929
Maybe we should give them a call.

281
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,348
Yeah?

282
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,392
Tell them you're ok.

283
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,438
What do you think?

284
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,913
But what shall we say?

285
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:18,626
I know, I know.
We should say you made other plans.

286
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,837
No. You probably already said that one.

287
00:31:22,254 --> 00:31:26,008
You know what?
You should think of something.

288
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,011
You're a good liar.

289
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,389
Go ahead.

290
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:34,141
Go!

291
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,185
No.

292
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,450
Hello.

293
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,785
Hello?

294
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,248
Hey, Rosie.
Can you get your mommy on the phone?

295
00:31:57,456 --> 00:32:01,460
Who's calling, please?
- It's Auntie Angie.

296
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,630
Mommy, it's Aunt Angie.

297
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:08,175
Give me a second. It's Angela.
Hey. Where are you?

298
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,052
- Angela?

299
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,180
I'm not feeling well.
- What do you mean?

300
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,100
We're all waiting for you.
She says she's not feeling well.

301
00:32:16,183 --> 00:32:20,104
- That's what she said the last time.
- Can I talk to my sister?

302
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:23,190
So, where are you, Angie?

303
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,777
Angela?

304
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,822
I'm home. I went home.

305
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,200
- What's wrong? Where is she?
- I really don't understand.

306
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,744
Last time I talked to you,
you said you were on your way.

307
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:39,999
- What about the costume?
- You know what? Let's just eat.

308
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:43,377
Angela, you know it would
be nice if you tried to put your family...

309
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,921
- ahead of your work sometimes.
- That's enough. Give me the phone.

310
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,716
Angie, what's wrong?

311
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:52,344
Hello? I can't hear her.

312
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:56,807
Hello, Sweetie. Can you hear me?
- Hi, Mom. I'm here.

313
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,311
Honey, what happened? Where are you?

314
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:03,105
I don't know.

315
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,442
I think it's the flu.
- You really sound terrible.

316
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:09,528
Are you sure you're ok? Honey?

317
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:11,530
Yeah.

318
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,493
I just need some rest.

319
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:20,789
Ok, well, rest up and hopefully
you'll feel better for lunch tomorrow.

320
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:24,668
And Sweetie,
don't worry about the costume. Ok?

321
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,838
Merry Christmas, Angel. I love you.

322
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,925
I love you, too, Mom.

323
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,725
Hey.

324
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:45,189
That's the best Christmas present
anyone's ever given me.

325
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,650
Thank you.

326
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,321
Now, I have a present for you.

327
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:14,969
Go ahead.

328
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,805
Open it.

329
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,228
Aren't you even curious?

330
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:27,022
Come on. Open it.

331
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:32,194
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

332
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:45,249
I bet you're curious now, yeah?

333
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:48,043
Ok, enough torture.

334
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:55,467
Watch. It's all cued up.

335
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,434
Why are you showing this to me?
- Wait.

336
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,756
You fucked up now, asshole.

337
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,803
Sorry you had to see that.

338
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,728
You want to go for a stroll?

339
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:56,945
These guys always do whatever they want.

340
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:04,912
Here we go.

341
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:12,252
Rocky, sit! Stay down.

342
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:18,550
Stay still. Stay still. Give me your arm.

343
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:20,678
Give it.

344
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,682
Why? Why? Why did you do that?

345
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:33,440
Rocky, shut the fuck up!

346
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:40,322
Let me help you up. Don't be silly.
I'm not going to hurt you, alright?

347
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:45,202
You're hurting my arm.
- That's because you won't relax your arm.

348
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:50,791
Come on now.
- Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

349
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:54,002
Oh, yeah. I believe you.
I will show you something.

350
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,274
Alright.
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

351
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:17,693
Here we go.

352
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:35,419
I think I drank too much wine.

353
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:40,048
I shouldn't be driving.

354
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,511
I'm just kidding.

355
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,602
You know, I've seen you drive
out of here so many times.

356
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:55,731
It's strange actually
being in the car with you.

357
00:37:56,148 --> 00:38:00,319
- It's great, actually.
- You said we were taking a drive.

358
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:01,487
We are.

359
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,366
Then why are we going down, Tom?
- It's freezing out there.

360
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,455
Besides, this is going to be much better.

361
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,885
Why are we down here, Thomas?

362
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,262
Tom.

363
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,826
Oh, my God.

364
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,496
Oh, my God, Tom. What is this?

365
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:55,582
This is my present to you.

366
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,470
Take this and show him.

367
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,350
Show him what?

368
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:15,769
Show him you're not a slut.

369
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:21,275
Take this and teach him he can't
be touching every woman that he wants.

370
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:25,320
Are you talking about
what happened in the elevator?

371
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:29,491
Oh, Tom. No. No, no, no.
You don't understand. That was a mistake.

372
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:33,287
That was a stupid mistake.
- What? What? He tried to rape you.

373
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:38,000
No. No, he got a little out of hand at
a party, Tom. He hardly tried to rape me.

374
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,544
Look, he was drunk.

375
00:39:40,627 --> 00:39:42,963
He apologized.

376
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:47,843
Oh, he apologized. Oh, you think you're
the first woman he tried to do this to?

377
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:52,180
I've seen him trying to touch every woman
in the building. He's a pervert.

378
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,392
He's a degenerate.
- No. No. He's not.

379
00:39:55,642 --> 00:39:57,853
He's a good man, Tom.

380
00:39:57,936 --> 00:40:01,982
He's a good man. Just look at him.
He has a family. He has a wife. Tom.

381
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:06,028
Please, Tom, just...
- Tom. Stop calling out my name, alright?

382
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:09,156
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to humanize yourself...

383
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,325
like you're some poor victim. I told you.

384
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:14,077
I'm not going to hurt you. Alright?

385
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,706
Stop calling out my name, alright?
Enough is enough. Tom. Tom. Tom.

386
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,875
Every time just the same.

387
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,835
Ok.

388
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,798
Oh.

389
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,676
Oh.

390
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,514
I know you're a person, ok?
I know you're a person. Ok?

391
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,850
I'm a person, too.

392
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,979
I know you have feelings.
I have feelings, too.

393
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:44,191
I care about your feelings.

394
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:49,363
He's the one you should be scared of.
He's the one who has no feelings.

395
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:53,867
So, if you want to help him,

396
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,621
take this and teach him a lesson.

397
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,087
I told you.

398
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,047
He apologized.

399
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,092
What? He can just apologize and then
he can do it again?

400
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:12,177
And he's just going to apologize again.

401
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,304
You've got to stop letting these assholes
have their way with you.

402
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:19,142
Tom, just please believe me.
It was just a misunderstanding, Tom.

403
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:23,855
Tom. Tom. Stop calling out my name.
I told you.

404
00:41:24,189 --> 00:41:25,315
Ok.
- Didn't 1?

405
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,110
Yes. Yes. Yes.

406
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:32,322
I'm sorry, but you're scaring me.
- Jesus. When are you going to understand?

407
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,490
I'm...

408
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,246
I'm here to help you.
I'm not going to hurt you.

409
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:53,051
Ok.

410
00:41:57,222 --> 00:41:59,933
I'll do it.

411
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:03,645
You untie me and I'll do it.

412
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:11,987
No, no, no.

413
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:17,617
Whoa. You're a good person.
- You're a good person, too.

414
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:22,414
I should have never asked you to do this.
I'm sorry. - No. No, it's ok.

415
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,668
It's ok, because I want to, I just...

416
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,588
You just have to untie me and I'll do it.

417
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:30,797
For you.

418
00:42:40,515 --> 00:42:44,644
It's my job. It's my job to protect you.
- No, Tom. Listen to me. It's not.

419
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:49,524
It's not. Please don't do anything.
- Don't try to run away, ok?

420
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,861
Can I trust you?

421
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:56,698
Can I trust you?
-Yes.

422
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,493
You can trust me.

423
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:06,083
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

424
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:10,629
So.

425
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:15,383
You like to touch girls, do you?

426
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,178
No? No? Look at her.

427
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:21,306
I said look at here.

428
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,560
Does she look happy to you?

429
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,812
Hm?

430
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:29,940
Yeah.

431
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,694
Yeah. You messed with the wrong girl, hm?

432
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:37,531
What makes you think you deserve her?

433
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:40,617
Hm? What gives you the right?

434
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:43,995
You're something else, you know that?

435
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,082
You pretentious, Ivy League,

436
00:43:47,415 --> 00:43:49,793
piece of shit.

437
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:53,046
You don't own the world
and everyone in it.

438
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,258
I mean, what is a guy like you thinking
when he puts his hands all over a girl...

439
00:43:56,341 --> 00:44:00,512
who obviously is not interested,
who is obviously not a slut?

440
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,725
Because that's what you think they are,
right? Yeah?

441
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,312
I can't hear you. What did you say? What?
Hm?

442
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:14,317
Can you speak up, because you can't talk
your way out of this one, can you?

443
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,281
Why am I even wasting my time with you?
- No!

444
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:25,704
What the hell? He deserves it.
- Don't do anything, Thomas. Please.

445
00:44:41,052 --> 00:44:42,137
No!

446
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,933
Thomas, stop it.

447
00:44:50,937 --> 00:44:51,980
No.

448
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,830
Way to ruin Christmas, asshole.

449
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:28,266
Well, he won't be bothering you again.
- Where are we going?

450
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:35,440
We can't just leave him there?
- Why? Why are you defending him?

451
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,733
I'm not.

452
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,402
I'm not.
- Why? Did you like this?

453
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,489
Do like to get touched? Hm? You like it
when he touches you in the parking garage?

454
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:45,325
You want to get laid here?
- No. You know that's not true.

455
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:49,162
So what? What is it?
Is it a career thing?

456
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:53,333
Did you fuck him to get a promotion? Hm?

457
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:57,170
You can't leave him here.

458
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:03,093
You're right. You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

459
00:46:03,843 --> 00:46:06,846
We shouldn't leave him here.

460
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,557
Thomas, stop!

461
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,774
What are you doing?
- We're going to take him for a drive.

462
00:46:17,857 --> 00:46:21,486
What are you doing? No, Thomas.
Stop the car. Stop.

463
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:24,155
Please, stop. Please.

464
00:46:25,573 --> 00:46:29,703
Stop it. Stop it.
What are you doing, Tom? No! No!

465
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:36,710
No. No. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

466
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:45,427
Don't do this. Please. Don't. Don't. No.
Thomas, please don't do this.

467
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:47,012
No.

468
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,513
No.

469
00:46:54,602 --> 00:46:55,645
Thomas. No.

470
00:46:56,938 --> 00:47:00,608
Please, don't do this. No.

471
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,904
No. No!

472
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,413
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

473
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:17,083
Where are you going?

474
00:47:18,376 --> 00:47:19,419
Angela.

475
00:47:20,086 --> 00:47:23,840
Angela. Come back.
You're fucking a great liar.

476
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,175
Liar.

477
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:54,621
Hey! Down here!

478
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,541
Hey, can you hear me? Help!

479
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,216
Down hear. Can't you hear me?

480
00:49:29,215 --> 00:49:30,675
Oh shit.

481
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,432
Good boy.

482
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,073
Good boy.

483
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,077
I just take my bag.

484
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,413
Stay right there.

485
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,639
Help me!

486
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,517
Help me, please. Help!

487
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:10,233
Help me, please. Help! Someone's trying
to kill me. Please help me.

488
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,737
Help me.

489
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,949
Somebody's trying to Kill.

490
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,703
Please somebody help.
- Where are you?

491
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:32,922
Come on. Please.

492
00:51:51,899 --> 00:51:52,942
Oh no.

493
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,684
Angela.

494
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:31,689
Please. Please. If anyone can hear me,
I'm trapped in the underground parking...

495
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:36,152
of the Arcadia building.
It's 2370 Park Avenue.

496
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:40,657
- Someone's trying to kill me.
- Angela.

497
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:44,452
Angela, come out.

498
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:45,578
Shit.

499
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,456
Angela. Angela.

500
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:49,791
No.

501
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,213
Can we talk about this?

502
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:03,513
Looks like somebody's playing game,
hm, Rocky?

503
00:53:10,895 --> 00:53:12,230
Angela?

504
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,712
Come on. Close. Come on.

505
00:54:20,631 --> 00:54:21,883
Lobby.

506
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:25,386
Come on. Lobby. Lobby. Come on.

507
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,973
Why is it fucking locked?

508
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:32,977
Angela.

509
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:41,277
Hello.

510
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:47,325
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

511
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:18,898
Please, hello? Please answer.
Please. Please.

512
00:55:20,441 --> 00:55:23,569
Yes, 5 Buroughs Security. Hello.

513
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:29,534
Hello?
- Yes,. I'm here. Can you hear me?

514
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,829
I can hear you fine. How can I help you?
- I'm being kidnapped.

515
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:37,041
I work at Brighter, Smith and Steinberg.
It's 2370 Park Avenue.

516
00:55:37,124 --> 00:55:41,212
And I'm hiding in the elevator.
Please can you call 911? - Calm down.

517
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:44,882
Is there someone with you right now?
- No, he's outside.

518
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,718
He's in the parking lot.
He already killed someone else.

519
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,721
Did you see him do it?
- Yes, his name is Thomas.

520
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:54,600
He's the parking attendant in my building.
If you'll please hurry. I'm in danger.

521
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:59,564
Ma'am, you have got to relax.
- How do you fucking expect me to relax?

522
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:03,442
This man is trying to kill me. Can you
just please try to understand...

523
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:07,238
and call the cops? Please, just call 911.

524
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,577
The police? No.

525
00:56:13,494 --> 00:56:16,622
I'm sure he's just trying to help you.

526
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,083
Right?

527
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:21,460
Angela.

528
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,841
Angela, are you still there?

529
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,845
Listen, you fuck face, I called the cops
and I'm going to stay down here...

530
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:35,057
as long as it takes until they get here
so I suggest you get the fuck out.

531
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,727
I just want to talk to you, Angela.

532
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:42,481
That's why I pretended to be someone else.
Ok? So don't be upset.

533
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,610
Will you come out? I was just kidding.

534
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,946
Just go to hell.
- Angela, don't you understand?

535
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:53,075
I did it for you.
That guy showed you no respect.

536
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,873
Why won't you talk to me, Angela?

537
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:02,668
Just give me a chance.

538
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:08,215
You know, if you just give us a chance,
it can work out.

539
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,384
You'll grow to like me.

540
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:14,180
You know, that's usually what happens
when 2 people are forced to be together...

541
00:57:14,263 --> 00:57:18,434
in a stressful situation.
They have to depend on one another,

542
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:22,772
and eventually they support each other,
and like each other.

543
00:57:22,855 --> 00:57:25,983
Sometimes they even fall in love.

544
00:57:28,527 --> 00:57:29,737
Angela.

545
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,492
Angela, please, please don't do this.

546
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,955
Hm? Why won't you talk to me?

547
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:47,296
You know, I wish you had just
a little bit more respect for yourself.

548
00:59:29,106 --> 00:59:32,234
I want to go out. Do you hear me?

549
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,072
What are you doing? You fuck!

550
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:55,257
No.

551
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,545
Oh, what did he do? Karl.

552
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,780
Karl. Karl.

553
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,450
Karl.

554
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:05,995
Oh my God.

555
01:01:08,914 --> 01:01:09,999
Karl.

556
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,151
Angela.

557
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:43,657
You must be freezing out here.

558
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,743
Angela!

559
01:01:57,546 --> 01:01:59,632
What a mess.

560
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,347
Angela.

561
01:02:08,682 --> 01:02:11,685
I think Karl is hurt.

562
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:13,520
Angela.

563
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,441
Should we call him an ambulance?

564
01:02:17,524 --> 01:02:18,609
Hm?

565
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:22,071
Yeah, that way he can go back
to his kids and his family.

566
01:02:22,154 --> 01:02:25,741
And you can go to your sister's
and I can stay here,

567
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:30,037
in this parking lot, all by myself,

568
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:34,250
because that's obviously
what everybody wants!

569
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,088
Angela.

570
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:49,640
I just can't keep chasing
you around all night, Angela.

571
01:02:50,557 --> 01:02:51,767
Besides,

572
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,980
the whole place is locked.

573
01:02:58,649 --> 01:02:59,858
Angela.

574
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,735
Angela.

575
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:05,739
Where are you going to go if you get away?

576
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:08,826
It's freezing out there.

577
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,327
Angela.

578
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,664
Angela?

579
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,126
Angela?

580
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,716
Angela.

581
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:26,302
Angela.

582
01:03:34,226 --> 01:03:36,937
Way to ruin Christmas, Karl.

583
01:04:08,093 --> 01:04:14,058
I'll have a blue Christmas

584
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,102
without you.

585
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:22,733
I'll be so blue

586
01:04:22,816 --> 01:04:27,446
just thinking about you.

587
01:04:30,115 --> 01:04:34,536
Decorations of red

588
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:39,333
on a green christmas tree.

589
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:45,130
Won't be the same dear,

590
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:49,301
if you're not here with me.

591
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:53,347
And when those blue

592
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:58,018
snowflakes start falling,

593
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:03,690
That's when those blue

594
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:08,362
memories start calling.

595
01:05:11,031 --> 01:05:15,244
You'll be doin' alright,

596
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:20,249
with your Christmas of white.

597
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:24,920
But I'll have a blue,

598
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:28,090
blue blue blue Christmas.

599
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:55,492
You'll be doin' alright,

600
01:05:56,201 --> 01:06:00,289
with your Christmas of white,

601
01:06:01,623 --> 01:06:04,918
But I'll have a blue,

602
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,255
blue blue blue Christmas.

603
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:14,011
Thank you. Thank you very much.

604
01:06:20,517 --> 01:06:23,228
I love you.

605
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,607
I'm so fond you.

606
01:06:36,825 --> 01:06:39,828
...to find a way out.

607
01:06:40,996 --> 01:06:43,707
He will pay for it.

608
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,593
So, what do you think?

609
01:06:54,676 --> 01:06:57,387
That's so easy.

610
01:06:59,139 --> 01:07:01,850
That's very good.

611
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,353
Oh, I think...

612
01:07:09,441 --> 01:07:11,818
So, you want make-up?

613
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:14,196
Hm? Ok.

614
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:24,706
You have the most beautiful lips
I have ever seen in my life.

615
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,711
You're beautiful.

616
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,465
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

617
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:40,931
You have a wonderful body.

618
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,563
It was meant to be, baby.

619
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,192
Me and you.

620
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:56,280
Angela, your skin is...

621
01:07:57,531 --> 01:08:00,242
It's so soft.

622
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:03,704
Honey.

623
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:07,749
I love you. I love you.

624
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,836
Angela, you know that, right?

625
01:08:29,646 --> 01:08:30,689
Hello.

626
01:08:31,231 --> 01:08:33,400
Shit, shit. I'm here. Hello.

627
01:08:33,483 --> 01:08:36,194
Can you hear me?

628
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,451
It's ok.

629
01:09:09,144 --> 01:09:11,897
Hello, officer. Can I help you?

630
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,108
Can you open up the gate, please?

631
01:09:16,693 --> 01:09:19,696
Yes, sir. I'll be right up.

632
01:09:23,575 --> 01:09:26,703
Sorry. I'm sorry. I have to do this.

633
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:54,856
Hey.

634
01:09:56,483 --> 01:10:00,654
Sorry about that.
I was on the bottom floor doing my rounds.

635
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:08,620
What's going on tonight?
- We got a call of a disturbance...

636
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,331
at this address.
Do you know anything about that?

637
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:17,629
No. It's been real quiet all night.
- See anything, hear anything suspicious?

638
01:10:18,004 --> 01:10:22,551
No. Like I said, I was just doing
my rounds and it's been real quiet.

639
01:10:22,634 --> 01:10:25,929
I haven't seen anybody down here.
- Any cars in there?

640
01:10:26,012 --> 01:10:29,015
Well, it is a parking garage.

641
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:33,812
Well, there's a few cars scattered
over here on this level,

642
01:10:33,895 --> 01:10:37,399
but on the second level,
there's a rental thing and then a...

643
01:10:37,482 --> 01:10:41,236
I mean, like I said, there's been no one
around tonight, except me and Rocky.

644
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:45,407
Two of you working here tonight?
- Yeah, kind of. He's my dog.

645
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:48,785
He's down in the office right now.
- We're going to take a look around, man.

646
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:54,291
Get in the back. We'll give you a ride.
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

647
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,877
Yeah. I've just got to close this gate.

648
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,131
You know, there's a lot
of homeless people around here.

649
01:11:41,421 --> 01:11:43,423
Ok, thanks for the ride.

650
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:46,968
Oh, if you guys want to check out
the other floors,

651
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,721
just keep going around this way,
but be careful on P3.

652
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,766
There's broken water main. Ok?
- We'll come back around.

653
01:11:52,849 --> 01:11:53,892
Ok.

654
01:13:02,168 --> 01:13:04,421
What the hell's going on here, man?

655
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:52,844
Help me! Help! Help!

656
01:14:19,829 --> 01:14:21,831
Help me! Help!

657
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:37,138
Help me!

658
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:41,810
You sure
you haven't seen anything weird tonight?

659
01:14:41,893 --> 01:14:45,647
No. Everybody left really early tonight.

660
01:14:45,855 --> 01:14:50,110
Are you having a party in there?
- It's just me and Rocky. Not a party.

661
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:58,284
Got anybody coming over to visit?
You know, a little action?

662
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:02,288
Me? No, no, no. The company would fire me,
if I had anyone down here in the night.

663
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,541
Especially at this hour.

664
01:15:04,624 --> 01:15:08,586
Yeah, well, we don't want
to break any rules, right, partner?

665
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,590
Not on my watch.
- Come on. Come on. Let's go.

666
01:15:16,219 --> 01:15:17,429
Help me!

667
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:20,682
Help me.

668
01:15:21,224 --> 01:15:25,020
Alright. Well, I've got to open the gate,
so I'll just take the stairs.

669
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:26,271
Let's do it.

670
01:15:46,082 --> 01:15:47,125
Open.

671
01:16:04,517 --> 01:16:06,811
Wait! Wait!

672
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:19,866
You guys stay warm.
- You keep your eyes and ears open. Hm?

673
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:20,992
Oh yeah. You bet.

674
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:28,625
Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, you too, buddy.

675
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:38,885
Wait. Wait!

676
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,116
- 911.
- Yes. Yes, please. I need your help.

677
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:52,495
All of our lines are busy at the moment.
Someone will be with you shortly.

678
01:19:52,578 --> 01:19:55,290
Hello?
- Thank you.

679
01:20:25,778 --> 01:20:28,865
911. All our lines are busy at the moment.
Please hold...

680
01:20:33,369 --> 01:20:36,122
911. All our lines are busy at the moment.

681
01:20:45,256 --> 01:20:46,591
Rock? Rocky!

682
01:20:59,437 --> 01:21:00,563
Why?

683
01:21:01,522 --> 01:21:04,525
Why would you do that?

684
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:08,112
Hm? He's just an animal.

685
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,908
Angela?

686
01:21:12,867 --> 01:21:16,621
Why would you kill a defenseless animal?

687
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:30,134
After all I did for you,

688
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,845
to help you,

689
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:35,640
this is what I get?

690
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,309
You kill my dog?

691
01:21:39,727 --> 01:21:42,522
- Answer. Answer. Please answer.
- Angela!

692
01:21:43,022 --> 01:21:47,110
Please.
- You're really starting to piss me off!

693
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:48,861
Angela.

694
01:22:38,369 --> 01:22:42,999
Hello. Hello. Are you there?
Hello. This is the police.

695
01:22:43,082 --> 01:22:46,002
Is somebody there?

696
01:22:46,085 --> 01:22:49,922
Is this an emergency? If you can hear me,
please say something.

697
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:52,675
Tap the phone.
Let me know if you're there.

698
01:22:52,758 --> 01:22:56,929
Hello. Hello. This is the police.
This is 911.

699
01:22:57,096 --> 01:23:00,266
Are you ok? Are you there? Hello?

700
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:08,774
You're trying to get me fired, aren't you?

701
01:23:10,401 --> 01:23:13,404
I bet you'd really liked that.

702
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:27,418
But...

703
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:31,005
But honey,

704
01:23:31,088 --> 01:23:33,966
what are we going to do then?

705
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:37,803
We couldn't just live off of your salary.

706
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:15,818
Angela.

707
01:25:19,196 --> 01:25:20,489
Angela.

708
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:26,370
Angela.

709
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,650
Shit. Shit.

710
01:26:49,161 --> 01:26:50,204
Shit.

711
01:28:00,691 --> 01:28:04,236
Let's fucking do this. You want to fuck
with me, let's fucking do this.

712
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:08,532
Come on!

713
01:28:19,001 --> 01:28:20,461
Come on, you chicken shit. Come on!

714
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:36,662
Angela.

715
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:41,417
<i>Let me help you out. OK?</i>

716
01:29:55,806 --> 01:30:00,227
You're going to help me? Why don't you
let me help you for a change?

717
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:01,562
Mother fucker.

718
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:39,058
What the fuck are you doing?
- Angela. Come back. You hear? Let me go.

719
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:44,480
Come over here and give me that right now.

720
01:30:45,564 --> 01:30:48,692
Why are you doing this, Angela? Why?

721
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:50,903
Angela.

722
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:57,117
Angela, I just wanted to be friends.

723
01:30:59,244 --> 01:31:01,121
I'm alone.

724
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:03,958
I'm always alone.

725
01:31:07,544 --> 01:31:11,298
Why can't we just
spend more time together?

726
01:31:12,174 --> 01:31:13,217
Angela.

727
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:16,095
Wait. Wait. Why?

728
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:17,554
Why?

729
01:31:18,764 --> 01:31:21,475
Why can't we be friends?

730
01:31:21,558 --> 01:31:25,604
Hm? Why can't we just spend
Christmas together?

731
01:31:26,021 --> 01:31:29,024
Do you hear me? You stupid fucking cunt!

732
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:47,209
Angela, wait. Wait, wait, I didn't...
- Merry Christmas, Thomas.

733
01:31:50,045 --> 01:31:53,632
No. No. No. No. No.

734
01:31:54,633 --> 01:31:58,929
No. No. No. No. No.

735
01:33:54,753 --> 01:33:57,589
You alright, lady?
