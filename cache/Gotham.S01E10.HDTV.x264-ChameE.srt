1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:02,968
<i>Previously on gotham...</i>

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,837
I need to siphon his strength

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,538
So when the time
is right,

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,007
<i>Taking over
his organization will be</i>

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,209
<i>Like slipping on a glove.</i>

6
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,845
<i>The point wasn't
to steal that money, butch.</i>

7
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,613
It was to hurt Falcone.

8
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,348
<i>Bruce: What's her name?
Gordon: Selina kyle.</i>

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,284
<i>Bruce: So, she saw everything?
Gordon: Yes.</i>

10
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,553
Her being here will put
master Bruce in great danger.

11
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,155
She's also
the best chance we have

12
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,623
Of finding who killed my parents.

13
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,493
You are gonna keep
working for fish.

14
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:29,795
You are gonna tell me

15
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,731
Every little thing
that she says.

16
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,401
Dent: Lovecraft, I have an eyewitness
who can tie you to the crime.

17
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,970
You and all the others involved.

18
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,739
So, tell me, dent,
who did I kill?

19
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,041
Thomas and martha wayne.

20
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,820
You lost, miss?

21
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,488
This is wayne manor?

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,991
Yeah, but not sure
you should be here.

23
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:02,094
Point you back to the road
if you're lost. No, thanks.

24
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,163
I am where I
need to be.

25
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,670
Shh...

26
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,877
Open him.

27
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,612
Keep it tight here.

28
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,990
Better?

29
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,926
Better.

30
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,965
If you want
to test yourself,

31
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,200
You should come with me
to the midtown bridge.

32
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,468
You've climbed it?

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,569
Yeah, to the top.

34
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,104
Kids go up there
to make out.

35
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,139
All the time.

36
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,907
I could take you, if you want.

37
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,308
Okay.

38
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,743
I'd like that.

39
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:28,213
Let me ask you a question.

40
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:32,784
What's up with all the weird
homework about your mom and dad?

41
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,621
I'm trying to understand
why it happened.

42
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,222
There's no why.

43
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,824
Bad stuff happens.

44
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,292
You-you got to get over it.

45
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:43,228
Maybe you're right.

46
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,897
Of course I'm right.

47
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,233
You want to kiss me?

48
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,869
No, thank you.

49
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,106
No?

50
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,774
I would like to,

51
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,976
But I can't help feeling
you have an ulterior motive.

52
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,978
I don't imagine
you consider me

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,548
A suitable romantic partner, so
why would you want to kiss me?

54
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,549
I don't know.

55
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,818
You think too much, kid.

56
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,520
I'm just trying to be nice.

57
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:12,691
No offense, you don't
strike me as a nice person.

58
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,926
What do you mean?

59
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:16,028
I'm nice.

60
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,430
I don't mean you're not a good
person, but you're not nice.

61
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:21,667
You don't care much
for other people.

62
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,835
Screw you, orphan.

63
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,005
Climb the damn bridge
on your own.

64
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,246
Yes, hello, miss.
How can I help?

65
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,883
Oh, dear.

66
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,419
My car, it went off the road.

67
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,920
Please...

68
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,890
Please come in.
Come in at once.

69
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,726
If you could call
an ambulance.

70
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,128
Alfred: Where exactly
are you hurt?

71
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,331
Alfred.

72
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,700
Is everything all right?

73
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,101
No, master Bruce.

74
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,604
This lady's been involved
in a car accident.

75
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,908
Run. Run!

76
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,526
This better be a way out.

77
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,228
The old servant's hallway,
it's through the closet.

78
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,529
But I need to help Alfred!

79
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,731
There's no time!

80
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,605
Bruce, come on!

81
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:07,606
Alfred might be hurt.

82
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,640
I can't leave him.

83
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,186
He told you to run.

84
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,122
Fine.

85
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,725
Stay, but I'm out.

86
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,000
Bruce!

87
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,061
Gordon: Local pd is
searching the woods,

88
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,930
But so far no sign
of Bruce or Selina.

89
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,265
What can you tell me
about this woman?

90
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,634
Well, she was, uh, early 30s.

91
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,303
A tasty fighter, actually.

92
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,405
Look, mate,
it's just a scratch.

93
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,140
Shove off, will you?

94
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,042
I've got stuff to do.

95
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,545
Look, we've got 50 police in the
woods, even more on the roads.

96
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,581
We need to focus on this woman
and her people.

97
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,049
What can you tell me about her?

98
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,917
They were trained killers.

99
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,919
And your bloody little girl
brought them here.

100
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,154
We don't know that yet.

101
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:29,922
Bullock: Jim.

102
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,558
You must be Alfred pennyworth.

103
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,126
Nice job out there.

104
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,661
Yeah, well,
not nice enough, eh?

105
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,129
This was taken off the dead guy.

106
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,231
Nothing else--
no keys, no I.D., nada.

107
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,900
Now, I know this girl.

108
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,935
She was grabbed
by the child snatchers.

109
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,837
And now she's getting
attacked by assassins

110
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,906
At wayne freaking manor?!

111
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:49,108
What the hell's
going on, compadre?

112
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,142
What, you haven't told him?

113
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:52,111
Told me what?

114
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,613
Selina kyle was in the alley the
night the waynes were murdered.

115
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,615
She saw the
killer's face.

116
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,018
Oh, for pete's sake,
don't do this to me.

117
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,553
Harvey dent in the d.A.'s office
is investigating dick lovecraft.

118
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,256
He thinks that lovecraft is
connected to the wayne killings.

119
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,392
So, he leaked
that we had a witness.

120
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:08,494
He thought he could
spook lovecraft.

121
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,595
Get him to
reveal himself.

122
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,863
Wow, that's
a hell of a plan.

123
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,231
How did it work out? Bravo!

124
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,899
We thought she was safe.

125
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,567
We thought no one knew
she was here.

126
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,937
Yeah, well, you were wrong,
weren't you, you plank?

127
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,406
How did they know?

128
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,508
Why didn't you tell me
about this foolishness?

129
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,543
Because you would have
tried to stop me.

130
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,011
Of course I would tried
to stop you, you putz!

131
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,413
What the hell are you thinking?

132
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:29,615
The wayne case is closed.
It is closed!

133
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,850
You know damn well
it's not closed!
Don't tell me what I know!

134
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,186
Will you shut up,
the pair of ya!

135
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,689
You can argue later!

136
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:40,526
Right now, we need
to find master Bruce.

137
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,928
All right.

138
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,263
If they don't come back soon,

139
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:45,597
They would have
headed to gotham.

140
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,066
Selina feels safe there.

141
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,734
Bullock: Good luck trying
to find her in the city.

142
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,102
A street kid like that?

143
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:52,538
But you will help us
find her, right?

144
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,039
Yeah, of course I will.

145
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,041
Because I have to be crazy.

146
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,277
Thank you.
All right,

147
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,045
I'll focus on lovecraft,
I'll find him, and if he is

148
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,281
Behind this, I'll get him
to call off the contract.

149
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,283
How you gonna do that? I don't know,
I'll think of something.

150
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,018
Run the streets, huh?

151
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,821
Focus on your contacts.
Go to work.

152
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,656
I'm coming with you.

153
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,958
All right.

154
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
You're pretty handy for a valet.

155
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,297
Butler, mate.

156
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,700
I'm the butler.

157
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,840
We need to call Alfred.

158
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,274
You see any phones?

159
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,078
No.

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,813
Perhaps we should go
back to my house.

161
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,682
If the police are there,
we'll know it's safe.

162
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,851
Yeah, right.

163
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,919
The police will
make it safe?

164
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,258
We have to contact
the police at some point.

165
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Someone tried
to kill you.

166
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,262
Me?

167
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,898
Nobody knew
I was there.

168
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,267
It's your house; someone
wants to kill you.

169
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,270
Duh.

170
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,272
Why would anyone want
to kill me?

171
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,342
Must be all that lame
detective work you're doing.

172
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:05,644
Paid off good, huh?

173
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,914
Cheer up.

174
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,749
We're cool.

175
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:11,984
We lost them.

176
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:14,420
I'm worried about Alfred.

177
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:16,021
Relax.

178
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,624
Once I got you safely
hidden in the city,

179
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:21,026
I'll find you a phone.

180
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,595
Thank you.

181
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,597
I appreciate your help.

182
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,599
Hey...

183
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,601
Just trying to be nice.

184
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,697
How did Maroni know
where my money was?

185
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,332
Wha...

186
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:05,969
Well, that's
a very good question.

187
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:09,439
Not to criticize, but you
could have just called me.

188
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:14,377
I'm going to ask you once more.

189
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:18,415
How did Maroni know where
I kept my money? No one knew.

190
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,985
The robbery at the armory.

191
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,987
That wasn't Maroni.

192
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:25,689
I thought we were friends.

193
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,390
We had an understanding.

194
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:31,361
You tell me every move
Maroni makes.

195
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,497
What happened?

196
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,265
When did you turn on me?

197
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,434
Never, don Falcone.

198
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,069
I swear, never.

199
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:43,039
Maroni had nothing to do
with the armory job.

200
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,574
I would know.

201
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,076
I would have told you.

202
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,344
Who was it if not Maroni?

203
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,579
And how did they
know about my money?

204
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:57,988
Thank you, Liza.

205
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,256
Won't be long.

206
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,324
I'll come back.

207
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,929
I asked you a question.

208
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:12,135
Oh, you have a mole, obviously.

209
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,638
Which is not Maroni's forte,
is it?

210
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,606
No, this is someone else.

211
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:17,874
Someone artful.

212
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:20,010
Someone close to you.

213
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,679
I know who you're going to name.

214
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,648
But your hatred of fish
makes me doubt

215
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,116
Anything you say against her.

216
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,552
With respect...

217
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,955
I don't understand why you
still tolerate her existence.

218
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,559
She has proved her
disloyalty a hundred times.

219
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,160
She wants your head.

220
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:39,996
Like half the people
who work for me.

221
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,499
Fish makes me a lot of money.

222
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,067
I can handle fish Mooney,

223
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,169
Or whatever son of a bitch
did this to me.

224
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,072
Tell me how to find the mole.

225
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:52,309
You leave that to me,
don Falcone.

226
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,577
Dirty work.

227
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,745
I'll find your mole for you.

228
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:58,148
Trust me...

229
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,016
He'll belong to fish.

230
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,387
Bring me proof.

231
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,795
I don't get it.

232
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,396
You, gabe?
Not get it?

233
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,499
<i>Quelle suprise.</i>

234
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,969
What, pray, don't you get?

235
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,272
Why not just tell Falcone
the truth?

236
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,741
It was that Liza girl
that betrayed him.

237
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,477
Timing, gabriel.

238
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,412
Timing is everything.

239
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,982
And Liza is a time bomb.

240
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,683
Just...

241
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:36,152
Wait a while.

242
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:38,588
Then watch and learn.

243
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:42,993
Stay there in
case he shows.

244
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,928
Lovecraft isn't at home.
Housekeeper hasn't seen him

245
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,930
Since yesterday.
Allen says he didn't

246
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,698
Come into his office.
He and montoya are watching it.

247
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,433
How did the killers know
where to find my witness?

248
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,435
Let's keep calm here.
It's a win.

249
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,371
We've made
lovecraft panic.

250
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,106
This is a panic move.
A win?!

251
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,540
There's two children
out there with

252
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,509
Professional assassins
coming after them.

253
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:01,077
Bruce and Selina
could end up dead.

254
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,712
We're gonna get lovecraft
to call them off.

255
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,282
How did they know?

256
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,517
I never told you
her name,

257
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,119
Let alone
where she was hiding,

258
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,288
So you couldn't have...
I should say not.

259
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:13,957
And you never mentioned my name

260
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,258
To anyone, right?

261
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,626
No, we agreed.

262
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,028
I didn't mention
any names out loud.

263
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,797
No names "out loud"?

264
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:23,900
What about whispering?

265
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:25,435
Don't hold out on me.

266
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,103
I'll know.

267
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:30,974
For deep background,
I leaked your name

268
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,042
To a couple of
select sources.

269
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,276
I had to, for
credibility!

270
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,611
You're the wayne
murders cop.

271
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,646
Damn it!
That's how they got to her.

272
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:39,749
I'm surprised it took them
this long to find her.

273
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,251
This is on you, dent!
Whoa.

274
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,419
I'll stipulate mea culpa.

275
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,087
Kick my ass, be my guest.

276
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,955
But let's find
lovecraft first

277
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,058
And get him
to call off the killers.

278
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,061
He's not at home,
he's not at his office.

279
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,395
He could've left gotham.

280
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:53,963
Someone could be hiding him.
Lovecraft...

281
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:56,299
Has got a couple of condos

282
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,535
That he keeps under
his mistress's name.

283
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,404
One up in stevensburgh
and one, uh, uptown.

284
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:04,074
I'll take the one uptown.

285
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,810
If anything's happened
to these kids...

286
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,653
Bullock: We know
you ran with a girl

287
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,021
Called cat.

288
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,422
She's in serious danger.

289
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:20,824
Who isn't, right?

290
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,225
Crazy world.

291
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:24,728
How much?

292
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,334
There's $100.

293
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,072
All right, listen.

294
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,074
I don't know where
cat lives, all right?

295
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:39,542
She's... Private

296
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:41,678
About stuff
like that.

297
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,246
But... I heard that
she got a new fence,

298
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:44,381
'cause her old one got popped.

299
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,782
He'd know where
to find her.

300
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,050
Who's the fence?

301
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,685
I don't know.

302
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,353
But I know who would know.

303
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,655
Oh, yeah? Who's that?!

304
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:57,627
Damn it, Alfred,
save your cheese!

305
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,195
I can beat the truth
out of this kid

306
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:00,497
With a roll of quarters!

307
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,198
Yo, ask fish Mooney.

308
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,700
She runs

309
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,268
All the fences.

310
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,114
Forgive me for shocking you,

311
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:21,451
But let me give you
some context here.

312
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,486
I loved bannion.

313
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,622
We came up
together.

314
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:29,359
But he was supposed to guard
the armory, and he didn't.

315
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,128
And maybe, just maybe,

316
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,464
He looked the other way.

317
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,266
I don't know.

318
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,836
So what do I do?

319
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,137
Let it lie?

320
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,372
Boss, we understand...

321
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,640
Falcone:
Whoever else was involved

322
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,743
Will very soon wish

323
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,846
They could die quickly,
like bannion.

324
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,414
In the meantime,

325
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:56,052
All of us must do what's right
for the family.

326
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:59,122
Each of your tariffs
will increase 25%

327
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,558
Until we've built
the reserves again.

328
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,993
No disrespect, that's high.

329
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:07,764
A little bit.

330
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,666
What do you think, fish?
Am I being fair?

331
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:13,403
We're family.

332
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,272
We sink or swim together.

333
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:18,308
Falcone: You could
all learn from fish.

334
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,243
She trusts me.

335
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,479
Trust me, and I'll trust you.

336
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,514
It goes both ways.

337
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:27,584
Let's eat.

338
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,334
<i>Bruce:
There's a phone!</i>

339
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,402
Come on!

340
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:51,007
I don't...
I don't carry coins.

341
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,609
Do you have
any coins?

342
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,843
nope.

343
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,012
Not a dime.

344
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,380
Why does Alfred matter
so much to you anyway?

345
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,381
He's just your butler.

346
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,183
He's my family.

347
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:12,595
Good luck, kid.
See you around maybe.

348
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:13,763
What?

349
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,031
Wait!
Look...

350
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,267
Those bad guys
were there for me.

351
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,102
Not you.

352
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,070
You have nothing to worry about.

353
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,305
Go home.

354
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,640
But you said...

355
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,108
I was just trying
to freak you out.

356
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,477
I was playing with you.

357
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,380
You were playing with me?

358
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,048
That's kind of cruel, isn't it?

359
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,049
Yeah.

360
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,284
No, look,

361
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,752
You're right about me.

362
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:36,986
I'm not nice.

363
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:39,155
Not like you.

364
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:40,623
You got a nice way about you.

365
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,059
"a nice way"?
Yeah. That's why

366
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,894
I said that thing about
you being the target,

367
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,231
So, you know, we could hang out
a while longer.

368
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,970
I see.

369
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,805
It's very convoluted reasoning.

370
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:58,207
Whatever.

371
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,976
Anyhow, it's been cool.

372
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,078
I'm gonna disappear.
But you can't do that!

373
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,680
I wasn't asking.
You can't disappear!

374
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,048
You have to come
back home with me.

375
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,350
When detective Gordon
finds the man

376
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,519
Who killed my parents,
you have to testify.

377
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:13,156
You really think that
was ever going to happen?

378
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,626
Grow up, b.

379
00:18:53,597 --> 00:18:55,932
No, don't!
You won't make it!

380
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,250
Help.

381
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,056
You're crazy.

382
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,324
Please don't run off again.

383
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,492
I'm out of breath.

384
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,628
Okay, kiddo.

385
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,030
You earned it.

386
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,998
You want to hang
with me, that's cool,

387
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,500
But my world, my rules.

388
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,801
You do what I say.

389
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:34,737
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:45,846
Why can't I call Alfred

391
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,548
Or detective Gordon
to let them know I'm okay?

392
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,816
Because we're disappearing.

393
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:51,285
You got to be like smoke.

394
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:55,656
Smoke doesn't
make phone calls.

395
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:05,733
What is this place?
The flea.

396
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,201
It's like the mall
for street kids,

397
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,502
Without the
crappy music.

398
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:10,571
We'll be safe
here till dark.

399
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:19,680
Falcone's making me nervous.

400
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:22,016
If he suspects it was us
who blew up his money,

401
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:23,784
Why hasn't he made a move?

402
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,586
'cause he can't be sure.

403
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:28,222
There are ten other people
who could have done this.

404
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:30,257
So what now?

405
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,226
You're going to stick
to the plan.

406
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:34,195
You're gonna reach out
to Saviano and Turski.

407
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:35,763
They are both very angry

408
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:37,465
That their taxes
have been raised,

409
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:40,134
And they're worried
about ending up like bannion.

410
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:42,470
They're ready.
The old man

411
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:44,038
Is herding his sheep toward me.

412
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,740
You got it, boss.

413
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:48,909
All right.

414
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:58,152
Hello, gentlemen.

415
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:02,289
Busy day, harvey.
Come back next year.

416
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,791
Bullock:
Hand to god, butch,

417
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:06,494
I'll be quicker than
a sailor on shore leave.

418
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:07,895
Thief we're tracking down.

419
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:09,530
Look familiar? Goes by "cat."

420
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:10,664
Nope.

421
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,999
Bullock:
Maybe fish knows her.

422
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,400
Gilzean:
Fish knows everyone.

423
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:14,535
Fish is busy.

424
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:15,536
She works with one of

425
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:16,637
Your fences, a new guy.

426
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,205
What's a fence?

427
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,141
Come on, butch. Be nice.

428
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:21,642
This is important.

429
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:22,676
Where's fish?

430
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:25,312
I told you, she's busy.

431
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:26,747
I once knew a fella

432
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:28,048
Called butch.

433
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,851
Yeah, he was a whitechapel lad.

434
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:33,487
Now, we called him butch,
you see, 'cause he wasn't.

435
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:35,422
It was a wind-up.

436
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,258
It was like
a joke name.

437
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,326
In fact, he was a horrible
little toe rag.

438
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:40,661
Gilzean: What?

439
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:42,596
I can't tell. Are-are you...
Are you threatening me?

440
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:44,098
Is he threatening me?

441
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:48,068
Yeah?

442
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,670
You can't...

443
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:51,138
Now...

444
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,841
Where is this fish?

445
00:21:54,743 --> 00:21:56,010
Right here.

446
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:00,915
So... What's the fuss?

447
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:03,484
They're just fooling around.

448
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:06,520
We're looking
for this girl,

449
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:10,191
A street thief, goes by cat,
works with one of your fences.

450
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:12,993
Looks familiar.
What's the urgency?

451
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,929
Professional killers
are looking for her.

452
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:16,697
Professionals, huh?

453
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:19,200
This wouldn't be the lovecraft
witness, now would it?

454
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:20,868
How'd you know?

455
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,436
Streets talk.

456
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:24,638
Using her to scare lovecraft.

457
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,440
She saw the waynes' killer,

458
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:27,875
Supposedly.

459
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:28,843
Yeah.
Mm...

460
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,313
And you're here
because you want me

461
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:34,882
To help you find her,
don't you?

462
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:36,183
Yes.

463
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:37,718
Harvey...

464
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:41,355
Why in the world

465
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:43,290
Would I help you
find her,

466
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:45,125
Of all people?

467
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:48,162
She has Bruce Wayne
with her, miss.

468
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:49,930
Really?

469
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:52,199
Yes, miss.

470
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:55,469
I'm Alfred pennyworth.
I'm the boy's legal guardian.

471
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:57,872
Very pleased to meet you.
Likewise.

472
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,273
Miss Mooney, we need your help.

473
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:00,307
Well, you see, Alfred,

474
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:01,976
I would love to help you,

475
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:04,612
But it would infringe
upon my personal interests.

476
00:23:04,614 --> 00:23:06,614
And why would I do that?

477
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:11,151
You have a very
eloquent... Gaze,

478
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:12,887
If I may say so, miss Mooney.

479
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:16,824
And I can see that you're
not a woman that would

480
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:21,996
Let petty self-interest
outweigh... Honor.

481
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:24,231
And compassion.

482
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:30,838
I'll make some calls.

483
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,075
But remember this kindness.

484
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:44,685
Much better.

485
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:47,421
Really?

486
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:48,989
I'm not sure.

487
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:50,424
You look badass.

488
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:52,059
No lie.

489
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:54,595
Ivy: Hey, cat.

490
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:56,330
Ivy...

491
00:23:56,332 --> 00:23:58,032
What are you doing here?

492
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:00,234
What have you been up to?
I thought...

493
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:02,069
Yeah, juvie caught me.

494
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,404
I got adopted upstate.

495
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:04,438
Didn't take?

496
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,873
Good people--
they wanted me

497
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,908
To cut my hair, dress nice.

498
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,677
I know you.

499
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,845
You're mario pepper's daughter.

500
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:13,681
Yes. Who are you?

501
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:16,417
I'm Bruce wayne.

502
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:19,353
Ivy:
Yes, you are.

503
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:20,721
Billionaire Bruce wayne.

504
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:22,723
Stay cool now, Ivy.

505
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,725
I am cool. Why are
you telling me that?

506
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:25,859
Why are you telling me
what to do?

507
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:27,528
I'm not.
I'm just saying,

508
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,229
I don't want you
to get mad at him.

509
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:30,631
He's a friend.

510
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:31,732
Why would I get mad at him?

511
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:32,766
It's not his fault, is it?

512
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,969
Did you kill my father?

513
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:36,537
Do you make my mother
cut her wrists?

514
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,038
No.

515
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,140
Ivy: Somebody did--
somebody did,

516
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:41,442
But not him.

517
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:43,444
How you doing?
You doing okay?

518
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:46,146
I'm okay. And you?

519
00:24:46,148 --> 00:24:48,382
I'm doing great.
How do I look?

520
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:51,685
You look good.

521
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:52,853
Have you seen
clyde the fence around?

522
00:24:52,855 --> 00:24:54,154
Yeah, he's working

523
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:56,323
Out of the factory
on the narrows.

524
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:57,458
He's cute, isn't he?

525
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,393
Yes, he is.
Uh, thanks, Ivy.

526
00:24:59,395 --> 00:25:02,296
Good to see you. Uh, we got
to go run and see Clyde.

527
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:05,199
Oh. Okay, fine.
Bye, then.

528
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:06,900
Keep moving.

529
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:08,869
She's just
a little girl.

530
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:10,471
Why are you
so scared of her?

531
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:12,539
Because she's scary.
Don't look back.

532
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:40,934
Gcpd!

533
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:42,636
Drop it.

534
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:46,640
Kick it over.

535
00:25:51,646 --> 00:25:54,848
You're under arrest.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

536
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,017
Murder? Me, murder?

537
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:58,085
Look, what are you
talking about?

538
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:00,121
You put a hit out
on selina kyle.

539
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:01,789
No, not me.

540
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:04,292
The same people that came after
her came after me, too.

541
00:26:04,294 --> 00:26:06,460
Th-they attacked me
on the street.

542
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:07,795
Why do you think
I'm hiding in here?

543
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:09,196
Why would they come after you?

544
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:10,197
Why do they ever come?

545
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,666
Because I know too much.

546
00:26:11,668 --> 00:26:14,535
Cut the crap.
Who are you so scared of?

547
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:16,103
You have no idea, do you?

548
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:17,672
You think I'm
the big wheel.

549
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:19,273
When it comes
to the crunch, kid,

550
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:22,376
I'm nobody, just like you.

551
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:24,178
A-and the people

552
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,147
Who really, truly run this city,

553
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:28,049
They're watching you huff and
puff and run around crusading,

554
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:29,550
And they are laughing at you.

555
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:30,885
You're so deep in the maze,

556
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:32,653
You can't see
over the wall.

557
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:34,522
Tell me something I don't know.

558
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:37,058
My briefcase, under the bed.
Files.

559
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,193
Go.

560
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:43,030
Right before the waynes
got killed,

561
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:45,566
There was a run on wayne
enterprises stock.

562
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:47,868
Like somebody knew something
bad was gonna happen.

563
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,137
So I figured
I deserved a cut.

564
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,039
So I started digging.

565
00:27:07,456 --> 00:27:09,757
I've come for that man.

566
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,193
You need not get hurt.

567
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:56,437
Mm... That was nice.

568
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,906
Let's do it again sometime.

569
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:21,360
Yeah?

570
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:23,128
Fish got a lead
on the kids,

571
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,364
At a place on the narrows
called the factory.

572
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:27,433
Word is, cat used
a fence named clyde.

573
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:29,702
He hangs there.
We're on our way now.

574
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:32,471
Alfred, let's go.

575
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:34,406
Fish, thank you.

576
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,041
You owe me.

577
00:28:36,043 --> 00:28:38,644
Who don't I owe?

578
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:42,214
Mr. Lovecraft?

579
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:05,738
No, no, no, no, no.

580
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,473
This is detective Gordon.

581
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:10,275
Badge number 23-16-11.

582
00:29:10,277 --> 00:29:13,000
Reporting body at 1257 antioch.

583
00:29:23,723 --> 00:29:27,292
Cat! My baby!

584
00:29:27,294 --> 00:29:30,028
Hey, clyde.
Well...

585
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,530
What have you got for me?

586
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,834
Hey!
Shh!

587
00:29:35,836 --> 00:29:37,970
Wow.

588
00:29:37,972 --> 00:29:40,172
Sweet swag.

589
00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:41,707
Not your usual junk.

590
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:43,442
Selina:
Moving on up.

591
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:48,046
Where'd you get this?

592
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:49,648
You want a story or the swag?

593
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,216
How much?

594
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:52,451
Thousand bucks.

595
00:29:54,355 --> 00:29:57,356
Please.
Give me a break.

596
00:29:57,358 --> 00:29:58,957
That's rock-bottom,
you know it is.

597
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:02,461
Fifty bucks.

598
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:03,462
Fifty?

599
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:05,230
This pen is real gold,

600
00:30:05,232 --> 00:30:06,665
And that's an antique
jade netsuke.

601
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:09,001
It's worth $2,000 on its own.

602
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:13,672
And who is this well-spoken
little... Dude?

603
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:14,973
Never mind
who he is.

604
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:18,010
Look, 500 is rock-bottom.

605
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:19,711
Why are you
wasting my time?

606
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:22,581
Relax.

607
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:25,117
I'm sure we can...
Make a deal.

608
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:31,490
No, thanks.
We'll go elsewhere.

609
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:34,927
Cool down, cat.

610
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:39,665
Or we'll poke your little
friend's eyes out.

611
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,433
That's it.

612
00:30:41,435 --> 00:30:44,236
Relax.

613
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:47,906
I've got some friends
coming over

614
00:30:47,908 --> 00:30:51,376
Who would just love
to meet you.

615
00:32:04,718 --> 00:32:06,152
It's all there.

616
00:32:06,154 --> 00:32:07,820
Don't look so anxious.

617
00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:11,157
Yeah, well, um...
You guys are kind of sporty.

618
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,225
Where is she?

619
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:14,627
She's upstairs.

620
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:16,062
She better be.

621
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:29,208
Find me something heavy.

622
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:50,289
Am I the only one in this damn
town who waits for backup?!

623
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:13,479
Bruce!

624
00:34:17,051 --> 00:34:18,818
Follow!

625
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:33,900
Where's Alfred?

626
00:34:33,902 --> 00:34:35,301
He's in there.

627
00:34:35,303 --> 00:34:37,136
Go!

628
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:06,432
Down!

629
00:35:30,222 --> 00:35:32,623
Where's your girlfriend?

630
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:38,963
I have no idea.

631
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:40,598
Don't make me hurt you.

632
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,299
You're not on the contract.

633
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:47,304
She's gone.

634
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:54,879
Some advice, kid:

635
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:58,149
Don't ever mistake bravery
for good sense.

636
00:36:09,561 --> 00:36:11,195
Alfred.

637
00:36:13,665 --> 00:36:16,433
Fancy seeing you here.

638
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,335
You all right?

639
00:36:18,337 --> 00:36:20,404
I'm fine.

640
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:22,473
How are you?

641
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:32,383
You really scared me,
master Bruce.

642
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:36,854
If you die...

643
00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:38,956
Who employs butlers anymore?

644
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,510
Oh, thank god.

645
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,256
James: Lovecraft was a beloved
pillar of this community.

646
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:15,725
A dedicated servant
of gotham.

647
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:18,461
So, what do I tell
the media, huh?

648
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:19,963
Hmm?!

649
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:21,464
Any ideas?

650
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:23,099
He was a crook.

651
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:24,901
We nearly had him.

652
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:26,936
And he was killed by
whoever he would have implicated

653
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:28,738
If he had lived to testify.

654
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,473
Say that.

655
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:33,643
Forgive me if I can't get
behind your approach.

656
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:34,744
It was your gun.

657
00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:36,346
I didn't kill him.

658
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:38,248
On balance, I believe you--
on balance.

659
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:41,417
But suicide is much cleaner...

660
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:42,885
It wasn't suicide,
it was murder!

661
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,220
It was suicide!

662
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:45,755
He went mad

663
00:37:45,757 --> 00:37:46,889
Under your relentless
questioning,

664
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:48,424
Overpowered you

665
00:37:48,426 --> 00:37:50,660
And killed himself
with your gun.

666
00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:52,895
And don't tell me otherwise.

667
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:58,167
What do you say, counselor?

668
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,841
I'm at your disposal,
mayor james.

669
00:38:04,843 --> 00:38:07,443
I'm sorry if we've
caused you any disquiet.

670
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:10,113
"disquiet."

671
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:12,348
You arrogant clowns.

672
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:17,253
You're hacking away at the very
foundations of this city.

673
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:19,922
Trying to take me down!

674
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:21,958
Should have the both of you
stuffed in a sack

675
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,660
And thrown in the river.

676
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:28,364
But I can't do that.

677
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:30,767
Two scapegoats would
look like panic.

678
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,136
But one of you is going down,
mark my words.

679
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:34,504
Sir, that's not right.

680
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:36,706
Hush.

681
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,474
It's not you, dent.

682
00:38:38,476 --> 00:38:42,145
Obviously, it's
mr. Gordon.

683
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:43,379
Sir, I protest.

684
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:44,781
But not too much.

685
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:47,283
You see, counselor Dent

686
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:50,386
Knows how to walk the line.

687
00:38:52,189 --> 00:38:53,723
He knows where the edge is.

688
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,226
You, mr. Gordon,

689
00:38:57,228 --> 00:39:00,029
Do not know where the edge is.

690
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,771
Mayor James.

691
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:13,976
Kiss my ass.

692
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:25,755
Dick lovecraft's suicide is
a terrible, terrible tragedy.

693
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:28,224
Fighting the trumped-up charges

694
00:39:28,226 --> 00:39:31,961
Of an overzealous police officer
was too much for him.

695
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:36,666
You have my word, dick.

696
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,735
This officer is
being dealt with.

697
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:42,605
Arkham Asylum?

698
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:44,674
A security guard for nut-jobs?

699
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,376
Criminal nut-jobs, yeah.

700
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:48,378
Are you taking the assignment?

701
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,879
It's that or quit.

702
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:51,013
So quit.

703
00:39:51,015 --> 00:39:52,749
That's what they want me to do.

704
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:56,052
Damn, Jim.

705
00:39:56,054 --> 00:39:57,587
Whoever your next partner is,

706
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:00,089
He or she will be
a lot easier than me.

707
00:40:01,558 --> 00:40:03,393
Ed.

708
00:40:03,395 --> 00:40:06,095
Detective Gordon, I hear you've
been thrown out in disgrace.

709
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:07,096
Is this true?

710
00:40:07,098 --> 00:40:08,364
Yeah, it is.

711
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,733
I'm gonna write a letter
to the boss.

712
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:12,435
You do that.

713
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:14,303
Which boss should I write to?

714
00:40:15,406 --> 00:40:17,240
Forget it, ed.

715
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:19,242
That's the breaks, huh?

716
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:20,309
You take care.

717
00:40:27,418 --> 00:40:29,252
Maybe you should
take him with you.

718
00:40:29,254 --> 00:40:31,053
You'd miss him if he was gone.

719
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:33,322
No, I wouldn't.

720
00:40:33,324 --> 00:40:35,224
Let me buy you a drink sometime.

721
00:40:38,195 --> 00:40:39,595
Soon.

722
00:41:00,184 --> 00:41:02,718
Selina:
Your security still sucks.

723
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,590
No one's hunting for me.

724
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,562
I didn't expect
to see you again.

725
00:41:12,564 --> 00:41:15,097
Never said good-bye.

726
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:17,500
No, we didn't.

727
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:19,902
Didn't want to be rude.

728
00:41:21,872 --> 00:41:23,539
It-it's good to see you.

729
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,341
Here.

730
00:41:42,526 --> 00:41:45,328
Thank you,
but you could keep this.

731
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,863
You need it
more than I do.

732
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:50,666
Nah, let's keep things
honest between us.

733
00:41:50,668 --> 00:41:53,202
I'm keeping this one anyway.

734
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:12,755
Having a little chat,
master Bruce?

735
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:16,826
Thinking out loud.

736
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:18,661
Right.

737
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:19,896
Right.

738
00:42:19,898 --> 00:42:22,198
Of course you were.

739
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:31,307
Shall I take that for you?

740
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:41,884
The old house
seems very quiet...

741
00:42:41,886 --> 00:42:43,386
Without her, doesn't it?

742
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:45,855
Yes, it does.

743
00:43:18,502 --> 00:43:24,570
