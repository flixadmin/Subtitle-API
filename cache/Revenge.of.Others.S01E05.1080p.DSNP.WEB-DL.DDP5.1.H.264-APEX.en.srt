1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,086
- That was Park Wonseok, right?
- You mean in the video?

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,462
Does that mean he was killed
and that he didn't kill himself?

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,089
- Right.
- Who did that?

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,799
I could've sworn I saw
somebody kicking him out of the window.

5
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,342
I don't feel safe in this school anymore.

6
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,029
Seok Jaebum?

7
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,323
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,159
Uh, I...

9
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,246
Actually, I...

10
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,664
Seok Jaebum, was it you?

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,332
Are you the one who left the note for me?

12
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,417
Note?

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,880
Oh, right. You're here
because you received a note too, right?

14
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,506
Uh...

15
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,149
Agh, we should have caught him!

16
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,650
That was probably the guy
who left the note, don't you think?

17
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,403
Definitely. Seriously, who is that guy?

18
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,197
Do you think he would've shown himself
to me if you hadn't been there?

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,617
Ah, sorry, that might've been the case.

20
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,285
Sorry, I ruined it for you.

21
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,369
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

22
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,580
I was in the athletic field,
ditching class,

23
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,290
when I saw you heading
into the shooting range alone.

24
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,000
That reminded me
of the auditorium incident

25
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,002
when you got attacked,
so I followed you in.

26
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,462
I guess I should thank you.

27
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,547
Do you think

28
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,299
that's the same guy
from the auditorium incident?

29
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,842
Maybe it's someone else?

30
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,220
Why do you say that?

31
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,763
Huh?

32
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,891
Oh, it's just...

33
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,643
It's just a hunch that I'm having.

34
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,277
SOUNDS FROM YOUR HEART

35
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,954
Ok Chanmi.

36
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,539
I'd like to apologize.

37
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,876
I should've investigated this
as a homicide case from the beginning.

38
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,628
I'm sorry it took us so long
to come around.

39
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,296
You need to find the cell phone.

40
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,715
My older brother's cell phone.

41
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,717
We'll look into it.

42
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,344
In the meantime, do you know of anyone

43
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,054
who might've been on bad terms
with your older brother?

44
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,305
No.

45
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,307
You transferred to this school
on purpose all the way from Busan.

46
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,268
Is there anything
you've managed to piece together so far?

47
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,103
Are you...

48
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,731
asking me if I know
who the perpetrator is?

49
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,359
Now? Three months after he was killed?

50
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,610
Now, after all the evidence
has disappeared and the murderer's

51
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,487
had plenty of time
to hide whatever's remaining?

52
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,656
I understand you're feeling frustrated
as a family member of the victim.

53
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,992
But your attitude is not going to help
this investigation. Wouldn't you agree?

54
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,743
I mean, what I'm asking is...

55
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,453
Chanmi.

56
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,456
You said you noticed someone
coming towards your brother

57
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,458
when you were on that video call
with him, correct?

58
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,253
Yes, I did.

59
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,212
<i>Hey, hold on a second.</i>

60
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,715
<i>We stopped talking
because someone came towards my brother.</i>

61
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,884
<i>It seemed like the phone fell
to the ground.</i>

62
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,801
Huh? What the...

63
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,179
Then someone picked up the phone.

64
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,763
I couldn't see their face.

65
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,016
It's exactly the same
as what I told you three months ago.

66
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,102
Do you remember your brother's expression

67
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,979
when that person approached him?

68
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,733
Did he seem happy to see them,
or did he not seem to like them?

69
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,822
I didn't really notice anything
in particular.

70
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,286
I called you in here today

71
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,580
mainly because I wanted to apologize.

72
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,167
Um, if you think of anything that
might be useful for the investigation,

73
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,585
feel free to reach out anytime.

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,420
If there's nothing else,
you're free to go.

75
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,255
May I also ask you a question?

76
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,759
The video of my brother falling,

77
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,178
the one that everyone saw
in the auditorium...

78
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,015
Why do you think they chose
to release it now and in this way?

79
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,769
If they had submitted that video
to the police from the beginning,

80
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,812
this case would have been investigated
as a homicide, right?

81
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,565
That's a mystery to us too.

82
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,817
You know that we can't share
any technical details with you, right?

83
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,444
Where was that video taken?

84
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,654
Chanmi,

85
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,530
I want to make this very clear to you.

86
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,282
We will investigate this case
as the police.

87
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,869
Please don't think about investigating
this case on your own.

88
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,708
What's up with you?
Ditching class and all.

89
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,170
We could just talk in the classroom.
Why did you text me to come out?

90
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,672
Osung.

91
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,258
Answer me truthfully.

92
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,552
What's going on?

93
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,013
Did you send Chanmi another note?

94
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,431
No.

95
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,433
You didn't?

96
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,560
I already got what I needed from her
in the auditorium that last time.

97
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,062
What else would I need from her?

98
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,439
I didn't send her another note.

99
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:34,857
Really?

100
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,401
Why do you ask?

101
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,443
Did something happen?

102
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,529
It's nothing.

103
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,863
If you didn't do it, it's fine.

104
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,574
Why are you paying

105
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,951
so much attention to her?

106
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,079
Chanmi's my shooting coach after all.

107
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,474
Hello, Mr. Jo.

108
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,769
Oh! Our dear Ajung!
You're finally back at school.

109
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,938
-How have you been?
-Oh, good, good.

110
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,607
Ajung, how is everything going
with your debut?

111
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,944
-It's going pretty well, thanks to you.
-If you become a superstar one day...

112
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,697
...don't forget about me.

113
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,242
Oh, of course!
How could I ever forget about you, Mr. Jo?

114
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,702
Good, good. You should head to class.

115
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,870
I'll be on my way then.

116
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,954
Hey, Ajung.

117
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,457
You already know which class
you'll be joining, right?

118
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,792
Yes, I do.

119
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,044
-Head on up then.
-Yes.

120
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,628
Aw.

121
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,089
She's finally back at school. My oh my.

122
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,051
Oh.

123
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,012
What did Mr. Jo say to you?

124
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,265
"Ajung, don't forget about me
if you become a superstar one day."

125
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,185
Pft, what the heck?

126
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,569
What the...

127
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,695
Hey, Ajung!

128
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,451
Are you vomiting for real?

129
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,412
Ah...

130
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,122
Hey, are you vomiting for real?

131
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,791
Wow, this is crazy.

132
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,877
I can't believe you're so disgusted by him
that you're actually vomiting.

133
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,592
I was in the same class
as Wonseok last year.

134
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,011
Do you know who might've been
on bad terms with him?

135
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,805
I'm not sure.

136
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,766
Several students told us
that it might've been you.

137
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,060
That's not true.

138
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,187
I wasn't on bad terms with him.

139
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,689
Didn't you guys get into a bloody fight
first semester of last year?

140
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,400
Everyone seemed to know
since it was a big fight.

141
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,443
Yes, we did fight once.

142
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,529
But just because we had a fight
doesn't mean I killed him.

143
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,780
Why did you two fight?

144
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,532
It was early in the first semester
of junior year.

145
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,118
Park Wonseok came to me
and challenged me to fight him.

146
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,078
So I did.

147
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,415
You're the one
who first reported his death.

148
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,292
Why were you in the science lab building

149
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,337
while everyone else was gathered
at the recording studio in the auditorium?

150
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,714
I told the police
all about that last time.

151
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,174
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,177
I transferred here
after the incident occurred.

153
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,304
There's a stray cat that I feed every day.

154
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,724
And that day, I was opening a can
of cat food for her behind that building

155
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,601
when I heard something fall...

156
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,770
Oh, right. That cat.

157
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,189
So after hearing the thud,
you went over there,

158
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,358
and Park Wonseok was already lying there.

159
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,484
Yes.

160
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,403
Was there anyone else nearby?

161
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,030
I don't think so.

162
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,490
I didn't see anyone.

163
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,660
Who do you think
was Park Wonseok's best friend?

164
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,248
I believe it was Gi Osung.

165
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,092
Oh, come have a seat.

166
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,183
So, were there any human rights violation

167
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,518
or anything of the sort
during the police investigation?

168
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,895
No, not at all.

169
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,855
Good.

170
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,064
Stay focused on your studies

171
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,900
even though things
are chaotic here at school.

172
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,401
Yes, Mr. Gu.

173
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,945
Oh, also, why haven't you come by
for academic counseling?

174
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,697
Everyone else has already stopped by!

175
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,032
Oh, I...

176
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,868
Hey. Where do you think
you'll be a year from now?

177
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,663
A college campus,
or a remedial boarding school?

178
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,042
Back in the day, we studied all night
and didn't even go home.

179
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,251
<i>Where will I be...</i>

180
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,129
<i>a year from now?</i>

181
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:36,599
NEUNGHWA LIVING FACILITIES

182
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,063
How are your studies going?

183
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,150
Mom, whenever I come see you,

184
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,195
why don't you have anything else
to ask me about other than my studies?

185
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,572
Of course. You're a high school senior.

186
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,538
Mom, when do you think
you were the happiest?

187
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,502
Hmm, let's see, when was I the happiest...

188
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,383
Maybe it was when you started kindergarten

189
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,262
and your older brother
started elementary school.

190
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,389
What did you like best about that time?

191
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,890
The two of you.

192
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,101
Whenever I looked at the two of you...

193
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,270
...it always pulled at my heartstrings.

194
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,649
Because my kids were starting
new chapters in their lives.

195
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,111
Starting kindergarten
and starting elementary school.

196
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,282
Is raising a child all about

197
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,450
seeing them grow up,

198
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,869
seeing what they end up doing,

199
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,123
and seeing that process repeat
over and over?

200
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,374
Exactly.

201
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,002
My son, you're so smart.

202
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,379
Mom.

203
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,381
Come on,
why are you being like that again?

204
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,134
It's nothing.

205
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,553
It's nothing.

206
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,054
Sooheon.

207
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,141
As your mom...

208
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,892
...I'm frustrated and heartbroken

209
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,604
that we've ended up like this, but...

210
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,440
as long as you're doing okay, Sooheon,

211
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,775
I'll be fine with it.

212
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,819
No matter what,

213
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,279
I just want you to be happy.

214
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,906
Do you understand what I mean,

215
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,992
my son?

216
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,452
Don't worry, Mom.

217
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,998
I'm going to be happy.

218
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,210
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,297
Mom, why are you crying?

220
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,176
Stop with the tears now, huh?

221
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,344
I'm fine.

222
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:04,997
REVENGE OF OTHERS

223
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,845
Sooheon!

224
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,431
Sooheon! Hey!

225
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,858
MMA, KICKBOXING, JIUJITSU,
MUY THAI, LOSING WEIGHT

226
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,318
Here.

227
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,364
Oh.

228
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,742
I just occurred to me
that I should thank you somehow.

229
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,661
You let me stay on the rooftop

230
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,870
even though
it might be inconvenient for you.

231
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,707
Anyway, for a lot of things, okay?

232
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,418
Drink this. Drink it up.

233
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,128
-Oh, should I open it for you?
-Chanmi.

234
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,547
-What is it you want to say?
-Huh?

235
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,843
It's about my brother.

236
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,471
I received a message
from my brother's adopted family.

237
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,850
They said I can come by
to pick up his things if I want to.

238
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,310
They haven't given you
any of his stuff until now?

239
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,813
I think they're feeling much better now
that they know his death wasn't a suicide.

240
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,523
What do you mean?

241
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,066
I don't really understand it either.

242
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,488
So... what I wanted to ask you was...

243
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,657
Do you think you could come with me

244
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,659
when I go over there
to pick up his things?

245
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,788
I just don't feel like
I can go there alone.

246
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,665
Okay.

247
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,292
I'll go with you.

248
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,710
Thanks.

249
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,503
No problem.

250
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,591
You want to go now?

251
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,051
Yeah, now.

252
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,358
We were very surprised to learn
that someone had killed him.

253
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,068
We're even being investigated.

254
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,112
Well, at least now

255
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,698
we know he didn't commit
the grave sin of committing suicide.

256
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,159
So, Wonseok's soul
will be saved after all.

257
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,118
Amen.

258
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,412
By the way,

259
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,999
how did you know from the beginning
that he didn't commit suicide?

260
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,709
They're twins.

261
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,836
Don't twins have some sort of
spiritual connection or something?

262
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,047
Anyways, I'm just relieved
that it wasn't a suicide.

263
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,925
Is this his stuff?

264
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,971
We already took care of his clothes,
shoes, books, et cetera.

265
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,723
So this is the only thing that's left.

266
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,393
But it's locked,
so we have no idea what's inside.

267
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,438
It made us feel uneasy.
Not being able to get rid of it.

268
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,233
Now that it's in the hands
of his younger sister, it's all good.

269
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,401
I'll be off then.

270
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,281
You guys were the ones who killed Wonseok.

271
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,661
What? You're relieved
that it wasn't a suicide?

272
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,413
How could anyone stand to live
with a family like this?

273
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,582
He must've already been dead inside.

274
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,043
How could you
even call yourselves parents?

275
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,963
-Your child died!
-My god.

276
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,882
-How dare you, you little punk!
-Just stop, Sooheon. Let's go.

277
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,844
Shouldn't you be eager to find out
who killed your own child?

278
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,848
Shouldn't you want to see the face
of the person who killed your own child?

279
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,184
Even his younger sister is going through
all kinds of trouble to find the murderer!

280
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,978
Seriously, how can
you call yourselves parents?

281
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,062
Huh?!

282
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,272
Sooheon!

283
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,441
Let's just leave.

284
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,569
Please.

285
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,224
Do you know the passcode?

286
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,979
Should I bring some tools?

287
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,898
If it's not the passcode
that I think it is,

288
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,399
then let's break it open.

289
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,942
In that case, I'll bring the tools anyway.

290
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,986
My brother and I...

291
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,364
were abandoned on April Fool's Day.

292
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,909
During the Cherry Blossom Festival
at Jinhae.

293
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,454
We had always hoped that

294
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,917
what had happened to us
was just an April Fool's Day joke.

295
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,463
So the password my brother and I
always used was...

296
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,049
0401.

297
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,303
Since this passcode is only 3 digits...

298
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,072
It worked!

299
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,999
Wow.

300
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,928
He won this when he was in middle school.

301
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,014
Wow.

302
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,020
We took this when we were
at the orphanage.

303
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,488
And this is the pistol I gave him.

304
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,327
These I bought every time I saw a star.

305
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,371
I gave these to him for his birthday.

306
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,791
It was his dream to study
in a military academy

307
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,001
and become a general one day.

308
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,378
Huh?

309
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,424
And this is...

310
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,802
evidence that he had secretly
been drinking alone?

311
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,387
But why whiskey?

312
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,264
I heard it's easier to buy
a bottle of whiskey

313
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,890
than it is to buy a bottle of soju.

314
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,475
You can always pretend
you're buying it as a gift.

315
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,269
Oh...

316
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,198
Sooheon.

317
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,075
Have you ever drunk before?

318
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,744
I know you probably won't believe me,

319
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,704
but no.

320
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,873
Believe it or not,
I've never had it before either.

321
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,458
Do you...

322
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,377
want to drink this together?

323
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,505
Cheers!

324
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,817
-Here, let me pour you another round.
-Again?

325
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,910
Ah, my brother was a real punk.

326
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,788
A high schooler secretly drinking whiskey.

327
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,039
He must've been going through a lot.

328
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,124
If people drank
every time things got tough for them,

329
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,335
every teenager in Korea
would be an alcoholic.

330
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,504
He must've been struggling.

331
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,631
You don't have to comfort me.

332
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,427
I already know he was a terrible person
and had a bad reputation as well.

333
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,012
I liked Wonseok though.

334
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,139
He was loyal

335
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,933
and manly.

336
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,518
Stop.

337
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,728
I don't need you to make me feel better.

338
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,026
<i>It just makes me wonder...</i>

339
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,906
<i>Is that about all
that's left of someone after death?</i>

340
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,412
What do you think

341
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,541
you'll be doing a year from now?

342
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,668
If nothing special happens to me,

343
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,629
I think I'll be a soldier by then.

344
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,339
A soldier? Just like Wonseok wanted?

345
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,133
Yeah.

346
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,224
I heard that being a parent is all about

347
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,561
seeing your child grow up,

348
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,230
then seeing what they end up doing,

349
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,860
and seeing what they do after that.

350
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,411
I'm gonna go to the restroom real quick.

351
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,846
You should get to school earlier.

352
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,391
And don't drink anymore.

353
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,685
It sucks to see someone cry
when they're drunk.

354
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,229
What's with you? That's the first thing
you say when you see me?

355
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,189
It seems Hong Ajung is back at school.

356
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,649
Can you tell her I want to see her?

357
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,500
I heard you and Park Wonseok were close.

358
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,377
And that you were
in some shooting club together.

359
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,672
But you do realize
your story lacks credibility, right?

360
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,090
What do you mean?

361
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,759
He told you I was his girlfriend?

362
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,761
When you were living all the way in Busan?

363
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,638
Yeah, um...

364
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,057
That's not true.
I wasn't his girlfriend.

365
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,267
What?

366
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,936
What do you mean?

367
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,398
How could I be his girlfriend
when we've never even kissed?

368
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,525
We were never together.

369
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,068
I have a real boyfriend.

370
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,946
That's why I'm telling you
that your story lacks credibility.

371
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,073
Wonseok lied his ass off to you.

372
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,909
Hold on.

373
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,079
Then, what's this?

374
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,915
Wow, he must've really tried his best
to fool you even showing you this.

375
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,377
I asked him for a favor one day.

376
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,421
I said, "Will you be my fake boyfriend?"

377
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,131
When I asked him, he said, "Okay!"

378
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,468
Well, I needed a fake boyfriend back then.

379
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,429
As you already know,
I was going to join a talent agency.

380
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:32,434
So in any case, Wonseok pretended to be
my boyfriend at school too.

381
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,148
LAST SUMMER

382
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,318
<i>I went to Daebu Island with my girlfriend.</i>

383
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,322
Wow, I can see hearts in your eyes.
You're so in love.

384
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,866
-Hey, hey!
-What else did you do with Hong Ajung?

385
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,287
-It's nothing. Ah, it's nothing.
-What? Show me.

386
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,538
Hey, why are you trying
to keep it to yourself?

387
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,207
-Show me, huh? Show me.
-No, it's nothing. You're making it shake!

388
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,084
-It's not shaking. Just show me! Come on.
-Uh, next time, next time.

389
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,168
Hey, stop, okay?

390
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,087
You...

391
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,089
Didn't you and Wonseok go
to Daebu Island together

392
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,548
and have grilled clams?

393
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,845
I would die if I ate shellfish.

394
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,141
My allergies are so fucking severe
it would kill me.

395
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,769
Jeez, I don't think
I can keep listening to this bullshit.

396
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,814
Was he in a relationship with himself?
Was he a pervert or what?

397
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,234
Hey.

398
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,736
Was that everything
you wanted to know about Wonseok?

399
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,363
Are we done here?

400
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,649
-You're incredible.
-What?

401
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,902
Didn't you already
have two servings of school lunch?

402
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,113
Did you give up on becoming an idol star
and switch to being a mukbang streamer?

403
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,449
Don't you usually prefer
butter and cheese?

404
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,826
You didn't use to like kimchi before...

405
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,371
I'm surprised too.

406
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,998
The mysteries of the human body.

407
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,048
I'm pregnant.

408
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,759
I'm twelve weeks pregnant.

409
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,512
You're crazy.

410
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,057
That wasn't funny at all.

411
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,642
Let's go.

412
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,854
Excuse me, how much is the total?

413
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,439
It's 21,000 Won.

414
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,066
Hey, are you really puking?

415
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,320
Are you being serious?

416
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,322
I'm serious.

417
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,825
Oh, my god!

418
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,703
Ah.

419
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,377
PREGNANCY JOURNAL

420
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,009
I took this at eight weeks.

421
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,260
I'm going for a check-up tomorrow,

422
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,762
and I'll have an ultrasound
since it's been 12 weeks.

423
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,306
-Are you really going to have the baby?
-Of course I will.

424
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,724
I have no other choice.

425
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,101
What about your life?
Does your mom know about this?

426
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,978
By the way, who's the father?

427
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,064
This is my life,
and nothing about that will change.

428
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,398
My mom knows about it too.

429
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,401
Who's the father?
I can't tell you that right now.

430
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,903
You're driving me crazy.

431
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,738
Are you going to keep coming to school?

432
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,697
Well, I came back to school

433
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,783
because it's safer after
the first 12 weeks have passed, but...

434
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,410
I don't think I'll be able to graduate,
don't you think?

435
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,246
I was thinking I'd drop out
after the summer break this year.

436
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,830
I see you're a planner.

437
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,166
What about the father?

438
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,377
Does he also want this baby?
Can he take responsibility for it?

439
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,504
We're going to take care of it together.

440
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,674
I have a close relationship
with the baby's father.

441
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,133
You're ridiculous.

442
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,178
Is there anything we can do to help?

443
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,388
This is my first time
with something like this.

444
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,349
You see? This is why I like Sooheon.

445
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,643
He's got the basics down.

446
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,436
He's really a decent human being.

447
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,398
Sooheon, I'll let you know
when I need help.

448
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,316
Please just keep this a secret.

449
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,568
Soyeon.

450
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,153
You can prepare a wig, some heavy makeup,

451
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,489
and an outfit tomorrow
so that you can pass as my older sister.

452
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,199
You're coming to the clinic
with me tomorrow.

453
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,716
Hold on.

454
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,342
Sejin.

455
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,970
How many hours did you practice yesterday?

456
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:40,056
Oh, yesterday I practiced
for about six hours.

457
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,766
Do you think that's enough?

458
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,561
You won't be able to get into a college
in the US if you don't give it your all.

459
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,398
Here. Don't stop here and slur your bow
to make it sound smooth.

460
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,400
Okay.

461
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,693
Let's try again.

462
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,143
HOW ARE THINGS GOING WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

463
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,061
SIX MONTHS AGO

464
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,020
STOP BEING SO NOSY.

465
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,396
THIS IS THE ONLY THING
THAT BRINGS ME JOY THESE DAYS

466
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,356
STOP BEING SO NOSY?

467
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,398
PLEASE HAVE MERCY ON ME.

468
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,483
COME ON, SEND ME A PHOTO.

469
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,943
CHANKYU

470
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:39,491
THE CAFÉ WE OFTEN VISIT.

471
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,117
OH THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS

472
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,455
DON'T YOU HAVE PICTURES
WITH YOUR FACES IN THEM???

473
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,665
THIS IS HOW
WE ALWAYS TAKE PICTURES.

474
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,727
May I take your order?

475
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,313
Oh, can I have a grapefruit ade?

476
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,272
Oh, also...

477
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,358
By any chance,
do you recognize this person?

478
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,902
Ah, I don't think so.

479
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,114
I recently inherited this café
from my older sister.

480
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,448
Oh.

481
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,533
That's Park Wonseok.

482
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,243
Oh.

483
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,245
Oh, Sejin, do you know that person?

484
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,372
Welcome.

485
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,833
May I take your order?

486
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,051
Ah, I was in the same class
as Wonseok in sophomore year.

487
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,929
Our school's so far from here.

488
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,181
How did you end up
getting a part-time job here?

489
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,310
I take violin lessons over there.
I'm trying to get into a conservatory.

490
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,732
Um, I dropped out of Yongtan High
after finishing my junior year last year.

491
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,484
Oh, you dropped out.

492
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,319
I'm heading for the US next month

493
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,739
because I'm preparing to apply
to colleges in the US.

494
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,991
I see.

495
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,952
By the way,
what brings you all the way here?

496
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,371
-It's pretty far from school.
-Oh...

497
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:14,043
Well, Wonseok and I were in the same club,
so we would message each other often.

498
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,297
I remembered him telling me
that he used to come to this café often.

499
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,509
Seems like you and Wonseok
must have been close.

500
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,886
Especially if you made it a point
to come here yourself.

501
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,431
I also...

502
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,600
still think of Wonseok often.

503
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,854
He used to sit over there.

504
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,357
Since I'm still working here part-time,

505
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,526
I can't help but think of him.

506
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,570
You must have been

507
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,781
really close to Wonseok.

508
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,074
We were close.

509
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,703
He saved my life.

510
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,289
He was really a good person.

511
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,000
He was...

512
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,044
a good person?

513
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,462
Yeah.

514
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,756
Thanks to him,
I was able to stay in school.

515
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:05,011
TWO YEARS AGO, SPRING, SOPHOMORE YEAR

516
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,304
Hey, Sejin!

517
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,894
Bullseye.

518
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,693
Hey, is it true
you have two fathers at home?

519
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,947
Is that right? Or was it two mothers?

520
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,365
Huh?

521
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,700
If you have two male parents,
who's the father and who's the mother?

522
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,578
-Is the one with the beard the dad?
-Crazy bastard.

523
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,831
Shit.

524
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,582
Does something smell gay to you?

525
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,751
Oh, did the gayness rub off on you? Huh?

526
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,337
Oh, it looks like
you have egg on you. Here.

527
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,381
Well...

528
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,633
It's a long story, but...

529
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,679
I was adopted when I was five.

530
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,098
I don't even know
what my biological parents look like.

531
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,267
When I was a junior in 8th grade,
my parents divorced,

532
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,185
and my father came out

533
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,604
as gay.

534
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,651
Um, I do refer to him
as my younger dad, but in any case,

535
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,403
I live with two dads.

536
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,030
Do you understand?

537
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,657
Yeah.

538
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,169
Oh, my Sejin.

539
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,462
You really worked up a sweat, huh?

540
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,214
It's time to take a shower.

541
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,844
Oh, I heard that gay people
wash themselves with milk. Is that true?

542
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,054
Here.

543
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,392
-Hey.
-Shit. Damn.

544
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,895
Ugh, something feels off, doesn't it?

545
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,063
Sejin, should we take our clothes off
so we can wash up properly?

546
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,982
Don't touch me, you fucker.

547
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,984
You fucking bastard,
you have a death wish...

548
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,740
-What are you doing, motherfucker?
-Hey!

549
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,159
Stop fucking around and get lost.

550
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,827
What the fuck is he saying?

551
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,123
Oh, are you guys a couple?

552
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,921
You motherfucker!

553
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,381
Well, shit! Hey!

554
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,216
Who do you think you are? Huh?

555
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,972
Okay, let's see what you got.
You little...

556
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,769
Fuck.

557
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,967
Let's go.

558
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,761
Okay.

559
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,776
<i>The truth is...</i>

560
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,237
there's something I haven't told you.

561
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,616
When I was eight years old,

562
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,493
I was adopted from an orphanage,
just like you.

563
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,329
I also have a twin sister.
She's the younger one.

564
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,331
She's still at the orphanage in Busan.

565
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,375
Oh, I see.

566
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,171
This is my sister, Ok Chanmi.

567
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,008
I'm really jealous
you have a younger sister.

568
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,053
-You're jealous?
-Yeah.

569
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,055
Really.

570
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,558
I think it'd be really cool.

571
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,644
Then let's all hang out together one day.

572
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,941
Sure, sounds good.

573
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,466
MOK JEONGHYEON OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

574
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:29,150
Come to think of it,
I think your boobs have gotten bigger.

575
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,402
Shut up.

576
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,988
Ms. Hong.

577
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,531
Please head to the doctor's office.

578
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,825
MOK JEONGHYEON OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

579
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,119
Excuse me.

580
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,497
-It's our turn.
-It won't take long.

581
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,041
DOCTOR'S OFFICE 1
MOK JEONGHYEON

582
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,340
<i>How have you been?</i>

583
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,008
How have you been feeling?

584
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,307
HEAD DOCTOR MOK JEONGHYEON

585
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,600
Why are you so surprised?

586
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,976
How can you be here?

587
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,937
I don't want to drag this on
for very long.

588
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,315
I heard you sued my parents while I was
in the juvenile detention center.

589
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,691
Drop the lawsuit.

590
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,026
Get out.

591
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,152
Get out right now.

592
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,614
I will, once I have your answer.
Will you drop the lawsuit?

593
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,324
Get out! Get out right now!

594
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,327
Get out before I call the police!
Get out! Get out!

595
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,205
Get out, you demon!

596
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,832
What the heck?

597
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm sorry. Please hold on for a minute.

598
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,004
That's definitely Ju Hyeokgeon.

599
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,257
Huh? Do you know him?

600
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,217
I went to middle school with him.

601
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,969
His name is Ju Hyeokgeon.

602
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,513
There was a huge incident.

603
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,098
Doctor Mok! Please lean back.

604
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,475
Doctor! Doctor!

605
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,352
Jeez, do I have
to make another appointment?

606
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,895
What a mess.

607
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,522
That kid goes into the doctor's office
for a brief moment,

608
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,357
and then the doctor faints,
like what the...

609
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,525
Right.

610
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,360
The victim's mother was a doctor.

611
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,948
Oh, that's right!
The victim's mother was a doctor!

612
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,116
What?

613
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,118
The victim?

614
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,494
ORDER HERE
WE MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY

615
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,122
So, that guy back there
killed the doctor's daughter?

616
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,666
I think it was the second semester
of 8th grade.

617
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,460
Wow, I can't believe
it's already been over two years.

618
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,545
Wow, shit.

619
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,630
Then why is he walking the streets
like nothing happened

620
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,798
when he should be rotting in prison?

621
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,633
A minor never goes to prison.

622
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,843
A minor?

623
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,094
Damn.

624
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,722
The victim was stabbed to death.

625
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,015
Brutally.

626
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,141
So you mean...

627
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,268
the doctor's daughter

628
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,146
was murdered like that
when she was in middle school?

629
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,647
I think he was put on probation
or something,

630
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,317
even after he committed murder,
because he was a minor.

631
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,320
He was in a juvenile detention center
for a while and that was it for him.

632
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,504
So did you say
you're a friend of Sooheon's?

633
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,048
Oh, yes.

634
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,299
I'm the director at this gym.

635
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,842
Hello.

636
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,469
So, you'd like to register
for the beginner class?

637
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,429
Yes.

638
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,472
In that case, there's a promotion

639
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,224
that'll give you
a discount for six months.

640
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,517
That's a great deal for a student
on a budget.

641
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,603
Why don't we fill out a registration card
for the time being?

642
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,231
He can't register, director.

643
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,690
Why not?

644
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,776
He's a senior, so he's gotta study.

645
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,153
If you want to learn,
come after you've graduated.

646
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,242
I'll be right out after a quick shower.
Do you want to wait outside?

647
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,326
Sure.

648
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,746
Ugh, that idiot.

649
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,290
He's ruining things again, seriously.

650
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,541
What did I even like about him

651
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,001
to start training him
in the first place? God.

652
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,795
GOGO STADIUM

653
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,547
MMA, KICKBOXING, JIUJITSU,
MUY THAI, LOSING WEIGHT

654
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,175
Fuck.

655
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,930
Look at him.

656
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,057
Mister.

657
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,645
Are you a minor by any chance?

658
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,398
-I'm an adult.
-Okay.

659
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,565
-What?
-Mister.

660
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,734
Can you do me a favor
and buy me some cigarettes?

661
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,363
You insolent punks.

662
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,117
Get lost, jackass.

663
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,618
Why are you talking to me like that?

664
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,203
Get lost, jackass.

665
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,038
Get lost, jackass.

666
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,958
-Mister, come here, come here.
-Let's go, let's go.

667
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,376
-Hey.
-It won't take long, come on.

668
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,961
Let me go!

669
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,004
Hey!

670
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,673
Hey, that's Ji Sooheon.

671
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,716
-Leave.
-What's he doing here?

672
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,092
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

673
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,053
-Right?
-Damn, these bastards.

674
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,141
Man.

675
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,560
I could've handled them myself.

676
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,438
What are you doing here?

677
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,866
Woo!

678
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,538
Are you having fun?

679
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,550
Woo!

680
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,554
Wow! So nice!

681
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,186
Hey, that was awesome!

682
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,855
You know, you're a great driver!

683
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,106
When did you start driving?

684
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,900
As you already know,
I can't really remember, but...

685
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,693
I heard I started driving here
since sophomore year.

686
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,362
My dad probably hooked me up
or something like that.

687
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,863
My body seems to remember how to drive.

688
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,032
Want to give it a try?

689
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,450
Me?

690
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,369
I don't even have a license,
and I've never driven before.

691
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,620
You drive a motorcycle, don't you?

692
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,538
But this is different, isn't it?

693
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,124
I'll ask if they can clear the track.

694
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,418
If you're the only one driving,
it should be just fine, right?

695
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,137
Okay, slowly lift your foot off.

696
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,390
That's right, good, good.

697
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,600
That's right.
Step on the middle one there.

698
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,768
There you go, left, right.

699
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,770
-Just slightly.
-Yeah.

700
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,355
Not too much pressure, easy.

701
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,066
What?

702
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,859
Nothing, nothing.
I think I'll be fine if I try again.

703
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,820
Yeah, d... don't step
on the break like that.

704
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,821
-Sorry.
-Oh, okay.

705
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,031
-Okay, should we go again?
-Okay, slowly...

706
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,616
You got it, right?
Don't hit the brakes so suddenly.

707
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,660
-Okay.
-Yeah? Now, step on the accelerator.

708
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,161
Good, good, good, good.

709
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,497
You're doing great. Let's go.

710
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,207
There you go!

711
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,751
Good, that's it.
Wow, keep going on like this!

712
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,129
Keep on, keep on, keep on!

713
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,630
That's great!

714
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,891
Hey, what was that?

715
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,435
That was awesome!

716
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,811
You're such a good driver.

717
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,479
Didn't I tell you you'd be a good driver?

718
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,190
It always feels nice
after a good ride like that.

719
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,484
Ah, yeah.
By the way, this car's really fast.

720
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,069
Thanks to you,
I really blew all my stress.

721
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,988
Let's come back again.

722
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:51,365
SHOPPING MALL ENTRANCE

723
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,287
JI SOOHEON
SOOHEON, COME UP TO THE ROOFTOP...

724
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,003
You didn't have to
drive me all the way up here.

725
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,755
-Are you working part-time here?
-Yeah.

726
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,507
You should come bowling sometime.
You know I got you covered.

727
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,885
You really helped me relieve some stress.
Thanks a lot.

728
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,637
Oh, not at all, it was nothing.
Let's go again when we have the chance.

729
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,432
-I'd love to.
-Okay, then. Take care.

730
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,228
Soyeon.

731
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,813
Did something good happen to you?

732
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,815
-You look excited.
-Well, yeah.

733
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,443
-You're not here to bowl, are you?
-Nope.

734
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,613
Oh, um, come up to the rooftop
after your shift.

735
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,864
We need to talk business.

736
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,408
Business?

737
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,911
There's another kid out there
that needs to be taught a lesson.

738
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,608
THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY

739
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,631
YONGTAN HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY

740
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,278
Mother.

741
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,321
Oh, Jaebum, you haven't had dinner, right?

742
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,614
I heard you went to the race track.

743
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,782
Mother.

744
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,577
Did anyone come inside my room
while I was taking a shower?

745
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,786
No.

746
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,705
No one went in there.

747
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,165
There's no one in this house
who would go inside your room.

748
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,001
Why do you ask?

749
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,587
It's nothing. I'll be there soon.

750
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,173
Hurry up, your father will be here soon.

751
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,383
Okay.

752
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,976
<i>I never leave my key here.</i>

753
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,101
Who is that?

754
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,107
A juvenile?

755
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,068
-A juvenile delinquent?
-Yeah.

756
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,694
He's a piece of shit.

757
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,907
6 HOURS AGO

758
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:30,709
How do you know my daughter Eunjin?

759
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,461
Dr. Mok, did Ju Hyeokgeon come

760
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,756
and visit you yesterday?

761
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,675
Who are you?

762
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,593
I've also experienced injustice in my life

763
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,470
just like you.

764
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,182
It was my younger sister.

765
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,726
Juvenile delinquents deserve
to be punished

766
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,229
to the fullest extent of their crimes.

767
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,898
No one who committed a planned,
brutal murder like that

768
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,068
should ever be forgiven.

769
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,870
TWO YEARS AND THREE MONTHS AGO

770
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:31,603
What?

771
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,022
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

772
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,693
Get lost.

773
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,112
Fucking bitch.

774
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,831
You fucking bitch!

775
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,834
You think you're all that, huh?
You arrogant bitch!

776
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,960
Didn't I say I'd kill you?

777
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,714
You thought I wouldn't do it? Fuck you!

778
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,133
Fuck!

779
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,072
<i>He stabbed my Eunjin 20 times</i>

780
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,034
<i>just because she refused
to be his girlfriend.</i>

781
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,912
<i>Because she rejected him
in front of the other students.</i>

782
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,955
Eunjin! Eunjin!

783
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,917
<i>Then, as he threw
the knife on the floor, he said...</i>

784
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,210
Ma'am,
report me to the police if you will.

785
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,712
I'm a minor anyway.

786
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,423
What?

787
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,342
<i>That he wouldn't be punished</i>

788
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,761
<i>because he was a minor.</i>

789
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,018
If you take care of this job,

790
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,687
that'll cover six months
of your mom's bills.

791
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,272
So I have to

792
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,442
make that bastard

793
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,862
kneel and apologize in front
of the mother who lost her daughter?

794
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,283
Let's figure out his route,
then decide when and where we'll do it.

795
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,369
Okay.

796
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,538
Ah, well...

797
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,790
This conversation was much shorter
than I thought it would be.

798
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,502
If you have something to tell me,
don't use your cell phone.

799
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,963
Leave me a note or tell me in person.
Don't forget.

800
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,256
I won't.

801
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,925
-Let's go.
-Oh, wait!

802
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,596
Also, this is something
I wanted to mention, but...

803
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,768
don't you think you were too harsh
on Sa Junggyeong last time?

804
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,729
Yeah.

805
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,731
I wasn't really thinking about it,

806
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,859
but somehow I ended up
going harder than I meant to.

807
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:42,818
I'll be more careful.

808
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,821
Oh, actually,
I'm fine with you punishing them harder.

809
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,199
It's just that if the situation escalates,
we'll have to deal with the police.

810
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,284
Sorry.

811
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,743
I'll be more careful.

812
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,954
I didn't mean like that.

813
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,967
When I lose my focus,

814
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,428
I prefer coffee to an energy drink.

815
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,221
How about you?

816
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,974
You should rest
when you're starting to lose focus, Osung.

817
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,476
The coffee's delicious.

818
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,479
-Huh?
-Hey!

819
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,107
Hey.

820
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,152
-Did you get home okay?
-Of course. What about you?

821
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,653
-Yeah.
-Ji Sooheon.

822
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,196
Do you want a cup of coffee?

823
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,115
Thank you for offering,
but I don't drink coffee.

824
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,327
Hey, Sooheon,
I have something to tell you.

825
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,579
-Hey, Osung, I'm going to head inside.
-What did you want to tell me?

826
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,715
What's this?

827
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,841
2022 PRO BASKETBALL LEAGUE
CHAMPIONS SERIES

828
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,676
Champions series
for pro basketball league?

829
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,097
-Champions series?
-It's in the first row.

830
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,016
Right behind the bench.

831
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,477
Wow, this is amazing.

832
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,606
Are you free tonight?

833
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,524
Me?

834
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,110
Can I really have this precious ticket?

835
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,654
Of course it's for you.

836
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,572
Am I dreaming?

837
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,366
It's tonight. Can you go?

838
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,203
Of course I'm going! Wow, damn.

839
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,789
Is this a VIP ticket?

840
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,123
I got it from someone I know.

841
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,209
I thought you might like basketball.

842
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,211
I'm a huge fan. How did you know?

843
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,963
I saw you playing.

844
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,131
- Don't forget your homework.
- Okay.

845
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,886
Hey, Osung.

846
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,514
I have something to ask you.

847
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,766
What is it?

848
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,312
Do you know who this guy is?

849
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,775
-Why?
-Hey, did you take notes?

850
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,318
- Yeah.
- I didn't take any.

851
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,195
Is this the one? That's so much text.

852
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,030
Why?

853
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,159
That's Park Wonseok.

854
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,954
Park Wonseok?

855
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,832
This guy is Park Wonseok?

856
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,210
LITERATURE

857
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,013
-Ah, welcome.
-How are you doing?

858
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,014
How can I help you today?

859
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,348
Please replace these wheels
with black ones.

860
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,267
-Okay, so, all of them?
-Yes.

861
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,435
Okay, got it.

862
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,562
-Hyeokgeon! Come here.
-Yes?

863
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,898
Go get us some coffee.

864
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,775
-Why don't we head inside?
-Sure.

865
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,451
-Hello.
-Hi.

866
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,119
I'll have two iced americanos, please.

867
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,412
Ah.

868
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,122
It looks like your father
has another customer.

869
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,041
Yes.

870
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,335
Your father must be happy
to have such a good son

871
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,379
who helps him with his business.

872
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,757
Hold on.

873
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,430
There.

874
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,639
Thank you.

875
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,224
Bye.

876
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,159
He's handsome.

877
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,535
Looks like he's the son
of the body shop owner.

878
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,536
Yeah.

879
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,538
I heard he left to study abroad
and then came back

880
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,665
because he struggled to adjust
or something like that.

881
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,583
I see.

882
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,336
It seems like he's chosen to work
with his father.

883
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,379
That's a great choice, really.

884
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,757
If you're going to study,
you've got to excel.

885
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,801
If you're just mediocre,
it won't make much of a difference.

886
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,095
You're right.
It's good to learn practical skills.

887
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,597
He's spending all his time
at the body shop, learning the trade.

888
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,516
He practices even after work
going home late at night.

889
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,560
He's a diligent kid.

890
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:57,906
MMA, KICKBOXING, JIUJITSU,
MUY THAI, LOSING WEIGHT

891
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,950
GOGO STADIUM
MMA CHAMPIONSHIP

892
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,206
Soyeon.

893
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,416
Did anything happen at school
while I was gone?

894
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,210
Wow, you didn't go...

895
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:13,630
I have Ju Hyeokgeon's route.

896
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,341
I think we can do it today.

897
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,552
Today?

898
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,428
Can we do it another day?

899
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,514
Why? Do you have another commitment?

900
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,431
I...

901
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,350
It's just... I have something today.

902
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,978
That bastard Ju Hyeokgeon is going
to be alone at a body shop tonight.

903
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,105
Tomorrow, he'll move to a dorm
to start at a mechanic school.

904
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,274
Today's our last chance.

905
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,776
What kind of appointment is it?

906
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,153
Can you just postpone it?

907
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,573
I'll postpone it.

908
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,325
Let's do it tonight.
I'll go ahead and prepare.

909
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,785
Ah, let me take your cellphone.

910
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,288
I'll wait somewhere far away
from the body shop.

911
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,415
Wait, let me just send
a text message really quickly.

912
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,250
- IT'S ME SOOHEON...
- (

913
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,086
I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO
TO THE GAME TONIGHT.

914
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,005
IT'S AN URGENT MATTER. I'M SO SORRY :(

915
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,967
This is the body shop
where Ju Hyeokgeon will be at.

916
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,886
He'll be there alone
after the business closes for the day.

917
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,097
And here's a transit pass you can use.

918
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,881
The person you dialed cannot be reached...

919
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,382
JI SOOHEON

920
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,078
Dad, is that you?

921
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,463
Who's there?

922
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,168
Ju Hyeokgeon. Nod if you're listening.

923
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:47,177
Ju Hyeokgeon. Nod if you're listening.

924
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,525
You know what with these tools,
I can modify your body like a car.

925
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,737
Do you catch my drift?

926
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:10,408
Nip a bit here, tuck a bit there.

927
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,203
Break this.

928
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,955
Cut that off. Isn't that right?

929
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,336
You brutally murdered Shim Eunjin,
a female classmate,

930
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,463
two years and three months ago.

931
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,884
You should end up just like her,
don't you think?

932
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,553
Maybe I can just stab you twenty times.

933
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,347
Wouldn't that be fair?

934
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,807
Spare me!

935
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,600
Spare you?

936
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,143
Please, spare my life.

937
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,437
I would if you were a minor.

938
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,900
But you aren't one anymore.

939
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,739
Spare my life.

940
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,828
Spare me. Forgive me.

941
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,788
These are words you should say
to Shim Eunjin's mother.

942
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,956
You got me?

943
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,419
This is your last warning.

944
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,254
Apologize to her
from the bottom of your heart.

945
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:08,091
Whether she forgives you or not,
you apologize to her.

946
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,952
As proof of your promise,
I'm going to take a few of your fingers.

947
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:46,004
Please! Spare me!

948
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,722
Please, please! Forgive me!

949
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,199
Did everything go okay last night?

950
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,409
Everything went well.

951
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,204
Okay.

952
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:02,997
Ah!

953
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,712
That bastard

954
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,257
will visit the hospital today
to apologize.

955
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,634
Bastards like that really deserve
to die though.

956
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,762
Good work.

957
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,613
DO NOT CROSS-POLICE LINE
UNDER INVESTIGATION

958
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,616
-What's going on?
-Sir, you're here.

959
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,867
Where? Where is it?

960
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,619
Over there.

961
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,666
What is this mess?

962
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,210
This way.
