Instead of lead. Ice!

46

The murderer pours water
into a .38 caliber mold,

freezes it, and keeps it solid
until the crime.

48

Then he shoots the guy
with the ice bullet.

What people?
I don't know who they are.

01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:54,696

A guy in Washington reads it.

He's my section chief.

He comes to New York
to shoot me.

- No.

No, but the guy
in Washington did.

- I wouldn't be.

If company agents aren't enough,
use freelance.

01:42:43,914 --> 01:42:46,508
What do you do for a living?

1105
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,847
Don't be ridiculous.

1106
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:52,950
What do you do...

1107
01:42:53,023 --> 01:42:55,116
exactly?

1108
01:42:57,027 --> 01:42:59,120
Deputy Director of Operations.

1109
01:43:01,131 --> 01:43:04,294
- What section?
- Middle East.

1110
01:43:07,037 --> 01:43:08,971
What are you working on?

1111
01:43:10,407 --> 01:43:12,807
What are you doing?

1112
01:43:14,545 --> 01:43:18,743
What's the secret worth murdering
everybody at the A.L.H.S. house?

1113
01:43:18,816 --> 01:43:21,979
- There's no secret.
- Wicks showed you my report.

1114
01:43:22,052 --> 01:43:25,021
What report? Yes.

1115
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:33,723
It was your network I turned up.

1116
01:43:35,232 --> 01:43:37,928
Doing what?

1117
01:43:38,001 --> 01:43:40,060
Doing what?

1118
01:43:40,137 --> 01:43:44,073
What does operations care
about a bunch of goddamn books?

1119
01:43:44,141 --> 01:43:47,269
A book in Dutch.

1120
01:43:47,344 --> 01:43:49,278
A book out of Venezuela.

1121
01:43:49,346 --> 01:43:51,678
- Mystery stories in Arabic.
- Wait.

1122
01:43:51,749 --> 01:43:54,684
What the hell
is so important about--

1123
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:02,124
Oil fields.

1124
01:44:05,496 --> 01:44:07,623
Oil.

1125
01:44:19,943 --> 01:44:21,877
That's it, isn't it?

1126
01:44:26,884 --> 01:44:29,819
This whole damn thing
was about oil.

1127
01:44:31,288 --> 01:44:33,222
Wasn't it? Wasn't it?

1128
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:37,389
Yes, it was.

1129
01:44:37,461 --> 01:44:39,395
Don't turn for a moment.

1130
01:44:39,463 --> 01:44:42,830
Put your thumb in front
of the hammer.

1131
01:44:48,405 --> 01:44:50,737
Release it slowly.

1132
01:44:54,211 --> 01:44:57,544
Set down the gun
on the desk.

1133
01:45:02,286 --> 01:45:04,254
And don't move.

1134
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:17,833
Back up.

1135
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,941
You were quite good,
Condor, until this.

1136
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:31,775
This move was predictable.

1137
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:36,685
Hey!

1138
01:45:56,940 --> 01:46:01,172
What? What?

1139
01:46:01,245 --> 01:46:04,373
Did you touch anything
except the chair?

1140
01:46:05,682 --> 01:46:07,741
You're working for
the company again.

1141
01:46:07,818 --> 01:46:10,150
Yes.

1142
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:12,154
I am.

1143
01:46:12,222 --> 01:46:15,658
Jesus. They took you back.

1144
01:46:16,793 --> 01:46:19,591
Just for this. For Atwood.

1145
01:46:21,598 --> 01:46:24,999
How-- Wha--
He's with the company. Why?

1146
01:46:25,068 --> 01:46:27,502
I don't interest myself in why.

1147
01:46:27,571 --> 01:46:30,005
I think more often
in terms of when,

1148
01:46:30,073 --> 01:46:33,474
sometimes where,
always how much.

1149
01:46:35,045 --> 01:46:39,004
I suspect he was about to become
an embarrassment.

1150
01:46:39,082 --> 01:46:41,073
As you are.

1151
01:46:48,959 --> 01:46:50,489
- So you're not finished.
- Pardon?

1152
01:46:50,489 --> 01:46:51,888
- So you're not finished.
- Pardon?

1153
01:46:51,957 --> 01:46:55,893
Oh, no. I have no arrangement
with the company concerning you.

1154
01:46:55,961 --> 01:46:59,658
They didn't know you'd be here.
<i>I</i> knew you'd be here.

1155
01:47:03,969 --> 01:47:06,233
But didn't you send
the mailman?

1156
01:47:06,305 --> 01:47:10,332
That was a business arrangement
with Atwood,

1157
01:47:10,409 --> 01:47:12,343
but you see.

1158
01:47:19,051 --> 01:47:20,985
Come on.

1159
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,692
Come.

1160
01:48:03,629 --> 01:48:05,563
Tell me about the girl.

1161
01:48:09,034 --> 01:48:10,968
What about the girl?

1162
01:48:12,104 --> 01:48:14,834
She was chosen... how?

1163
01:48:14,907 --> 01:48:17,239
By-- By age?

1164
01:48:17,309 --> 01:48:20,210
Her car? Appearance?

1165
01:48:20,279 --> 01:48:24,409
At random. Chance.

1166
01:48:24,483 --> 01:48:26,417
Really.

1167
01:48:29,188 --> 01:48:31,122
Can I drop you?

1168
01:48:33,659 --> 01:48:36,457
[Sigh]

1169
01:48:36,528 --> 01:48:39,463
I'd like to go back
to New York.

1170
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,730
You have not
much future there.

1171
01:48:50,242 --> 01:48:52,176
It will happen this way.

1172
01:48:53,345 --> 01:48:56,246
You may be walking.

1173
01:48:56,315 --> 01:49:00,149
Maybe the first sunny day
of the spring,

1174
01:49:00,219 --> 01:49:03,450
and a car will slow
beside you,

1175
01:49:03,522 --> 01:49:05,456
and the door will open,

1176
01:49:05,524 --> 01:49:08,459
and someone you know,
maybe even trust,

1177
01:49:08,527 --> 01:49:10,893
will get out of the car.

1178
01:49:12,764 --> 01:49:16,291
And he will smile,
a becoming smile.

1179
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:22,370
But he will leave open
the door of the car

1180
01:49:22,441 --> 01:49:25,638
and offer to give you a lift.

1181
01:49:30,649 --> 01:49:33,982
You seem to understand
it all so well.

1182
01:49:36,555 --> 01:49:38,489
What would you suggest?

1183
01:49:38,557 --> 01:49:42,288
Personally, I prefer Europe.

1184
01:49:42,361 --> 01:49:45,057
- Europe?
- Yes.

1185
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:47,496
Well, the fact is,

1186
01:49:47,566 --> 01:49:50,933
what I do is not
a bad occupation.

1187
01:49:51,003 --> 01:49:53,369
Someone is always
willing to pay.

1188
01:49:58,010 --> 01:50:00,501
I would find it...

1189
01:50:00,579 --> 01:50:02,513
tiring.

1190
01:50:02,581 --> 01:50:06,278
Oh, no. It's quite restful.
It's almost peaceful.

1191
01:50:06,351 --> 01:50:10,685
No need to believe
in either side or any side.

1192
01:50:10,756 --> 01:50:13,054
There is no cause.

1193
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:15,150
There's only yourself.

1194
01:50:15,227 --> 01:50:18,025
The belief is in
your own precision.

1195
01:50:24,102 --> 01:50:27,538
I was born in the United States,
Joubert.

1196
01:50:29,141 --> 01:50:32,167
I miss it when
I'm away too long.

1197
01:50:32,244 --> 01:50:34,576
A pity.

1198
01:50:37,049 --> 01:50:38,983
I don't think so.

1199
01:50:40,552 --> 01:50:44,682
Is it any trouble to drop me
at the Union Station?

1200
01:50:44,756 --> 01:50:47,816
Oh, no.
It would be my pleasure.

1201
01:50:56,935 --> 01:50:59,631
For that day.

1202
01:50:59,805 --> 01:51:02,000
[Carolers]
Remember Christ, our Savior

1203
01:51:02,074 --> 01:51:04,338
Was born on Christmas day

1204
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:07,105
To save us all
from satan's power

1205
01:51:07,179 --> 01:51:09,340
When we're gone astray

1206
01:51:09,414 --> 01:51:14,147
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy,

1207
01:51:14,219 --> 01:51:18,679
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

1208
01:51:18,757 --> 01:51:21,055
Higgins!

1209
01:51:22,661 --> 01:51:25,186
Higgins!

1210
01:51:34,373 --> 01:51:39,401
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy

1211
01:51:39,478 --> 01:51:42,311
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

1212
01:51:42,381 --> 01:51:45,179
Why'd you call so late?
We were worried about you.

1213
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:47,013
Likewise. The car for me?

1214
01:51:47,085 --> 01:51:50,248
It's all right. It's safe.
You'll have a few hours of debriefing.

1215
01:51:50,322 --> 01:51:53,519
- Hey, Higgins?
- Yeah?

1216
01:51:53,592 --> 01:51:57,084
Let's say,
for the purposes of argument,

1217
01:51:57,162 --> 01:52:00,962
I had a .45
in one of my pockets

1218
01:52:01,033 --> 01:52:03,467
and I wanted you
to walk with me.

1219
01:52:03,535 --> 01:52:06,265
You'd do it, right?

1220
01:52:06,338 --> 01:52:08,704
Which way?

1221
01:52:08,774 --> 01:52:11,641
West. And slowly.

1222
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:15,646
Stay in front of me
about three or four steps.

1223
01:52:23,522 --> 01:52:25,456
Where we going?

1224
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:28,559
Wave them on ahead.

1225
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:41,806
Do we have plans to invade
the Middle East?

1226
01:52:41,873 --> 01:52:44,307
- Are you crazy?
- Am I?

1227
01:52:44,376 --> 01:52:46,742
- Look, Turner--
- Do we have plans?

1228
01:52:46,812 --> 01:52:48,746
No. Absolutely not.

1229
01:52:48,814 --> 01:52:51,908
We have games. That's all.

1230
01:52:51,983 --> 01:52:54,451
We play games-- What if?

1231
01:52:54,519 --> 01:52:57,454
How many men?
What would it take?

1232
01:52:57,522 --> 01:53:00,616
Is there a cheaper way
to destabilize a regime?

1233
01:53:00,692 --> 01:53:04,423
- That's what we're paid to do.
- Walk on.

1234
01:53:04,496 --> 01:53:06,430
Go on.

1235
01:53:09,835 --> 01:53:12,770
So Atwood just took the games
too seriously.

1236
01:53:12,838 --> 01:53:17,605
He was really going to do it,
wasn't he? A renegade operation.

1237
01:53:17,676 --> 01:53:20,270
Atwood knew 541 2 would
never authorize it,

1238
01:53:20,345 --> 01:53:22,779
not with the heat
on the company.

1239
01:53:22,848 --> 01:53:25,282
What if there hadn't
been any heat?

1240
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:28,285
Suppose I hadn't stumbled
on their plan?

1241
01:53:28,353 --> 01:53:30,617
Different ballgame.

1242
01:53:30,689 --> 01:53:33,624
Fact is, there was nothing wrong
with the plan.

1243
01:53:33,692 --> 01:53:38,629
The plan was all right.
The plan would've worked.

1244
01:53:38,697 --> 01:53:41,131
Boy, what is it
with you people?

1245
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:45,158
You think not getting caught in a lie
is the same thing as telling the truth?

1246
01:53:45,237 --> 01:53:47,831
No. It's simple economics.

1247
01:53:47,906 --> 01:53:49,840
Today it's oil, right?

1248
01:53:49,908 --> 01:53:54,936
In 1 0 or 1 5 years-- food, plutonium,
and maybe even sooner.

1249
01:53:55,013 --> 01:53:58,141
What do you think the people
are going to want us to do then?

1250
01:53:58,216 --> 01:54:00,309
Ask them.

1251
01:54:00,385 --> 01:54:03,718
Now now. Then. Ask them
when they're running out.

1252
01:54:03,788 --> 01:54:06,723
Ask them when there's no heat
and they're cold.

1253
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:08,725
Ask them when
their engines stop.

1254
01:54:08,793 --> 01:54:12,729
Ask them when people who have never
known hunger start going hungry.

1255
01:54:12,797 --> 01:54:16,233
Want to know something?
They won't want us to ask them.

1256
01:54:16,301 --> 01:54:18,735
They'll want us
to get it for them.

1257
01:54:18,803 --> 01:54:21,135
Boy,

1258
01:54:21,206 --> 01:54:23,299
have you found a home.

1259
01:54:24,576 --> 01:54:27,010
There were seven people
killed, Higgins.

1260
01:54:27,078 --> 01:54:30,104
- The company didn't order it.
- Atwood did.

1261
01:54:30,182 --> 01:54:33,948
Atwood did.
And who the hell is Atwood?

1262
01:54:34,019 --> 01:54:35,953
He's you.
He's all you guys.

1263
01:54:36,021 --> 01:54:39,752
Seven people killed,
and you play fucking games!

1264
01:54:39,824 --> 01:54:43,988
Right.
And the other side does, too.

1265
01:54:44,062 --> 01:54:46,792
That's why we can't let you
stay outside.

1266
01:54:46,865 --> 01:54:51,495
Well, go on home, Higgins.
Go on. They've got it.

1267
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:54,004
- What?
- You know where we are.

1268
01:54:54,072 --> 01:54:57,803
Just look around. They've got it.
That's where they ship from.

1269
01:54:57,876 --> 01:54:59,810
They've got all of it.

1270
01:55:09,221 --> 01:55:11,155
What? What did you do?

1271
01:55:11,223 --> 01:55:13,418
I told them a story.

1272
01:55:13,491 --> 01:55:17,587
You play games,
I told them a story.

1273
01:55:25,503 --> 01:55:27,596
Oh, you--

1274
01:55:27,672 --> 01:55:30,607
You poor, dumb
son of a bitch.

1275
01:55:30,675 --> 01:55:33,701
You've done more damage
than you know.

1276
01:55:35,247 --> 01:55:37,238
I hope so.

1277
01:55:45,523 --> 01:55:47,855
You're about to be
a very lonely man.

1278
01:55:51,196 --> 01:55:53,630
It didn't have
to end this way.

1279
01:55:53,698 --> 01:55:55,859
Of course it did.

1280
01:55:58,136 --> 01:56:00,730
Hey, Turner.

1281
01:56:00,805 --> 01:56:04,434
How do you know
they'll print it?

1282
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:08,074
You can take a walk,

1283
01:56:08,146 --> 01:56:10,876
but how far if they
don't print it?

1284
01:56:10,949 --> 01:56:13,645
They'll print it.

1285
01:56:13,718 --> 01:56:16,118
How do you know?

1286
01:56:16,187 --> 01:56:19,122
Remember Christ, our Savior

1287
01:56:19,190 --> 01:56:21,715
Was born on Christmas day

1288
01:56:21,793 --> 01:56:24,421
To save us all
from satan's power

1289
01:56:24,496 --> 01:56:26,930
When we're gone astray

1290
01:56:26,998 --> 01:56:28,179
Ohh

1291
01:56:28,179 --> 01:56:28,873
Ohh
