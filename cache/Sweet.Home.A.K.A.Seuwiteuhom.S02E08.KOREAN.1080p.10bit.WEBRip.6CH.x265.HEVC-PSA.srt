00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:03,104
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,205
Seung-wan, don't make a sound.

4
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,917
Can you be quiet?

5
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,631
Seung-wan.

6
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,883
I need your help.

7
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,551
You need…

8
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,970
my help?

9
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,017
Just say the word and I'll--

10
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,602
Thank you.

11
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,603
Thank you so much.

12
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,813
Sure.

13
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,650
Sir.

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,485
May I come in?

15
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,579
Sir?

16
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,764
What is it?

17
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,015
It's just…

18
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,814
It wasn't a defect.

19
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,858
Someone deliberately cut the wires.

20
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,862
The door to the basement was locked
at the time of the blackout.

21
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,366
Who handles the keys?

22
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,201
Staff Sergeant Bang and Chief Ji, sir.

23
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,787
But as you already know,

24
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,623
they were both at the central plaza.

25
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,334
Why would anyone do this?

26
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,129
They have something to hide.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,714
Sorry?

28
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,884
They must have used the blackout
for some sort of scheme.

29
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,553
But who would do that, sir?

30
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,485
Are you sure I can be of help?

31
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,030
There are more
qualified technicians out there.

32
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,949
I've spent most of my days studying,

33
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,534
so I'm not good with my hands.

34
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,121
Seung-wan.

35
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,372
Yes?

36
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,874
How do you like it here?

37
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,627
Well, I'm only alive
because I'm afraid to die.

38
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,421
But to be honest,

39
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,840
this place kind of grew on me.

40
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,634
Right?

41
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,137
The entire world
is swarming with monsters.

42
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,766
But here, I feel like…

43
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,769
I'm still in touch with humanity.

44
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,773
So Chief Ji,

45
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,858
what do you want me to…

46
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,779
Have a look at this.

47
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,784
What's this?

48
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,410
This is our living area.

49
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,120
It's quite cramped, isn't it?

50
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,289
So I want to expand it.

51
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,626
I didn't know.
I assumed what I saw was all of it.

52
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,920
Not everything is as it seems.

53
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,424
But Master Sergeant Tak
will probably try to stop me.

54
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:19,968
Why?

55
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,765
Symptomatic individuals are hard to find
if they really try to hide.

56
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,145
Right.

57
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,939
Isn't that a relief?

58
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,818
But with more areas to supervise,

59
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,903
wouldn't this place become more dangerous?

60
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,571
But that's not a problem for you.

61
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,323
What?

62
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,743
What was that for?

63
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,704
You said you'd help me.

64
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,415
So I'm trying to help you too.

65
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,250
When did I say that?

66
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,085
I knew something was fishy.

67
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,169
I'm telling everyone!

68
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,087
Go ahead.

69
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,842
But who will you tell?

70
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,803
The Platoon?

71
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,888
Master Sergeant Tak?

72
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,349
Do you even have the courage?

73
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,438
Seung-wan.

74
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,774
I know you're having symptoms.

75
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,602
Get up.

76
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,395
Damn it.

77
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,939
-Hey!
-Oh, come on!

78
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,821
What is it?

79
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,990
I'm trying to get my beauty sleep.

80
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,202
Are you going to fix my skin
if it breaks out?

81
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,662
You've got bigger things to worry about.

82
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,999
This is yours, isn't it?

83
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,965
No, it's not.

84
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,133
Then whose is it?

85
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,636
Why?

86
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,221
I told you it's not mine.

87
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,848
I've never seen that thing in my life.

88
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,642
Why won't you believe me?

89
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,353
Excuse me.

90
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,687
Seung-wan disappeared.

91
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,817
He's too scared
to even use the toilet at night.

92
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,778
Look for him again
and let us know if you can't find him.

93
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,323
You're hurting me!

94
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,866
Please let go of me.

95
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,623
You're working late, aren't you?

96
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,960
A monster incident, a blackout…

97
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,379
It's been a long day, Master Sergeant Tak.

98
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,551
I didn't interfere
with your work until now

99
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,304
because I deemed you
necessary for public safety.

100
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:11,931
And?

101
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,392
I've been thinking…

102
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,228
that I might've been mistaken.

103
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,819
You think I endanger this place?

104
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,029
We'll find out soon enough.

105
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,547
Let go of me!

106
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,507
Let go of me, you assholes!

107
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,556
I assume you won't need me to explain,

108
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,101
but someone cut the wires
in the control room.

109
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,355
And your daughter's ring was found there.

110
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,108
I didn't do it!

111
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,860
Let go of me!

112
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,488
Mom.

113
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,532
Come on, say something.

114
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,451
Mom.

115
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,453
Did you know about this?

116
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,087
I had no idea.

117
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,673
That's a relief.

118
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,091
Mom…

119
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,386
Mom, what are you doing?

120
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,181
Mom, come on.

121
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,641
Mom!

122
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,476
Let go of me!

123
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,786
If anyone finds out,

124
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,831
you won't be isolated or kicked out.

125
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,209
After what happened with Jun-il's mom,

126
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,045
the protocol for symptomatic individuals
has changed.

127
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,131
What will you do?

128
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,969
What if she doesn't come back?

129
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,277
I thought you wouldn't come back.

130
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,861
I was so scared.

131
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,280
I told you I'd come.

132
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,698
I know.

133
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,202
I'm sorry for doubting you earlier.

134
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,454
Thank you.

135
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,124
Thank you.

136
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,512
What is this place, ma'am?

137
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,223
-Seung-wan.
-Yes?

138
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,116
Chief Ji.

139
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,288
Why, Chief Ji?

140
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,915
Why are you doing this to me?

141
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,294
You should've stayed unconscious.

142
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,090
I wanted to make it painless for you!

143
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,926
What are you talking about?

144
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:41,515
I want to go out.

145
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,434
I'll stop being so selfish!

146
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,562
I'll be good. I swear.

147
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,814
Seung-wan.

148
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,318
-No!
-It's too late.

149
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,820
I'll be good. Please…

150
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,823
I'll be good. Please.

151
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,552
Sarge.

152
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,263
Sergeant Min!

153
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,932
Damn it.

154
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,893
Kim Yeong-hu!

155
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,145
Fuck!

156
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,065
Radio not working, sir?

157
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,608
Check your signal.

158
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,944
Do you have Yong-seok's location?

159
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,987
No, sir.

160
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,410
Is Yong-seok even here?

161
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,621
What if Sergeant Kim was wrong?

162
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,875
We're all going to fucking die
for nothing at this rate!

163
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,797
We would've come here for anybody.

164
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,340
Even for you, asshole.

165
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,343
Isn't that what family is?

166
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,557
I'm sorry, sir.

167
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,600
I got scared like an idiot.

168
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,893
I get it.

169
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,146
Of course you're scared.

170
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,564
But let's see this through.

171
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,899
We need to find Yong-seok!

172
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,152
That's what we're here for.

173
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,778
Jong-hyun.

174
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,863
Okay?

175
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,947
Come on.

176
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,885
The reception isn't great here, sir.

177
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,595
It must be because of the monsters.

178
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,640
They're probably hiding somewhere safe.

179
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,808
What should we do?

180
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,228
We'll look for Jeong and Min
in the research facility.

181
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,106
And then we'll search for Yong-seok.

182
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,817
Are you sure about leaving
Dr. Lim back there?

183
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,487
I'm just worried.

184
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,738
We've warned him enough.

185
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,241
He'll radio us if he's in danger,
so keep your ears open.

186
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,284
Yes, sir.

187
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,744
Let's go.

188
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,329
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,464
Yong-seok.

190
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,507
Choi Yong-seok.

191
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,186
What the hell are those?

192
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,861
They're all monsters.

193
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,200
But isn't it strange?

194
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,702
What is, sir?

195
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,162
The picture's too perfect.

196
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,707
It's like someone
deliberately isolated them.

197
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,315
Fuck.

198
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,489
Fuck you!

199
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,840
They'll make their way up soon.

200
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,551
Let's get you to safety.

201
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,997
Nothing here, sir.

202
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,174
Grab anything that might be useful.

203
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:37,871
So?

204
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,250
What kind of person were you?

205
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,795
Did you have family?

206
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,716
Oh, you were alone?

207
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,676
That's nice.

208
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,643
Some of us have turned into monsters

209
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,897
and some of us live on
as humans just like myself.

210
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,360
What's it like to be a monster?

211
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,487
Is it any better?

212
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,577
I guess I'll never know
unless I experience it firsthand.

213
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,663
It's such a shame.

214
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,682
Sir.

215
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,768
About Yong-seok.

216
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,063
What do we do…

217
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,107
if he already turned?

218
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,361
I know I shouldn't worry, but…

219
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,072
Will we kill him if he's a monster?

220
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,533
I have no idea.

221
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,288
Do what feels right if I hesitate.

222
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,749
You sure, sir?

223
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,202
Who are you? Are you human?

224
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,080
Open your eyes and look at me.

225
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,498
Open your eyes!

226
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,250
Sarge.

227
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,672
Are you okay?

228
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,174
We won't hurt you.

229
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,259
You're human, right?

230
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,097
Can you look at me?

231
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,321
Thank you.

232
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,829
Are you hurt?

233
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,998
Could you come out for a moment?

234
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,135
Are you cold?

235
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,481
Hey, Kang Seok-chan.

236
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,234
Just doing what feels right, sir.

237
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,376
Are you soldiers?

238
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,629
Not right now.

239
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,589
We're also survivors.

240
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,884
Are you alone?

241
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,802
Is anyone else here?

242
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,225
This is where we live.

243
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,436
Isn't it dangerous?
There are still monsters here.

244
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,191
The monsters don't come here.

245
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,986
Have you seen anyone else
in military uniform?

246
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,197
He probably came not long ago.

247
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,909
-I saw him.
-You did?

248
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,494
Where is he?

249
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,332
We really need to find him.

250
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,292
Can you take us to him?

251
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,080
What happened?

252
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,458
There was a fire at her hideout
and she couldn't escape.

253
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,544
She was already unconscious

254
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,254
when I went inside.

255
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,215
It's carbon monoxide poisoning.

256
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,552
There must be portable oxygen tanks here.

257
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,636
Let's look for one.

258
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,987
FOR MEDICAL USE
OXYGEN

259
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,614
I found it!

260
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,551
Is it working?

261
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,809
What's wrong?

262
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,644
There's no oxygen left.

263
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,438
So what now?

264
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,733
If she doesn't get oxygen,

265
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,110
her organs will start to fail.

266
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,531
-And then…
-Give me a solution, not a problem.

267
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,783
It's too late.

268
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,787
Why would you say that
without even trying?

269
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,998
Stay out of the way
if you don't want to help.

270
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,127
Hyun-su, help me carry her.

271
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,337
Let's go to the stadium.

272
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,588
We need to go now.

273
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,966
Help me already!

274
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,545
You're so ugly.

275
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,464
You're ugly on the outside,

276
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,843
but you're even uglier on the inside.

277
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,141
Coward.

278
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,811
Liar.

279
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,860
That's enough.

280
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,364
Why do you keep me around
if you hate people so much?

281
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,825
Am I different somehow?

282
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,501
You know, those two…

283
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,172
They looked like they were glowing.

284
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,009
Funny, right?

285
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,637
But they really did.

286
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,224
Even that minx looked so pretty
all of a sudden.

287
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,061
They looked so alive.

288
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,359
I wanted that too.

289
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,406
But I just feel like
an empty shell right now.

290
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,036
You know how you're different?

291
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,333
I liked how empty you were.

292
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,754
I liked how you didn't glow.

293
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,259
That meant you wouldn't
turn into a monster.

294
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,641
It doesn't matter if we're empty shells.

295
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,602
What matters…

296
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,021
is that we're alive.

297
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,156
Where are we headed now?

298
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,369
Somewhere with no humans or monsters.

299
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,704
Sounds so boring.

300
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,987
Feeling any better?

301
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,912
We've done enough.

302
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,915
Are you okay with this?

303
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,961
Are we just supposed to
let her die like this?

304
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,132
Now that I think about it…

305
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,220
I think she wanted this.

306
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,888
What?

307
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,975
The boat was on fire…

308
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,478
but she didn't get out.

309
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,442
Why not?

310
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,778
Why wouldn't she?

311
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,661
I have a question.

312
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,754
How's everyone doing?

313
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,560
Hye-in and Su-yeong died.

314
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,396
So did Ji-su.

315
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,069
They're all gone.

316
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,659
I also have a question.

317
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,468
SURVIVORS, TURNING, DEAD

318
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,178
He must have had symptoms.

319
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,722
LEE EUN-HYEOK

320
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,057
Weren't you the last one…

321
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,061
who saw Eun-hyeok that day?

322
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,938
You met him, didn't you?

323
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,648
How was he?

324
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,737
He didn't seem any different.

325
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,244
Nothing felt off about him.

326
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,552
Then…

327
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,804
you also don't know…

328
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,266
what happened to him.

329
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,892
Whether he turned into a monster or…

330
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,361
Thanks, though.

331
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,200
For coming back to me.

332
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:20,842
Excuse me.

333
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,305
I'm sorry for being so forward,

334
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,806
but you're resisting it, right?

335
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,100
Yes.

336
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,351
I'm sorry.

337
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,729
I know it was rude to ask,

338
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,063
but I had to check.

339
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,523
It's fine.

340
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,026
Are you the person…

341
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,863
Eun-yu was looking for?

342
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,783
No.

343
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,076
Probably not.

344
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,039
There's someone more precious to her.

345
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,253
Please take care of Yi-kyung and Eun-yu.

346
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,005
Where are you going?

347
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,716
I have to find someone.

348
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,094
Yi-kyung should get to say goodbye.

349
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,447
Yi-kyung is badly hurt.

350
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,119
She could die.

351
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,416
Come with me.

352
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,895
What does "die" mean?

353
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,523
It means to say goodbye.

354
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,237
You won't be able to see her again.

355
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,947
I'm fine with that.

356
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,162
You really don't know anything.

357
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,748
Mom hates me.

358
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,333
She wished I would disappear.

359
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,920
So I'm not going.

360
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,841
You're the one who doesn't know anything.

361
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,014
You may be fine now…

362
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,228
but you'll eventually regret it.

363
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:34,827
Let's go.

364
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,872
Do you not want her to die?

365
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,877
No.

366
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,880
Then don't let her die.

367
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,133
I wish I could.

368
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,763
But there's no way.

369
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,183
What do I have to do?

370
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,145
You don't have to do anything.

371
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,317
Just…

372
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,531
stay by her side.

373
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,934
Cha Hyun-su, was it?

374
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,230
He's the monster
who killed Mr. Kim, isn't he?

375
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,691
I don't like the way that sounds.

376
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,740
Well, that's what I know.

377
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,366
Enough with all the questions.

378
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,209
Mr. Kim was having symptoms.

379
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,838
I don't know when it started.

380
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,598
Die, you piece of shit!

381
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,607
Why didn't you tell anyone?

382
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,901
They called you a murderer.

383
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,445
Chief Ji and I have had

384
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,115
bad blood for a long time.

385
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,704
But we're all alive
because she opened up the stadium to us.

386
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,750
I didn't want to screw her over.

387
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,211
Eun-yu.

388
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,923
That's not the only reason,
so don't get me wrong.

389
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,010
I didn't know it was Hyun-su then…

390
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,973
but either way,
I didn't want to tell the Platoon.

391
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,291
Could you give us a moment?

392
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,239
Yi-kyung, wake up.

393
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,742
I brought her with me.

394
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,121
I'm…

395
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,084
so sorry.

396
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,356
Why are you coming out already?

397
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,608
Stay with her for a while.

398
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,944
Mom's not going to die.

399
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,363
So don't cry for her.

400
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,499
Yi-kyung.

401
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,257
Yi-kyung.

402
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,925
Yi-kyung.

403
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:20,733
Yi-kyung.

404
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,914
Yi-kyung…

405
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,841
Do you not want her to die?

406
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,179
Then don't let her die.

407
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,439
Look out!

408
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,700
No!

409
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,746
It's too late. She's gone!

410
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,682
Yi-kyung.

411
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,148
You should get out of here.

412
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,276
What about you and Yi-kyung?

413
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,612
I swear she had no symptoms.

414
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,614
-How can she suddenly…
-It was her daughter.

415
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,907
She turned her into a monster?

416
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,201
Humans can't trigger monsterization.

417
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,703
She isn't human.

418
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,038
What the hell are you talking about?

419
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,540
Get out of here!

420
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,980
All monsters…

421
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,524
have to die.

422
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,063
I can see it all, Eun-yu.

423
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,483
I can see the desires
of the people who turned.

424
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,529
I can see all the illusions

425
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,240
they're living in.

426
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,204
They're all happy…

427
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,790
in their own dreams.

428
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,044
But Yi-kyung…

429
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,213
still won't be happy there.

430
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,134
I have to put an end to this.

431
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,094
It has to be me.

432
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,490
Could it be true?

433
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,328
We've been killing monsters

434
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,998
because we thought…

435
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,669
monsterization couldn't be reversed.

436
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,423
We didn't consider them human.

437
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,010
But if he's right,

438
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,096
I've been murdering people all along.

439
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,306
No.

440
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,601
They were trying to kill you.
You had no choice.

441
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,149
What will you do now?

442
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,735
Wait for Hyun-su to wake up.

443
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,489
You?

444
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,907
I should get back.

445
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,992
I was gone for too long.

446
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,329
Yeah.

447
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,415
Sorry you had to go through all that
because of me.

448
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,590
You're always so quick.

449
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,427
Even with coming to terms with things.

450
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,095
It must be nice.

451
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,017
This could be the last time.

452
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,936
Do you have anything to say

453
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,647
to the people waiting for you
at the shelter?

454
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,524
No.

455
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,817
Let me be forgotten.

456
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,299
You should go now.

457
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,969
And never come back.

458
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,604
For fuck's sake.

459
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,871
Good morning.

460
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,257
Hey, boss.

461
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,759
I'm sorry.

462
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,552
You little…

463
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,912
I can't live like this anymore.

464
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,376
How do I go backward?

465
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,971
Hold on.

466
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,392
It's all right.

467
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,060
They've been isolated.

468
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,063
We can't live with monsters.

469
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,149
Didn't you say there were humans like us?

470
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,735
I didn't lie.

471
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,613
There are symptomatic individuals
here too.

472
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,491
The person you're looking for…

473
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,995
is here.

474
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,204
Symptomatic individuals?

475
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,706
Is Yong-seok one of them?

476
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,424
Yong-seok.

477
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:53,759
Are you in there?

478
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,386
Yong-seok!

479
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,022
Sergeant Kim…

480
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,361
Sergeant Kim.

481
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,447
Please save me.

482
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,865
Please let me out.

483
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,621
Are you okay?

484
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,955
Seok-chan?

485
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,332
Fuck.

486
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,089
Seok-chan, wait.

487
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:42,933
Open it right now.

488
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,268
I don't know how.

489
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,480
There are other survivors here, right?

490
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,611
Sarge…

491
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,197
Don't do it, Sarge.

492
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,493
-Stay with him, Seok-chan.
-Sarge.

493
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,370
-But sir…
-I won't be long.

494
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,041
Hey, Yong-seok.

495
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,169
Seok-chan will stay with you. Hold tight.

496
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,423
Lead the way. Where are they?

497
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,219
Wait.

498
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,348
Thank you so much for your help.

499
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,504
Yes.

500
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,091
You've been doing great.

501
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,887
That was great self-control.

502
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,555
Good restraint.

503
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,056
You held back for long enough.

504
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,477
A greeting wouldn't hurt, right?

505
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,400
Nice to meet you.

506
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,236
Hi.

507
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,384
Who's there?

508
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,595
Who's there?

509
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,682
Are you a monster or a human?

510
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:09,537
Wait.

511
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,501
You'll stay put, right?

512
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,503
I'll be right back.

513
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,730
So did you get the medicine?

514
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,071
Your girlfriend cried a lot.

515
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,866
You should go comfort her.

516
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,328
Seok-chan,

517
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,205
give this to Jin-a for me.

518
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,755
FOR HIV/AIDS

519
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:02,966
What's this for?

520
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,928
Tell her I'm sorry
that this is all I could find.

521
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:08,763
And tell her…

522
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,059
that I got scared and ran away.

523
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,269
Listen, you idiot!

524
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,023
Stop being so weak.

525
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,860
Sergeant Kim will never give up on you.

526
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,236
Neither will I.

527
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,740
So get a hold of yourself.

528
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,117
Seok-chan.

529
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,160
They're…

530
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,912
not going to let us go.

531
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,040
Run away.

532
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,959
I said run away!

533
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,769
What's this?

534
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,440
Let's talk.

535
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,359
Explain yourself.

536
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,743
It's me you should talk to.

537
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,039
What do you want from me?

538
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,126
We're taking the soldier
in the isolation area.

539
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,797
We'll leave quietly
if you don't get in the way.

540
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,632
No.

541
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,716
I can't allow that.

542
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,426
This is not a discussion.

543
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,771
You want me to start over?

544
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,777
It's protocol to isolate
symptomatic individuals.

545
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,488
You soldiers like rules, don't you?

546
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,073
Cut the bullshit.

547
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,741
You knew he had no symptoms.

548
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,245
I don't know why the fuck
you're isolating perfectly fine people,

549
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,955
but I'm not playing along.

550
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,000
I was giving him a chance.

551
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,129
A chance to be like us.

552
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:35,762
Those things…

553
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,223
were their test subjects.

554
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,940
You bastard.

555
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,151
Ja-yeong.

556
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:54,656
Sarge!

557
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,466
Sarge!

558
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,383
Cha Hyun-su.

559
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,854
Are you going to hit me with that?

560
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,481
Bring him back.

561
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,650
Bring Hyun-su back.

562
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:37,819
He's hurt.

563
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,405
Leave him to rest.

564
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,991
I was just helping him out
because he was hurting.

565
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,326
Give me a break.

566
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,517
This is all your fault.

567
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,655
Wasn't Hyun-su in control?

568
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,116
I'm Hyun-su too.

569
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,868
The real Hyun-su, not you.

570
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,162
We agreed to help each other.

571
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,830
It wouldn't be great for me

572
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,832
if he died.

573
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,460
Just leave him alone and get lost.

574
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,462
Really?

575
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,589
Would you be okay with that?

576
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,341
Would you be okay with Cha Hyun-su…

577
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:44,969
who's a weakling?

578
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:47,638
Yes.

579
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:07,658
What are you doing?

580
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,453
I don't know.

581
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,247
What should we do?

582
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:17,543
What do you want to do?

583
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,048
I knew you'd come back.

584
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,135
If you didn't drop dead, that is.

585
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:11,722
Right.

586
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,643
But I don't know who you are.

587
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,315
This place was everything to you too.

588
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,404
Well, that's how it is.

589
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:28,030
Being a public figure,

590
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,702
I can't recognize
everyone who recognizes me.

591
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:37,832
Were you a researcher?

592
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,671
I don't pay much attention to people.

593
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,673
I'm not so keen on them.

594
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,094
And yet, you seemed very interested in me.

595
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,639
Right.

596
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,850
So tell me.

597
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,603
Who are you?

598
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,441
Your first…

599
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:05,693
test subject.

600
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,656
Don't run.

601
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,866
You should say hi.

602
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,653
I knew this day would come.

603
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,157
I really wanted to show you.

604
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,746
MH-1, was it?

605
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,457
Or should I say

606
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,125
your friend,

607
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,670
Nam Sang-won.

608
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,222
Good to see you again.

609
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,684
I was worried…

610
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:21,978
that you might be dead.

611
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:40,222
SWEET HOME WILL RETURN
IN SUMMER 2024
