1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,535
- Did you hear they started their bus already?
- No?

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,386
One month into high school and
they started their bus already.

3
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:10,307
Ingrid...

4
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:13,433
- I miss you.
- You look like a slut.

5
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:14,843
***

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,000
Maybe I can get a friend?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,060
You invited loads of
people on a cabin trip

8
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:23,882
- that was supposed to be just us!
- Two guys?!

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,530
- I can see your messages then.
- I already told you this is ridiculous!

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,234
Why don't you trust me?

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,906
SATURDAY, 5:11 PM

12
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,960
I'll call you later, okay?

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,780
Yeah.

14
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,240
Eva...

15
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:17,280
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,831
If I knew how important
this cabin trip was for you,

17
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:21,905
I wouldn't have invited the guys.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,636
I didn't know it wasn't
that important to you.

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,980
It was important to me!

20
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,140
But...

21
00:01:36,712 --> 00:01:38,181
***

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,740
It's also important to me to
spend time with my friends.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,420
It used to be important to you, too.

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,670
It's important to me.

25
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,959
But not as important as your friends.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,360
I told you that you could bring friends!

27
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,080
- Can't you just...
- Get some friends?

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,193
That's not what I meant.

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,460
But it's what you're thinking.

30
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,260
I don't know what the right answer is.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,420
Just be completely honest.

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,720
Completely honest?

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,000
Eva, you are the coolest girl I know.

34
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,945
You're pretty, sweet, smart, and funny.

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,540
But...

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,500
I don't know what the problem is.

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,105
You have to find new friends!

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,300
Get yourself new friends!

39
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,745
Anyone who gets to be your
friend is really lucky.

40
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,972
You don't know what to say?

41
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:57,569
I nailed it.

42
00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:59,115
You nailed it.

43
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:34,860
Hope you had a nice trip! Love you! Mom.

44
00:04:10,452 --> 00:04:16,198
Congratulations on
having me as a friend!

45
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:37,640
Hey girl! What's up?

46
00:04:59,997 --> 00:05:02,284
Hi, is what I meant.

47
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:05,971
Wanted to write Hi, but then
I pressed the send button

48
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:09,653
and so it was just H. Haha.

49
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:37,006
MONDAY, 10:29 AM

50
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:00,197
Hello.

51
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:02,740
How are you doing?

52
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,241
I'll sit here.

53
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,160
Hi.

54
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,500
Or... H?

55
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,780
H-H.

56
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:24,695
Hello.

57
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,709
How are you doing?

58
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,912
Today, we're gonna with

59
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,417
what you did during the holidays.

60
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,998
Should we have done homework
during the fall break?

61
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:37,082
Yes!

62
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:38,568
Fuck!

63
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,609
Eva?

64
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:43,377
What does the main
character of this story do?

65
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,460
She feels alone.

66
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:57,820
Noora, I don't want
you to respond for Eva.

67
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,200
She hadn't found her homework yet.

68
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
I was just helping.

69
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,320
You asked it the wrong way.

70
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,448
The right way would be:

71
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,700
What are the main
characters of the story like?

72
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,848
You're right. I'm sorry!

73
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,890
- I lived in Madrid.
- Okay, okay.

74
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,042
That's why I don't have friends.

75
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:21,648
In Oslo.

76
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:29,100
What's your excuse?

77
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,860
Strong body odor.

78
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:44,535
- Culturally.
- TUESDAY, 11:50 AM

79
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:48,362
***

80
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:51,202
***

81
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,722
***

82
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:00,800
Hi!

83
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,820
- Thanks for last time.
- Hi!

84
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,977
I can't remember if I greeted you
properly. I was a little out of it.

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,235
- Vilde.
- Eva.

86
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,600
It was so nice of you to help me!

87
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,516
No, no. It was nothing!

88
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:18,640
We were wondering if you
already had a Russ bus.

89
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:20,372
Eh, no.

90
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:22,864
That's perfect! We just
rented a completely new bus.

91
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,975
We really want you to join.

92
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:29,241
I haven't really started
thinking about Russefeiring time.

93
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,659
It's really important to think about it

94
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,560
if you want to be on a bus.

95
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,885
I don't know what
it's like in Trondheim,

96
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:40,110
but here in Oslo you have to
start planning really early.

97
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,231
Otherwise you end up on a bad bus,

98
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:45,007
- or you become a loser.
- ***

99
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,060
Being a Russ is not
just about Russ time,

100
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:51,229
it's also about being
social and about unity.

101
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,162
Yes, think of it a like a sect.

102
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,805
Once you're in, you can't get out.

103
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,550
It ends in a collective
suicide in Tryvann,

104
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:06,825
on the night of the 17th of May in 2018.

105
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,720
She's just joking.

106
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,771
Do you perhaps want
to join our bus meeting

107
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:13,428
Friday after school?

108
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,158
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Yeah?

109
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,722
That's so cool!

110
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,127
If you have friends,
just take them with you!

111
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,838
***

112
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,220
We'll see each other then.

113
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:44,061
What the fuck was that?

114
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,360
What is it?

115
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,319
She was sucking on that spoon

116
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:48,935
- and looked him straight in the eyes.
- Chris?

117
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,362
Yeah!

118
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,720
Who is she?

119
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:03,500
THURSDAY, 2:05 PM

120
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,501
H. As in, "Have you got a drug problem?"

121
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,424
Or H as in,

122
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,622
- "Have you got any plans for Friday?"
- Hi!

123
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,136
Hi.

124
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,180
Vilde, this is Noora.

125
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,800
Hi.

126
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,698
- Have you talked to Chris?
- No.

127
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,212
We can't have the bus meeting at hers,

128
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,580
her mom is having a wine reception.

129
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:30,388
And we can't have it at mine
because it'll become stressful.

130
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,580
So I was wondering if
we can do it at yours?

131
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:33,660
Mine?

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,762
Eh, yes!

133
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,331
But how many will come?

134
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,520
Do you want to join?

135
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,400
- What?
- Bus meeting.

136
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,366
But meeting... what?

137
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,445
We'll create the
world's coolest Russ bus.

138
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:49,707
- You want to join?
- No.

139
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,880
Then we're with three...

140
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,993
Hi guys. Meet Sana.

141
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,929
She'll join the bus meeting.

142
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,652
What do you know each other from?

143
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,845
We met at a Ramadan
program in the mosque.

144
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,040
She's joking. We have German together.

145
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,257
But you want to join our bus meeting?

146
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,240
Yes.

147
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,676
Is that okay, then?

148
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,720
What's the problem?

149
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,736
No, eh...

150
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,732
Since you're Muslim, isn't it true

151
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:40,439
that Muslims aren't allowed

152
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:42,275
to be a Russ?

153
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:45,420
No, it's punished by stoning.

154
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:52,618
- When is it?
- Tomorrow. Who's hosting?

155
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,033
- Me.
- I'll put your address in the GPS.

156
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,000
Auf Wiedersehen!

157
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:06,060
It means "see you later".

158
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,170
She can't be on our bus.

159
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,597
Why not?

160
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,322
We'll give her a chance.
She was really cool.

161
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,640
We?

162
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,700
You're not even on our bus.

163
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:20,117
If she's joining, so am I.

164
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,236
Awesome!

165
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:35,071
FRIDAY, 6:50 PM

166
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,371
We have a really big advantage
over the other bus groups.

167
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:43,685
I already bought a lot of toilet paper.

168
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,893
Vilde managed to buy toilet
paper for 40.000 Kroner

169
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,600
with a credit card for another bus.

170
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:53,115
Anyway, we're left with
a profit of 60.000 Kroner.

171
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,083
According to the budget,

172
00:12:56,217 --> 00:13:00,666
we'll need 50.000 next
to the toilet paper sales.

173
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,860
So I'll need an individual
plan from all of you

174
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:07,115
on how you'll earn that money.

175
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,699
- Is there something?
- We're wasting time on toilet paper.

176
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:16,539
It's not enough.

177
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,453
It's important that we have ***

178
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:20,240
***.

179
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:23,065
Listen, we're losers at school.

180
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,873
If we don't want to
end up in a loser car,

181
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:29,627
- we need a strategy.
- We aren't the losers of the school.

182
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,380
Wasn't it you who was
thrown out of another bus?

183
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,179
Not really thrown out.

184
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes, you were.

185
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,069
Listen, Vilde.

186
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:41,661
It'll be hard if you deny everything.

187
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,255
Acknowledge that we're losers.

188
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,080
Do you think so yourself?

189
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,140
Hello?! I'm a Muslim girl
in a faithless country.

190
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:51,741
I'm the biggest loser of them all.

191
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:54,965
- You talk really maturely.
- Thanks.

192
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,380
But what do you want us to do?

193
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:01,985
First, we need to get more girls.

194
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:03,280
Cool girls.

195
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,880
How do we do that?

196
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:07,880
- Ask them?
- Wrong.

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,034
We ask nothing. The cool girls ask us.

198
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,663
But first, we need
something we don't have.

199
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:17,180
A four-letter word.

200
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,040
- "Spenn."
- Cred.

201
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,100
Spenn has five letters, Chris.

202
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,211
Do we know any '97 guys?

203
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,560
Okay...

204
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,715
Then we need to find out
who from the '97 people

205
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,977
have the best bus,

206
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:36,523
get ourselves invited to parties

207
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,088
and to those buses.

208
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,900
Any idea how we'll do that?

209
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,500
You guys have to hook up with them.

210
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,750
- Are you serious?
- "You guys"?

211
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:49,120
I'm not hooking up!

212
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,720
Okay, so we'll hook up.
What will you contribute?

213
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,892
Are you kidding me?

214
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,817
I'm rescuing you here
with a strategic plan

215
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,703
and you're wondering
what I'll contribute?

216
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,980
Does anyone have a boyfriend?

217
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,580
I have.

218
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,380
How old is he?

219
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:09,180
He's from '99.

220
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,714
Dump him.

221
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,683
You're not serious now?

222
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,478
She's the prettiest here.

223
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:18,075
It's wasted if she has a boyfriend.

224
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,751
Honestly. This is really stupid.

225
00:15:24,871 --> 00:15:25,820
What is?

226
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,180
You can't ask us to use our sexuality

227
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:32,437
in exchange for credibility.

228
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:36,520
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm honest.

229
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,275
Norwegian girls exchange
sex for money, popularity,

230
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:41,253
and acknowledgment every day.

231
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,405
We might disagree on values.

232
00:15:43,406 --> 00:15:48,166
But this isn't news to
you! It's your culture.

233
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,215
It is crazy. So try to change it

234
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:53,312
instead of criticizing it.

235
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,947
But it's a little much to ask Eva

236
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,261
- to break up with her boyfriend.
- It was a suggestion.

237
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,105
She can think for herself.

238
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:11,552
She's not a child.

239
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,091
I think it went well.

240
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:28,699
