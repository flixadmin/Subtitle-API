1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,835
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,450
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,452 --> 00:00:09,470
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,855
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:16,026
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:21,499
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:26,304
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:28,790
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,841
I could save you,
or I could kill you.

10
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:32,843
Slade has the Mirakuru
in his system now.

11
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:35,429
The ones who survived,
they became someone else.

12
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,913
Whoa!

13
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:40,851
This Mirakuru,
it's messing with your head.

14
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:42,236
I know you
and your new friends

15
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:43,821
have the Mirakuru.
In exchange,

16
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:44,905
I'll promise you
and your friends

17
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:47,007
safe passage
off this island.

18
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:48,859
Slade's gone, and he took
the Mirakuru with him.

19
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:51,245
You know who he is under
that hood, don't you?

20
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:56,283
Once he has lost everyone
and everything he values...

21
00:00:56,285 --> 00:01:00,537
I will drive an arrow
through his eye.

22
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:19,056
Welcome to
St. Walker's, alderman.

23
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:22,109
Or should
I call you Mayor?

24
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:23,944
Thank you
for letting me come by so late.

25
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:26,397
Well, I can imagine how
busy your schedule is.

26
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,115
It's really great
of you taking the time

27
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:29,233
to come and visit
your aunt.

28
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:31,702
Her health
has taken a bad turn.

29
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:33,737
Of course.

30
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:36,773
She's family.

31
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:41,912
Maya, look who came to see you.

32
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:44,998
It's your nephew, Sebastian.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,201
Don't go.

34
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:48,685
Please.

35
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:50,721
We'll be fine.

36
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:52,606
Thank you.

37
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,010
Still worshipping
the old Gods, I see.

38
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:59,930
They're the last thing
I have from your father's.

39
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:01,849
They protect me.

40
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:04,485
You were supposed
to protect you.

41
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:07,354
A friend of mine, Laurel Lance,
came by to visit you

42
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:10,791
a couple days ago.
Do you remember her?

43
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:12,259
She's muy Linda.

44
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:14,928
Yes, she is.

45
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,397
What did you both
talk about?

46
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:19,933
Nada.
Nothing.

47
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:23,120
You know I don't like it
when you lie to me.

48
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:25,939
I told her
the truth.

49
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:28,926
That you--
you kill him.

50
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:30,660
Your father.

51
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:34,715
Mi esposo!

52
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:38,385
I don't know
what came over me.

53
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:41,155
I am so, so sorry.

54
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:44,341
I hurt you, mijo.

55
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:46,143
Esta bien.

56
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,312
No te preoccupes.

57
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:52,182
But you are
my child, my son.

58
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:56,186
And I hurt you.

59
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:58,789
I forgive you, mama.

60
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:08,365
I forgive you
for everything.

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,927
La luz de dios me rodea,
amor de dios me envuelve,

62
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:22,379
El poder de dios
me protege,

63
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:25,649
la presencia de dios
vela por mí.

64
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:29,987
Los dioses
están muertos.

Oh! Ah!

68
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,734
Oh, please!

69
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,036
I don't know anything.

70
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:48,088
The man in the skull mask.
Where is he?

71
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,756
I don't know what
you're talking about.

72
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,942
He's been experimenting
on people in the Glades.

73
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:53,627
He's leaving a trail
of corpses

74
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:54,990
with blood running
from their eyes.

75
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:58,011
No, no, no, no, no.

76
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:00,597
I deal in stolen
merchandise, that is it.

77
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,582
Ah, ooh, please!

78
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:04,667
Ask him
what color his shoes are.

79
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,269
What?

80
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:07,971
You want this guy
to take a polygraph

81
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:10,173
via Bluetooth, cool,
but I need to hear him

82
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:12,943
establish a base line.
I need to hear him tell the truth

83
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:14,444
just once.

84
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:17,948
What color
are your shoes?

85
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,649
What?

86
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,067
They're blue!

87
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,987
He's not lying.

88
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:25,522
Please...

89
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:31,294
He's out there.

90
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:33,696
Somewhere.

91
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:35,048
Come home.

92
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,700
We can't do
any more tonight.

93
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:42,539
Slade?

94
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,642
Slade!

95
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:47,811
Thought maybe
he'd come back here.

96
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:49,763
He has the Mirakuru
serum in his bloodstream.

97
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:53,934
He's not thinking clearly.
So what do we do now?

98
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:56,269
I don't know, Sara.

99
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:00,824
The sensor grid
is still active.

100
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,192
So at least we're going
to know if Ivo

101
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,327
and his men come back
to the island.

102
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,279
So we just sit here and wait?

103
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:08,498
Well, do you have
any other ideas?

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,035
'Cause right now,
I'm open to suggestions.

105
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:14,704
We find Slade, and...

106
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:17,457
Maybe we consider Ivo's offer.

107
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:18,959
What?

108
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:21,578
Look, if we get the serum
back from Slade,

109
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,296
then we can go home.

110
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,932
And I can try to talk to Ivo.
I can get him to listen to me.

111
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:29,019
Like he listened before he shot
Shado in the head?

112
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:31,754
He's just tired,
and he's frustrated.

113
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:34,941
You don't understand
what finding

114
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:37,277
the Mirakuru serum
has meant to him.

115
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,145
You're right, Sara,
I don't understand.

116
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:41,031
And I don't get
how you can even consider

117
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,983
trusting him after what he did.

118
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,951
He's not evil.

119
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:48,038
He kept me safe
on that ship for over a year.

120
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,741
And I mean, not just safe,
he taught me things.

121
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,776
And I learned a lot.

122
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:56,162
I learned a lot, too.

123
00:05:56,164 --> 00:05:59,382
This island taught me
that you can't trust anyone.

124
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:15,482
Ms. Lance?

125
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:17,484
I have a call for you
on line two.

126
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:19,102
Thank you,
Katherine.

127
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:23,490
Laurel Lance.

128
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:25,742
This is nurse Downey
from St. Walker's.

129
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:29,362
You asked me to call if there was
any changes Inaya Resik's condition.

130
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:32,916
I'm sad to report
she passed away.

131
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,284
What?

132
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:37,504
Her heart gave out
on her, poor soul.

133
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:39,956
You think Sebastian Blood,
the saint of Starling City,

134
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,374
killed his own mother?

135
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:42,825
He was the last person
to see her alive.

136
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:44,594
That isn't a coincidence.

137
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,329
He's a devoted nephew
visiting a sick relative.

138
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:47,964
You're right,
that's very, very suspicious.

139
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,716
He didn't go there
to visit her.

140
00:06:49,718 --> 00:06:51,051
He went there to
kill her;

141
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,719
to cover up the fact
that as a child,

142
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,554
he killed
his father.

143
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:56,056
Maya Resik told me
what happened.

144
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:57,507
From inside
a padded room, right?

145
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,526
Which he had her
forcibly committed.

146
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:02,395
She tells me the truth and then
two days later has a heart attack.

147
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:04,364
You don't find that strange?
Well, for one thing,

148
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,116
there's no record that Maya Resik
was even Blood's mother,

149
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:07,901
and according
to the hospital,

150
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:09,619
she was in the late
stages of heart disease.

151
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:11,705
I need you to call
in a favor with Judge Carlin.

152
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:14,207
Get a search warrant
for Sebastian's campaign headquarters,

153
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,743
his phone records; I--I
have to start somewhere.

154
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:18,995
Laurel, this isn't
some casual request.

155
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:21,965
I'm the ADA
who took Vertigo on live TV.

156
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,750
I take a shot
at Sebastian Blood and miss,

157
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:26,035
my career is done.

158
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:28,037
Adam!

159
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,205
Please.

160
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,707
I'm sorry, Laurel.

161
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,343
You're on your own.

162
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:39,516
Hello, Roy.

163
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:43,436
Lurking in an ally.

164
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:44,988
That's not
at all creepy.

165
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,489
When I ran the club,

166
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,274
I learned
all the secret entrances.

167
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,193
I never got a chance
to thank you

168
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,195
for saving my mother's life.

169
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,114
Thea told me.

170
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:57,167
She said that
you were very brave.

171
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:59,502
I did what anyone
would have done.

172
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:01,004
Not anyone.

173
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:03,623
It takes a lot to run
towards danger,

174
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,508
not away
from it.

175
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,927
That sounded like praise.

176
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:10,630
I thought where I was concerned,
you didn't approve.

177
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:14,467
Thea said that you also got
hit by some falling debris.

178
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:16,853
How are you feeling?

179
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:19,139
Actually, it mostly missed me.

180
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:21,975
I'm fine. Look,
I got to get back to work.

181
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:30,283
Has Roy mentioned
anything about the man

182
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:31,735
in the skull mask
who injected him?

183
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:33,369
Roy is not
the kind of guy

184
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:35,572
who is comfortable
discussing his feelings.

185
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:38,541
Not like you and me.

186
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:40,410
Don't yell at me, but I really think
we need a new plan

187
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:42,128
on how to find
this creepy mask guy.

188
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,247
Scaring the crap out of low-lifes
isn't yielding results.

189
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:46,416
Felicity, I am open
to any and all suggestions.

190
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:48,218
Oliver, maybe we're
over thinking this.

191
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,720
What if the mask simply got wind
that you were after him

192
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,005
and decided
to skip town?

193
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:53,673
He didn't go
to all the trouble

194
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:55,759
of recreating the serum
and testing it on people

195
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:57,293
just to walk away.

196
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:00,263
He is still out there, and
we need to locate him.

197
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:07,570
Lance,
for the Arrow.

198
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:10,073
Yes, Detective?
Can we meet?

199
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,574
What is it?

200
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:14,277
Someone wants
to talk to you.

201
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:22,085
Hello, Laurel.

202
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:24,320
You're late.

203
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:27,056
I had to circle around to make sure
there wasn't a SWAT team

204
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:28,458
waiting for me again.

205
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,926
That's fair.

206
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:31,761
Trust me, I wouldn't
have asked my father

207
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:34,380
to put me in touch with you
if I had any other choice.

208
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:36,533
What do you need?
Sebastian Blood.

209
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,551
He's about to be
the new mayor of Starling City.

210
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:39,853
I know who he is.

211
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:42,689
No, you don't.
No one does.

212
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,607
A few weeks ago,
I was approached

213
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:47,393
by your groupie, Roy Harper,
and his girlfriend.

214
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:51,948
They asked me to investigate
the death of Max Stanton.

215
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:55,902
You think Blood was involved in
Stanton's death?

216
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:59,572
Blood, or a man that works
for him named Cyrus Gold.

217
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,793
Gold killed
four cops,

218
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:07,530
including my father's
partner, Lucas Hilton.

219
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:09,392
Blood and Gold knew each
other from the orphanage

220
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:10,918
that Blood was raised at.

221
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:15,555
He would do anything to keep
the truth about his past hidden.

222
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:18,508
Including murdering
his own mother.

223
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,560
Why would he do that?

224
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:23,313
To cover up the fact that he
killed his father.

225
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:26,850
I tried going to the DA.

226
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:28,568
No one will believe me.

227
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,155
I swear to you,
Sebastian Blood is dangerous.

228
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:35,508
And you're the only person
in this city who can stop him.

229
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:43,253
Laurel was right.

230
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:44,888
I hacked Blood's
cell phone records.

231
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,606
The alderman and Gold have
stayed buddies

232
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,007
since Zandia
orphanage.

233
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:49,676
So what? They
kept in touch.

234
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:51,094
Doesn't exactly mean
that Sebastian Blood

235
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:52,729
is the man
in the skull mask.

236
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:55,265
His last name is Blood.
That can't be a good sign.

237
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:57,767
Felicity, he's dedicated
his life, risked his life

238
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,402
to help the people
of the Glades.

239
00:10:59,404 --> 00:11:01,321
And in his spare time,
he's a murderer

240
00:11:01,323 --> 00:11:03,173
trying to create an army
of human weapons?

241
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,275
You're a personal bodyguard
who fights crime at night

242
00:11:05,277 --> 00:11:07,160
with his billionaire boss.
Not a lot of people

243
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:09,813
show their real face in public.

244
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:12,532
Oliver, what
are you thinking?

245
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:16,202
Laurel gave me
a case number to start with.

246
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:19,339
We need to know if Sebastian
really killed his father,

247
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:21,124
then we figure out
if there's a chance

248
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:23,460
he has the Mirakuru formula.
I'm on it.

249
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:25,095
And what if this
is just another trap,

250
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:26,846
set by Laurel?
She could be setting you up,

251
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:29,749
and this time, you wouldn't
have Sara to save you.

252
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:37,724
Asking a cute girl to meet you
down by the tracks, Harper?

253
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:39,726
Good thing Thea and I are tight.

254
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:41,260
I have to show you
something.

255
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:42,695
Easy there, tiger.

256
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:49,402
You're not even bleeding!
When did you start juicing?

257
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,904
I'm not.

258
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:53,272
Then how do you explain
what I just saw?

259
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,244
You remember that night around
Christmas when I went missing?

260
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:00,163
Yeah, Thea
and I were pissed.

261
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:03,166
I never told you guys
what really happened.

262
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:05,718
You were right
about your friend Max.

263
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,754
He didn't OD,
he was murdered.

264
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:09,722
He was injected with something,

265
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:12,225
and I was injected with the same thing,
but it didn't kill me.

266
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:14,427
It made me--
it made me stronger.

267
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,346
Thea must be
freaking.

268
00:12:16,348 --> 00:12:18,130
No, she doesn't know,
I don't want her to.

269
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:20,266
Why not?
No, I can't, not yet.

270
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:22,936
Not until I know more about
what happened to me.

271
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:24,404
I don't want to scare her.

272
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:26,439
And you're not worried
about scaring me?

273
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,741
Come on, I was going crazy
not telling someone.

274
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:30,643
So what are you
going to do?

275
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:35,021
Well, the Arrow once told me
all I was good for was taking a beating.

276
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,825
Maybe it's time I started
handing out a few of my own.

277
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:41,173
I don't follow.

278
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:44,416
Now I don't need his help
to protect this city.

279
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:47,502
Let's find us a bad guy.

280
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:49,388
I have good news

281
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,007
and bad news.
I suggest the good news first;

282
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,209
it tends to soften
the blow of the bad news.

283
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:56,478
Okay, dealer's choice.

284
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,215
Good news is we found the case file
on Sebastian's dad's murder.

285
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:02,100
Anything in it
to suggest he killed him?

286
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,685
Oliver, meet bad news.

287
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,687
That file was
sealed years ago.

288
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:07,990
And since the file
is over 27 years old,

289
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:09,758
there is no digital copy
for me to hack.

290
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,361
The only hard copy
is stored the old-fashioned way

291
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:14,446
in the city archives.
So I go in

292
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:16,415
and take it--
the old fashioned way.

293
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:19,251
Except security in the file room
is so old school,

294
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,620
you need a key card to get in,
which, even if you had,

295
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:23,972
you wouldn't know where
to start looking for the file.

296
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:29,044
An assistant DA would.

297
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:47,462
You said
you needed my help.

298
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:49,931
Now I need yours.
What do you need?

299
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,651
You.

300
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:04,546
You know what I really miss
about being home?

301
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:08,450
My bed.

302
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:13,889
I don't know if I even remember
what a bed feels like anymore.

303
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:16,892
And you probably
never will.

304
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:19,094
And neither
will I.

305
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,430
Sara...

306
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:23,598
You don't have to do that.

307
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,268
We're going to find
a way off the island.

308
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,687
Ok?

309
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:33,641
You just--you just
have to trust me.

310
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:37,612
Last time
I trusted you

311
00:14:37,614 --> 00:14:40,232
was right before
the "Gambit" went down.

312
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,751
I haven't gotten
a chance to say this...

313
00:14:43,953 --> 00:14:45,320
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:48,123
I know this is my fault.

315
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,958
And none of this
would have happened

316
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,228
if I hadn't invited you
on the boat with me.

317
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,214
That's not
exactly true.

318
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:57,966
I mean...

319
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:00,202
I was the one
who said yes.

320
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:03,004
And it was only
half because of your charm.

321
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:04,606
And the other half?

322
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:06,558
Do you remember
when you spilled that beer on me

323
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,176
at Tommy's party?

324
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:09,895
No.

325
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:12,847
But I never left
one of Tommy's parties

326
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:14,483
with my memory intact.

327
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:17,035
Well, I wasn't even
supposed to go.

328
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:18,520
But I snuck
out of the house

329
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:20,038
because I knew
you were going to be there.

330
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,574
And I had this--

331
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:25,627
I had this embarrassing
crush on you.

332
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,963
And Laurel,
she knew it.

333
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:32,467
And that's why the party got
broken up by the cops.

334
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:34,586
She tipped off our dad.

335
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:36,421
Then I was grounded
for a month,

336
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,473
and the next thing
I knew...

337
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:42,227
You and Laurel
were together.

338
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:45,046
You think she did
all that on purpose?

339
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,218
Not everybody's
what they seem.

340
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:54,556
We should
get some sleep.

341
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,886
You ready for this?

342
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:27,189
Whatever it takes.

343
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:30,925
We're going in.

344
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:33,228
At least the security cameras
are from this century.

345
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:36,782
And now
they're toast.

346
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:39,201
You have exactly seven minutes
until the system reboots.

347
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:44,322
Hey, check it out.

348
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:49,661
This could
take a while.

349
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,380
You have six minutes.

350
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:01,590
I'm rebooting the monitors.

351
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:03,625
There's a trojan
plugging our system.

352
00:17:03,627 --> 00:17:06,511
It's probably some punk.

353
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,689
Uh-oh.

354
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:20,909
Oliver...

355
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:22,644
What's wrong?

356
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:24,863
It looks we've got the one
rent-a-cop with a brain here.

357
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:28,116
If there's a camera nearby,
I recommend hiding.

358
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:30,418
Look there.

359
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:33,922
You got to send
some officers here.

360
00:17:33,924 --> 00:17:35,173
Starling's finest
will be there any minute.

361
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:36,958
You need to get
out of there now.

362
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,094
We're not leaving
without the file.

363
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:40,662
Laurel...

364
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:44,382
I can't find it!

365
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:46,834
Up there, third floor.

366
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:54,676
Hurry, Oliver.

367
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:05,120
Wait! Case number SC43878!

368
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:06,571
This is it!

369
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:08,573
Vigilante,
we know you're here!

370
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,909
Close everything off, now!

371
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:14,746
They're blocking
our only way out!

372
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,047
It's not our only way.

373
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:18,466
Get to the east wall
and wait for me.

374
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:22,504
Drop your weapon!

375
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,422
We tried going through
all the security footage

376
00:19:04,424 --> 00:19:06,224
at the city archives
to see if anyone swiped the file

377
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:07,642
over the last few days.
Did you see anyone?

378
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:09,844
Just this.

379
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,564
It's all been erased.

380
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,316
So what happened
when you reversed the footprint

381
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:17,201
to see who hacked in
before you?

382
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:19,437
I struck out again.
It must have been an inside job.

383
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,189
Meaning?
As a city alderman,

384
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:22,740
Blood would have
had access to the files.

385
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,391
Oliver, anyone on city payroll
could have done this.

386
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:25,910
He's running for mayor.

387
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:27,445
One hint that
he killed his father,

388
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:28,996
and his political future
is dead in the water.

389
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:31,049
Wait, I thought you two were
supposed to be friends.

390
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:33,084
Don't you think you ought to give him
the benefit of the doubt?

391
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:35,336
Please keep digging
into Blood's past

392
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,071
and see if there's
anything that could help us.

393
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:39,257
Where you going?

394
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:41,876
To give a friend
the benefit of the doubt.

395
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:47,215
What, are you still
giving me the cold shoulder?

396
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:48,433
Are you still
not telling me

397
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:50,718
what the hell
is going on with you?

398
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,186
Am I interrupting?

399
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:54,338
He and I would
actually have to be talking

400
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,023
for you to be
interrupting.

401
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,225
Can I try?

402
00:19:57,227 --> 00:20:00,061
Be my guest.

403
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:01,896
Tell her.

404
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,531
No.

405
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,366
Now what do you
got for me?

406
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:07,702
This guy in the Glades,
the Starling Slasher.

407
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,238
Word on the street is,
he's got a thing for prostitutes.

408
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,241
And by thing, I mean he has
a thing for slicing them up.

409
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:14,992
Mostly hunts in Crescent Circle.

410
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:16,544
Sounds like
a great guy.

411
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:18,329
Hmm, yeah. Problem is,
he's some big shot lawyer,

412
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:20,281
so no one has
the sack to ID him.

413
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:22,583
Wait, this sounds exactly like someone
the Arrow would go after.

414
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:23,751
But we don't need
the Arrow anymore.

415
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:24,836
We're going to have
to bait him.

416
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:26,320
What pro is going to let us

417
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:28,089
dangle her in front
of a psycho?

418
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,174
No. No, no way--
Thea.

419
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:31,392
No!

420
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,728
Um, Sin has a date.

421
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,763
She has hoping
to borrow an outfit.

422
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:37,682
You know, something slutty.

423
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:40,134
I have the perfect
first date outfit.

424
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:42,270
Guarantees a second one.

425
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,437
Great.

426
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:44,739
This guy won't know
what hit him.

427
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:47,775
Or girl.
Whatever you're into.

428
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:49,777
I could do your make-up
or your hair.

429
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:51,412
You are not touching
the hair, Queen.

430
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:54,315
Ok.

431
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:05,626
You looking for me?

432
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:07,461
Sebastian.
Good to see you.

433
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:09,180
You too, man.

434
00:21:09,182 --> 00:21:10,882
Listen, I'm so sorry, but I'm
right in the middle

435
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:12,600
of a polling snafu.

436
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:14,685
I'll be quick. I just
had a question about Laurel.

437
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,137
Of course.
Is everything ok?

438
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:17,722
Not sure. I ran
into her the other day,

439
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:20,191
and something just seemed off.
I know the two of you

440
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:21,609
have been spending
a lot of time together,

441
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:24,061
I just wanted to know
if you knew anything.

442
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:25,646
Well, we've traded
phone calls,

443
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:27,615
but she's in trial,
I've been campaigning.

444
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:29,283
We haven't really
been able to connect.

445
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:30,952
Nothing happened
between the two of you?

446
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:35,289
Not an argument
or a fight or something?

447
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,408
If I didn't know
any better,

448
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,210
I'd say you were coming to me like
a jealous ex-boyfriend.

449
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:42,830
No. Just--no, I'm just
looking out for a friend.

450
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:44,832
And I hope you do the same.

451
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:46,000
Of course.

452
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:48,553
Listen, I will
take care of Laurel.

453
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,871
Thank you
for letting me know.

454
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:11,157
You're new.

455
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,393
Got to start
somewhere, right?

456
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:14,894
Get in.

457
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:26,923
Romantic.

458
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:28,908
You're pretty.

459
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,878
You're disgusting.

460
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,382
I see you'd like
to play rough.

461
00:22:44,426 --> 00:22:46,693
Wait!

462
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:48,928
I've got money!
Keep it.

463
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:02,325
Roy, Roy, stop it,
you're killing him!

464
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,713
Oh! Sin?

465
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:08,331
Sin, I'm sorry.

466
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,750
We have to call
an ambulance.

467
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:20,927
Point blank range.

468
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:24,397
Single shot to the heart
from a low angle.

469
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:28,468
Obviously the handiwork
of someone quite scared,

470
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,105
and very small.

471
00:23:32,107 --> 00:23:34,024
How come the police
didn't arrest you?

472
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:36,359
I knew how to cover my tracks.

473
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:39,529
A skill you've obviously lost since
you've gotten bigger.

474
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:41,998
You know how close you came

475
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,801
to allowing the Vigilante
to destroy everything?

476
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:46,536
Someone spoke out of turn.

477
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,421
I've taken care of the problem.

478
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,493
Your mother was
not our problem.

479
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:56,112
Laurel Lance is.

480
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,830
You were the one who told me
to get close to her.

481
00:23:57,832 --> 00:24:00,166
You said that it was part of the plan
to hurt the Vigilante.

482
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:01,868
It is.

483
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,837
But you being
sloppy isn't.

484
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,024
Fix this, Mr. Blood.

485
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:11,895
You don't want me
to fix it for you.

486
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:18,268
Brother Daily.

487
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,487
I need you to take care
of something for me.

488
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:36,836
Whoever you are,
I'm calling the police!

489
00:24:36,838 --> 00:24:39,339
No need to.
Remember me?

490
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:42,041
Officer Daily, right?

491
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:44,060
What's this all about?

492
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:46,096
What are you doing
in my apartment.

493
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,148
I have a warrant.

494
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,432
A warrant for what?

495
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:51,384
We found these
in your bedroom, Ms. Lance.

496
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:53,219
These aren't prescribed to you.
That's a felony.

497
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:56,389
What?! This is ridiculous!

498
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:59,109
You're under arrest for possession of
a controlled substance.

499
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,777
You have the right
to remain silent.

500
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:02,495
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

501
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:03,897
in a court of law.

502
00:25:19,691 --> 00:25:21,921
I know what
this looks like.

503
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:23,794
But you have
to listen to me.

504
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:28,427
I know what's happening.

505
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:31,897
Sebastian Blood...
He's setting me up,

506
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,499
because he knows
I'm onto him.

507
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,684
He's--he's trying
to frame me!

508
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:37,936
So he planted drugs
in your apartment?

509
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:41,106
But--no, no!
Forget about the drugs.

510
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:43,325
The point is, is that he

511
00:25:43,327 --> 00:25:45,777
is the one
behind this witch hunt.

512
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,282
Sebastian called your boss.
He's worried about you.

513
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:52,201
No, no!

514
00:25:52,203 --> 00:25:54,837
He wasn't worried
about me.

515
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:57,256
He's trying
to discredit me!

516
00:25:57,258 --> 00:25:59,324
Don't you see
what he's doing?

517
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:01,543
What I see is that you
have tested positive for opiates.

518
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:03,011
I see that you have been
lying to me,

519
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:05,664
and I see that you have been
stealing from me!

520
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,268
I can explain that.

521
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,720
Every person that stands
where you're standing now

522
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:13,605
says the same thing.

523
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:15,891
Dad...
The DUI,

524
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:18,610
the paranoia about Blood,
you're looking like hell.

525
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:23,982
You got a problem, Laurel.

526
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:25,584
No.

527
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:27,819
It's addiction.
No!

528
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:30,072
It runs in the family.

529
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:34,910
You can't pin it
on Sebastian Blood.

530
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:37,546
Daddy, please,
you have to believe me!

531
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:41,250
Please!

532
00:26:41,252 --> 00:26:42,968
Please.

533
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,105
I don't, baby.

534
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,909
No!

535
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:52,578
No!

536
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,852
How is she?

537
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:02,071
I don't know.

538
00:27:02,073 --> 00:27:05,357
I don't know
anything anymore.

539
00:27:07,823 --> 00:27:10,658
I'll--I'll get her home.

540
00:27:13,462 --> 00:27:15,764
Thanks.

541
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:26,507
Anthony?

542
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:29,024
Are you there?

543
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:30,891
I'm here, Sara.

544
00:27:30,893 --> 00:27:32,911
I was hoping that
you would reach out to me.

545
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:34,529
Are you alone?

546
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:36,698
Yes.

547
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:43,070
Are you all right?

548
00:27:43,072 --> 00:27:44,872
You're not hurt,
are you?

549
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:48,376
Do you even care?
You were going to shoot me.

550
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:49,711
No.

551
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,212
No, Sara.

552
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:53,681
I swear, you were
never in danger, I swear.

553
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:57,418
So it's ok because you were just
planning on murdering Shado?

554
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:02,256
Her name was Shado.

555
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:03,808
Yes.

556
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,644
And you killed her,
Anthony.

557
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:09,864
And I'm going to have to live
with that for the rest of my life.

558
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:13,117
I never set out to hurt anyone.

559
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,571
I started this quest
to save people;

560
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:19,540
to save the human race.

561
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:22,609
I know.

562
00:28:24,112 --> 00:28:25,496
Sara.

563
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:28,782
I know you think
that this ship rescued you

564
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:31,585
when you were stranded at sea.

565
00:28:33,054 --> 00:28:35,589
The truth is...

566
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:42,229
You rescued me.

567
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:45,632
But now the darkness,
it's threatening me again.

568
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:50,237
I need you, Sara.

569
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:52,406
Please.

570
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:54,808
Save me.

571
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:12,877
How's he doing?

572
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:15,212
The damage done to his head
and lower abdomen is severe.

573
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:16,314
He ruptured his spleen

574
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:18,339
and he has massive
swelling in his brain.

575
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:21,352
Thankfully, he got medical
attention quickly,

576
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:23,554
so he's got a shot.

577
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:25,773
You did a good thing
here, Roy.

578
00:29:30,678 --> 00:29:33,647
What happened to you out there?

579
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:34,848
I don't know.

580
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,850
We nearly killed this guy.

581
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:38,452
Roy?

582
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:39,653
Are you ok?

583
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,155
What are you
doing here?

584
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:42,689
Sin called me.
Why did you do that?

585
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:46,043
Because she was
worried about you.

586
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:48,712
Who is that guy?

587
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:50,714
He was my date.

588
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:52,866
We put him there.

589
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:55,669
You--you did this?

590
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,471
Just drop it.
Please.

591
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:59,306
Roy, something
is happening to you.

592
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:01,058
I'm not judging you.

593
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,177
I'm not angry with you.

594
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,346
I'm on your side.

595
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:07,314
I just want to help you.

596
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:10,234
You can't.

597
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:14,054
I--I got to go.

598
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:16,357
Roy!

599
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:42,566
You haven't
said much.

600
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:44,718
Are you working
on your lecture?

601
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
No lecture.

602
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:49,690
I suppose you think I was wrong
about Sebastian, too, though.

603
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:52,092
I think...

604
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:54,862
that you have everyone fooled,

605
00:30:54,864 --> 00:30:58,932
because you want people to think
that none of this gets to you.

606
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:00,868
And that you don't need
anyone's help.

607
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,769
I don't!

608
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:05,072
Except, I know you!

609
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:10,794
This isn't you.

610
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:16,950
What happened
to no lectures?

611
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:23,957
I just--I need
a glass of water.

612
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:26,777
Do you mind?

613
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,779
Please.

614
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,450
Leave him. He's not important.

615
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:51,518
Hello, Laurel.

616
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:03,259
Laurel.

617
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:08,659
It's me.

618
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,993
Someone
came after Laurel.

619
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,161
Do you know
where they took her?

620
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,380
I think I have
a pretty good idea.

621
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,894
If that mask
is supposed to scare me...

622
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,580
All that it's doing

623
00:32:46,582 --> 00:32:50,367
is confirming what I've already
known for a while now.

624
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:55,789
You're one sick
son of a bitch, Sebastian.

625
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,240
30,000 years ago,

626
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,576
masks invested
their wearer with authority,

627
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,211
like a God.

628
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,579
You're insane.

629
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,548
I'm not the one
making drug-addled,

630
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,301
unsubstantiated accusations
against Starling's favorite son.

631
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:10,187
If I can find out
the truth,

632
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,055
then others can, too.

633
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:14,724
You found out
nothing.

634
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,726
You know nothing.

635
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,930
Get away from her!

636
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:25,619
Or I will put...You...Down.

637
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:27,020
And to think,

638
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:28,938
a few short months ago,

639
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,991
you were trying
to arrest him.

640
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:33,877
You wanted me here.
I'm here.

641
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:37,547
Let...Her...Go.

642
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,586
No, I think
she should witness this.

643
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:21,958
Aaah!

644
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:40,443
Take off his mask.

645
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,980
I need to see.

646
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,383
Sweetheart.

647
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:37,153
Are you all right?

648
00:35:37,155 --> 00:35:38,321
Yeah.

649
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:42,192
Looks like Daily
was behind this whole thing.

650
00:35:42,194 --> 00:35:45,495
Son of a bitch volunteered for the raid
that got Hilton killed.

651
00:35:45,497 --> 00:35:47,363
And we found
the accelerant that he used

652
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:50,417
to torch the Langford Institute
in his apartment.

653
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:53,736
I thought it was Sebastian.

654
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:57,373
I was so sure.

655
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,459
Yeah.

656
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:02,245
Well, that's the thing about
the booze and the pills.

657
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:05,381
You know, same thing
that dulls your pain...

658
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:08,068
clouds the judgment.

659
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:17,560
Can we have a minute?

660
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:23,099
Yeah.

661
00:36:27,755 --> 00:36:30,657
Are you here to say,
I told you so?

662
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:32,542
We're dropping
the possession charges

663
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:34,961
and you won't be charged
in Daily's shooting.

664
00:36:34,963 --> 00:36:36,729
It was clearly self defense.

665
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:40,950
You don't seem
that thrilled for me.

666
00:36:40,952 --> 00:36:43,253
Are you going
to look me in the eye

667
00:36:43,255 --> 00:36:45,955
and tell me you don't have
a substance abuse problem?

668
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,979
The DA's office has
a generous severance package.

669
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:54,630
Wait!

670
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:56,683
Wait, let me explain
to DA Spencer.

671
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:58,351
I can--I can tell
her everything!

672
00:36:58,353 --> 00:37:00,270
This isn't coming
from Spencer, Laurel.

673
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:01,771
This is me.

674
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:04,473
I'm the one that hired you.

675
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:06,826
I'm sorry.

676
00:37:06,828 --> 00:37:08,828
But you're done.

677
00:37:17,955 --> 00:37:21,407
Did Laurel
really shoot him?

678
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:23,593
She saved my life.

679
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:26,012
That's a good thing,
Oliver.

680
00:37:26,014 --> 00:37:29,048
You ok?

681
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,141
She really had me believing
that Sebastian Blood

682
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,304
was a criminal mastermind,

683
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:37,140
and the only reason
that I nearly believed her

684
00:37:37,142 --> 00:37:39,976
was because it was Laurel.

685
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:44,347
I do have a blind spot
where she's concerned.

686
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,218
Not anymore.

687
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,204
Certainly know how
to talk yourself out of a victory.

688
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:52,989
It's a gift.

689
00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:54,757
Take the win, man.

690
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,659
Daily's dead, you destroyed
the serum.

691
00:37:56,661 --> 00:37:59,629
It's over.

692
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:06,135
No, it isn't.

693
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:14,677
Hey.

694
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:17,313
Slow night?

695
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:22,318
Something I said?

696
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,037
Don't take it
personally.

697
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:27,523
He won't even make
eye contact with me.

698
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:29,943
Something happen?

699
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:34,364
He put someone
in the hospital.

700
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:37,834
He's a little stingy
with the details,

701
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:40,903
but.... You should have
seen this guy.

702
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:42,789
I don't understand
how any human

703
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:45,258
could have done that
to another.

704
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,744
Each day, he becomes
more and more like somebody

705
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:51,714
I don't even know.

706
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:54,050
He won't even
listen to me.

707
00:38:54,052 --> 00:38:56,252
I know someone
he'll listen to.

708
00:38:57,888 --> 00:39:00,306
Sara,
are you still there?

709
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:02,258
When you first
found me,

710
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,361
I felt like
you were my savior.

711
00:39:05,363 --> 00:39:07,146
And letting me
into your work,

712
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:09,115
I felt like I was a part
of something bigger.

713
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:11,067
You are, Sara.

714
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:13,102
It was only because
I didn't want to see

715
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:14,871
what you were
really doing.

716
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:17,407
I mean, what you did
to those people on the boat,

717
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:21,794
and how you tortured
them for science...

718
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:25,581
How I was glad
that I wasn't one of them.

719
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:30,753
But now...

720
00:39:30,755 --> 00:39:35,958
I'd rather be dead
than keep being a part of this.

721
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,396
You ungrateful bitch.

722
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:43,316
You think you know
what torture is?

723
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:45,768
You have no idea.

724
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,971
But I will show you.
I am going to hunt you down.

725
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:50,940
Both of you,
and I will show--

726
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:14,430
Let's go find Slade.

727
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:18,468
It's done.

728
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,669
They think
it was all Daily.

729
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:23,690
He sacrificed himself
for our cause.

730
00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:25,641
A good start.

731
00:40:25,643 --> 00:40:28,010
But the magnitude
of your negligence

732
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:31,898
requires a greater sacrifice.

733
00:40:38,405 --> 00:40:43,993
Your incompetence has now
cost four lives, alderman.

734
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:48,131
Fail me again...

735
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:51,200
and yours will be
the fifth.

736
00:41:02,813 --> 00:41:04,814
If that was supposed to
go through my other leg,

737
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:06,682
you missed.

738
00:41:06,684 --> 00:41:09,819
You seem to be
healing pretty well.

739
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:17,360
You're stronger,
you heal faster,

740
00:41:17,362 --> 00:41:19,779
but you're not in control.

741
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:22,731
The serum that you were
exposed to, it changes your body

742
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:25,284
but it also warps your mind.

743
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:27,236
How do you know
so much about it?

744
00:41:27,238 --> 00:41:28,737
I've seen it before.

745
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,289
It twists men.

746
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:34,243
Turns them into
someone they don't recognize.

747
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:38,047
Someone dangerous.

748
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:40,883
Maybe you should put
another arrow through me.

749
00:41:40,885 --> 00:41:43,019
This time through my heart.

750
00:41:43,021 --> 00:41:45,772
There's another
way, Roy.

751
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:47,557
I can teach you...

752
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:50,977
to control
your new ability.

753
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:54,113
And to control
yourself.

754
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:56,416
Let me help you.

755
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:02,088
When do we start?

756
