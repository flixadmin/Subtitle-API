2
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,640
All right, everybody. Listen up.

3
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,351
Tuco Salamanca.

4
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,479
For those of you who were
not with us this morning

5
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,772
we raided his headquarters.

6
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,816
Also his last-known address.

7
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:53,112
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

8
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,239
We netted a bunch
of his lieutenants.

9
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,907
The big man himself
smelled us coming.

10
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,745
So study the face.
Study the file.

11
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,331
Get a big old raging hard-on

12
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,126
at the idea of catching
this piece of shit.

13
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,754
My apologies
to the H.R. department.

14
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,800
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

15
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,552
All right.

16
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,679
On the hit parade, 1998.

17
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,848
Reputed to have whacked
one "Dog" Paulson

18
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,724
back when our homegrown bandidos

19
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,686
were wresting the crank trade
away from the So Cal biker gangs.

20
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,314
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

21
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,152
And for my money, seeing how
he customarily deals with rivals,

22
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,988
I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance

23
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,448
of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

24
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,618
Hats over your heart
for that dirtball.

25
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,829
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that

26
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,558
but as usual,
we couldn't make it stick.

27
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,333
Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

28
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,462
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

29
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,883
Yeah, yeah. I know it's... We all
know what's going on down there.

30
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,930
We sure as hell don't want it
going on up here,

31
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,887
which brings us to the good news.

32
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:04,600
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

33
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,687
- This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
- No-Doze.

34
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,399
Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law,

35
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,234
a.k.a. Gonzo.

36
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:18,906
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body...

37
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,593
Either hiding it there or pulling it out.
We're still not sure.

38
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,162
...when he got his arm crushed clean off.
Heh, heh.

39
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,415
Anyone wanna see the photos, they'
re on my website. Hilarious.

40
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,584
Anyway. The upshot is

41
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:36,131
we got us a nice, big, juicy,
bloody fingerprint

42
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,760
which belongs to Señor Tuco.

43
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:43,555
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

44
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,226
That is,
provided we find this guy.

45
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,729
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

46
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

47
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,067
What the hell was that? Jesus.

48
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,778
Wanna try that again?

49
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,198
- Do you wanna find this guy?
- Yes!

50
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,951
- Are we going to find this guy?
- Yes!

51
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,452
- Louder, damn it!
- Yes!

52
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,579
Give me a "hell, yeah!"
Hell, yeah!

53
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,498
- Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

54
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:13,210
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.

55
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,299
They ain't gonna find him.

56
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,718
Guy is in México by now.

57
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,930
Appearances, Gomey. Tsk, tsk.
It's all about appearances.

58
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,476
Listen, I gotta take
some personal time.

59
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,395
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

60
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,149
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

61
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:39,486
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

62
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,656
Damn. You don't think he...?

63
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,243
Holler if you need me.

64
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,329
All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

65
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,572
- This is the most recent photo.
- We haven't taken many lately, so...

66
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,910
But that's what
he looks like now.

67
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,329
Without the hair.

68
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,375
Hey, it's me.

69
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,087
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate
you sparing us your day off.

70
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,714
No worries.
Happy to help.

71
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,175
Yeah, this is helpful.
Good.

72
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,761
What about height and weight?
Five eleven,

73
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,097
most recently, about 170.

74
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,726
One sixty-five.
That's what I weigh.

75
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,771
I guess he weighs a little less.

76
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,233
That's fine. That's close enough.
Good.

77
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,777
What about other
distinguishing features?

78
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,279
Tattoos or moles or scars?

79
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:51,535
Anything that might help us.
Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

80
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,537
That's fine.

81
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,580
Is that the list of medications?
Yes.

82
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,291
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

83
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:02,212
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

84
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,923
Has he been depressed?

85
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,891
He's, um, been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

86
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,810
Yeah.

87
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,314
Last night, he was, uh, agitated.

88
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,649
Agitated?

89
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:27,320
Yeah. When he came home last
night, he was agitated, upset.

90
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,613
Upset in general?

91
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,241
Or upset because
of something particular?

92
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,452
Um...

93
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:40,000
When I asked him what
was wrong, he said:

94
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,752
"I don't know where to begin."

95
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,840
Then he just walked out of the
room... Out of the bathroom.

96
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,675
I was in the tub,
I was taking a bath.

97
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,928
...and when I came out about
10 minutes later, he was gone.

98
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,723
Nothing else missing?

99
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,936
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

100
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,815
But... What about the phone call?

101
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,360
Uh... I'm looking into it.

102
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,490
What phone call?
Walt's cell phone rang.

103
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:16,036
He pulled it out, looked at
it, and didn't answer it.

104
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,537
But then, a short time after,

105
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,873
he wandered out of the bathroom.

106
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,875
I mean,

107
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,919
couldn't that be, uh,

108
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,004
important, right?

109
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,635
Anything else you can think of?

110
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,387
Anything else. Um...

111
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,723
No. I called
the credit card providers,

112
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:42,062
and there's no report
of any recent activity.

113
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,608
I... Let's see. I checked with
every hospital within 50 miles.

114
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,902
Every police station.
Every morgue.

115
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,780
So, no, I really don't...
I don't have anything else.

116
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,492
I was actually hoping
that you had something else,

117
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,203
being that you're the expert.

118
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,042
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,585
No worries.

120
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,629
I think this is
good enough to start.

121
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,548
Gives us plenty to work on.

122
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,261
Mrs. White.
Thank you.

123
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,888
Walter.
Thank you.

124
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,943
So that cell-phone call she's
talking about? I ran it.

125
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,070
And?
Never happened.

126
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,738
No record of it.

127
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,241
Second cell phone.
Yeah. I'm thinking.

128
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,759
I understand.

129
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,554
Out.

130
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,723
Get away from me!

131
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,895
Settle down, bitch.

132
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:33,400
- You gonna shoot me, huh?
- Shoot me in here!

133
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,902
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

134
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,154
That way, you have to clean it up!

135
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,535
It's your ride, retard.

136
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,662
I ain't gotta clean jack.
Now get out.

137
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:56,606
Get up.

138
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,146
Oh, my God.

139
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,440
Don't do this, Tuco.

140
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,193
No more posters?

141
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,488
Walter Jr.'s making more.

142
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,202
Thank you, Marie.

143
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,792
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

144
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,546
I mean, he just doesn't
strike me as the type.

145
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,381
He'll turn up.

146
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,726
Okay, the whole tiara thing,

147
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,480
- I just find it bewildering that...
- Marie.

148
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,567
- You didn't believe that...
- Marie.

149
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,237
Not now.

150
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,165
Empty your pockets.

151
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,363
Thought your name was Heisenberg,

152
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,366
"Walter Hartwell White."

153
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,786
Heisenberg is kind of
a pseudonym.

154
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,541
You know, a business name.

155
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,174
Yeah.

156
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,099
I like doing business
with a family man.

157
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,893
There's always
a lot of collateral.

158
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,639
Answer me one thing.

159
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,311
Can I trust you?

160
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,774
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

161
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,535
Sit down.

162
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,171
DEA...

163
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,634
hit my place of business
this morning.

164
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,053
About a hundred cops
looking for me.

165
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,139
You two haven't
been talking, right?

166
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,392
No.

167
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,481
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

168
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,734
Everybody except Gonzo.

169
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,986
That's weird, right?

170
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,657
I mean, don't you think
that that's weird?

171
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,576
It's weird. Yes.

172
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:44,747
Unusual.

173
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:50,670
Last two days, I couldn't
get Gonzo on the phone.

174
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:55,174
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

175
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,886
Explain to me.

176
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:04,183
How is it my fault that that little
bitch did not know his place?

177
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,025
I saw this coming.

178
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,821
I can see the future, you know?

179
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,701
It's this gift that I have
deep inside my head.

180
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,330
I knew last night they were
gonna come try and bust me.

181
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,040
Gonzo.

182
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,795
He went and snitched to the cops!

183
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,631
That lousy son of a bitch!

184
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:42,555
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

185
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,350
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut
him, I'm gonna skin him,

186
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,062
and I'm gonna stuff his hide
for a heavy bag,

187
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,400
and every time I hit him, it's going
to be like a lesson to myself!

188
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,654
You never, never trust the
people that you love!

189
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:10,875
So you plan to ice Gonzo,
like, future tense?

190
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,002
What?

191
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,339
You're saying, Tuco...

192
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,342
You're saying that Gonzo

193
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,930
is currently operating
as a police informant

194
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,264
as far as you know?

195
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,937
I'm very sorry to hear that.

196
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,981
That's disappointing.

197
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,608
Yeah.

198
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,778
- I'd waste him too, yo.
- Shut up.

199
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,363
Okay.

200
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,449
They're out there
looking for me right now.

201
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,452
They got ghetto birds
and black ops.

202
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,790
I need to get high. Oh, fu...
I need to get good and high.

203
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,756
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

204
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,010
No, it's, uh... it's killer.

205
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,762
Yeah, seriously.

206
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:12,311
So I was thinking last night.

207
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,146
I came up with this great idea.

208
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,483
México.

209
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,277
Mexico?

210
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,072
Ha, ha. We'll disappear
way out in the jungle.

211
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,032
We'll set you up in a superlab.

212
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,743
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

213
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,829
And no Federales
are gonna mess with us

214
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,248
because I got my people there.

215
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,250
Connections.

216
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,671
We're going to make beaucoup
bucks, Heisenberg, huh?

217
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,965
Tuco, I...

218
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,801
I have a wife and family.

219
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,179
So what?
You'll get another one.

220
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:51,434
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I can't just

221
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,020
uproot my life like that.

222
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,188
Yeah, man.
I mean, me neither.

223
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,943
Who's talking to you?

224
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,325
You need me, man,

225
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,703
because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

226
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,041
Yeah.

227
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,834
I'll tell you something, yo.

228
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,879
You never tried nothing like it.

229
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,214
Stink or no stink,

230
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:26,886
one bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

231
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,558
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

232
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,102
Careful when you hit it.

233
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,147
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

234
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,736
It's got a secret ingredient.

235
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,531
What secret ingredient?

236
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,534
Chili powder.

237
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,168
I hate chili powder.

238
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,217
This blue magic, this is money.

239
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,513
You keep cooking this,
Heisenberg.

240
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,269
We're gonna rewrite
history with this.

241
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:26,112
All right. Time to clean the
menudo out from between your ears.

242
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,241
No, no, no. No,
I need him, Tuco.

243
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,451
I need him very, very badly.

244
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,955
He's my partner.

245
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,252
And if he doesn't go,
I don't go.

246
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,632
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now

247
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,635
to smuggle us back down, and
they're gonna be here by sunset

248
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,886
and you're gonna be
on that truck,

249
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,305
or you're gonna be dead!

250
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,851
And you...

251
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,063
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

252
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,330
Where are you going?

253
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,666
Louis is taking me
to the train station.

254
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,626
We'll put these up.

255
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,839
No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
He wants to help, let him help.

256
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,468
I mean, how long has it
been since you've slept?

257
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,763
Yeah, she's right, Sky. Why
don't you lay down a while?

258
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,434
For Christ sake,
you got a bun in the oven.

259
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,936
I got my cell if you need me.

260
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,230
- Okay?
- Okay.

261
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:48,319
- Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
- All right. Bye.

262
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:55,743
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet

263
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,786
bodes well.

264
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:03,250
Well, I mean, if he...
You know.

265
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,338
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

266
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,132
There's got to be something.

267
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,218
Some detail that
we haven't picked up on.

268
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,805
What about the second cell phone?
Ah, Jesus.

269
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,643
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

270
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,146
Okay.
What are you talking about?

271
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:32,571
Uh, the call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

272
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,074
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

273
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,035
No incoming, no dropped
calls, nothing.

274
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,287
But his phone rang.
I heard it.

275
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:46,710
Um, all right. Well, then if that's the
case, he must have a second phone.

276
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,507
Wh... Why? What sense
would there be in that?

277
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,760
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

278
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,516
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

279
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,768
What does it mean?

280
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,104
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

281
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,441
It means Walt has a secret.

282
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,487
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

283
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:18,617
Okay. Oh, wow. Everyone. Okay.
Skyler, come on.

284
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:22,746
He kept cancer
from you for weeks.

285
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:28,586
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

286
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,213
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

287
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,757
Walt? Please.

288
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,555
What about the marijuana?

289
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,767
He's not on pot anymore.

290
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,978
Says who? Him?

291
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,314
Chemotherapy and
marijuana go together

292
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,443
like apple pie and Chevrolet.

293
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:57,323
Maybe he's addicted to the pot

294
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,575
and he owes his drug
dealer a lot of money.

295
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,870
Marie, you don't get
hooked on pot like that.

296
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,040
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

297
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:11,003
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

298
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,796
He may know something.

299
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:22,014
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

300
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,018
Then grasp.

301
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,529
Excuse me, ma'am.

302
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,617
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

303
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,203
No. I'm afraid not.

304
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,331
Why?
I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

305
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,960
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

306
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:55,381
He taught your son
chemistry in high school.

307
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,926
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

308
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,762
That was a long time ago.
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,641
It's my understanding that he and
Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

310
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,644
Really?
Yeah.

311
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,853
Huh.

312
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,358
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

313
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,902
He really tried to motivate him.

314
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,488
He was one of the
few teachers who cared.

315
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,490
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

316
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,243
I'm so sorry to hear
about his illness.

317
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,078
Please pass along
our best wishes.

318
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,623
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

319
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,041
He's missing, actually.

320
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,502
Just kind of walked off, or...

321
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,005
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around,

322
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,842
trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

323
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,760
That's terrible.

324
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,263
Anything we can do to help.

325
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,433
Well, if you could put me
in touch with your son...

326
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,686
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

327
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,896
Jesse's not answering either
phone number I have for him,

328
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,940
and no one seems to be home
at his house.

329
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:59,278
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

330
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,449
I don't necessarily.
I just, um...

331
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,868
Are you with the police?
No, ma'am. Not at all.

332
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:13,250
I'm with the
Drug Enforcement Administration.

333
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,002
Oh, my God.

334
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,295
Is my son in trouble?

335
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,964
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

336
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,675
Do I need to get a lawyer?

337
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,470
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this,

338
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,097
coming here and asking
questions about my son and...

339
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,785
Mrs. Pinkman, I swear to you,
I'm not here on official capacity.

340
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,604
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

341
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,564
I just wanna find
my brother-in-law.

342
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,819
His wife is worried sick, and
she's got a baby on the way.

343
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,865
I'm sorry.
I would like to help you,

344
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,576
but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

345
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:51,163
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

346
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,084
Well, thanks for your time.

347
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,755
Oh, uh...

348
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,341
If you could tell me
one more thing.

349
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,929
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

350
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:12,559
If he had spent half as much
time and money on his education

351
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,980
as he has on that
ridiculous bouncing car...

352
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,359
Low rider, huh?

353
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,153
Gomey, hey.

354
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,198
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out

355
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,492
a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo

356
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,121
registered to a one
Jesse Pinkman.

357
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,458
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

358
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:40,212
It's one of those jack-off low riders, so I'm
betting it's got a good shot that there is.

359
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,757
If so, can you go ahead and get
me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

360
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,703
Chili powder.

361
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,748
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

362
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,292
Whatever, man.

363
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,252
At least I tried something.

364
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,379
Hey, it almost worked too.

365
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,674
How's about
you leaving my gun, huh?

366
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,719
First you boost it, then
you leave it in your house.

367
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,596
My gun.

368
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:37,436
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

369
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,814
Well, at least
he wants you alive.

370
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,642
Hey, I don't get it.

371
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,853
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

372
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:24,316
I don't know.

373
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,611
Does it really matter?

374
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,782
If he finds out that Gonzo is
dead and not a police informant,

375
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,076
who does he automatically blame?

376
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,119
Us.

377
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,499
We need a plan.

378
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,004
- Think, think.
- Let's just bum-rush him, man.

379
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,465
You know, you crack him over
the head with something,

380
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,509
and I'll go for his gun.

381
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,308
Crack him over the head
with something?

382
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,189
Hey, you got the C-bomb,
man, all right?

383
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,066
You're as good
as checked out already.

384
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:10,362
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

385
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,989
Just...

386
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,119
Oh, so my life is not
the priority here,

387
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,871
because I'm gonna be
dead soon anyway.

388
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,540
That's your point?

389
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,084
Uh, yeah.

390
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,781
We gotta get him to take this.

391
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,367
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chili P.

392
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,411
That much has been established.

393
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,581
So unless you can convince
him to booty bump...

394
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,548
Eat!
We got a long ride ahead of us.

395
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,400
Oye, tio.

396
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
La comida esta
preparada, señor.

397
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,360
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

398
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,822
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

399
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,155
Take it easy, Tio.

400
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,660
I will feed you.
I eat first. That's the deal.

401
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,336
What?

402
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,012
I get it, I get it, I get it.

403
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,433
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

404
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,853
I tell you, Heisenberg.

405
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,022
Old people.

406
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,859
You feed them, huh?

407
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,695
You put them in a really
nice crib in the country,

408
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:00,282
and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

409
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,743
You better eat every bite of that.

410
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,728
What did you do that for?

411
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,855
God!

412
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,443
Ha, ha, ha. Shh.
Hey, look. Look.

413
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,278
There's nothing left.

414
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,350
What?
What do you want?

415
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,024
No.

416
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,486
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

417
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,946
Don't go there.

418
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,253
Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?

419
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,174
What, you don't like them?

420
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,511
One ding.

421
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,098
That means yes.
Tio don't like you.

422
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,188
Why don't you like them, Tio?

423
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,527
You don't trust them?

424
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:54,539
Why don't you trust them, Tio?
Tuco, come on. He's...

425
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,710
There clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

426
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,211
Shh.

427
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,892
Did they do something
to you, Tio?

428
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,356
Something that you don't like?

429
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:30,408
What did they do to you?
What did you do to my tio?

430
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,910
Nothing. Nothing.

431
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,037
Bullshit! My tio does not lie!

432
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,915
I don't know. I swear.
I don't know. I...

433
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:41,920
No, I... Maybe it was... I did change
the channel on his TV, but...

434
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,381
Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking,

435
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,093
he was watching one of
those, um... Those telenovels

436
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,929
with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

437
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,806
I told you not to
change the channel, man.

438
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:56,017
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's it.

439
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:08,279
Is that it, Tio?

440
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,408
Did they change your mamitas?

441
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,710
What are you telling me, Tio?

442
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,754
Huh?

443
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,798
Are they punking me?

444
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,607
Hey. No.

445
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,236
No, man. No.

446
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,904
Come here! Aah!
No.

447
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,658
No, no, Tuco.

448
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,501
Tuco, no. Tuco.

449
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,674
- Tuco.
- Shut up!

450
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,648
No. Please, no. God.
Please, no.

451
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,359
No, God.
I don't wanna die.

452
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,528
Tell me what you did, Walter!

453
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,032
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

454
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,994
No!
Tell me what you did!

455
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,085
We tried to poison you.

456
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,797
We tried to poison you,

457
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,720
because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth,

458
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,889
and you deserve to die.

459
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,725
Who's the bitch now?

460
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,206
Let him bleed.

461
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,810
The keys.

462
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,396
Tuco.

463
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,857
Oh, my God.

464
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,319
The cousins?

465
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,543
What the hell is going on?

466
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,224
Jesse Pinkman.

467
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,185
You're a hard man to find.

468
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,612
Oh, shit.

469
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,583
Easy.

470
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,579
Oh, my God.

471
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,709
Oh, God. Hank.

472
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,336
Who?
Hank.

473
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,921
What?

474
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,839
Oh, my God.
