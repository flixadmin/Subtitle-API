1
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:56,228
DEATH TO ESCOBAR

2
00:00:57,854 --> 00:00:59,398
Forgive me.

3
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:06,029
Children and innocent people
died in that bombing.

4
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:09,825
That was an act of pure terrorism.
It must be answered for.

5
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,494
<i>Surrender, unconditionally, now.</i>

6
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:17,374
What kind of country is it
when a death squad is not only tolerated

7
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:20,085
but is actually sanctioned
by the goddamn government?

8
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,046
Do you want to see Bogotà
turned into a crater?

9
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:28,635
Is that what it will take to protect
my family from those bastards, Los PEPES?

10
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,056
No. Your family's safety
is our utmost concern.

11
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:38,812
They're simply... in protective custody.

12
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:42,441
Get my family out of Colombia.

13
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,611
We can get your family out of Colombia.

14
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:52,451
But I can't guarantee any country
will accept them.

15
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:55,454
I don't have that kind of power.

16
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,957
You better find that kind of power,

17
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:03,754
because I won't even discuss surrender
until my family is out of the country.

18
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,049
Until then, we have nothing to talk about.

19
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:54,781
<i>Congressional leaders
are calling for immediate action</i>

20
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,576
<i>and President Gaviria has called
an emergency meeting</i>

21
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,244
<i>of the national police.</i>

22
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,037
<i>Yesterday's bombing
has resulted in a total of...</i>

23
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:02,998
Now he's really fucked up.

24
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,712
Pacho".
I want you on a plane to Miami.

25
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:11,298
It's time.

26
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,510
And Escobar's family?
Should we get them?

27
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:19,848
No, not now.
They're surrounded by police.

28
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,976
They're not going anywhere.

29
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:28,857
Son of a bitch.

30
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,503
Stay there. You can go.

31
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:51,254
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

32
00:04:58,303 --> 00:05:02,265
Agent Jimenez, put out that cigarette
and go downstairs, please.

33
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:07,103
- And don't smoke in the room again.
- Yes, sir.

34
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:10,482
Thank you.

35
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,609
Excuse me.

36
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:17,989
- Who wants dinner?
- Me!

37
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:23,537
Stop looking out the window.
There's no one out there.

38
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:25,205
Come eat something.

39
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,457
- Mama?
- Yes, my love?

40
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,584
Who are Los PEPES?

41
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:36,967
No one. No one you have to worry about.
All right, my love?

42
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:39,010
And how much
longer do we have to be here?

43
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:40,720
Not much longer, love. Keep eating.

44
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:43,223
Can I speak with you a moment?

45
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,480
- We have to do something, Hermilda.
- Pablo will fix this, like always.

46
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:52,732
We can't even call him.

47
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,696
Even if we could,
all the telephones are tapped anyway.

48
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,743
We're alone, Hermilda.

49
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:07,747
And you're telling me
everything will be okay?

50
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,423
Excuse me, Colonel...

51
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:07,761
CARLOS HOLGUIN POLICE BASE

52
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:18,313
Blackie. What's going on?

53
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:21,691
- <i>Do you think you can get inside?</i>
- No, boss. I don't think so.

54
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:24,402
With all the police swarming around,
it's impossible.

55
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:27,655
Can you see the top floor?
Through the windows?

56
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:31,159
No, I can't. It's too difficult.

57
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:34,496
Keep your eyes on it, Blackie.
You might see something.

58
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:36,581
Sure, boss.

59
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:39,417
All right, as soon as you see anything,
call me.

60
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:45,799
<i>Blackie...it's important
that I know they're okay.</i>

61
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,804
Hey, boss. Can you believe it?

62
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:54,599
Just this second,
Tata came into view, boss.

63
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,601
What do you see? Is she alone?

64
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,229
<i>She looks beautiful.
She's at the window.</i>

65
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:03,399
She's got that dress on that you had me
bring from Miami, remember, boss?

66
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:04,859
The one you like so much.

67
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:09,155
The children, Blackie.
Can you see them?

68
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:12,742
There, I can see Manuela, boss.

69
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:18,039
- Can she see you?
- She looks so pretty, boss.

70
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,750
Go.

71
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,253
Blackie...

72
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:26,464
Thanks for this.

73
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:07,755
{\an8}WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR; IN
DEFENCE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE

74
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,350
- Héctor.
- Sir.

75
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:22,353
Do me a favour and bring
Miss Judy a beer.

76
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:24,147
- Of course, boss.
- Thanks.

77
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:26,774
This isn't about Pablo.
Pablo is a dead man.

78
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,486
It's just a matter of time.
We're here to talk about the future.

79
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:34,407
And if you're interested in the future,
then you'll have to join us.

80
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:40,205
Listen, Judy, you know
we never had problems with Pablo.

81
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,751
Plus, we had a very good relationship
with Kiko. Right, Berna?

82
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:49,130
And that's why we made the decision
to stay out of this shit.

83
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:52,842
And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

84
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:56,012
Because things are very difficult.

85
00:11:56,137 --> 00:12:00,225
And when all this shit is over,
the organisation will change,

86
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,102
the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

87
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:11,110
And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

88
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:13,404
That's why I'm talking to you.

89
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,823
If all of us from Medellin are united,

90
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:18,993
we'll be able to say
what happens to each one of us.

91
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:27,418
Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

92
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:29,879
and you tell them you're on our side.

93
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:37,178
She wants them to join Los PEPES.

94
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:45,144
They say Pablo Escobar is fucked,
that his time has come.

95
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,564
And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

96
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,902
- What did they say?
- They're joining.

97
00:12:56,698 --> 00:12:58,449
Here's the information.

98
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:01,661
They have a meeting
with the Castaños on Friday.

99
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:04,539
This is big, boss.

100
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:09,836
If the Gallóns are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too.

101
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:14,090
When is it?

102
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:17,010
Friday at 9:00pm, boss.

103
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,721
Take that address...

104
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:23,558
and go to Montecasino.

105
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:25,810
Take Limón with you.

106
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:29,063
And find out what's going on over there.

107
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:31,316
Quica.

108
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,152
Are you all right?

109
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:35,987
Yes, boss.

110
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:44,329
How many men can we rely on?

111
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:50,501
I think I can round up a hundred.
But we need cash.

112
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,964
How much money do we have on hand?

113
00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:01,763
If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

114
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:05,641
It's... around this much.

115
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:10,480
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

116
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:13,483
But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

117
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:19,906
Make sure we have the weapons and
the men we need when the time comes.

118
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,532
Got it?

119
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:25,745
The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

120
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:31,626
Then we can take care of business.

121
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,669
Go on.

122
00:14:33,795 --> 00:14:35,171
Yes, sir.

123
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,931
Pass that to me.

124
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:20,693
Nothing relevant has happened today.

125
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:24,822
Corrupt politicians,
celebrity divorces. Bullshit!

126
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:28,201
You don't like it, go and work at CNN.

127
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:30,203
- Miss Velez.
- Yes, honey?

128
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:32,121
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but you have a call...

129
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:34,499
Take a message,
I'm about to go on air.

130
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:38,085
Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.
She says it's urgent.

131
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:48,804
What are you doing?
Answer the call.

132
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,938
You have to get her
to give you an interview.

133
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:05,655
Hello?

134
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:09,992
<i>Hello?</i>

135
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:15,665
I know that you and I have had
a lot of problems in the past.

136
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,253
But I need you to help me.

137
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:52,702
<i>I brought all the influence
the party can bear on Gaviria.</i>

138
00:17:53,536 --> 00:18:00,543
And it seems he has agreed
to find asylum for your family.

139
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,170
<i>Where?</i>

140
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:05,548
No, that remains to be seen.

141
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:09,719
But we will meet in his office,

142
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:15,141
I suppose to discuss the terms
of their relocation.

143
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,560
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

144
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:20,438
- You're a man of your word.
- <i>I</i> am.

145
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:23,107
Now you must be of your word.

146
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:26,777
<i>I will. Be sure of that.</i>

147
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:31,574
The moment my family is safe,
we will speak again.

148
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:33,993
- <i>Until then.</i>
- Thank you.

149
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:37,872
She's here.

150
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,457
Bring her here.

151
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,608
Hello, Valeria.

152
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,781
I liked it more with the hood on.

153
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:17,953
I told them, don't take me anywhere
that doesn't have a beautiful pool.

154
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,335
It's very dangerous
to be my friend these days.

155
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,256
Come on.

156
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:48,859
Look. These are the codes for the radio.
I'll put them here.

157
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:51,445
And here is some cash.

158
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:57,493
This is for you.

159
00:19:57,618 --> 00:20:01,205
- No, Pablo. I don't want your money.
- It's for your help.

160
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,253
I'm doing this for you.

161
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:23,769
Thank you.

162
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:31,652
I'm worried about you, Pablo.

163
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:54,800
You guys can't do shit to me.

164
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:58,971
De Greiff offered us amnesty.

165
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:01,515
That's right.

166
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:04,935
But you have to talk to get it.

167
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:08,731
You want to negotiate, gringo?

168
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:11,233
You want to negotiate? Let's negotiate.

169
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:14,403
I'll give you something. Something small.

170
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:16,864
Blackie...

171
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:22,578
Blackie, Blackie, Blackie.

172
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:28,876
What name did your mother give you?

173
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:34,590
Nelson Hernández... Lucumi.

174
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:35,966
Lucumi?

175
00:21:39,094 --> 00:21:40,721
From the Pacific.

176
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,394
Lucumi, they found explosive residue
on your hands.

177
00:21:49,313 --> 00:21:51,524
On your jacket, everywhere.

178
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,751
They're going to blame you
for that bomb, Lucumi.

179
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,631
Hey...

180
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:21,887
- I had nothing to do with it.
- We know that.

181
00:22:22,596 --> 00:22:26,767
We know it wasn't your idea.
We know you're not the boss.

182
00:22:31,856 --> 00:22:34,525
Don't let them blame you for this.

183
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,655
Don't let them see you as the one
who killed all those innocent children.

184
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:47,329
Help us and we'll help you.

185
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,543
Give us Pablo.

186
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:57,631
No fucking way. I can't give you Pablo.

187
00:22:58,465 --> 00:23:00,634
No fucking way I give you the boss.

188
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:03,304
Then give us something.

189
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:07,766
You have to give us something
or they'll hang you.

190
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:17,860
I'll give you...

191
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:21,572
La Quica.

192
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:28,621
Faggots.

193
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,727
There's a lot of them.

194
00:23:54,438 --> 00:23:56,649
Do you think we can take all of them?

195
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,443
What's wrong, brother?

196
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,988
You're turning into a pussy.

197
00:24:05,658 --> 00:24:07,826
If you're scared,
why don't you run away?

198
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:10,579
Abandon the boss.
It's that easy, brother.

199
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:13,123
No, brother.

200
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,378
I'm loyal to the boss.

201
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,590
And if I have to die, I'll die, brother.

202
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:24,009
You better, motherfucker.

203
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:13,809
- Trujillo.
- Yes, Colonel.

204
00:25:13,934 --> 00:25:15,811
Prepare the emergency team.

205
00:25:15,936 --> 00:25:18,313
They need to be ready
when we get the signal.

206
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:21,608
- Yes, Colonel.
- Martinez, get your people ready.

207
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:24,778
We'll start tracking them
first thing tomorrow.

208
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:26,488
At your service, Colonel.

209
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:44,048
Good work on Blackie.

210
00:25:46,717 --> 00:25:49,178
I need to know you didn't make the call.

211
00:25:52,765 --> 00:25:55,809
The only thing I want
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.

212
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,728
It's the only thing I want, Peña.

213
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:01,190
- For all the lives he has taken.
- I know.

214
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,985
But not with them.

215
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:09,698
I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

216
00:26:09,823 --> 00:26:14,453
When Escobar dies, 3 Colombian cop
should be standing over him.

217
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:25,297
- Good evening, Ms Velez.
- Good evening.

218
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:27,966
Welcome, they're expecting you.

219
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:34,556
What is she doing here?

220
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,437
I sent for her.

221
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,440
Please, take the children to their room.

222
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:46,568
Please.

223
00:26:47,194 --> 00:26:49,530
Let's go.

224
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:04,461
This is from Pablo.

225
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:10,676
It's a radio telephone,
so you can speak with him.

226
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:15,264
This is a cipher sheet
for the frequencies he'll be on all day.

227
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,102
You must keep it hidden.

228
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:26,066
He also sent you money.

229
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:34,158
Thank you.

230
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:47,796
Well, let's do the interview already.

231
00:27:50,632 --> 00:27:53,969
You know what? Another time.

232
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:56,805
When all of this is over.

233
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:12,988
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.
I can't leave so quickly.

234
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:19,077
Then stay.

235
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:23,123
You can show yourself out
when you're ready.

236
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:33,967
<i>Pablo?</i>

237
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:40,474
Tata.

238
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:43,769
Pablo, is it you?

239
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,898
So good to hear your voice, my love.

240
00:28:50,025 --> 00:28:52,194
<i>How are you, Tata?</i>

241
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:55,239
How are our children?

242
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:57,574
My love, we're all okay.

243
00:28:57,699 --> 00:28:59,576
<i>We need you.</i>

244
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,203
And I need you.

245
00:29:01,328 --> 00:29:04,623
Listen, I'm going to get you
out of there soon.

246
00:29:04,748 --> 00:29:08,085
<i>I talked to the attorney general.
Everything is ready.</i>

247
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:11,880
Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.

248
00:29:13,423 --> 00:29:15,217
I love you very much.

249
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:18,637
I love you, my darling. I love you...

250
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:42,119
Mr President, I ask you
not to take this as a failure.

251
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:47,374
Escobar will be brought to justice.

252
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,669
And once his family is out of Colombia,

253
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:55,048
he will reinitiate negotiations
for his surrender.

254
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:58,218
- I already did that.
- Yes.

255
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:02,139
Well, I've got a list here

256
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:07,436
of possible locations that would be safe
for the Escobar family.

257
00:30:07,561 --> 00:30:13,400
If you ask officially,
those countries will allow them to enter.

258
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:19,448
Attorney General De Greiff...

259
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,409
it seems you've been misinformed.

260
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:28,707
Escobar's family isn't going anywhere.

261
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:32,210
Pardon me?

262
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:34,880
I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.

263
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:40,093
I am categorically opposed
to you or anyone else doing so.

264
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:42,471
Do you know what that means?

265
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:45,349
There will be no surrender.

266
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:49,227
The violence will not end.

267
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:52,606
And you will be the one responsible.

268
00:30:52,731 --> 00:30:56,234
You... will be the one responsible.

269
00:30:57,486 --> 00:31:01,782
Your promises and negotiations
have only brought us more violence,

270
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:03,492
while making him stronger.

271
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:09,247
This, Mr De Greiff, doesn't end
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.

272
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:11,541
This...

273
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,129
This ends with his death.

274
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:22,219
<i>No, you don't need to worry
about anything.</i>

275
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:26,264
Put yourself at ease. We got it.

276
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:31,269
<i>Miami is ours.
I'll be back in Colombia tonight.</i>

277
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:43,532
How's it going?

278
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,701
What's up, little Lion?

279
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:49,037
Doing good. Just hanging out.

280
00:31:49,162 --> 00:31:50,956
Is everything packed or what?

281
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:56,336
I don't get why you're staying
in this dump, brother.

282
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:58,505
I would've thought that Pacho Herrera

283
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,592
would be staying in a five star hotel
with all the bells and whistles...

284
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:30,328
- Do you want juice, my love?
- Yes.

285
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:31,913
I'll take more.

286
00:33:01,318 --> 00:33:04,196
PABLO'S WHORE

287
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:14,831
So my business is done? Is that right?

288
00:33:14,956 --> 00:33:17,125
I can't get anyone on the phone, sir.

289
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:22,547
I called many times. Many times.

290
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:27,385
I called everyone in Miami.
There's no trace of the Lion.

291
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,354
<i>Pablo!</i>

292
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:47,948
Tata?

293
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:51,785
<i>Pablo, they killed her.
They dumped her in front of the hotel.</i>

294
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,370
<i>Who?</i>

295
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:57,541
Valeria.

296
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:08,134
Are you all okay?

297
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:12,013
<i>Yes, we're okay.</i>

298
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:13,723
Listen.

299
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:17,602
<i>I need you to be strong.</i>

300
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:22,524
Everything will end soon. But you need
to be stronger than ever, Tata.

301
00:34:23,316 --> 00:34:25,819
I'll call you back soon.</i>

302
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:27,612
<i>I love you very much.</i>

303
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:42,794
Tonight... we're going to fight
like we've never fought before.

304
00:34:44,337 --> 00:34:47,048
We'll fight with everything we have.

305
00:34:49,384 --> 00:34:51,595
Fuck the Cali cartel!

306
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,346
Fuck Judy Moncada!

307
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:55,890
Fuck Los Castaños!

308
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:59,519
We're going to show these motherfuckers
who they are messing with,

309
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:02,647
because we're still the Medellin cartel

310
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:07,235
and tonight we're going to Montecasino!

311
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:13,992
Bring all the men we can buy.

312
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:18,788
Go to Medellin
to every money stash we have

313
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:21,333
and bring me every penny you can find.

314
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,669
Limón and Quica will take me
to Montecasino,

315
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:30,592
because tonight we'll be fighting
side by side to the death.

316
00:35:30,717 --> 00:35:33,887
And when those motherfuckers
open their doors to the Gallons,

317
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:37,182
we'll go in and hit them
with everything we have!

318
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,643
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.

319
00:35:40,393 --> 00:35:41,394
Boss...

320
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:48,151
I think I should go with Rojas.
It's too dangerous.

321
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:55,367
Okay.

322
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,912
Take Ricardo with you.

323
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,539
As you wish, boss.

324
00:36:02,457 --> 00:36:03,500
Let's go, brother.

325
00:36:06,795 --> 00:36:08,588
- Let's go!
- Quickly!

326
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:22,894
Let's go!

327
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:42,247
There. After that corner. Right there.

328
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:50,171
What are the odds
that we survive tonight?

329
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:55,719
Fifty-fifty.
But that's pretty good for us.

330
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:58,304
Let's do this quickly.

331
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:12,694
I think we're ready.

332
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:15,155
We've cast as wide a net as possible.

333
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,826
Go ahead.

334
00:37:45,894 --> 00:37:48,521
Hello?

335
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:52,817
<i>I can't hear you. Hello?</i>

336
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:56,404
Damn it.

337
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:02,494
Let's go.

338
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:06,247
Let's go to 10th and 32nd Street.

339
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:23,890
Answer it.

340
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,937
Fucking answer it!
It could be the boss.

341
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:31,189
<i>Hello?</i>

342
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:34,234
Quica.

343
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:35,777
<i>Hello.</i>

344
00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:38,530
Shit. Who the fuck is this?

345
00:38:38,655 --> 00:38:42,367
- Hello, Quica. How's it going, my friend?
<i>- Motherfucker. Who is this?</i>

346
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:47,413
<i>Calm down, Quica. Don't be nervous.
What's up, Quica?</i>

347
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:49,582
Who the fuck
do you think you are, bitch?

348
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:56,506
- Velén, let's go!
- Let's go, they're in Laureles!

349
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:15,149
Hey, Rojas, wait for me.
You're leaving me behind.

350
00:39:35,044 --> 00:39:36,254
Hello?

351
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:39,674
<i>Quica. What's up, Quica?</i>

352
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:43,219
Quica, Quica, Quica.
What time is it, Quica?

353
00:39:43,344 --> 00:39:45,722
- <i>What are you up to, Quica?</i>
- Bastard.

354
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:54,188
You're the accountant.
How much is there?

355
00:39:54,314 --> 00:39:56,274
I don't know. Maybe $500,000.

356
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:03,031
Looks like you're almost out of money.
Leave some for the market, fat ass.

357
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:05,283
So funny.

358
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:07,827
Why aren't you watching the car...?

359
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:22,091
Sorry, but this toss of the coin
doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

360
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:23,593
Let's make a deal...

361
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:56,751
Go right.

362
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,650
Copy that! We're on it!

363
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:29,409
Perez, close all of 4th Street.
Go straight.

364
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:30,868
We'll go this way to cut him off.

365
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:40,003
Come on, pussy.

366
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:49,387
There! Follow him!

367
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:52,807
Follow him!

368
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:54,350
To the right!

369
00:41:57,895 --> 00:41:59,564
All units, be ready for the play.

370
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:41,939
Fucker

371
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:28,069
Limón.

372
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:30,655
Relax.

373
00:43:33,032 --> 00:43:34,617
Okay, boss.

374
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:39,372
- Are we ready?
- They're all waiting for us, boss.

375
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:41,624
I think we have enough.

376
00:43:46,212 --> 00:43:48,381
La Quica isn't answering, boss.

377
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:56,264
Okay.

378
00:43:58,724 --> 00:44:01,102
Go and start the car.
I'll be there in a second.

379
00:44:01,227 --> 00:44:02,728
Yes, sir.

380
00:45:33,152 --> 00:45:35,112
Where's the staging area?

381
00:45:35,238 --> 00:45:39,659
You want me to hand you information,
just like that? Free?

382
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:43,996
No, brother. I want a deal.

383
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:48,584
Then give us Pablo... asshole.

384
00:45:49,335 --> 00:45:51,379
I want something different.

385
00:45:51,504 --> 00:45:55,341
I want to start a new life,
in the United States of America.

386
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:15,027
We don't have time for bullshit.
Blackie already rolled on all of you.

387
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:22,994
If you don't give us something fast,
of substance,

388
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,874
we'll buy you that ticket
to the United States... but extradited.

389
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,336
- Extradition doesn't exist.
- Fine, then a jail cell here.

390
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,632
With a sign that says "snitch"
around your neck.

391
00:47:17,256 --> 00:47:18,174
Quica.

392
00:47:18,299 --> 00:47:20,676
<i>Hello. Where are you, boss?</i>

393
00:47:20,801 --> 00:47:23,095
I'm en route. And you?

394
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,097
<i>Me too. I'm not too far off.</i>

395
00:47:29,935 --> 00:47:35,024
I'm almost there, boss.
Are you still far off?

396
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:42,365
Pass the phone to Ricardo.

397
00:47:44,241 --> 00:47:48,120
Boss, Ricardo went to get
one last stash.

398
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:49,830
He's on his way.

399
00:47:50,706 --> 00:47:54,585
You want me to meet you?
Are you with Limón?

400
00:48:02,468 --> 00:48:04,261
Yes, we're almost there.

401
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:20,194
You have what you wanted.
He'll be there soon. Limón's driving.

402
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:24,615
Now give us the staging point.

403
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:28,869
Pull over.

404
00:48:35,918 --> 00:48:37,503
Give me a moment.

405
00:48:39,004 --> 00:48:40,256
Sure, boss.

406
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,680
<i>Tata.</i>

407
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:52,935
Yes, my love?

408
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:57,773
<i>I just want you to know...
that I love you very much.</i>

409
00:48:57,898 --> 00:49:00,734
<i>You and our children.</i>

410
00:49:03,988 --> 00:49:07,116
You may not hear from me
for a while.

411
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,577
What's happening, Pablo?

412
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,121
What are you going to do?

413
00:49:14,457 --> 00:49:16,292
Something I have to do.

414
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:25,384
<i>But you know that I will never,
never leave you, right?</i>

415
00:49:27,553 --> 00:49:28,721
I know.

416
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,812
I love you, Tata.

417
00:49:41,192 --> 00:49:43,736
I will always love you, Pablo.

418
00:50:04,924 --> 00:50:08,511
Keep going down that road.
I'll show you the way.

419
00:50:08,636 --> 00:50:09,678
Yes, boss.

420
00:51:02,898 --> 00:51:04,108
Fuck.

421
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:08,904
I've got something.

422
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:11,740
Attention all units.
A vehicle is approaching. Be alert.

423
00:51:33,554 --> 00:51:34,972
Hey, girls.

424
00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:42,062
Negative. They're whores.

425
00:51:48,527 --> 00:51:50,362
All right. Let the women through.

426
00:51:50,487 --> 00:51:53,073
Stand by, everyone.
This isn't happening tonight.

427
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:01,123
Fire! Let's go! Fire!

428
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:30,653
What will happen with Quica, boss?

429
00:52:35,282 --> 00:52:36,909
Quica's gone, Limón.

430
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:42,081
They're all gone.
