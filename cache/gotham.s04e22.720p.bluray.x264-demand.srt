1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,538
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,829
Hugo Strange can fix Butch.

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,381
Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,217
But whatever happens
after I walk out that door,

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,048
I care about you.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,637
And I always will.

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,348
<i>Jerome is dead. Long live me.</i>

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,718
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,929
I have bombs
planted around this city.

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,764
These are the buildings
Jeremiah's planning to demolish

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,974
with his bombs.

12
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,604
Once those buildings are blown,

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,684
they collapse and create

14
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,895
the labyrinth
from the finished drawing.

15
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,569
<i>I have the locations of
every bomb Jeremiah planted.</i>

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,111
How did they beat you, huh?

17
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,491
I'll have to start again.

18
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,291
I had a vision of Gotham in flames.

19
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,584
Together we can make that happen.

20
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,958
Now listen closely
to what you must do.

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,500
Come on, Selina.

22
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,722
It's okay, it's okay.

23
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,387
Make way.

24
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,638
We'll do everything we can.

25
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,345
But the evacuation has us
dealing with a skeleton crew.

26
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,429
Bruce...

27
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,479
Selina, you're at the hospital.
You're gonna be okay.

28
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,522
Are you gonna leave me?

29
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,072
No, I'm gonna be right here.

30
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,573
Promise?

31
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,700
I promise.

32
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,215
You know, I don't know why
I brought him here.

33
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,513
I should've killed him
when I had the chance.

34
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,141
You did the right thing, Alfred.

35
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,595
You say that. You didn't see what
he did to Selina.

36
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,064
All right, I better get
to the hospital.

37
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,683
I'll stop by when I can.

38
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,360
Alfred.

39
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,318
Couldn't have put a cap in that
psycho and done the world a favor?

40
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:57,444
Where are we?

41
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,400
Bomb squad's at the last site
on the map.

42
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,201
After they disarm the bomb,
they're gonna put it in the warehouse

43
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,369
with all the others.

44
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,870
Also, the Mayor called. He wants
to lift the evacuation order.

45
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,750
Tell him we are not doing
anything until we have

46
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,327
all the bombs locked away.

47
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,914
Pardon me, Jim.

48
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,213
Don't you all have work to do?

49
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,766
What is it?

50
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,644
I'd like to press charges against
Bruce Wayne's butler.

51
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,518
I mean, just look at my face.

52
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,520
I think you look great.

53
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,573
And I'd like to speak to Bruce again.

54
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,319
We couldn't really talk before
what with his girlfriend bleeding out

55
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,493
all over him.

56
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,199
You tried to prove you're better
than your brother.

57
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,329
But I'm still here.
The city's still here.

58
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,414
You're a failure, Jeremiah.

59
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,800
Enjoy Arkham. Your brother did.

60
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,090
Put him in the box.
Get him ready for transport.

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,170
Bring me Bruce Wayne

62
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,755
and I'll tell you
where the other bombs are.

63
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,725
We have all your bombs.

64
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:10,101
The maze bombs, yes.
I mean the other ones.

65
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,896
Jim, as an engineer,
you expect systems to fail.

66
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,321
So, you build in redundancies.

67
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,325
And I am a very good engineer.

68
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,947
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,913
How many lives are you
willing to bet?

70
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,168
You're right, you know. I did fail.

71
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,005
I didn't yet understand the vision
I was servicing, but,

72
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:45,094
I do now. My eyes are open
as will yours be.

73
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,564
When you realize I'm not bluffing,
bring me Bruce Wayne.

74
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:59,734
And I'd like a coffee.
Black. Two sugars.

75
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,692
No heartbeat.

76
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,616
Extraordinary.

77
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,196
This better work.

78
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:14,498
The chemicals that turned him into
this beautiful specimen

79
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,047
kept his organs surprisingly
well-preserved.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,543
Once we flush his body
with anti-toxins,

81
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,175
we'll top him off with some
fresh blood.

82
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,560
And a quick jolt to the heart
will see him good as new.

83
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,144
You hear that? You're gonna be cured.

84
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,233
Yeah.

85
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,441
What?

86
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,868
When?

87
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,369
What is it?

88
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,622
Selina's been shot
by that lunatic Jeremiah.

89
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,075
She's at Gotham General.

90
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,126
I have to go. I'll be back.

91
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,621
Of course. You go check on the kid.

92
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,129
What? No, she's in surgery.
I'm gonna kill Jeremiah.

93
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,092
I'm coming with you.

94
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,887
I don't advise that. The procedure
should not be interrupted.

95
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,431
Stay.

96
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:14,312
I'll be here. Making sure everything
goes as planned.

97
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,476
I'm doing this for Butch.
Not for you.

98
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,858
It's okay.

99
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,951
Unfortunately, there's no telling

100
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,207
just how many battery bombs
Jeremiah produced.

101
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,630
He was fanatically secretive about
his technology

102
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,457
and Bruce trusted him, so...

103
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,255
He's gotta be bluffing.

104
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,335
Yeah.

105
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,633
Cap, Mayor's on the phone again.

106
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,636
The evacuation stays in effect.
I will tell him when it's lifted.

107
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,018
<i>You think
there are more bombs?</i>

108
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,352
Up till now, Jeremiah's actions
sprang from the fear and hatred

109
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,477
of his brother.

110
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,527
Even his obsession with Bruce
is just a reflection of Jerome's.

111
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,196
What did he mean when he said
he didn't understand

112
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,615
the vision he was serving?

113
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,284
That his eyes had been opened.

114
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,073
<i>Perhaps the previous mayor
took orders from a police captain.</i>

115
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,541
- Captain Gordon...
- Jim Gordon is not the Mayor

116
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,118
of Gotham, I am.

117
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,673
The people need to know the city
is safe. I'm lifting the order.

118
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,468
What are you looking at?

119
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,759
There's a man on the building
across the street, staring at us.

120
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,839
What?

121
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,458
How many bombs are there?
Where are they?

122
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,710
I want to talk to Bruce Wayne.

123
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,217
Tell me where they are,
you son of a bitch.

124
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,340
Who's helping you?

125
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,342
Bruce Wayne.

126
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,058
You are never gonna talk
to Bruce Wayne.

127
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,134
You hear me?

128
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,307
Then more people will die.

129
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,391
Well, you never were good at
holding on to what you care about,

130
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,726
were you, James?

131
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,489
Jim, we need you out here now!

132
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,546
Can I help you?

133
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,751
Captain Gordon? Major Rodney Harlan,
Seventh Division, Fort Henry.

134
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,838
Major, I assume you're here to help
with the evacuation.

135
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,513
If so, Detective Bullock
can coordinate.

136
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,215
The Governor
has declared martial law.

137
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,518
Until this crisis is resolved,
I'm in charge here.

138
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,971
Are you serious?

139
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,397
Son, this is not a pissing match.

140
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,726
I was sent here to restore order
in a chaotic situation.

141
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,445
Can I count on you?

142
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,528
- Yes, sir.
- What do we got?

143
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,493
Not much.
Valeska had a plan to knock down

144
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,036
a number of buildings in Gotham.

145
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,618
We recovered those bombs,
but he's stashed away more.

146
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,912
Who's helping him?
Somebody's gotta be.

147
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,461
It's unclear.
We've heard reports that

148
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,958
his followers have turned on him,

149
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,459
which would indicate
he has someone else.

150
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,506
He would like to talk to Bruce Wayne.
That's clearly a trap.

151
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,006
His brother pulled the same gag.

152
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,508
There was a blimp,
it was a whole thing.

153
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,011
We'll make sure he's safe.
Get me Bruce Wayne.

154
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,218
Major, you cannot bring
Bruce Wayne down...

155
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,722
Not your call, Captain.

156
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,312
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

157
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,190
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

158
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,357
Arrest Captain Gordon.

159
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,187
Hey, are you out of your
freakin' mind?

160
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,614
You listen to me. This city
is holding on by a thread.

161
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,192
I would not allow anything
to jeopardize it further.

162
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,027
Including insubordination.

163
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,120
Escort Captain Gordon
across the river.

164
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,705
Hold him there till you hear from me.

165
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,123
Get me Bruce Wayne.

166
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,881
I strike where you lie.
Death's gentle cousin.

167
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,179
The answer is sleep, Ed...

168
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,926
It's polite to let people finish.

169
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,396
Rise and shine!

170
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,736
Good morning, sweetheart.

171
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,570
I know. Waking up in the Narrows,
a prisoner.

172
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,325
Must feel like history
repeating itself.

173
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,451
Ed.

174
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,453
Speaking of history, remember
when you punched me in the face?

175
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,792
That felt good.

176
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,295
Listen to me. Jeremiah Valeska
has more bombs.

177
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,680
- You have to...
- I have to what, Jim?

178
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,555
Set you free? Help save the city?

179
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,516
Well, we've been there, done that.
And guess what?

180
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,724
Shocker!
Lee and I are still fugitives.

181
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,809
I offered her a way out.

182
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,314
Oh, by returning the money?

183
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,021
She's dispersed that among
all the deadbeats of the Narrows.

184
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,861
Not exactly what I would have done.

185
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,990
But, point is, it's gone.
Now, on with the show.

186
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,663
We're a little pressed for time.

187
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,370
Ed, Ed, Ed...

188
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,504
Wait. Ed. Wait, wait, Ed.

189
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,176
This is 50 pounds of pressure.

190
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,512
What are you doing?

191
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,182
<i>Peine forte et dure.</i>

192
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,176
Was my own version of it anyway.

193
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,434
You see in the old days, they used to
pile weights on a prisoner's chest.

194
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,975
Tried to get a confession.
Usually, they just died.

195
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,026
That's 100 pounds.

196
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,230
Why?

197
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,826
To help Lee break free
from her history.

198
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,698
You see, she has this anchor,
deadweight holding her to her past,

199
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,872
and that's you.

200
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,411
Once you're gone, she'll finally
be free to be the person

201
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,961
she was meant to be.

202
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,209
The person I want her to be.

203
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,383
150.

204
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,430
You see, I saw you together.
I saw the way she looked at you.

205
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,928
So, for her sake, you're gonna die.

206
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:30,146
And for my sake, you're gonna suffer.

207
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,934
Now, this is gonna be so much fun.

208
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,325
This evacuation is going to leave
a lot of territory undefended.

209
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,281
Shame not to capitalize.

210
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,752
Hello, Barbara.

211
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,668
Was only hoping to talk.

212
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,170
By attacking my people?

213
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,669
- Call it precaution.
- What do you want?

214
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:06,098
I'm leaving Gotham and I want you
to come with me.

215
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,096
Try again.

216
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,809
I had a vision when I took back
the Demon's Head.

217
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,150
Death. Destruction.
The city in flames.

218
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,185
But it didn't come to be.

219
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,945
How disappointing for you.

220
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,239
Indeed, for many reasons.

221
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,443
Not least is that for centuries
I have depended on the Demon's head

222
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,572
to get ahead of my enemies.

223
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,996
But, without the full
measure of its power...

224
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:33,292
Wait. Are you saying you think
some of it might still be in me?

225
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:39,332
Interesting. So I guess
you're here to kill me for it.

226
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,216
You misunderstand.

227
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,421
Remember the woman from the tapestry,
the one whose features you share?

228
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,973
The whore you murdered?
How could I forget?

229
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,851
I lied. To get under your skin.

230
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,765
I loved her. Very much.

231
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,235
I offered her eternity,
but she turned it down.

232
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,364
And now, I make you the same offer.

233
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,745
Join me. And we will rule
the League of Shadows together.

234
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,578
Think about it.

235
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,130
What about your vision?
The city on fire.

236
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,959
I am making certain of it even now.

237
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,045
Its destruction will give rise
to the one I foresaw long ago.

238
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,257
The one who brought me here, my heir.

239
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,184
Bullock, can you tell this putz
to let us go, please?

240
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,645
Major, the men escorting Gordon
were attacked.

241
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,405
Your guys didn't see who.
I'm thinking it's either Valeska's...

242
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,733
Enough. Did you prepare
Valeska like I asked?

243
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,652
Yeah.

244
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,738
Mr. Wayne, you'll be perfectly safe.

245
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,040
If you could help us learn
the location of the bombs...

246
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,867
Major, you brought me here
against my will.

247
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,703
I want to go back to the hospital
and back to my friend.

248
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,415
Let's get this over with.

249
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,686
Hello, Bruce.

250
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,439
It's great to see you.

251
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,823
Where are the bombs, Jeremiah?

252
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,071
Closer, please.

253
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,744
Closer.

254
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,754
Tell me. How is the young lady doing?

255
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,765
You know why we're destined
to be best friends?

256
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,346
Because we're very much alike.
You are as I used to be.

257
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,180
At war with your true nature.

258
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,021
You must truly embrace it
if you ever want to be free.

259
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,228
I'm just trying to help you.

260
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,817
Trying to help me?

261
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,984
By torturing Alfred?

262
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,663
Trying to destroy Gotham?
By shooting Selina?

263
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,914
You think we're alike because
there's a darkness inside both of us.

264
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,622
But the difference is,
I know how to control mine.

265
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,509
I think you could be so strong.

266
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,010
I see it.

267
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,969
He sees it too.

268
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,228
What do you mean, "he"?

269
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,558
Ask him about the bombs.

270
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,273
Where are the other bombs?

271
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,191
What bombs?

272
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,615
<i>Bombs you planted around the city.</i>

273
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,196
You blew up the Mayor.

274
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,245
Ah, that bomb.
Yes, that was the only one.

275
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,747
But it did what it had to do.

276
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,749
It got you here.

277
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,590
All right, that's enough.
I want my boy out, mate.

278
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,759
- Mmm-mmm.
- You said, "he."

279
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,013
Who do you mean?

280
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,594
The one who opened up my eyes.

281
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,676
Who showed me that everything
I was doing,

282
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,265
was not to create a Gotham of my own.

283
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,888
But yours.

284
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,898
The Gotham you need.

285
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,188
Your dark island.
And it will come to be, Bruce.

286
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,857
Tonight.

287
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,072
Tell me his name.

288
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,449
What did the doctors say?

289
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,451
Will the little bitch
ever walk again?

290
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,449
What vertebrae did I sever?

291
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,246
I was hoping for the lumbar...

292
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,873
Tell me his name!

293
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,383
You already know his name.
You're his heir.

294
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,507
Ra's al Ghul.

295
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,138
- No, it can't...
- Shh.

296
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,134
- Bullock?
- Yeah.

297
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,991
350 pounds of pressure.

298
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,530
Getting hard to breathe?

299
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,490
I'll take that as a yes.

300
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,293
You know, if we listen carefully,
we can hear some ribs cracking soon.

301
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,872
Four hundred fifty.

302
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,340
Healthy male adult. His ribs should
be able to take about 450 pounds

303
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,545
before they crack.

304
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,220
Do you think you could
hide this from me, Ed?

305
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,893
I'm Queen of the Narrows.
People tell me things.

306
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,016
I know how this looks.

307
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,642
It looks like you're trying
to crush him to death

308
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,564
because you think we still have
feelings for each other.

309
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,736
Well, perhaps we should jump to
why this is a good thing.

310
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,029
I can't wait.

311
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,405
He's holding you back.

312
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,194
From?

313
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,536
From being the person
that you are meant to be.

314
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,284
The woman that I love.

315
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,335
You really think
so little of me?

316
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,625
I don't follow that.

317
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:14,004
How weak would that person need to be
if Jim Gordon could hold her back?

318
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,625
It's actually insulting.

319
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,965
That's not what I intended, I...

320
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,091
Enough.

321
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:24,052
Yesterday, you said a part of you
would always care for me.

322
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,475
The woman you loved is gone.
Understand?

323
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,606
Yes.

324
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,945
The Narrows is free from landlords
and gangs.

325
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,780
Every family has money to build
their life. I'm done. I'm leaving.

326
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:45,489
I want you to come with me.
But if you kill Jim, don't bother.

327
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,991
And I will decide
who I'm going to be.

328
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,203
Not you. Not Jim Gordon. Me.

329
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,002
I'm leaving tonight.
It's your choice.

330
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,887
She chose me, Jim.

331
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,603
Did you hear that?

332
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,352
It's all I wanted.

333
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,696
You can have Gotham.

334
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,491
By the time I got there,
Jeremiah had already escaped.

335
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,701
Right.
Where the hell is Ra's al Ghul?

336
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:34,630
Alfred. Let me guess. Ra's helped
Jeremiah kidnap Bruce.

337
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,206
So you came to me to find Ra's.

338
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,170
Would you care to tell me
where he is?

339
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,669
I don't know where he is.
But I know where he's gonna be.

340
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,014
Ra's is leaving Gotham tonight
after turning it to a pile of rubble.

341
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,309
With, I assume, Jeremiah's help.
So, here's the deal.

342
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,388
You get to kill Jeremiah,
you get to rescue Bruce,

343
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,143
and I get to kill Ra's.

344
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,057
And how do you plan
on doing that then?

345
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,819
I got a little surprise for him.

346
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,191
One question.

347
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,317
Who do I get to kill?

348
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,995
The only way to keep
Butch on the table

349
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,743
was to promise I would come help.

350
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,457
Well.

351
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,956
Don't we make quite the little gang?

352
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,209
Let's do this.

353
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,258
Hey.

354
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,178
My car's around the corner.

355
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,018
You're gonna wanna ice those ribs.

356
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,191
Is it true about you leaving Gotham?

357
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,478
- Yes.
- And taking Ed with you?

358
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,525
That's none of your concern.

359
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,067
Back in the GCPD,

360
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,528
when I told you there was so much
I wish I could change,

361
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,203
- you asked me what I meant.
- Jim.

362
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,828
I would change everything that
brought us to this point.

363
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,791
I would ask you to leave Gotham
with me that first moment I saw you

364
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,463
and I would make sure we had
a life together.

365
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,750
Then you wouldn't be you.

366
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,214
Maybe that'd be a good thing.

367
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:06,930
No, it wouldn't.

368
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,972
I'm not going back to who I was.

369
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:16,394
But, what you said yesterday about
part of you always caring for me,

370
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,520
I feel the same way.

371
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,952
Goodbye. Now, go save Gotham.

372
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,748
Ready at your command, Major.

373
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,170
- Jim.
<i>- Harvey.</i>

374
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,248
Thank God, you're all right.
What the hell happened?

375
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,550
<i>It's a long story.
Did Harlan get Bruce to the precinct?</i>

376
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,047
Yeah, it's bad.

377
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,469
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

378
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:50,341
Jeremiah escaped. He's got Bruce.
He took the bombs, all of them.

379
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,488
It's true.

380
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,411
- How did you two...
- Find each other?

381
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,536
I'd like to think it was you, Bruce.

382
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,797
You brought us together.

383
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,208
I trust things went smoothly?

384
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,835
Like clockwork.

385
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,180
Did your men retrieve my bombs?

386
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:35,306
They are en route to their positions
as we speak.

387
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,097
From here,

388
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:43,519
we can take in the full majesty
of Gotham's destruction.

389
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,694
You're both insane.

390
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,323
I know
it's difficult to fathom, Bruce.

391
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,740
But Jeremiah and I are doing this
for your benefit.

392
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,746
How is destroying Gotham
supposed to help me?

393
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,661
Because I had a vision.

394
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,839
That out of this crucible
of blood and fire

395
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,794
will rise the Dark Knight
that your city needs. That I need.

396
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,762
To be honest, Bruce.

397
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,969
Prophesies, visions.
Not really my cup of tea.

398
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,185
But our friend revealed
something to me.

399
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,520
That my twin obsessions,
rebuilding Gotham and rebuilding you,

400
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,692
are one and the same.

401
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,781
You're the brother I never had.

402
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,116
The one Jerome never could be.

403
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,082
We will create a legacy in this city.

404
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,912
Gotham falls. We rise.

405
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,585
Together.

406
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,966
A dozen transport vans were stolen
from the GCPD motor pool.

407
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,517
That's gotta be how
they're carrying the bombs.

408
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,971
There were sightings here,
here and here.

409
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,977
They're moving towards
the outskirts of Gotham.

410
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,774
Jeremiah must have changed targets.

411
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,067
- Gordon.
- Perfect.

412
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,816
You have some explaining to do.
What happened to my men?

413
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,442
Major, we got serious fish to fry...

414
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,864
I didn't ask
for your opinion, Detective.

415
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,442
Two more sightings.
Bolyston and Third,

416
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,492
and they're moving north
along the Van Hook Highway.

417
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,865
That doesn't make any sense.

418
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,447
What buildings
would he be targeting there?

419
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,500
Told me Jeremiah promised to turn
Gotham into a dark island.

420
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,167
We need to cancel the evacuation.
Get those people off the bridges.

421
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,589
Absolutely not.

422
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,087
They're filled with people
leaving the city.

423
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,043
We bring them back into Gotham.
Buildings fall...

424
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,845
The bridges are the targets.
Harper, spread the word.

425
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,219
Don't move. Arrest Captain Gordon.

426
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,677
I wouldn't do that.

427
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,062
Arrest them both.

428
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,734
Officer, your radio.

429
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,787
This is Captain Gordon. I want all
the bridges cleared immediately.

430
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,407
I repeat. Clear all the bridges.

431
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,833
Civilization, so fragile, Bruce.

432
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:11,793
Gotham is soon to be each man
for himself, a more savage place.

433
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,381
Sounds like fun.

434
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,130
Sure you wanna leave?

435
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,265
Oh, hey, Bruce. Freak.

436
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,472
Hello, Barbara.
I'm really glad you came.

437
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,275
Bad news, baby.
I'm not leaving.

438
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,441
Gotham's in my blood. And I don't
think I can let you leave either.

439
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,864
You re-forged it. Well now.

440
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,617
You see, you say you're leaving.

441
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,869
But I've got a feeling
you're gonna be back.

442
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,462
And I don't like looking
over my shoulder.

443
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,590
Need I remind you, Barbara.
You've already tried

444
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,792
using that knife.

445
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,674
And also, you're outnumbered.

446
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,213
Hmm.

447
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,933
That Demon's Head is really not
working out for you, huh?

448
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,819
Bullock, the hell is going on?
Why are we clearing the bridges?

449
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,030
Because we said to do it.
Now, just do it.

450
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,581
Did a GCPD transport van
come through here?

451
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,748
About 20 minutes ago.

452
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,825
Had to make way for it.

453
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,164
What's the status?

454
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,662
<i>All the bridges
are being cleared.</i>

455
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,965
But I just heard from our choppers,
they've spotted vans on every bridge.

456
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:39,095
The vans are in position.
Bombs could go off any minute.

457
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,302
What the hell.

458
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,012
Jim.

459
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,264
Out of the way.

460
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,317
When will you ever learn, Barbara?
The knife has to be held...

461
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,113
Held by Bruce Wayne. I get it.

462
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,246
So you know, this is for Selina.

463
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,585
In that case,

464
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:20,504
it must be very disappointing
for you to be dying like this.

465
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,650
What are you doing?

466
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,208
Well done, Barbara.

467
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:36,129
The choice is now yours.
Stay Bruce Wayne.

468
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:41,627
Or accept your destiny.
Become Gotham's Dark Knight.

469
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,083
Seems Jeremiah's made
good on his threat.

470
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,458
And I take it that means
you're not leaving.

471
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,126
How can I?

472
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,341
They need me more than ever now.
No one will help them but me.

473
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,136
So, what does that mean for us?

474
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,722
Ed, this is the end of the road for us.

475
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,855
All this time I've been calling
the other Ed stupid.

476
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,359
And I'm the idiot.

477
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,741
You were never gonna leave with me.

478
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,665
You just wanted to save Jim Gordon.

479
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,915
You and Jim really
aren't that different.

480
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,122
You both think you know me.

481
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,754
You both wanna change me.

482
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,211
Neither one of you really sees me.

483
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:18,766
For what it's worth, Ed,
I was offering you something real.

484
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,443
But I was never going to be
who you wanted.

485
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,526
Sooner or later,
you were just gonna kill me.

486
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,323
It's just what you do.

487
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,197
That's quite possible.

488
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,497
But you're wrong, Lee.

489
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,081
I do see you.

490
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,533
Calm.

491
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,583
Where is Butch?
What did you do with him?

492
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,870
I'm right here.

493
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,216
You're you.

494
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,637
Yeah. I'm me again.

495
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,690
- Yeah.
- I love you.

496
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,238
I love you too, baby.

497
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,701
Oswald,

498
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,250
I'll never forget this.

499
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,917
Anything you need, I'm there.

500
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,006
Thank you, Butch.

501
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,178
I want you to know
I consider you a friend.

502
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,469
And that I'm truly sorry.

503
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,596
What?

504
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,959
Did you think I forgot that
you murdered my mother?

505
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,460
That I just got over it?

506
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,844
I have lived
with that pain every day.

507
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,677
I could've killed you
any time I wanted,

508
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,806
but I believe in an eye for an eye.

509
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,812
You took away the one person I loved,

510
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,061
so I took away the one person
you loved.

511
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,564
And you get to live with that.

512
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,413
All of this...

513
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,949
Finding Strange, curing Butch,

514
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,918
was all so you could kill him
in front of me?

515
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,133
Exactly. But don't worry.

516
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,924
In time, when I feel that
you have suffered enough,

517
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,511
I will kill you too.

518
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,928
Not if I kill you first.

519
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,016
You're welcome to try.

520
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,778
I'll kill you!

521
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,956
Selina.

522
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,121
How is she?

523
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,289
She did well in surgery.

524
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,250
But the bullet severed
her spinal cord.

525
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,835
And the damage is likely permanent.

526
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,763
Mr. Wayne,
the hospital is shutting down.

527
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,056
This is the last ambulance

528
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,476
leaving for the post. We have room
for you, but we need to go.

529
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,652
Bruce.

530
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,451
I can't leave, Alfred.

531
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,709
Ra's was right.

532
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,120
This is what I'm meant to do.

533
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,586
The city's abandoned, Master Bruce.

534
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:55,837
There's nothing more
you can do here, mate...

535
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,043
Jeremiah is still out there.

536
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,220
He is not your responsibility.

537
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,966
Gotham is not your responsibility.

538
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,514
I'm making it mine.

539
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,643
Um...

540
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,488
Oh, sod it.

541
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,865
All right, fine.

542
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,614
- We'll both stay.
- No.

543
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,249
I need to know
Selina's gonna be okay.

544
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,662
Please.

545
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,799
All right, I'll see that she's safe.

546
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,049
And then I'll come back
and I will find you.

547
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,307
I promise.

548
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,802
You just can't
throw in the towel on an entire city.

549
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,304
There's no way to know how many
bombs are still out there.

550
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,431
The power's out,
water supply is damaged.

551
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,308
You're giving up. Plain and simple.

552
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,183
We're proceeding with the evacuation.
Boats will run all night.

553
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,269
Everyone leaves,
including the police.

554
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,275
Now the Governor's declared
the city off-limits until

555
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,822
this situation can be evaluated.

556
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,898
I'm not leaving.

557
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,699
So, if you're gonna arrest me,
do it now.

558
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,076
He's right, Jim.

559
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,037
Governor's given up on the place,
there's gonna be nobody here.

560
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,588
Gangs are carving up turf.

561
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,211
Two hours,
this city's gonna be a battleground.

562
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,097
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

563
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,101
Yes, this will do nicely.

564
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,232
This is our territory. You can't...

565
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,912
Now it's mine.

566
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,827
I want a ring of fire.
Ten blocks wide.

567
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,840
If anyone stands in your way,
burn them!

568
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,972
The hell?

569
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,772
No, not hell.

570
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,035
Hell is what's coming.

571
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,408
Penguin says fix them.

572
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,765
What should I do with you?

573
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,518
Ra's al Ghul is gone.
You defeated him.

574
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:47,781
We have spoken and agreed.
We will follow you.

575
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,747
Wow, I am honored.

576
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,838
Tabitha. What happened?

577
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,917
Penguin. He shot me and killed Butch.

578
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,717
Everything that is wrong with Gotham,

579
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:20,982
all the greed, the pain,
the corruption, the destruction,

580
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:26,062
it can all be traced back
to one problem, men.

581
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:33,369
Well, I think it is time we had
a men-free zone, starting here.

582
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,013
That's better.
Much, much better.

583
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,516
Lucius?

584
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,064
I requisitioned one of
Jeremiah's battery bombs

585
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,441
before it went to the warehouse.

586
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,693
Just restored it
to its original purpose.

587
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,820
It is an ingenious mechanism.

588
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,281
I told him we were staying.

589
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,665
Figured we could use some help
with the, uh, science stuff.

590
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,034
And there are others on their way.

591
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,711
This is our city.
You're going to need our help.

592
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,884
Speaking of, there's something
I need you to do.

593
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,310
Where's Jeremiah?

594
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,561
I don't know!

595
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,645
You see him, you tell him
I'm looking for him.

596
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,543
Bruce.

597
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,048
You're not supposed to be here.

598
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,303
Neither are you.

599
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,765
There's a dozen cops downstairs.

600
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,513
You stayed to fight for the city.

601
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,403
The gangs are carving up territory.
We're gonna have to go

602
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,650
block by block.

603
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,071
I have no idea what we're gonna find.

604
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,492
A thing like this brings out
whatever's lurking in the shadows.

605
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,164
The light.

606
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,543
You're basically daring whatever
is out there to come after you.

607
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,546
Let them come.

608
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,588
There are still good people
out there.

609
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:42,137
They need to know we're here,
willing to fight.

610
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,059
I remember the night we met.

611
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,771
You told me the world may seem dark.

612
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,074
But there is light.
