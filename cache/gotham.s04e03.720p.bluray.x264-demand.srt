1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,118
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:04,748
You can't commit a crime in Gotham

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,830
<i>without a license from Penguin.</i>

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:11,134
Tell your families
Oswald Cobblepot keeps them safe.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,587
Not the GCPD.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,888
<i>We'd need an army
to take on Penguin.</i>

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,715
I am not giving this city
over to Penguin.

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,175
<i>I don't care what the
Commissioner says.</i>

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,137
- Makes me miss Falcone.
- I'm done with this business.

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,347
I'm out.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,272
I've got a place down south
I can go to.

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,692
We need an army. He's got one.

13
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,612
<i>If you show your face
to Falcone, he will kill you.</i>

14
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,153
An opportunity awaits you.

15
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,489
Why do you want this so bad?

16
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,413
I'm sick of
not being taken seriously.

17
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,583
<i>With you and Barbara,
the three of us could give</i>

18
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,786
all those creeps a run
for their money.

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,629
You were the one time
I've met a weakened me.

20
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,332
<i>I want you around
as a constant reminder</i>

21
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,383
<i>to never make that mistake again.</i>

22
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,506
I'm the one you seek.
I am Ra's al Ghul.

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,558
<i>I have to be ready for when
Ra's al Ghul returns.</i>

24
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,886
<i>You need to find
your true north</i>

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,970
<i>and let that guide you.</i>

26
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,515
It is here.

27
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,227
At last.

28
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,773
I was no more.

29
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,274
Now, you live.

30
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,690
How can this be?

31
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,864
The power is in the water.

32
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,536
It has given you life.

33
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,075
And a destiny.

34
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,160
You must find your heir.

35
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,500
As I found you.

36
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,541
Find him.

37
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,089
Be free.

38
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,658
Alfred? You read?

39
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,707
Loud and clear, Master Bruce.

40
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,961
Looks like the rumors
around town are true.

41
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,667
Penguin's bringing in a big shipment.

42
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,965
Whatever it is, must be valuable.

43
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,047
He's got four armed men
loading it onto a truck.

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,469
I'm gonna go down for a closer look.

45
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,478
How did I know
you were going to say that?

46
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,601
I'm wearing
bulletproof armor, remember?

47
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,479
Yes. Lucius Fox's armor
was bulletproof.

48
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,481
My mask is not.

49
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,109
Don't get shot in the face? Got it.

50
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,157
<i>Do I detect a note of sarcasm,
Master Bruce?</i>

51
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,358
Hold on.

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,861
I just picked up a thief
heading toward the truck.

53
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,202
<i>Thieves stealing from thieves is
a victimless crime, Master Bruce.</i>

54
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,533
<i>Just walk away now.</i>

55
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,126
They're walking into a trap.

56
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,670
Master Bruce, I'm all for you
protecting the innocent,

57
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,374
but I won't have you
risking your life over a thief.

58
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,550
<i>Now, walk away.</i>

59
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,721
Master Bruce?

60
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,892
<i>Master Bruce!</i>

61
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,724
The hell
are you supposed to be?

62
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,190
You must be real stupid
trying to steal from Penguin.

63
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,608
Bad idea.

64
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,742
Hold it!

65
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,917
Let's get outta here!

66
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,091
Come on.

67
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,419
In the truck.

68
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,675
Damn it!

69
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,345
Can I help you?

70
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,851
James Gordon. I'm here to
see Carmine Falcone.

71
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,314
He's not expecting me.

72
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,859
Come with me, please.

73
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,061
Carmine.

74
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,852
Jim.

75
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,484
You're a long way from home.

76
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,151
Came down to see you, Carmine.

77
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,366
Heard you retired down here.

78
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,198
Sorry for not calling ahead.

79
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,538
No, you're not.

80
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,125
It's quite the spread you have here.

81
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,877
I think we're past the point
of small talk, Jim.

82
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,371
Just tell me why you're here.

83
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,044
Morning, Daddy.

84
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,681
How was Artemis?

85
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,226
Feisty as usual.
But I whipped him into shape.

86
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,728
Who's this?

87
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,431
James Gordon.

88
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,976
Jim. Meet my

89
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,020
only daughter, Sofia.

90
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,706
What're you doing here, James?

91
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,038
Go ahead, Jim.

92
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,253
I have no secrets from my children.

93
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,045
Penguin has taken over the city.

94
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,841
GCPD has turned its back on Gotham.

95
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,889
There are families
that are still loyal to you.

96
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,768
I need your help
to knock him off his perch.

97
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,061
Sure this isn't about you, Jim?

98
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,811
Your loss of power in Gotham?

99
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,395
This is bigger than me.

100
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,401
You have fight, kid.

101
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,483
I've always admired that in you.

102
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,282
But I can't do what you're asking.

103
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,910
Why?

104
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,827
Because I'm dying.

105
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,542
Doctors don't know why.

106
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,787
Maybe old age. Karma.

107
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,087
They seem to think the air is
better down here for me.

108
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,293
Give me more time.

109
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,091
I'm not one to argue with doctors.

110
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,342
Or time.

111
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,508
So, you see.
I can't go back with you.

112
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,396
I'll go back.

113
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:27,848
Hush.

114
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,734
You're not ready for Gotham.

115
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,692
There was a time in my life

116
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,615
when I would have done
anything for the city.

117
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,318
Those days are gone.

118
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,447
I'm sorry, Jim.

119
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,365
You're on your own.

120
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,042
You sure you know what you're doing?

121
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,430
You're mad because
I didn't listen to you, Alfred.

122
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,933
You're damn bloody right I am. Yeah.

123
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,602
You're right. I let my guard down.

124
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,979
It won't happen again.

125
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,279
All right. There we go.

126
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,531
Might leave a little bit of a scar.

127
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,246
Thanks, Alfred.

128
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,622
All right.

129
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,999
Now...
Where do you think you're going?

130
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,633
To the docks.

131
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,968
I'm sure there's a
manifest on the freighter.

132
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,637
Whatever is in that crate
must be important

133
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,760
if the thief was willing to steal
from the Penguin.

134
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,841
I want to know what it is.

135
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,267
Right, so being shot wasn't enough,
was it?

136
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,470
You gotta let this slide, Master B.

137
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,313
There's more to this, Alfred.
I can feel it.

138
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,309
This is my chance to investigate
a real crime.

139
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,728
Stop it before it becomes
something bigger.

140
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,529
Fine.

141
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,533
But just don't go charging around in
broad daylight with that bloody mask on.

142
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,239
It'll be like having a socking great
bulls-eye on your back, all right?

143
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,246
So how do you suggest
I get onto the ship?

144
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,250
There are other kinds of masks
you can wear,

145
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,963
Master Bruce.

146
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,898
As you can see, the scatter pattern
is tighter than most.

147
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,064
You won't find a superior weapon
anywhere in Gotham.

148
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,984
- I'll take two dozen.
- Excellent.

149
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,986
You can pay out front.

150
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,197
Right this way, sir.

151
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,866
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

152
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,119
Tabitha planning on coming to work?

153
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,454
I am paying her half the profits.

154
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,494
Don't you mean a third?

155
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,954
That depends.

156
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,588
Where's my crate?

157
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,583
I ran into some trouble.

158
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,585
- Did Penguin's men see you?
- No.

159
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,838
I wore a mask like you said.

160
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,098
- I know you're pissed...
- I'm not mad.

161
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,058
I misjudged you.

162
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,603
I was wrong to cut you in
on my new business.

163
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,018
You're clearly not ready.

164
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,310
You're serious?

165
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,939
I can get the damn thing.

166
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,566
I'll do it myself.

167
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,155
But if you do want to
redeem yourself,

168
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,487
you can do the floors.
Mop's in the closet.

169
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,203
You can mop your own damn floors.

170
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,046
Another excellent night
of business, Victor.

171
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,547
Except for the part where

172
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,591
a couple of thieves tried to
rob your shipment.

173
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,714
What?

174
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,170
Relax, boss.

175
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,098
My men stopped them before they
could get their hands on anything.

176
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,641
You see what I'm dealing with, Ed?

177
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,063
That shipment is full of black
market items I'm auctioning off

178
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,061
tonight to Gotham's elite.

179
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,896
I stand to make a killing.

180
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,195
I cannot do that without the items.

181
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,523
Where are they?

182
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,152
At the warehouse.

183
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,279
Take me.

184
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,745
I want to be sure
it's all accounted for.

185
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,948
Once I do, bring everything
back here for safekeeping.

186
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,243
No! No!

187
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,123
No!

188
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,831
This cannot be happening.

189
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,042
I don't know.
Kind of opens up the room.

190
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,845
Whoever did this,

191
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,297
I want them found.

192
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,303
I want them dead.

193
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,177
And I want Ed back here, today!

194
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,275
Where are you, Ed?

195
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,625
Oh! He's up. He's up.

196
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,420
Where am I? How did I get here?

197
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,250
I brought you here. You're in
my home. What do you think?

198
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,557
I'm sorry, but who are you?

199
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,723
You don't remember?
Hilltop Elementary?

200
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,645
Mrs. Macher's class?

201
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,515
I was third row,
closest to the window?

202
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,393
Eddie. It's me. Myrtle Jenkins.

203
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,522
Um, I followed your rise
to becoming the Riddler.

204
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,566
I've read every article.

205
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,071
All the police reports.

206
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,120
I guess you could say
I'm your number-one fan.

207
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,864
Okay.

208
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,122
Um, I should get going.

209
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,711
Whoop! That's gonna be tough.

210
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,177
Why am I tied up?

211
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,088
You're not.

212
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,474
Your muscles have atrophied
from being on ice. Okay?

213
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,428
But don't worry, these warming lamps
should help thaw you out.

214
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,062
- Ice?
- Yeah.

215
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,351
Last thing I remember
was being frozen by the river.

216
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,442
How long was I on ice?

217
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,732
Five months.

218
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,444
I know.

219
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,949
Since then,

220
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,119
Penguin opened a club called
the Iceberg Lounge.

221
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,077
You were its centerpiece.

222
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,124
That little freak.

223
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,624
He put me on display
like some caged animal.

224
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,046
Yes.

225
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,629
And I will nurse you back to
health so you can reclaim your throne

226
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,556
as Gotham's greatest villain.

227
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,510
Ha! Ooh! Caveat.

228
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,345
With me as your sidekick, of course.

229
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,977
Doesn't that sound wonderful,
my love?

230
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,161
You lost, kid?

231
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,744
My uncle Al works on your ship.

232
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,910
My aunt hasn't heard from him
in a few days, and she's worried.

233
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,253
There're a few men below deck.

234
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,333
But I'm pretty damn sure none of
their old ladies are looking for 'em.

235
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,755
Listen, I told my aunt I'd find him.

236
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,009
Can I just take a quick look?
I'll be in and out in a few minutes,

237
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,088
I promise.

238
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,722
Sure. Go ahead.

239
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,303
Thank you.

240
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,190
Bet you think you're real smart
giving us the slip.

241
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,899
I don't know
what you're talking about...

242
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,736
Save it. Somebody tried to steal
from this ship last night.

243
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,695
Did this to my face.

244
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,913
Tell me who you're working for.

245
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,788
I assure you, I'm just here
looking for my uncle.

246
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,334
I took a wrong turn.

247
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,707
Assure?

248
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,129
Here's a little advice.

249
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,332
If you're gonna play
the part of a street kid,

250
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,008
learn how to talk like one.

251
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,756
Hey, Andy.

252
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,177
Get over here.

253
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,306
What'd I tell you about
bothering me at work?

254
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,263
Sorry, fellas.

255
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,393
You're right, though.

256
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,104
The boy's acting does need some work,
doesn't it?

257
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,950
You see, improvisation, Master Bruce,
is a very important weapon

258
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,403
in any actor's toolkit.

259
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,821
Shall we go?

260
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,080
There's a knife being
sold at your auction tonight.

261
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,420
I was thinking
you might be kind enough

262
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,296
to sell it to me ahead of time.

263
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,680
And why is this knife
so important to you?

264
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,095
It's not.

265
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,643
I have a client who's interested.

266
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,557
Gave me a ton of cash.

267
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,311
So, I was hoping to get it for a
lower price and make a profit.

268
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,607
That start with the attempted
five-finger discount last night?

269
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,646
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

270
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,697
Of course you don't.

271
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,488
I'll triple the opening price.

272
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,240
It'll probably
go for less at auction.

273
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,367
My dear,

274
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,324
wherever you disappeared to
these last few months

275
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,660
has not made you a better liar.

276
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,089
It's clear
that this isn't about profit,

277
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,001
but about your mysterious benefactor.

278
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,591
He is your client,
is he not?

279
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,848
Reveal his identity to me

280
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,305
and you have a deal.

281
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,321
Wow.
He's really got his hooks into you.

282
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,491
See you tonight, I guess.

283
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,239
Don't forget to bring
your checkbook.

284
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,662
Always a pleasure, Oswald.

285
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,032
The knife was used to embalm
King Balahsi.

286
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,069
According to this, he ruled ancient
Mesopotamia for the first century.

287
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,868
What thief in Gotham would want
a knife like that?

288
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,582
That's a good question.

289
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,248
According to the manifest,
the shipment was full of jewels

290
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,454
and expensive art.
Yet, our thief went for the item

291
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,880
with the least intrinsic value.

292
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,500
Well, that tells me
she was a gun for hire.

293
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,794
But who hired her?

294
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,969
I think I just found the answer.

295
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,770
Alfred, look.

296
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,732
This drawing depicts a man
being healed by water.

297
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,685
And look at his eyes.

298
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,653
His face.

299
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,484
Who does that remind you of?

300
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,538
That's impossible.

301
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,412
I mean, this drawing
is 2,000 years old.

302
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,709
I know.

303
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,383
That's him.

304
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,129
That's Ra's al Ghul.

305
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,845
He wants the knife.

306
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,104
I struck out with Falcone.

307
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,815
<i>That right?</i>

308
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,652
Try not to sound too happy about it.

309
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,529
<i>Look, if you brought back Falcone,</i>

310
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,906
<i>that would mean gang wars
and blood in the streets.</i>

311
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,158
<i>And I don't like it
when the streets are bloody, Jim.</i>

312
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,411
Yeah, see how you like it
with Penguin.

313
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,660
See you tomorrow, Harvey.

314
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,039
Mind if I join you?

315
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,680
What are you doing here?

316
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,221
I figured you didn't know anyone in
town. Thought I'd keep you company.

317
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,305
Or maybe I just didn't
want to drink alone.

318
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,397
To my dad.

319
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,031
I am sorry about your father.

320
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,076
We may have had
our differences over the years,

321
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,282
but I always respected him.

322
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,038
When I was a little girl,

323
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,877
if I wanted to spend time
with my father,

324
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,959
he'd have me schedule an appointment.

325
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,962
Save the respect.
I know who my father is.

326
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,965
Took him getting sick for us to
finally have a real relationship.

327
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,724
How long have you lived down here?

328
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,815
Since I was 13.

329
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,696
My father thought sending me away
from Gotham would keep me safe.

330
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,192
I mean,
there are worse places to grow up.

331
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,653
People are happy here.

332
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,534
You see the sun every day.

333
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,581
And I wasn't alone. I had Mario.

334
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,538
We took care of each other.

335
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,042
I know there's nothing I can say.

336
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,004
I am sorry for what happened to him.

337
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,639
You're right.
There is nothing you can say.

338
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,016
He was infected with the virus.

339
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,898
You did what you had to.

340
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,740
There's no sign of Nygma
anywhere in Gotham.

341
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,368
Word on the street is

342
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,419
it's an inside job.

343
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,422
Find whoever is in charge of hiring.

344
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,625
Kill them.

345
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,254
I want everyone here interrogated.

346
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,548
There's a traitor amongst us.

347
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,976
Those needles should help
stimulate your muscles.

348
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,023
You'll have feeling back in no time.

349
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,231
Just call me the Riddlette!

350
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,783
I know. What do you think?

351
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,283
I think that rehashing someone else's
idea isn't very original.

352
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,499
It's an homage.

353
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,951
And I thought you'd like it.

354
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,666
It's very nice.

355
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,014
This is so much fun.

356
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,679
If only I were
the criminal mastermind you are,

357
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,385
we would've been together sooner.

358
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,937
I'm sorry,
I don't really follow that.

359
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,478
Well, it took me months
to plan your escape.

360
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,610
I had to learn Penguin's schedule.
When he came and went.

361
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,653
Devise an exit strategy.

362
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,990
I'm sure it would've taken you
two seconds to think something up.

363
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,494
It is slightly impressive you were
able to outwit Oswald.

364
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,696
Hmm.

365
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,449
Though, as you say, my plan
would've taken much less time.

366
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,079
Oh, wait. That is a great idea.

367
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,082
You should tell me
what your plan would've been.

368
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:51,256
Because a window into your master
villainy would mean so much to me.

369
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,803
I...

370
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,307
Um...

371
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,188
Oh.

372
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,023
Here I am bombarding you
with silly questions.

373
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,860
After everything you've been through,
you must be exhausted.

374
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,194
Yes.

375
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,330
Yes, I must be exhausted.

376
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,497
Ooh. Soup's ready.

377
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,877
Do you like tomato? I put
little question marks in it, too.

378
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,691
Last one.

379
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,227
One. Two. Three.

380
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,075
Anything, my love?

381
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,999
No! Acupuncture

382
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,749
is therapeutic snake oil.

383
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,965
I've been focused on
repairing the wrong muscle.

384
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,132
What?

385
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,710
Your brain.

386
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,672
It fires synapses that carry neurons
to the rest of your body.

387
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,176
If we can stimulate it,

388
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,008
perhaps your other muscles
will follow.

389
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,055
- Logical.
- Yeah.

390
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,845
- What do you suggest?
- Well,

391
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,940
in anticipation of our partnership,
I have been working on a few

392
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,525
riddles.

393
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,818
Yes!

394
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,697
Riddles!
That's exactly what I need.

395
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,609
That's gonna make me feel like
myself again.

396
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:44,868
Fire away.

397
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,287
Okay. Here goes.

398
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,824
What's black and white
and red all over?

399
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,707
Easy. Zebra with a gaping hole.
Next.

400
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,712
No, it's actually a newspaper.

401
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,383
That's ridiculous. There's nothing
red on a newspaper. Next.

402
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,551
- Well, it makes sense, if...
- Next!

403
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,627
Um...

404
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,265
I have a face and two hands,
but no arms or legs.

405
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,803
What am I?

406
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,760
Deformed baby. Come on.

407
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,436
Surely, you can do better than this.

408
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,893
The answer is a clock. Hands...

409
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,103
I think something is wrong
with your brain, Ed.

410
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,947
There is

411
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,943
nothing wrong with my brain.

412
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,696
The problem is your riddles.

413
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,490
Bring me a riddle

414
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,166
that is worthy of my name.

415
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,135
Next time,
I'll know to pack a swim suit.

416
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,095
You actually own one?

417
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,012
Yeah. I got a nice two-piece.

418
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,306
He comes with a sense of humor.

419
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,025
You ever think about
walking away from it all?

420
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,228
Gotham?

421
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,364
Sometimes.

422
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,821
But I can't.

423
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,028
Why not?

424
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,954
It's in my blood.

425
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,038
My father spent his entire life
fighting for the city.

426
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,835
Never took the easy way out.

427
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,038
Neither can I.

428
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,377
What?

429
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,763
Give 'em to me.

430
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,268
I don't really think
they're your size.

431
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,141
Come on.

432
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,102
- That too?
- Mmm-hmm.

433
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,771
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

434
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,696
You can't be serious.

435
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,991
Just a little water, Jim.

436
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,099
I can't remember the last time
I just stood still.

437
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,384
All right, Master Bruce.

438
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,844
Let's go over the plan again.

439
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,755
It's simple.

440
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,182
I show up at the auction
and buy the knife.

441
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,552
Should be easy enough.
I am a billionaire.

442
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,682
And a very public one at that.

443
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,690
Turning up at the
Penguin's black market auction

444
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,143
is certainly gonna raise
a few eyebrows. Innit?

445
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,443
You're the one that said that
bidding on it was the smarter play.

446
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,742
That I did. But I didn't mean
going in as yourself. Did I?

447
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,618
What do you think the idea was

448
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,321
going down to the docks
pretending to be someone else?

449
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,032
I was trying to teach you a lesson.

450
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,578
Now, if you're going to continue
down this vigilante path,

451
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,832
Master Bruce,

452
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,547
you've got to learn how to assume

453
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,046
other roles.

454
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,845
Play the role

455
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,892
that you were born to play.

456
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,483
That of a privileged someone.

457
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,573
Pedantic teenager with
deeper pockets

458
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,241
than anybody else in this city.

459
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,737
You mean behave
like a spoiled brat.

460
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,447
It goes against everything

461
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,954
that your beautiful parents
tried to ingrain in you.

462
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,619
But, yes,

463
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,127
sir.

464
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,259
Bruce Wayne.

465
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:14,510
Billionaire brat.

466
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,012
Two hundred and fifty thousand.

467
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,436
Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars going once, twice...

468
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,143
Sold. To Mr. Bruce Wayne.

469
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,142
That's what I'm talking about!
I love art.

470
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,731
I love it! Yeah!

471
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,655
I'm gonna put it in my bathroom.

472
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,361
Steady on, Master Bruce, let's not
overplay our hand, shall we?

473
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,696
I must admit, this is fun.

474
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,782
And try to exercise a modicum of
financial restraint.

475
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,458
I know technically you are
the richest man in the room,

476
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,252
but let's not try and buy
absolutely everything, shall we?

477
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,755
True. But if I only bid on the knife
everyone's been trying to steal

478
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,673
from Penguin,
it might draw his suspicion.

479
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,215
If I go on a spending spree,
recklessly throwing my money around,

480
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,295
he won't think twice.

481
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,676
Nice. When did you think of that?

482
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,174
Improvisation, Alfred.

483
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,969
It's a weapon in any actor's toolkit.

484
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,429
All right, sir. Here we go.

485
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:09,110
Oswald! My friend.

486
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,112
Bruce Wayne? What a lovely surprise.

487
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,154
You certainly are getting out
quite a lot these days. Aren't you?

488
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,990
The way I see it, everyone else
in this town is having fun.

489
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,116
- Why shouldn't I?
- I agree.

490
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,452
You and your insanely large
bank account

491
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,874
are more than welcome here.

492
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,075
Ha!

493
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,203
Barbara Kean.

494
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,876
I thought she died.

495
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,084
Unfortunately, nobody stays dead
in this town.

496
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,965
Excuse me.

497
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,639
You do realize, don't you,
Master Bruce,

498
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,091
that if you actually win,

499
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:42,351
Ra's al Ghul
will come after the knife.

500
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,681
Let him.

501
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:50,394
The next item up for auction
is an embalming knife.

502
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,147
From the tomb of
King Balahsi of Sumeria.

503
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,400
Opening bid will begin at $50,000.

504
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,737
A hundred thousand dollars.

505
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,370
What does she want with it?

506
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,157
I have no idea.

507
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,662
Stay focused.

508
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,493
One hundred thousand dollars
to Ms. Kean.

509
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,456
- Do I hear...
- One hundred thousand and one dollar.

510
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,543
Actually, Mr. Wayne,
the bidding amounts are...

511
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,798
- Two hundred thousand dollars.
- Fine.

512
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,345
We have $200,000. Do I hear...

513
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,889
Two hundred thousand and one dollar.

514
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,017
Mr. Wayne.

515
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,561
How about you let someone else
have some fun?

516
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:33,653
Oh! Sure. No problem.
I'm sorry about that.

517
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,610
- Three hundred thousand.
- Very well,

518
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,868
three hundred thou...

519
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,992
Three hundred thousand dollars

520
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,368
and one cent.

521
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:49,334
Five hundred thousand.

522
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,667
Now back off. You little brat.

523
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,758
Wow, Ms. Kean.
That's a lot of money.

524
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,797
For someone like you.

525
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,005
Two million dollars!

526
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,881
Two...

527
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,093
Sold to Mr. Bruce Wayne.

528
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,353
Congratulations, Bruce.

529
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,151
Thank you.

530
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,611
I do love
seeing that woman lose.

531
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,738
A little piece of friendly advice.

532
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,831
Barbara Kean does not give up easily.

533
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,533
She'll be coming for that knife.

534
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,913
I would just, uh, keep a close eye
on it if I were you.

535
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,169
There's a new wrinkle, isn't it?

536
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,349
What's green and red and goes
round and round?

537
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,814
Someone's obsessed
with the color red.

538
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,652
The answer obviously
isn't newspaper.

539
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,528
You're stalling.

540
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,610
No.

541
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,318
You don't know the answer.

542
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,492
Of course I do.

543
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:05,987
No, you don't. Ed!

544
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,707
Mmm-hmm.

545
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,999
Your brilliant mind is as damaged
as the rest of your body.

546
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,043
Actually,

547
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,208
my body is feeling fine.

548
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,213
Frog in a blender!

549
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,438
Selina?

550
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:47,487
Why are you sitting
in the dark by yourself?

551
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,325
I was expecting someone else.

552
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,532
Like who?

553
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,706
Doesn't matter.

554
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:52,874
What are you doing here?

555
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,500
I heard about Penguin's auction.

556
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,673
So, Barbara sent you for the knife.

557
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,798
Figured, what? Because we're friends
I'd just hand it over?

558
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,219
Something like that.

559
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,506
Why is it so important to her?

560
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,760
How should I know?

561
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,059
She was supposed
to get it for some client.

562
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,386
Said he was a pretty dangerous guy.

563
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,518
And that if you were smart,

564
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,892
you'd hand it over
and save yourself the trouble.

565
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,231
So, you're here to protect me.

566
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,402
Is that it?

567
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,651
The knife can't possibly mean
that much to you, Bruce.

568
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,858
I don't know.

569
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,864
Like you said, I spent $2 million on it.
I think I'll keep it.

570
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,195
- Why are you acting like this?
- Me?

571
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,824
What about you? Are you really
Barbara Kean's errand girl now?

572
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,375
I'm her partner.

573
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,667
But if I don't give
her this knife back,

574
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,044
she won't ever see me as an equal.

575
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,128
I'm asking you to do me a solid.

576
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,348
I'm sorry, Selina.

577
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,134
You should go.

578
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,459
Morning, Harv.

579
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,162
Jim, hey.

580
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,542
This is Detective Harper. She just
transferred over from the three-five.

581
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,968
- Jim Gordon.
- Nice to meet you, Detective.

582
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,136
Heard a lot of good things.

583
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,304
From who?

584
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,549
It's good to have you in the fold,
Harper.

585
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,633
Thanks.

586
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,059
Gordon.

587
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,727
You got a visitor.

588
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,443
Hot damn.

589
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,528
Fox in the hen house.

590
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,195
No offense, Harper.

591
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,024
None taken.

592
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,159
But you got the wrong idiom, Captain.

593
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,033
- No, I don't.
- Be right back.

594
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,246
Sofia?

595
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,039
What are you doing here?

596
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,874
I came to help you.

597
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,671
Yeah? How is that?

598
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,006
Penguin. Oh, I know you didn't directly
ask me, but...

599
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,679
I find men tend to have trouble
seeing the simple solution

600
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,427
even when it's presented to them.

601
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,883
You shouldn't
have come back here.

602
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,181
Oh, Jim.

603
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,977
I don't need your permission.
Or my father's.

604
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,187
I'm a Falcone.

605
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,897
This city is my birthright.

606
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,737
My father might not think I'm ready.

607
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,610
But I am.

608
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,199
Is that so?

609
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,912
What do you think I've been doing
down south, the past 10 years?

610
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,414
You knew you were coming back

611
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,291
from the moment
I left your father's house.

612
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,082
Everything that's happened was what?

613
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,883
You sizing me up?

614
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,552
No. Not everything.

615
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,599
But I had to get to know you
if we're gonna work together.

616
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:56,892
We're not.

617
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,971
Don't be sore, Jim.
You came looking for a gangster.

618
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,600
That's exactly what you found.

619
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,060
We can do great things together,
you and I.

620
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,562
I'll be in touch.

621
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,494
You?

622
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,077
You're the one who stole from me?

623
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,416
Some good it did.

624
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,418
The ice broke his brain.

625
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,795
What are you talking about?

626
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,756
What's green and red and goes
round and round?

627
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,174
Frog in a blender.

628
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,882
Exactly.
Ed couldn't even get that.

629
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:38,476
It does seem unlike Ed
to keep this rube alive.

630
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,721
Sound the word. I want him found.

631
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,105
And her?

632
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,560
A lot of people have been trying to
steal from me lately.

633
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,236
An example needs to be made.

634
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,447
Have fun, Victor.

635
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,709
- Love your dress.
- Thank you.

636
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,328
I made it.

637
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,679
Excellent technique, Barbara.

638
00:41:58,725 --> 00:41:59,932
I'm impressed.

639
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,009
I had a good teacher.

640
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,978
I wish you'd have called ahead.

641
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,185
Does that mean
you don't have the knife?

642
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,153
No. Bruce Wayne has it.

643
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,360
Bruce?

644
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,401
Really?

645
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,529
How interesting.

646
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,581
- You're not angry?
- No. Not at all.

647
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,034
You see, Barbara,

648
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,336
when I bathed you in the Lazarus Pit,

649
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,084
I did it in the knowledge that
you would become

650
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,923
a competent ally of mine.

651
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,592
And so far,

652
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,590
you've done an admirable job.

653
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,430
I'm glad you feel that way.

654
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,686
And I wouldn't worry
about that knife.

655
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,856
Didn't seem all that special to me.

656
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,610
Oh, but you couldn't be more wrong.

657
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,278
You see,

658
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,235
that knife

659
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,445
is the key

660
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,485
to everything.

661
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,615
Well, not everything.
