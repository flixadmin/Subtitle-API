"Inside Out (2015)" ^ (Run time : 01:34:50)

2
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,468
Do you ever look
at someone and wonder...

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,139
"What is going on inside their head?"

4
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,854
Well, I know.
Well, I know Riley's head.

5
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,398
And there she was...

6
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,944
Hello.

7
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,652
Riley.

8
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,993
Look at you.
Aren't you a little bundle of Joy?

9
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,055
Aren't you a little bundle of Joy?

10
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:11,803
Whoa.

11
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:34,066
It was amazing.
Just Riley and me. Forever.

12
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,914
Er, for 33 seconds?

13
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,415
I'm Sadness.

14
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,253
Hello.
I... I'm Joy. So...

15
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:54,134
Can I just... if you could...
I just want to fix that. Thanks.

16
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,217
And that was just the beginning.

17
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,598
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

18
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,100
Very nice. Okay, looks like
you got this. Very good.

19
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,018
Sharp turn! No! Look out! No!

20
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,397
That's Fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

21
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:13,318
Easy, easy. We're good. We're good.

22
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,611
- Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

23
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,202
And we're back!

24
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,119
Here we go. All right, open.

25
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,704
- This looks new.
- You think it's safe?

26
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,215
What is it?

27
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,114
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell, people.

28
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:30,168
Hold on. What is that?

29
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,294
This is Disgust.

30
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,880
She basically keeps
Riley from being poisoned.

31
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,298
Physically and socially.

32
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,383
That is not brightly colored
or shaped like a dinosaur.

33
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,467
Hold on, guys.

34
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,802
It's broccoli!

35
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,473
Yucky!

36
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,558
Well, I just saved our lives.
Yeah. You're welcome.

37
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,519
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not gonna get any dessert.

38
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,938
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

39
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,148
That's Anger.

40
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,318
He cares very deeply
about things being fair.

41
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,154
So that's how you want to play it,
old man? No dessert?

42
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:03,125
Oh. Sure, we'll eat our dinner!
Right after you eat this!

43
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:09,305
Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane!

44
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,168
Oh. Airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

45
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,879
Airplane.

46
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:26,176
And you've met Sadness.
She... well, she...

47
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,146
I'm not actually sure what she does.

48
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,649
And I've checked,
there's no place for her to go, so...

49
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,777
She's good, we're good. 
It's all great!

50
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,820
Anyway, these are Riley's memories

51
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,451
and they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.

52
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,083
But the really important ones
are over here.

53
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:54,043
I don't want to get too technical,
but these are called core memories.

54
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,213
Each one came from a super 
important time in Riley's life.

55
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,633
Like when she first scored a goal.
That was so amazing!

56
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,302
Hey! Would you look at that? 
Very nice!

57
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,801
- We got a future center here!
- Nice job.

58
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:07,194
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,860
And each core memory

60
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,779
powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.

61
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,570
Like Hockey island.

62
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,576
Goofball island is my personal favorite.

63
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,714
Come back here, you little monkey!

64
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,875
Oh, you're silly.

65
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,252
Yep, Goofball is the best.

66
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,593
Friendship island is pretty good too.

67
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,843
I love Honesty island.
And that's the truth!

68
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,557
And of course,
Family island is amazing.

69
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:53,769
The point is, the islands of personality
are what make Riley...Riley!

70
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,976
Look out, mermaid!

71
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,107
Lava!

72
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,449
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong!

73
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,913
- Hey! Very nice!
- Where'd you learn that?

74
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,667
Ah!

75
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,088
Brain freeze!

76
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,968
Yeah!

77
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,140
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, dad.

78
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,768
And...We're out!

79
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,152
That's what I'm talking about!
Another perfect day!

80
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,445
Nice job, everybody!

81
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,981
Let's get those memories
down to long term.

82
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,670
All right, we did not die today!
I call that an unqualified success.

83
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,474
And that's it. We love our girl.

84
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,726
She's got great friends
and a great house.

85
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,687
Things couldn't be better.

86
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:21,938
After all, Riley's 11 now.
What could happen?

87
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:23,113
Sold

88
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:24,695
what...

89
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,581
Okay, not what I had in mind.

90
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,766
Inside
out

91
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,895
hey, look! The golden gate bridge!
Isn't that great?

92
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,355
It's not made out of
solid gold like we thought,

93
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,266
which is kind of
a disappointment, but still...

94
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,401
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

95
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,612
Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!

96
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,906
Yeah...

97
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,283
- Are you kidding? Get out of the street!
- For Pete's sake! Move it!

98
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,535
These are my kind of people.

99
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,371
All right, just a few more blocks.
We're almost to our new house!

100
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,497
Step on it, daddy!

101
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,166
Why don't we just
live in this smelly car?

102
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,751
We've already been in it forever.

103
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,586
Which, actually, was really lucky,

104
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,254
because that gave us
plenty of time to think about

105
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,590
what our new house
is going to look like!

106
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,092
What! Let's review
the top five daydreams.

107
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,886
- That looks safe!
- That one's nice.

108
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,430
This will be great for Riley!
No, no, no, no, this one!

109
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,766
Joy, for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

110
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,557
That's the one! 
It comes with a dragon.

111
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,652
Now we're getting close, 
I can feel it.

112
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,435
Here it is, here's our new house. 
And...

113
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,953
Maybe it's nice on the inside.

114
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,042
- We're supposed to live here?
- Do we have to?

115
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,961
I'm telling you, it smells like
something died in here.

116
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,170
Can you die from moving?

117
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,589
Guys, you're overreacting.
Nobody is dying...

118
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,090
A dead mouse!

119
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,467
- Great. This is just great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

120
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,511
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

121
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,096
Get off of me!

122
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,472
Hey. All through the drive,

123
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,558
dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

124
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,642
Let's go check it out!

125
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,768
- Let's go!
- It's gonna be great!

126
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,853
Yes, yes, yes.

127
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:23,062
No, no, no, no, no.

128
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,522
I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.

129
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,649
Get out the rubber ball,
we're in solitary confinement.

130
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,984
Riley can't live here.

131
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,151
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

132
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,486
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

133
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,197
It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

134
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,867
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

135
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,202
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

136
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,287
Where did you read that?

137
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,663
It doesn't matter. 
I read it and it's great.

138
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,124
We'll put the bed there.
And the desk over there.

139
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,543
- The hockey lamp goes there.
- Put the chair there.

140
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,921
- The trophy collection goes there.
- Stars! I like that!

141
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,008
Now we're talking! Let's go
get our stuff from the moving Van!

142
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,342
All right. Goodbye.

143
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,345
Well, guess what? The moving Van
won't be here until Thursday.

144
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,847
You're kidding.

145
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,349
The Van is lost? 
It is the worst day ever!

146
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,185
That figures. 
The Van is lost.

147
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,686
You said it would be here yesterday!

148
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,354
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

149
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,647
Mom and dad are stressed out!

150
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,858
- They're stressed out?
- What are we going to do?

151
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,324
I've got a great idea!

152
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,321
Did you even read the contract?

153
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,865
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

154
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,033
Hey!

155
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,201
No, you're not!

156
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,243
She's lining up for the shot!

157
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,411
Coming behind you.

158
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,335
- Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores! Yeah!

159
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,084
Come on, grandma!

160
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,211
Ha. "Grandma"?

161
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,512
She put her hair up, 
we're in for it!

162
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,052
Hey, put me down!

163
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,360
Sorry. 
Hold on. Hold on.

164
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:41,516
Hello?

165
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,600
Wait. 
Wh...

166
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,231
You're kidding.

167
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,730
All right. Stall for me. 
I'll be right there.

168
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,900
The investor's supposed to show up
on Thursday, not today!

169
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,653
- I got to go.
- It's okay. We get it.

170
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,472
You're the best. 
Thanks, hon.

171
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:57,757
See you, sweetie.

172
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,565
Dad just left us.

173
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,247
He doesn't love us anymore. That's sad.
I should drive, right?

174
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,416
Joy? 
What are you doing?

175
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,627
Just give me one second.

176
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:14,132
You know what I've realized?
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

177
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,594
Hey, I saw a pizza place
down the street.

178
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,762
Maybe we could try that?

179
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,222
Pizza sounds delicious.

180
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,353
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

181
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,645
- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza?

182
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,313
That's it. I'm done.

183
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,441
Congratulations, San Francisco,
you've ruined pizza!

184
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,282
First the Hawaiians and now you!

185
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,115
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

186
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,409
Must be a San Francisco thing, huh?

187
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,787
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.
At that diner in Nebraska.

188
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,832
Yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself!

189
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,041
That was disgusting.

190
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,585
Good. Family is running.

191
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:51,836
Dad's got a steel stomach.

192
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,964
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?
What was your favorite part?

193
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,757
Spitting out the car window!

194
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,217
Definitely not when dad was singing.

195
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,302
Wearing a seat belt!

196
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,596
What about the time with the dinosaur?

197
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,177
- That's the one.
- Definitely!

198
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,432
Say cheese!

199
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,975
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

200
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,643
- Now hold still.
- The car!

201
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,314
Stop! No, no, no!

202
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,107
Nice one, Joy.

203
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,278
I liked that time at the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

204
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,663
Wait. What? What happened?

205
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,868
She did something to the memory.

206
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,458
What did you do?

207
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,667
I just touched it.

208
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,628
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

209
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,046
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

210
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,131
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, Sadness.

211
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:40,551
Now when Riley thinks of that moment
with dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo.

212
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:45,602
I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know...
I thought maybe if you...

213
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,978
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

214
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,481
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figure out what's going on.

215
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,691
- Okay.
- All right. Get ready.

216
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,862
This is a monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down!

217
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,505
Wait, what? What happened?

218
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,173
- A core memory!
- No!

219
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,045
Sadness, what are you doing?

220
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,916
It looked like one was crooked
so I opened it and then it fell out. I...

221
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,933
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

222
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,894
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa.

223
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,564
Sadness, you nearly
touched a core memory.

224
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,066
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

225
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,194
I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

226
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,071
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

227
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,365
You're not having a breakdown.
It's stress.

228
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,076
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

229
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,370
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

230
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:53,291
You know what?
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

231
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,961
There's always a way to
turn things around, to find the fun.

232
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:00,256
Yeah. Find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

233
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,757
Okay. Well, try to think
of something funny.

234
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,597
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

235
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,599
Yeah, that's not...

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,309
What about that time with Meg

237
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,980
when Riley laughed so hard
milk came out of her nose?

238
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,404
Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.

239
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,278
It was awful.

240
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,030
Okay, okay, don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

241
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,656
What are your favorite things to do?

242
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,575
My favorite?

243
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,619
Well, I like it when we're outside.

244
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,455
That's good.
Like there's the beach and sunshine.

245
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,541
Like that time we buried dad
in the sand up to his neck.

246
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,542
I was thinking more like rain.

247
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,465
Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!

248
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,425
We can stomp around in puddles.

249
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,803
You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.

250
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,641
More like when the rain runs down
our back and makes our shoes soggy.

251
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,769
And we get all cold, shivery,

252
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,730
and everything just
starts feeling droopy.

253
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,899
Hey, hey. Hey, easy.

254
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,110
Why are you crying?

255
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,660
It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

256
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:10,447
Crying helps me slow down and obsess
over the weight of life's problems.

257
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,746
You know what?
Let's, think about something else.

258
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:17,792
How about we read some
mind manuals, huh? Sounds fun.

259
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,335
I've read most of them.

260
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,128
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

261
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,298
"Long term memory retrieval,
volume 47"?

262
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,676
- No.
- A real page- Turner!

263
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:30,555
"Long term memory data selection
via channel subgrouping"?

264
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,266
See? Fun already! You lucky dog.

265
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:37,397
You're reading these cool things.
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

266
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,699
What can we do? We've only got capital
to last a month, maybe two.

267
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,369
If we can't find investors by then,
we're going to have to lay people off.

268
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,706
Mom! Dad! Come kiss me good night!

269
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,082
- I know. I know.
- Be right there!

270
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,793
We've got to land this, okay?

271
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,169
Did you hear dad?
He sounded really upset.

272
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,011
What was that?
Was it a bear? It's a bear!

273
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,554
There are no bears in San Francisco.

274
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,764
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

275
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,100
I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot.

276
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,476
I don't want to hear 
about your nerves.

277
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,561
I'll tell you what it is.

278
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,521
This move has been a bust.

279
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,731
That's what I've been 
telling you guys!

280
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,442
There are at least 37 things
for Riley to be scared of right now.

281
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,277
The smell alone
is enough to make her gag.

282
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,279
I can't believe
mom and dad moved us here!

283
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,573
Look, I get it. 
You guys have concerns.

284
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,033
But we've been through worse!

285
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,910
Tell you what,
let's make a list of all the things

286
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,703
Riley should be happy about.

287
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,581
Fine. Let's see, this house stinks,
our room stinks.

288
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,750
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

289
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,460
And all of our stuff 
is in the missing Van!

290
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,295
Come on. It could be worse.

291
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,666
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on the dirty floor. In a bag.

292
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,385
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start.
But think of all the good things that...

293
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,139
No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

294
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,432
Let us handle this.

295
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,935
I say we skip school tomorrow
and lock ourselves in the bedroom.

296
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,770
We have no clean clothes.
I mean, no one should see us.

297
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,563
Yeah, we could cry
until we can't breathe.

298
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,149
We should lock the door
and scream that curse word we know.

299
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,109
- It's a good one!
- Now hold on!

300
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,154
Look, we all have our off days.
You know...

301
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,280
Hi, honey.

302
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,451
The mom bad news train is pulling in.
Toot- toot!

303
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,453
Still no moving Van.

304
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,997
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday, can you believe it?

305
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,123
Toot- toot- toot!

306
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,250
Where's dad?

307
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,461
On the phone. This new venture
is keeping him pretty busy.

308
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,004
I rest my case!

309
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,798
Your dad's a little stressed,

310
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,716
you know, about getting
his new company up and running.

311
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,847
Now for a few
well- placed withering scowls.

312
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,810
I guess all I really want to say is,
thank you.

313
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:43,354
You know, through all this confusion
you've stayed...

314
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,605
Well, you've stayed our happy girl.

315
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,025
Your dad's under a lot of pressure,

316
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,572
but if you and I can keep smiling,
it would be a big help.

317
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,743
We can do that for him. Right?

318
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,658
Well.

319
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,581
Yeah, sure.

320
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,826
What did we do to deserve you?

321
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,632
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

322
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,885
Well, you can't argue with mom.
Happy it is.

323
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,261
Team happy! Sounds great!

324
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,852
Totally behind you, Joy.

325
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,765
Looks like we're going into rem.

326
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,727
I got dream duty, so I'll take care
of sending these to long term.

327
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:27,148
Great day today, guys!
Sleep well, team happy!

328
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,825
All right, what's on tonight,
dream production?

329
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,526
Well, this is it. The new place.

330
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,121
Come live with me, Riley.

331
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,501
Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

332
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,542
- Eat me!
- I'm organic!

333
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,007
No! Who is in charge
of programing down there?

334
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,468
I know I'm not supposed
to do this, but...

335
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,772
We are not going to
end the day like this.

336
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,728
don't you worry.

337
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,774
I'm gonna make sure
that tomorrow is another great day.

338
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,105
I promise.

339
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,790
Hello! Did I wake you?

340
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,916
Do you have to play that?

341
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,209
Well, I have to practice.

342
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,300
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

343
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,591
Okay, first day of school!
Very, very exciting.

344
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,968
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

345
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,094
Here it is! Fear.

346
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,680
I need a list of all the possible
negative outcomes

347
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,973
on the first day at a new school.

348
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,309
Way ahead of you there. Does anyone
know how to spell "meteor"?

349
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,770
Disgust. Make sure Riley stands out
today. But also blends in.

350
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,647
When I'm through,
Riley will look so good,

351
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,816
the other kids will
look at their own outfits and barf.

352
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:34,984
"Joy." "Yes, Joy?"

353
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,945
"You'll be in charge of the console,
keeping Riley happy all day long.

354
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,655
"And may I add I love your dress?
It's adorable."

355
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,486
"This old thing? Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls."

356
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,875
Train of thought! Right on schedule.

357
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,415
Anger. Unload the daydreams.

358
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,626
I ordered extra
in case things get slow in class.

359
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:52,668
It might come in handy.

360
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,004
If this new school is
full of boring, useless classes.

361
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,672
Which it probably will be.

362
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:00,384
Sadness. I have a
super important job just for you.

363
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,005
- Really?
- Follow me.

364
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,141
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect!

365
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,268
This is the circle of Sadness.

366
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:13,689
Your job is to make sure that
all the sadness stays inside of it.

367
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,651
So you want me to just stand here?

368
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,946
Hey, it's not my place
to tell you how to do your job.

369
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:24,492
Just make sure that
all the sadness stays in the circle!

370
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,828
See? You're a pro at this!
Isn't this fun?

371
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,038
- No.
- Atta girl.

372
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,331
All right, everyone, fresh start.

373
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,458
We are gonna have a good day,
which will turn into a good week,

374
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,710
which will turn into a good year,
which turns into a good life!

375
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:38,130
So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

376
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,716
I know! I'm kind of nervous,
but I'm mostly excited.

377
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,134
How do I look? Do you like my shirt?

378
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,845
Very cute!

379
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,513
Are you gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

380
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,431
Mom and dad? With us in public?

381
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,891
- No thank you.
- I'm on it!

382
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,477
Nope! I'm fine. Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

383
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,228
Have a good day at school, monkey.

384
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,403
Have a great day, sweetheart!

385
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,574
- That's crazy. It really is.
- That was so funny.

386
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,493
Do you know what
basketball game is coming up?

387
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,077
Are you sure we want to do this?

388
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,328
- In we go!
- Okay! Going in! Yes!

389
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:16,002
Did you see her? Hello?

390
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,423
Okay, we've got a group
of cool girls at two o'clock.

391
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,257
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierced, infinity scarf.

392
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,925
Is she wearing eye shadow?

393
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,969
- Yeah, we want to be friends with them.
- Let's go talk to them!

394
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,596
Are you kidding?
We're not talking to them.

395
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,014
We want them to like us.

396
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,432
Yeah. 
Wait, what?

397
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,434
Almost finished
with the potential disasters.

398
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:34,937
Worst scenario is either quicksand,
spontaneous combustion,

399
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,399
or getting called on by the teacher.
So as long as none of those happen...

400
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,860
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

401
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:44,197
Are you kidding me? Out of the gate?
This is not happening!

402
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:47,116
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

403
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,452
No! Pretend we can't speak English.

404
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,083
Don't worry. I got this.

405
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:53,789
Okay.

406
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,416
My name is Riley Andersen.

407
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:59,087
I'm from Minnesota 
and now I live here.

408
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,299
And how about Minnesota?

409
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,759
Can you tell us something about it?

410
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,300
Well, you certainly
get a lot more snow than we do.

411
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,433
She's hilarious!

412
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,143
Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

413
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,646
The lake freezes over,
and that's when we play hockey.

414
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,981
I'm on a great team.
We're called the prairie dogs.

415
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,984
My friend Meg plays forward.
And my dad's the coach.

416
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,612
Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.

417
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,489
It's kind of a family tradition.

418
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,700
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

419
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,996
Or we did, till I moved away.

420
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,164
- Hey, what gives?
- Wait, what?

421
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:39,460
Hey, Sadness! You touched a memory?
We talked about this.

422
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,170
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

423
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,839
Get back in your circle.

424
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,760
- What's going on? Why won't it eject?
- Get it out of there, Joy.

425
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,594
We used to play tag and stuff.

426
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,175
Cool kids whispering at three o'clock!

427
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,764
- Did you see that look?
- No.

428
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,265
They're judging us!

429
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:56,435
Somebody help me!
Grab that... everybody put...

430
00:23:56,436 --> 00:24:00,936
But everything's different now.
Since we moved.

431
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,530
No! We're crying! At school!

432
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:10,032
What? Sadness! What are you doing?

433
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,872
Oh, no! 
I'm sorry!

434
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,705
It's a core memory!

435
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,866
But it's blue.

436
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:23,212
No! Wait! 
Stop it! No! No!

437
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:30,887
Joy, no.

438
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,388
- That's a core memory!
- Hey!

439
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,223
- Joy, wait!
- Stop it! Let go!

440
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,484
The core memories!

441
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,742
No, no, no, no!

442
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,756
Thank you, Riley.

443
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,342
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place,

444
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,886
but we're happy to have you here.

445
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:14,055
All right, everyone,
get out your history books

446
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,596
and turn to chapter seven.

447
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,693
Can I say that curse word now?

448
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:44,843
No! One, two, three. Okay.

449
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,802
I got them. Where are we?

450
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,803
Long term memory? Wait...

451
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,693
Goofball island?

452
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,650
Riley's islands of personality.
They're all down!

453
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:07,984
This is bad.

454
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,486
We... we can fix this!

455
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,405
We just have to get back
to headquarters,

456
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:16,526
plug the core memories in,
and Riley will be back to normal.

457
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:22,004
Riley has no core memories.
No personality islands and no...

458
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:23,624
What? What is it?

459
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,667
You.

460
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:26,836
You're not in headquarters.

461
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:29,707
Without you, Riley can't be happy.

462
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,222
We got to get you back up there.

463
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,264
I'm coming, Riley.

464
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,278
So, as it turns out, the green trash can
is not recycling, it's for Greens.

465
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,905
Like compost. And eggshells.

466
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:56,741
And the blue one is recycling.
And the black one is trash.

467
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,826
Riley is acting so weird.
Why is she acting so weird?

468
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,245
What do you expect?
All the islands are down.

469
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,455
Joy would know what to do.

470
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,581
That's it.

471
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:06,501
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do!

472
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:10,922
Great idea. Anger, Fear, Disgust,
how are we supposed to be happy?

473
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:13,473
Hey, Riley. I've got good news!

474
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:16,344
I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Francisco.

475
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:20,389
And get this: Try- outs are tomorrow
after school. What luck, right?

476
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,891
- Hockey?
- What do we do?

477
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,434
Guys, this is...

478
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,810
You pretend to be Joy.

479
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,151
Won't it be great
to be back out on the ice?

480
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:31,404
Yeah, that sounds fantastic.

481
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,861
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

482
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,572
- Because I'm not Joy.
- Yeah, no kidding.

483
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,575
Did you guys pick up on that?

484
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,577
- Something's wrong.
- Totally.

485
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:42,870
Should we ask her?

486
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,748
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,
so she doesn't notice.

487
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:48,084
So, how was the first day of school?

488
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:49,293
She's probing us.

489
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,837
I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.

490
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,008
What? Okay.

491
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:56,592
It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

492
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:59,428
Very smooth. That was just like Joy.

493
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,597
Something is definitely going on.

494
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:04,058
She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

495
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,768
We're going to find out
what's happening.

496
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,103
But we'll need support.

497
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,604
Signal the husband.

498
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:15,784
With a nice pass over to Reeves,
comes across...And nice!

499
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,531
She's looking at us.

500
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,286
- What did she say?
- What?

501
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,787
Sorry, sir. No one was listening.

502
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,248
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

503
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,125
What? What is it, woman? What?

504
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:31,377
He's making that stupid face again.

505
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,296
I could strangle him right now.

506
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,957
Signal him again.

507
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,969
So, Riley, how was school?

508
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,929
- You got to be kidding me!
- Seriously?

509
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,974
For this we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

510
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,143
Move! I'll be Joy.

511
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:49,061
School was great, all right?

512
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,652
Riley. Is everything okay?

513
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,317
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

514
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,985
What is her deal?

515
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,737
All right, make a show of force.

516
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,322
I don't want to have to
put "the foot" down.

517
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,324
No, not the foot!

518
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,659
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

519
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,286
I'll show you attitude, old man.

520
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,077
No. No, no, no! Stay happy!

521
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,790
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

522
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,584
Sir, reporting high levels of sass!

523
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,503
Take it to defcon two.

524
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,964
You heard that, gentlemen.
Defcon two.

525
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:20,510
Listen, young lady, I don't know where
this disrespectful attitude came from...

526
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:23,429
You want a piece of this, pops?
Come and get it!

527
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,014
Yeah, well... well...

528
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,805
Here it comes. Prepare the foot!

529
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,772
Keys to safety position.

530
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:34,189
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

531
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,493
Just shut up!

532
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,696
Fire!

533
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:44,987
That's it! Go to your room! Now!

534
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:51,124
The foot is down! The foot is down!

535
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:56,125
Good job, gentlemen.
That could have been a disaster.

536
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,209
Well, that was a disaster.

537
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:04,098
Come fly with me, gatinha.

538
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,818
We're going to walk out there? 
On that?

539
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,653
It's the quickest way back.

540
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,780
But it's right over the memory dump.

541
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,157
If we fall, 
we'll be forgotten forever.

542
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:29,245
We have to do this for Riley.
Just follow my footsteps.

543
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:34,126
- Okay.
- It's not that high. It's totally fine...

544
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,430
Hey.

545
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:54,404
So, things got
a little out of hand downstairs.

546
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:57,268
Do you want to talk about it?

547
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,610
Come on, where's my happy girl?

548
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,152
Monkey.

549
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:06,117
He's trying to start up Goofball.

550
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,775
Come on!

551
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,756
Go back! Run, run, run!

552
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,908
What...

553
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,010
I get it. You need some alone time.

554
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:14,266
We'll talk later.

555
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,562
We have a Major problem.

556
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,651
Joy, where are you?

557
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,986
We lost Goofball island.

558
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:29,782
That means she can lose Friendship
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

559
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,410
You can fix this, right, Joy?

560
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:33,911
I...

561
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,080
I don't know.

562
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:38,671
But we have to try. Okay, come on.

563
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:41,627
Riley's gone to sleep.

564
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:45,715
Which is a good thing.
When you think about it because

565
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,967
nothing else bad can happen
while she's asleep.

566
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,136
We'll be back to headquarters
before she wakes up.

567
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:53,177
We'll just go across 
Friendship island.

568
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,559
We'll never make it.

569
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,894
- No!
- No, no, no!

570
00:32:57,895 --> 00:32:59,353
don't obsess over
the weight of life's problems.

571
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,230
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

572
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,816
Sadness, we don't have time for this.

573
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:07,403
We'll just have to go around.
Take the scenic route.

574
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,864
Wait, Joy, you could 
get lost in there!

575
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,490
Think positive!

576
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:15,541
Okay. I'm positive
you will get lost in there.

577
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,413
That's long term memory.

578
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:20,041
An endless Warren
of corridors and shelves.

579
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:22,585
I read about it in the manuals.

580
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,630
The manuals? The manuals!

581
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:27,548
- You read the manuals!
- Yeah.

582
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,759
So you know the way
back to headquarters!

583
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,260
I guess.

584
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,429
You are my map!

585
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,726
Let's go! Lead on, my map!
Show me where we're going!

586
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:42,522
Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk.

587
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:46,033
Just give me a few...Hours.

588
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,277
Which way? Left?

589
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,898
Right.

590
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:53,491
No. I mean, go left.
I said left was right. Like "correct."

591
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:54,742
Okay.

592
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:56,953
This actually feels kind of nice.

593
00:33:56,954 --> 00:34:00,373
Okay, here we go! We'll be back
to headquarters before morning.

594
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:04,464
We can do it! This will be easy!
This is working!

595
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,299
This is not working.
Are we getting close?

596
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Yeah, just another right.

597
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:17,473
And...A left and then another...
Left and...

598
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,934
Are you sure
you know where we're going?

599
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:23,195
Because we seem to be
walking away from headquarters.

600
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,864
Riley's awake.

601
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:33,656
don't touch. Remember?
If you touch them, they stay sad.

602
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:37,201
Sorry, I won't. Starting now.

603
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,579
I can't take much more of this.

604
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,163
Forget them!

605
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:44,174
- Mind workers!
- But, Joy, we're almost...

606
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:47,753
Phone numbers. We don't need
all these. They're in her phone.

607
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:50,304
- Excuse me, hi.
- Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it!

608
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,009
- I need to find Friendship island.
- Look at this.

609
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,510
Four years of piano lessons.

610
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:55,845
Yeah, it looks pretty faded.

611
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:59,216
You know what? Save chopsticks
and heart and soul, get rid of the rest.

612
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:01,017
- Are you...
- U.S. presidents. What do you think?

613
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:03,269
Yeah, just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

614
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,521
- Forget 'em!
- Hey! You can't throw those away!

615
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:06,939
Those are perfectly good memories.

616
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,275
The names of
every "cutie pie Princess" doll?

617
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,445
Yes! That is critical information!
Glitterstorm, honeypants...

618
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,196
Forget 'em!

619
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:19,744
Hey! Bring those back!

620
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,038
They're in the dump.
Nothing comes back from the dump.

621
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,706
Yeah. 
Look, lady, this is our job, okay?

622
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,167
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

623
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,585
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

624
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:31,672
Yeah, except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

625
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:33,633
- Tripledent gum
- will make you smile

626
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:35,009
the song from the gum commercial?

627
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,512
You know, sometimes we send that one
up to headquarters for no reason.

628
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,972
It just plays in Riley's head
over and over again.

629
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,807
Like a million times!

630
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:42,934
Let's watch it again!

631
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,560
Tripledent gum

632
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:47,605
yeah, I know. We all know the song.
Okay. Yeah, real catchy. Okay.

633
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:48,856
Hey, what do you think?
Should we do it?

634
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:49,899
Yeah!

635
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,900
Okay, here we go!

636
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:55,738
Tripledent gum

637
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:57,909
what the... this again?

638
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,410
Wait! Do you know
how to get to Friendship island?

639
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:02,495
Tripledent gum

640
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,748
do you like it there? Did you feel
any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool?

641
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,584
Yeah, it's good.
What happened with the playoffs?

642
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:09,669
We won the first game.

643
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,963
Coach says we might actually
go to the finals this year.

644
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,924
And we've got this new girl
on the team. She's so cool.

645
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:16,509
She did not just say that.

646
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,762
A new girl?
Meg has a new friend already?

647
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,055
Hey, hey! Stay happy!

648
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:23,391
We do not want to lose
any more islands here, guys!

649
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,560
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.

650
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,019
It's like mind reading!

651
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,396
You like to read minds, Meg?

652
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,314
I got something for you to read,
right here!

653
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:32,145
Let's just be calm for one second!

654
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:34,193
- I heard they have parrots...
- I've got to go.

655
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,074
- What?
- I got to go!

656
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:41,657
Okay, could you just please
tell me which way is... oh, no!

657
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:47,255
Friendship island! What?

658
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,840
Not Friendship.

659
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,854
Riley loved that one. 
And now it's gone.

660
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:13,985
Goodbye, Friendship. 
Hello, loneliness.

661
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:20,325
We'll just have to go the long way.

662
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:25,537
Yeah. The long, long, long, long way.

663
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:27,826
I'm ready.

664
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:31,384
There's got to be a better way.

665
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,000
Look at you!

666
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:38,508
I will take you, but not you.

667
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:40,968
Who am I kidding? I can't leave you.

668
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,845
Hello!

669
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,556
Wait! Hey! Wait!

670
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,523
Wait! Stop!

671
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,317
Excuse me.

672
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,447
I was looking for... diversion!

673
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,818
- What?
- So long, sucker!

674
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,118
I hurt all over.

675
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,995
Wait. I know you.

676
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:11,624
No, you don't. I get that a lot.
I look like a lot of people.

677
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,084
No, no, no. I do.

678
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,878
Bing bong! Riley's imaginary friend!

679
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:18,422
- You really do know me?
- Well, of course!

680
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:21,050
Riley loved playing with you!
You two are best friends!

681
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,594
You would know. We're trying
to get back to headquarters.

682
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:25,847
Headquarters?
You guys are from headquarters?

683
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:29,016
Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is Sadness.

684
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,768
You're Joy? The Joy?

685
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,436
What the heck are you doing out here?

686
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,605
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

687
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:37,650
Without you, 
Riley won't ever be happy.

688
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:40,111
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

689
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:42,196
I'll tell you what. Follow me!

690
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:43,281
Thank you!

691
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:44,991
It is so great to see you again.

692
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,285
I gotta tell you,
I am such a huge fan of your work.

693
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:50,371
Do you remember
when you and Riley were in a band?

694
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,290
I went to all of your concerts.

695
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,791
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.

696
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,418
Watching you play tag 
was such a treat.

697
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,794
two- time world champ.

698
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,504
And remember your rockets?

699
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,840
Of course! It runs on song power!

700
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,341
That's right! Your theme song!

701
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,801
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

702
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:05,136
Bing bong
bing bong

703
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,554
his rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

704
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,347
- Bing bong, bing bong
- bing bong, bing bong

705
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:10,766
what exactly are you supposed to be?

706
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,561
You know, it's unclear.
I'm mostly cotton candy.

707
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:18,357
But shape- wise I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

708
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:19,728
Dolphin?

709
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:25,364
You got to remember, when Riley
was three, animals were all the rage.

710
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,325
The cow goes moo.
The horse goes neigh.

711
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:29,035
That's all people
talked about back then.

712
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,621
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true.
What are you doing out here?

713
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:35,124
Well, there's not much call
for imaginary friends lately.

714
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,085
So I, you know...

715
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:41,714
Hey, hey. don't be sad.

716
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,883
Tell you what.
When I get back up to headquarters,

717
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,927
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

718
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:48,758
- You will?
- Of course! She'd love that.

719
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,349
This is the greatest day of my life!

720
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,271
Are you okay?

721
00:39:57,981 --> 00:40:00,316
- Hey, what's going on?
- I cry candy.

722
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,937
Try the caramel. It's delicious.

723
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:06,155
- Here, use this.
- Thanks!

724
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,696
Hold on, wait a second.

725
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:13,294
It always gets stuck at the bottom.

726
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,584
Here. What? It's imaginary.

727
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,671
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier
to walk back to headquarters.

728
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,506
Walk? We're not walking.

729
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:26,087
We're taking the train of thought!

730
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,136
The train, of course!

731
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,722
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

732
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,516
Well, it kind of goes 
all over the place,

733
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,977
but there is a station
in imagination land.

734
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:38,729
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

735
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,400
I am so glad we ran into you!

736
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:44,277
The station is right through here.
After you.

737
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:45,695
- Joy.
- What?

738
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:48,906
I read about this place in the manual.
We shouldn't go in there.

739
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,492
Bing bong says
it's the quickest way to headquarters.

740
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:53,744
No, but, Joy, 
this is abstract thought.

741
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:57,373
What are you talking about? I go in here
all the time. It's a shortcut, you see?

742
00:40:57,374 --> 00:41:01,674
D- a- n- g- e- r. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

743
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:07,626
Look at me. I'm closer to the station
because I'm taking the shortcut.

744
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,468
Let's go around. This way.

745
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,719
Almost there!

746
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:14,724
If you want to walk the long way,
go for it.

747
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,767
But Riley needs to be happy.

748
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:19,604
I'm not missing that train.
Bing bong knows what he's doing.

749
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,564
He's part dolphin. They're very smart.

750
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,735
Well, I guess.

751
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:28,705
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

752
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:45,917
Okay, what abstract concept
are we trying to comprehend today?

753
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,840
Loneliness.

754
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,467
Looks like there's something in there.

755
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:51,969
I'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk.

756
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,010
What did I tell you?
You'll be at headquarters in no time.

757
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,679
Say, would you look at that?

758
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:01,442
- What's happening?
- Oh, no, they turned it on.

759
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,400
Never seen this before.

760
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:09,114
My face! My beautiful face!

761
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:10,863
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting!

762
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:15,034
There are four stages. This is the first:
Non-objective fragmentation!

763
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,202
All right. Do not panic.

764
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:19,123
What is important
is that we all stay together.

765
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,750
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing!

766
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,251
Run!

767
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,509
I can't feel my legs!

768
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:28,923
There they are.

769
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:30,634
Come here, me!

770
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:35,930
We've got to get out of here before
we're nothing but shape and color!

771
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,515
We'll get stuck here forever!

772
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,350
Stuck? Why did we come in here?

773
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:42,019
I told you, it's a shortcut!

774
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,110
The train!

775
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,153
Oh, no. We're two- dimensional!
That's stage three!

776
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:52,196
We're getting nowhere!

777
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:55,777
- Depth! I'm lacking depth!
- Come on.

778
00:42:58,412 --> 00:42:59,745
We can't fit.

779
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:03,666
Oh, no, we're nonfigurative.
This is the last stage!

780
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,917
We're not going to make it!

781
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:11,377
Wait! We're two- dimensional.
Fall on your face!

782
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,147
Stop! Stop!

783
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:28,149
No! I thought you said
that was a shortcut.

784
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,152
I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.

785
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,362
That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.

786
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:34,572
How long until the next train?

787
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:38,326
Who knows. But don't worry.
There's another station. That way.

788
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:41,495
The train always stops there.
Right before it goes to headquarters.

789
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,539
If we hurry, we can catch it.

790
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,330
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

791
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:48,377
Yeah!

792
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,213
Is there really another station?

793
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,884
Through there.

794
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:56,385
Welcome to imagination land!

795
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:58,513
- Imagination land?
- Sure!

796
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,932
I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

797
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:03,768
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French fry forest!

798
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:06,103
- Delicious.
- No way!

799
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,814
Check it out! Trophy town!

800
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:12,395
Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!

801
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:14,695
I won first place!

802
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:17,532
- Me too!
- Participation award.

803
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:21,035
Wait, is that...
Sadness, look, it's cloud town!

804
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,079
That is my favorite!

805
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,539
It's so soft!

806
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,332
Let me try.

807
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,209
Hey! What's the big idea?

808
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,420
You better fix that wall,
or else you're in big troub...

809
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,918
Oh, no! Lava!

810
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:38,336
Imagination land is the best!

811
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,889
Is it all going to be so interactive?

812
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,267
Hey, look! The house of cards!

813
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,686
Wait. Hang on just a minute.

814
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,229
- Your rocket!
- Yeah.

815
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,022
I stashed it in there for safekeeping,

816
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:52,943
and now I'm all set to
take Riley to the moon!

817
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:55,528
- I'm sorry.
- Great.

818
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,697
I love imagination land.

819
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:00,948
Isn't it great? And there's
always something new, like...

820
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:04,370
Who the heck is that?

821
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:05,788
Imaginary boyfriend.

822
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:08,119
I would die for Riley.

823
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,088
- I've never seen him before.
- I live in Canada.

824
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,880
Anyway, this way.
Through preschool world!

825
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:16,551
- We're nearly to the train!
- Riley, here we come!

826
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:22,889
This should be fun!
New team, new friends.

827
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,265
These kids look pretty good,

828
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:25,975
considering they're from San Francisco.

829
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,351
Okay, Andersen, you're up!

830
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:30,479
- Got to go.
- Okay. Good luck, sweetie!

831
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,731
Luck isn't going to help us now.

832
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:33,566
If she tries to use Hockey island,
it's going down.

833
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,986
Which is why I've recalled
every hockey memory I can think of.

834
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:39,822
One of these has got to work
in place of the core memory.

835
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:41,743
- She's about to play!
- Hurry!

836
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:52,039
We did it, gang! It's working!

837
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:59,338
Line change! Line change!
Change it up!

838
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,522
No! No!

839
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,313
It's like we don't learn anything.

840
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:14,398
- Come on!
- Let's pick it up out there!

841
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:17,359
Pass! Shoot it! Shoot it!

842
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:20,905
- That's it!
- No, no, no! Breathe.

843
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:22,616
Find your happy place.

844
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:28,415
What's her problem?

845
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:36,337
- Riley. What's wrong?
- Let's go.

846
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,923
- You're not going to finish try-outs?
- What's the point?

847
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:41,300
Hey. It'll be all right. 
Let's just go back...

848
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:43,851
Stop saying everything 
will be all right!

849
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,354
Nice hustle, ladies!

850
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:56,730
Hockey?

851
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:03,948
No, no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey.

852
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:06,284
- Hey! Look at that! Very nice shot!
- Hey!

853
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:08,244
Bing bong,
we have to get to that station.

854
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:10,454
Sure thing. This way,
just past Graham cracker castle.

855
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:13,708
Hey. That's weird. Graham cracker
castle used to be right here.

856
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:16,085
I wonder why they moved it?
That's not...

857
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:18,671
I would have sworn
sparkle pony mountain was right here.

858
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,506
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

859
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,587
- We'll have to come back.
- Princess dream world!

860
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:28,427
Oh, no!
The stuffed animal hall of fame!

861
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:31,016
My rocket!

862
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:33,519
Wait! Riley and I,
we're still using that rocket!

863
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,105
It still has some song power left!

864
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:38,106
Who's your friend who likes to play?

865
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:47,909
No! No, no, no. No, you can't
take my rocket to the dump!

866
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,700
Riley and I are going to the moon!

867
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:57,789
Riley can't be done with me.

868
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:07,136
Hey, it's going to be okay!
We can fix this!

869
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:09,138
We just need to
get back to headquarters.

870
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:10,515
Which way to the train station?

871
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:13,516
I had a whole trip planned for us.

872
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:19,483
Hey, who's ticklish, huh?
Here comes the tickle monster!

873
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,320
Hey, bing bong! Look at this!

874
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:26,113
Here's a fun game!

875
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:30,284
You point to the train station
and we all go there!

876
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:33,995
Won't that be fun?
Come on, let's go to the train station!

877
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,415
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

878
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,505
They took something that you loved.
It's gone. Forever.

879
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:44,924
Sadness. don't make him feel worse.

880
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:48,219
- Sorry.
- It's all I had left of Riley.

881
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,390
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

882
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:53,182
They were wonderful.

883
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:57,019
Once we flew back in time.
We had breakfast twice that day.

884
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,187
Sadness...

885
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:01,318
It sounds amazing. 
I bet Riley liked it.

886
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:05,611
She did. We were best friends.

887
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:08,412
Yeah. It's sad.

888
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,210
I'm okay now.

889
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:26,512
Come on. 
The train station is this way.

890
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:34,140
How did you do that?

891
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:36,142
I don't know. He was sad.

892
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:37,476
So I listened to what...

893
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:40,397
Hey! There's the train!

894
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:54,332
We made it!
We're finally going to get home!

895
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:58,664
Oh, no! These facts and opinions
look so similar.

896
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:01,745
don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

897
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,299
On a scale of one to ten,
I give this day an f.

898
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,427
Well, why don't we quit standing around
and do something?

899
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:12,595
Like what, genius?

900
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:14,514
Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

901
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:19,105
Sure it's the coward's way out.
But this coward's gonna survive.

902
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,440
Emotions can't quit, genius!

903
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,320
I thought we were supposed
to be keeping Riley happy.

904
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:34,489
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

905
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:41,582
- What is it?
- Nothing.

906
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,960
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

907
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:46,629
All the good core memories
were made in Minnesota.

908
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,799
Ergo, we go
back to Minnesota and make more.

909
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,883
- Ta- da!
- Wait, wait, wait.

910
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:52,885
You're saying we run away?

911
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:54,345
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

912
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:57,056
I'd call it the happy core
memory development program.

913
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:58,432
You can't be serious.

914
00:50:58,433 --> 00:50:59,934
Hey! Our life was perfect

915
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:04,315
until mom and dad decided
to move to San Fran stinktown.

916
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:06,274
I mean, it's just so drastic!

917
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:08,526
Need I remind you
of how great things were there?

918
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:11,697
Our room? Our back yard? Our friends?

919
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,407
- Tripledent gum
- will make you smile

920
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:17,158
did I ask for the gum commercial?

921
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,661
Anyway, it was better, 
that's my point.

922
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:21,247
Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.

923
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:23,828
Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we
just sleep on this or something?

924
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:25,376
Fine. Let's sleep on it.

925
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:28,337
Because, hey,
I'm sure jolly fun- filled times

926
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:31,218
are just around the corner.

927
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:44,395
Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving?

928
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:46,856
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

929
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:48,733
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

930
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:51,027
Yeah, the train of thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

931
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:53,487
- We can't wait that long.
- How about we wake her up?

932
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:56,778
Sadness, that's ridiculous!
How could we possibly...

933
00:51:58,702 --> 00:51:59,827
How about we wake her up?

934
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,413
- Great idea, Joy.
- Thanks. Come on!

935
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,544
Dream

936
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:09,545
this place is huge!

937
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:12,466
Yeah, it looks so much smaller
than I expected.

938
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:16,139
I can fly? I love that one!

939
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,887
Rainbow unicorn! She's right there!

940
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:25,478
My friend says you're famous.
She wants your autograph.

941
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:28,356
No, no, Sadness,
don't bother miss unicorn, okay?

942
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:31,777
Sorry, she's from out of town.
That was so embarrassing, right?

943
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:34,820
I loved you in
fairy dream adventure part 7.

944
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,489
Okay, bye. I love you!

945
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,740
Do not enter when
light flashing

946
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:39,534
wonder what that means.

947
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:41,205
Well, let's go in.

948
00:52:42,955 --> 00:52:45,748
Set up the classroom set!
Today's memories are in!

949
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,667
We've got a lot to work with here.

950
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:50,711
Riley dumped her best friend,
had a miserable day at school,

951
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:51,796
and quit hockey.

952
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:54,090
The writers have
put together a killer script!

953
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:56,300
Just because Joy
and Sadness are gone,

954
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:58,391
I have to do stupid dream duty.

955
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:01,722
Okay. How are we
going to wake her up?

956
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:04,642
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

957
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:05,726
We could scare her.

958
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:08,062
Scare her? No,
she's been through enough already.

959
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:09,146
- But, Joy...
- Sadness,

960
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:11,732
you may know your way
around down here, but I know Riley.

961
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:15,278
We're gonna make her so happy,
she'll wake up with exhilaration.

962
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:16,612
We'll excite her awake!

963
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:18,781
That's never happened before.

964
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:20,449
Riley loves dogs. Put this on.

965
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,492
I don't think that'll work.

966
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:23,244
- Bing bong?
- Yeah?

967
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:26,795
- don't let anything happen to these.
- Got it.

968
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,253
Add the reality distortion filter.

969
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:34,755
Love it. Remember,
play to the camera, everyone!

970
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:36,465
Riley is the camera!

971
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:40,216
Makeup, get out of there,
we are on in five, four, three...

972
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:44,015
Hello, class.

973
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:47,560
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

974
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:49,353
Man, she is one bad actress.

975
00:53:49,354 --> 00:53:51,694
...which counts for 90%
of your final grade,

976
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:56,444
I want to introduce
our new student. Riley.

977
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:58,613
Would you like to stand up

978
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:00,784
- and introduce yourself?
- Camera.

979
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:03,284
And cue Riley.

980
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:04,994
My name is Riley Andersen.

981
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:08,335
I'm from Minnesota 
and now I live here.

982
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,960
Look! Her teeth are falling out!

983
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:13,794
- That's disgusting.
- Gross!

984
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:16,835
Teeth falling out.
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

985
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:19,342
Let me guess, we have no pants on.

986
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,385
Hey, look! She came to school
with no pants on!

987
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:22,553
Called it!

988
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:23,596
Ready?

989
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,933
I don't think this happy thing
is going to work. But if we scare her...

990
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:28,944
Just follow my lead. Here we go.

991
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:31,938
Bark! Bark! Bark!

992
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,519
Who is that?

993
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:35,232
What's going on?

994
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:39,033
Asleep
asleep -  awake

995
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:43,163
you're on! Go!

996
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:46,911
Let's party! Let's dance!

997
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:48,657
Hey, a party.

998
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:50,873
Bark, bark, bark!

999
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:53,294
Joy, this isn't working.

1000
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,630
Sadness, what are you doing?
Come back here!

1001
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:06,313
It's just a dream, it's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

1002
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:10,638
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security!

1003
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,854
Hi, Riley, it's me!

1004
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:14,355
- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing bong?

1005
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:17,436
- Bing bong, bing bong!
- Sadness, stop! It was working!

1006
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:21,571
Sadness! You are ruining this dream!
You're scaring her!

1007
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:23,452
But look, it's working!

1008
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:27,197
They are not part of this dream.
Get them!

1009
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,041
Stop right there!

1010
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:32,161
Pan away! Pan away!

1011
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:38,296
Pick a plotline!

1012
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:40,089
- Careful!
- Hold still!

1013
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,465
You can't do this!

1014
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:44,086
I know people in headquarters!

1015
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:48,764
Cut that out! Please!

1016
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:52,977
Do you like candy? You look hungry.
I get you candy! No!

1017
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,268
No, no. No, no!

1018
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:56,981
There go the core memories!

1019
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:59,822
I can't go in there!
I'm scared of the dark! Please!

1020
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,244
Come on.

1021
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,865
- What is this place?
- The subconscious.

1022
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:10,286
It's where they take
all the troublemakers.

1023
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:13,998
My hat feels loose.

1024
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:15,625
How do we get in?

1025
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:18,211
- Let me see.
- You got my hat? Or is that your hat?

1026
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,295
- Yeah, it's my hat.

1027
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:21,836
You sure?
I don't know, look in the label.

1028
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:24,509
- Yeah, it says, "my hat."
- Wait, it says, "my hat"?

1029
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,344
- My hat, it says.
- That's what I wrote in my hat.

1030
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:27,929
- What are you talking about?
- You've got my hat on.

1031
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,430
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1032
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:32,481
- Hey! You!
- You caught us!

1033
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:35,733
Get back in there! No escaping!

1034
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:49,832
I don't like it here. It's where
they keep Riley's darkest fears.

1035
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:53,406
It's broccoli.

1036
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,789
The stairs to the basement!

1037
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:02,047
Grandma's vacuum cleaner!

1038
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:11,847
Okay, come on.

1039
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,685
- Would you walk quieter?
- I'm trying.

1040
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:17,186
What is going...

1041
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,310
Candy wrappers?

1042
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:33,202
- Bing bong!
- Joy?

1043
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:34,703
- There you are.
- Shhh!

1044
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:43,128
It's Jangles.

1045
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:45,382
Who's the birthday girl?
Who's the birthday girl?

1046
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:58,686
Do you have the core memories?

1047
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:02,767
Yeah. 
All he cared about was the candy!

1048
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:22,668
We're out of here! 
Let's get to that train!

1049
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:26,923
Wait! The train's not running.
We still have to wake up Riley.

1050
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:28,594
But how?

1051
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,683
Oh, no!

1052
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,784
Hey, Sadness. Did you hear \about
the pa- pa- party they were having?

1053
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:59,455
Yeah. Yes, Joy. 
Isn't it a birthday party?

1054
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:02,456
Did you say birthday?

1055
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:04,627
And there's going to be
cake and presents.

1056
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:05,878
And games and balloons...

1057
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,421
A birthday?

1058
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:09,842
Okay. Follow us!

1059
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:13,135
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

1060
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,637
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1061
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:16,138
No it isn't. 
That's my... I wrote that.

1062
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:17,889
No, but this one's my handwriting.

1063
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:39,505
Who's the birthday girl?

1064
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:46,338
Come on, let's go!

1065
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,969
We made it!

1066
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,430
Guess who's on their way
to headquarters!

1067
00:59:57,431 --> 00:59:58,971
We are!

1068
01:00:05,397 --> 01:00:08,107
- What is going on?
- He did it again!

1069
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:10,651
We were at school, and we were naked,
and there was a dog,

1070
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:14,071
and his back half was chasing him
and then we saw bing bong!

1071
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:17,408
You idiot! It was a dream!
This is ridiculous!

1072
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:20,203
We can't even get
a good night's sleep anymore.

1073
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:21,954
Time to take action.

1074
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:23,664
Stupid mom and dad.

1075
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:25,875
If they hadn't moved us,
none of this would've happened.

1076
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:27,666
Who's with me?

1077
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:30,918
No no no no no.

1078
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:33,631
Yeah. Let's do it.

1079
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:47,355
She took it. There's no turning back.

1080
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:50,066
So how are we going
to get to Minnesota from here?

1081
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:52,151
Well, why don't we go down
to the elephant lot

1082
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:53,319
and rent an elephant?

1083
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,612
Hey. That sounds nice.

1084
01:00:54,613 --> 01:00:56,573
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1085
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,368
There's a bus
leaving tomorrow. Perfect!

1086
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:02,411
A ticket costs money.
How do we get money?

1087
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:04,789
- Mom's purse.
- You wouldn't.

1088
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:07,960
But I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1089
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:11,087
- Tripledent gum
- no!

1090
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:14,590
It's downstairs somewhere.
Mom and dad got us into this mess.

1091
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:16,591
They can pay to get us out.

1092
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:23,266
How about this, huh? Isn't this nice?
You can see everything from up here.

1093
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:26,561
Look, there's inductive reasoning.
There's déjà vu.

1094
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:29,397
There's language processing.
There's déjà vu.

1095
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:32,066
There's critical thinking.
There's déjà vu.

1096
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:34,237
Hey, look at this, guys! Memories!

1097
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:39,866
Hey. That was a good idea.
About scaring Riley awake.

1098
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:41,450
You're not so bad.

1099
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:43,161
Really?

1100
01:01:43,245 --> 01:01:44,755
Nice work.

1101
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:47,957
I can't wait to get 
the old Riley back.

1102
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,793
As soon as we get there,
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1103
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:52,128
Is this Riley?

1104
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:54,964
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1105
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,465
How are we gonna get to the moon?

1106
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:59,302
It's that time in the twisty tree,
remember?

1107
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:03,389
The hockey team showed up
and mom and dad were there cheering.

1108
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,560
Look at her, having fun and laughing.

1109
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,937
I love this one.

1110
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:10,938
I love that one, too.

1111
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:13,482
Atta girl! Now you're getting it!

1112
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:17,320
Yeah. It was the day the prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1113
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:22,121
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful. She wanted to quit.

1114
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:26,333
Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I?

1115
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:30,500
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back. Okay?

1116
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:32,081
Okay.

1117
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:35,959
But I just don't understand.

1118
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:40,345
Why did our moving Van
even go to Texas?

1119
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,848
Multiple customers?

1120
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:56,280
Well, we were promised
delivery on the fifth.

1121
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:09,909
Excuse me, isn't there any way 
that you can rush it?

1122
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:16,666
Honesty island?

1123
01:03:24,263 --> 01:03:26,643
Look out!

1124
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:33,230
Come on!

1125
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:38,234
Hold on!

1126
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:42,825
Hurry up! Come on! Over here!
Come on, people! Let's, go, go, go!

1127
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:55,956
That was our way home.

1128
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:58,671
We lost another island?
What is happening?

1129
01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:02,008
Haven't you heard?
Riley's running away.

1130
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:03,679
What?

1131
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:07,101
Wait, wait, hang on, guys.

1132
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,849
Are we really doing this?
I mean, this is serious.

1133
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,559
Look. We have no core memories.

1134
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,102
You want Riley to be happy?

1135
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:16,233
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

1136
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:20,481
Joy, if we hurry, 
we can still stop her.

1137
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:23,398
Family island. Let's go!

1138
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:40,626
Joy! Joy! It's too dangerous!

1139
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:42,844
We won't make it in time.

1140
01:04:45,594 --> 01:04:47,604
But that's our only way back!

1141
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:01,655
A recall tube!

1142
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:06,410
We can get recalled!

1143
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:10,743
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1144
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:12,834
See you after school, monkey.

1145
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:14,465
We love you!

1146
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,835
Go! Run, run! Go!

1147
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:33,524
Whoa! Whoa! Sadness! Sadness, stop!

1148
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:35,476
You're hurting Riley!

1149
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:37,767
No, no, no! I did it again!

1150
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:41,983
If you get in here,
these core memories will get sad.

1151
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:50,157
I'm sorry. Riley needs to be happy.

1152
01:05:50,158 --> 01:05:52,368
Joy?

1153
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:07,429
Joy!

1154
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:13,308
Joy!

1155
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,920
Joy?

1156
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:55,102
Joy!

1157
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:04,189
Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please?

1158
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:11,781
don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here.

1159
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,622
We're forgotten.

1160
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:24,543
We used to play tag and stuff.

1161
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,681
But everything's different now.

1162
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,644
Since we moved.

1163
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:11,222
Do you remember how she used to stick
her tongue out when she was coloring?

1164
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,980
I could listen to her stories all day.

1165
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:40,122
I just wanted Riley to be happy.

1166
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,671
And now...

1167
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:44,934
It was the day the prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1168
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:48,945
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1169
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:51,359
She wanted to quit.

1170
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:10,749
Sadness.

1171
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:15,256
Mom and dad... the team...

1172
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:19,969
They came to help because of Sadness.

1173
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:27,854
We have to get back up there.

1174
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:30,862
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1175
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:33,731
We might as well be on another planet.

1176
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,493
Another planet.

1177
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:47,004
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1178
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:52,710
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1179
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:56,051
His rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

1180
01:10:59,134 --> 01:11:02,220
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say?

1181
01:11:02,221 --> 01:11:05,431
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1182
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:07,562
his rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

1183
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:22,534
Hop in.

1184
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:28,788
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1185
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:30,998
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1186
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:34,339
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1187
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:36,963
who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1188
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:38,965
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1189
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:42,046
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing the song to say...

1190
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:49,892
Come on!

1191
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:52,144
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1192
01:11:52,145 --> 01:11:54,480
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1193
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:56,482
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1194
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:58,483
who's your friend who likes to play?

1195
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:13,582
Come on, Joy. One more time.

1196
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:15,957
I got a feeling about this one.

1197
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:18,004
Bing bong, bing bong
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"

1198
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:19,422
Bing bong, bing bong

1199
01:12:19,423 --> 01:12:21,215
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1200
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:23,593
who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1201
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:26,470
louder! Joy, sing louder!

1202
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:29,061
To sing this song to say
who's your friend who likes to...

1203
01:12:30,309 --> 01:12:32,101
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1204
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:34,103
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1205
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,522
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1206
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:37,690
bing bong

1207
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:39,571
we're gonna make it!

1208
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:49,827
Bing bong! We did it!

1209
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:53,998
We... bing bong? Bing bong!

1210
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:56,675
You made it!

1211
01:12:57,544 --> 01:13:00,304
Go! Go save Riley!

1212
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:06,975
Take her to the moon for me. Okay?

1213
01:13:20,025 --> 01:13:22,855
I'll try, bing bong.

1214
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:27,412
I promise.

1215
01:13:40,254 --> 01:13:42,214
We're home!

1216
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:45,682
Riley? Riley!

1217
01:13:49,513 --> 01:13:51,473
I'll call her cell.

1218
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:56,978
This is terrible. Wait,
is that someone walking towards us?

1219
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:58,689
Yep, let's cross the street.

1220
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:04,527
It's mom. She's onto us!

1221
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:05,862
- What do we do?
- Where's my bag?

1222
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:07,405
Riley needs to get core memories.

1223
01:14:07,406 --> 01:14:09,486
- That's the stuff.
- We keep going.

1224
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:14,042
Sadness!

1225
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:26,215
Sadness! Sadness?

1226
01:14:26,216 --> 01:14:28,718
Come on, Sadness. Where are you?

1227
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,719
Okay. If I were Sadness,
where would I be?

1228
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:36,601
Everything is awful
and my legs don't work,

1229
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:40,442
and you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1230
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:57,457
Oh, no! It's mom again! What do we do?

1231
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:06,422
This is madness!
She shouldn't run away!

1232
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:08,423
Let's get this idea out of her head.

1233
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:10,546
Sadness?

1234
01:15:12,262 --> 01:15:15,262
- Sadness!
- Joy?

1235
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:16,927
Wait! Sadness!

1236
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:21,229
Just let me go!
Riley's better off without me!

1237
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:22,730
Come back!

1238
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:31,239
Okay, you're saying your husband
was blown away by an elephant.

1239
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,365
Was he with anyone?

1240
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:33,783
Yes! And there she is!

1241
01:15:33,784 --> 01:15:35,284
Hey! Come back here!

1242
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:37,945
Forget it, Jake. It's cloud town.

1243
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:43,251
What? Sadness!

1244
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:46,254
I only make everything worse!

1245
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:48,975
Wait! Sadness!
We got to get you back to...

1246
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:00,268
- It's stuck!
- Great.

1247
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:02,603
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

1248
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:04,734
Oh, no no no no! What is this?

1249
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:14,866
- How do we stop it?
- I got it!

1250
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:16,659
Make her feel scared!
That'll make her change her mind!

1251
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,786
- Brilliant!
- I know it's brilliant! Do it!

1252
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:20,872
Nothing's working!
Why isn't it working?

1253
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:21,497
- Let me try.
- Great! You broke it!

1254
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:22,665
No, I didn't! don't touch that!

1255
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:24,326
- Let me do it! Get out of here!

1256
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:32,425
Guys, we can't make
Riley feel anything.

1257
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:35,013
What have we done?

1258
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:38,514
Hey! Hey, look at me!
Did you mean what you said before?

1259
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,975
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1260
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:43,136
Yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it.

1261
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:48,441
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1262
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,492
I would die for Riley!

1263
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,790
That's it! I fold!

1264
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:43,956
This is crazy. This is crazy.
No, no, no. Joy. Be positive.

1265
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:49,629
I am positive this is crazy!

1266
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:56,428
- Now!
- For Riley!

1267
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:05,937
- Joy?
- Hang on!

1268
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:09,273
I wish Joy was here!

1269
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:17,858
It's Joy!

1270
01:18:18,282 --> 01:18:19,992
Stand back!

1271
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:21,617
That worked.

1272
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:23,698
Well, what would you do,
if you're so smart?

1273
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:26,956
I'd tell you,
but you're too dumb to understand.

1274
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:27,957
What?

1275
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:29,792
Of course your tiny brain is confused.

1276
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:32,670
Guess I'll just have to
dumb it down to your level.

1277
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:37,471
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you, but let me try. Duh!

1278
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:47,977
Thank goodness you're back!

1279
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:49,979
- Things are really messed up!
- We found this idea.

1280
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,360
We were just
trying to make happy memories.

1281
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:03,492
Joy, you got to fix this! 
Get up there!

1282
01:19:03,493 --> 01:19:05,244
Sadness, it's up to you.

1283
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:07,580
- Me?
- Sadness?

1284
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:08,831
I can't, Joy.

1285
01:19:08,832 --> 01:19:11,922
Yes, you can. Riley needs you.

1286
01:19:23,347 --> 01:19:25,007
Okay.

1287
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,290
Wait! Stop! I want to get off!

1288
01:19:59,424 --> 01:20:01,175
All right. Thank you. We will.

1289
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:02,844
Her teacher
hasn't even seen Riley all day.

1290
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:04,053
- What?
- What was she wearing last?

1291
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,934
- Do you even remember what...
- I can't believe this.

1292
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,891
Riley, there you are! Thank goodness!

1293
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:11,352
We were worried sick!
Where have you been? It's so late!

1294
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:13,479
Honey! What happened?
Are you all right?

1295
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,314
We asked the neighbors,
I called the school,

1296
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:16,895
we talked to your teacher.

1297
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:46,948
I know you don't want me to but...

1298
01:21:47,824 --> 01:21:49,664
I miss home.

1299
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:53,156
I miss Minnesota.

1300
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:59,793
You need me to be happy, but...

1301
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:05,926
I want my old friends,
and my hockey team.

1302
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:09,854
I want to go home.

1303
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,721
Please don't be mad.

1304
01:22:16,121 --> 01:22:19,444
- Oh. Sweetie.
- We're not mad.

1305
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:24,534
You know what? I miss Minnesota too.

1306
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:28,817
I miss the woods where we took hikes.

1307
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:32,163
And the backyard
where you used to play.

1308
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:35,826
Spring lake,
where you learned to skate.

1309
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:39,211
Come here.

1310
01:23:59,957 --> 01:24:01,707
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1311
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,251
Friendship island has expanded.

1312
01:24:03,252 --> 01:24:05,920
Glad they finally opened
that friendly argument section.

1313
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:08,214
I like tragic vampire romance island.

1314
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,925
Fashion island? Everyone shut up.

1315
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:13,261
Boy band island?
Hope that's just a phase.

1316
01:24:13,262 --> 01:24:17,014
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

1317
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:18,641
All right. Here you go.

1318
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:21,732
Your new expanded console
is up and runnin'.

1319
01:24:23,146 --> 01:24:24,814
Cool! Upgrade!

1320
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:27,365
Hey! Whoops, wait. Did I just do that?

1321
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:29,819
Hey, guys? What's pub- er- Ty?

1322
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:32,113
I don't know. 
It's probably not important.

1323
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:35,825
I have access
to the entire curse word library!

1324
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:38,486
This new console is the...

1325
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:40,663
Sorry. I did it again. My bad.

1326
01:24:40,664 --> 01:24:42,164
They're getting to the rink.

1327
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,418
Now when you get out there,
you be aggressive!

1328
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:47,170
- I know, dad.
- But not too aggressive.

1329
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:50,006
You know, you guys don't
have to come to every game.

1330
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:53,050
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one!
Go foghorns!

1331
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:57,638
- Go Riley! Foghorns are the best!
- Okay! I got to go!

1332
01:24:57,639 --> 01:24:58,973
They love us.

1333
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:00,641
Yeah, mom and dad are pretty cool.

1334
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,602
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1335
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:07,023
She loved the face painting!

1336
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:08,524
Told you it was a great idea!

1337
01:25:09,276 --> 01:25:13,026
- Best idea he's had in a while.
- He's a really good guy.

1338
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:18,993
Just in case.

1339
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:20,494
Oh!

1340
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:23,122
Sorry.

1341
01:25:25,584 --> 01:25:30,214
Girl! Girl! Girl!

1342
01:25:32,382 --> 01:25:35,722
Okay. Bye.

1343
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:38,848
Remember, just hustle.

1344
01:25:39,264 --> 01:25:42,524
- Go, Riley!
- You got this!

1345
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:46,229
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1346
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:48,900
All right. Let's play some hockey!

1347
01:25:49,942 --> 01:25:51,025
All right, Anger, take it!

1348
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:52,235
Give us that puck or you're dead meat!

1349
01:25:52,236 --> 01:25:53,319
On our left. On our left!

1350
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,154
Let's just try
not to get all smelly this time.

1351
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:57,323
Mom and dad are watching us fail.

1352
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:59,244
Not for long!

1353
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:02,203
We've been through a lot lately,
that's for sure.

1354
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:04,247
But we still love our girl.

1355
01:26:04,248 --> 01:26:06,916
She has great new friends,
a great new house.

1356
01:26:06,917 --> 01:26:08,417
Things couldn't be better.

1357
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:13,208
After all, Riley's twelve now.
What could happen?

1358
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:36,612
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

1359
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:39,123
Anyone? Jordan?

1360
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:42,660
How much more of this?

1361
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:46,372
Five months, two weeks and four days
until Summer vacation.

1362
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:50,084
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who!

1363
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:53,545
Come fly with me, gatinha.

1364
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,930
Have a nice day.

1365
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:00,761
What are we mad about?

1366
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:02,680
I don't know.
Whatever Troy's mad about.

1367
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:05,891
- What's Troy mad about?
- I don't know.

1368
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:08,023
I know. Totally.

1369
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:11,105
We're a total fraud!
Do you think they can see through us?

1370
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,982
Of course not!
We're wearing eye shadow!

1371
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:15,693
Being cool is so exhausting.

1372
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:21,317
Who's the birthday girl? Hey! Hello?

1373
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:26,454
6 years of drama school for this?

1374
01:27:26,455 --> 01:27:28,375
Move it, will you?

1375
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:32,502
What are you doing? 
Come on!

1376
01:27:32,503 --> 01:27:34,212
You know what? This is okay.
This is fine.

1377
01:27:34,213 --> 01:27:36,547
We just need to go 
to our happy place.

1378
01:27:36,548 --> 01:27:37,715
Tripledent gum

1379
01:27:37,716 --> 01:27:39,836
No! 
Not this again!

1380
01:27:44,348 --> 01:27:46,138
I smell food.

1381
01:27:46,808 --> 01:27:48,059
The man has food.

1382
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,310
Get the food.

1383
01:28:14,608 --> 01:28:19,622
