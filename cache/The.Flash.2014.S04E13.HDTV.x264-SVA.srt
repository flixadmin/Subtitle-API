1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:01,710
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:03,929
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:05,179
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,182 --> 00:00:07,329
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:08,765
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:10,400
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:12,169
I fight crime and find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:13,370
like me.

9
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,238
But I became lost in time.

10
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,873
It took everything in my friends' power

11
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,942
to bring me back, and in doing so

12
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,478
our world was opened up to new threats.

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,847
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

14
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,449
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,804
Previously on "The Flash"...

16
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:30,835
His tears are more than just water.

17
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:32,237
It's like a love drug.

18
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,043
I think I can read minds.

19
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:37,579
Cecile's a telepath.

20
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:38,962
That's way more important

21
00:00:38,964 --> 00:00:40,597
than getting Allen out of prison.

22
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:42,700
Cecile filed an appeal last week.

23
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:44,598
We have no new evidence,
so that doesn't matter.

24
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:45,782
Did you know the oscillating cameras

25
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:46,970
aren't the only ones in this wing?

26
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:48,242
You're The Flash.

27
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:50,387
You said to call you when
I was ready to do business.

28
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,562
Do you have another fish to sell me?

29
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,283
Welcome to my own personal meta-block,

30
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,886
built on the ruins of
the first Iron Heights...

31
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:05,188
Completely off the
books and camera-free.

32
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,251
Yes, yes, less history
lesson, more window shopping.

33
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:10,554
Mina Chaytan...

34
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:12,629
Her powers bring effigies to life.

35
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:14,898
Now, that is a nifty trick.

36
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,901
Can she animate anything else, hm?

37
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:19,035
How about my finger?

38
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,838
Oh, I like her, she's feisty.

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,441
You are going to love me,

40
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:26,076
and I'll come willingly, gorgeous.

41
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:28,245
Sylbert Rundine... He can shrink objects

42
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:29,746
and return them to original size.

43
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:31,214
I know a drug smuggler who'd pay

44
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,583
a pretty pence for that man.

45
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:35,785
Ramsey Deacon... Controls technology.

46
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:37,472
And Becky Sharpe...

47
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:40,090
Can manipulate luck
on the quantum level.

48
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:41,891
I smell a bidding war.

49
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:46,963
And who might this be?

50
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:49,833
Something you've been
wanting for a long time...

51
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:51,134
A speedster.

52
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:54,187
C'est pièce de résistance.

53
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,056
Terms are the same as always.

54
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:58,374
Any metas you sell, we
split the profits evenly.

55
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:00,010
So, who would you like?

56
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:02,712
Oh, well,

57
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:06,316
eenie, meenie,

58
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:09,133
miney,

59
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:10,536
all of them.

61
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:20,333
Drakkar Noir,

62
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:22,883
onions,

63
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,219
and liverwurst?

64
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,937
Oh, no.

65
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:37,347
Earl Cox.

66
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:38,703
Earl!

67
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:41,119
- It's the cops.
- It wasn't me!

68
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll fight every one
of you, ha-ya, ha-ya!

69
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:46,937
Oh, hello, Ralphy.

70
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,258
How'd you get in here, Earl?

71
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,492
Door was unlocked.

72
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:50,560
No, it wasn't.

73
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:51,828
Was after I picked it.

74
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:56,594
Ow, oh, look at you.

75
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:58,368
You went all Zac Efron on me.

76
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,737
You drank so many six
packs you'd have grown one.

77
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:02,772
Nice suit, Earl.

78
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:04,240
Ah, thank you kindly...

79
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:05,975
Armani knockoff, I love it.

80
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,510
Listen, it's always great seeing you,

81
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:10,246
but if you'll excuse me,
I got a very busy day.

82
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:12,023
Clear your calendar, slim,

83
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,734
'cause I've got a score that'll

84
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:16,984
knock your honey glazed
holiday ham into next Christmas.

85
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:18,355
Yeah, I don't think any of those words

86
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:19,556
mean what you think they do.

87
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,391
How about these words for you?

88
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:24,992
A rich, old heiress hires me
to find her other boyfriend,

89
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:27,396
the pool boy, as a gold digger.

90
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,898
Turns out, he is.

91
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,736
But pool boy is willing
to share said gold

92
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:35,645
with someone who can help
him keep up appearances,

93
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,340
so to speak, and that, my friend,

94
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,341
is your specialty.

95
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,976
Are you in?

96
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:42,045
I don't do that kind of stuff anymore.

97
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:44,114
Ralph Dibny needs to concentrate.

98
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:46,816
- You see this?
- I got friends now.

99
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:48,051
They're good people.

100
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:49,419
They helped me, uh,

101
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,653
turn over a new leaf.

102
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,655
- Are they, now?
- Yeah.

103
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:57,660
We'll see.

104
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:59,462
Meaning?

105
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:01,698
Meaning,

106
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,467
I love you, Ralphy, I really do.

107
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:06,469
But you let people down,

108
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,371
especially the good ones.

109
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,608
They get close to you,
place their trust in you,

110
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,476
and then, bam,

111
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,112
you screw up,

112
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:18,250
every single time.

113
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:21,087
So, when you let your new friends down,

114
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,586
give your old one a call.

115
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:32,155
Thanks for coming, Cecile.

116
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:33,796
I know Barry isn't too optimistic

117
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,831
about the appeal hearing.

118
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,132
Don't lose hope, Iris,

119
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:37,467
we still have a few days to prepare.

120
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:38,523
I know, but it's not like

121
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:39,968
we've come up with any new ideas

122
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,205
for clearing Barry's name.

123
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:44,789
A bigger issue is

124
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,409
we don't seem to have Barry.

125
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,611
- Mrs. West-Allen?
- Warden Wolfe.

126
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,547
Unfortunately, you won't be
able to see your husband today.

127
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:51,661
He was in an altercation.

128
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:52,949
What... An altercation?

129
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:53,983
A prison yard fight.

130
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:55,084
What? Is he okay?

131
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,094
Oh, he's fine, he's fine,

132
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:57,592
he wasn't harmed and he wasn't at fault,

133
00:04:57,594 --> 00:04:59,689
but per Iron Heights protocol,

134
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:02,459
everyone involved is in
isolation for the week.

135
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,327
And is he safe there?

136
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:06,062
Oh, he couldn't be more safe.

137
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:08,469
Actually, it's a pretty
common occurrence.

138
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:10,350
Safe until midnight...

139
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:13,434
and then Allen and the
others belong to Amunet.

140
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,939
The important thing to
know is, he's in good hands.

141
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,373
You can rest easy at night.

142
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,408
Thank you, Warden.

143
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,944
Yes, thank you.

144
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,483
What's wrong?

145
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:28,618
Wolfe is trafficking meta-humans?

146
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,156
Is everybody crooked in this town?

147
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,789
Ah, he always did look smug
in those Italian wool suits.

148
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,192
Oh, my God, he's literally
wolf in sheep's clothing.

149
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,827
It's kind of the perfect
partnership, I mean,

150
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:38,914
Amunet deals in metas,

151
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,363
and Wolfe has a prison full of them.

152
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,078
And him being the Warden,

153
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:44,299
he can make some inmates disappear

154
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,969
without raising any eyebrows.

155
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,437
I'm gonna go talk to Singh.

156
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,105
And say what?

157
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:50,540
Your pregnant girlfriend

158
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,175
with gestational
psychic powers told you?

159
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,571
Yeah, Joe, Singh's just gonna think that

160
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:55,773
you're a father desperate
to get his son out of prison.

161
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:57,614
Well, if we don't figure out
something before midnight,

162
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:58,882
that's exactly what I'm gonna say.

163
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:01,084
Hey, where's Harry? He can help.

164
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:03,286
He went to Earth Two,
he's checking in on Jesse,

165
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:05,021
so...

166
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,289
- Great.
- Okay, well,

167
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,484
we're out of legal options,

168
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,593
and Cisco can't breach
Barry out of the meta-wing,

169
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:13,129
so, how do we stop this?

170
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,565
Hey, guys, got your
alert, sorry I'm late.

171
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,567
- It's okay, Ralph.
- No, it's not okay.

172
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,435
I ran into this old
business partner of mine.

173
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:22,140
This guy... He's just a big, fat creep.

174
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:25,807
He's always sticking
his nose in my business.

175
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,043
Oh, my.

176
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:29,079
And he's so shady.

177
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:31,748
He's got these beady eyes
and this crooked smile.

178
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,383
Just a real two-faced rat

179
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:34,617
from head to toe.

180
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,833
- Well...
- Freaky.

181
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:38,755
What?

182
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,857
He's a two-faced rat, he is.

183
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,116
What's wrong with my voice?

184
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,585
Do you hear that?

185
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:47,997
Um...

186
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:53,469
That's him right there.

187
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:55,305
That's him, do you see him? That's him.

188
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,140
That's him, that's him, that's him,

189
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:59,203
Right there, there he...

190
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:00,542
there...

191
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,515
That's me, that's me.

192
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:07,125
What is happening?

193
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,820
You somehow willed your body

194
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:10,887
to shape shift into Earl's appearance.

195
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,323
Seems like your cells can do
a lot more than just elongate.

196
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,825
Ugh, brilliant. How do you undo it?

197
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,627
Undo this? That? This?

198
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:18,872
Control Z?

199
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,130
Control...

200
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:32,408
Guys, I think I just figured
out how to stop Warden Wolfe.

201
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,071
If Ralph could shape
shift into Braveheart here,

202
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:36,941
then he could easily
shape shift into Wolfe

203
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:38,777
and meet Amunet before midnight.

204
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,961
And call off the whole deal
before it ever even happens.

205
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:43,163
Right.

206
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,148
Angala what now?

207
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,372
If he doesn't stop soon,

208
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm gonna ask to be sold early.

209
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:55,731
Being a meta-prisoner
or a meta-pet...

210
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:57,367
What's the difference?

211
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,062
Difference is Amunet Black.

212
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:00,364
She captures metas,

213
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:01,828
sells them to the highest bidder.

214
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,570
Mob bosses, drug traffickers, gangs...

215
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:06,475
Just imagine how our powers

216
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:07,977
could be used in the wrong hands.

217
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,013
I ain't gonna be nobody's weapon.

218
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,180
We gotta get outta here.

219
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:13,816
Agreed, but how?

220
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:21,491
Wolfe and Amunet's latest
criminal undertaking

221
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:24,394
throws an annoying wrench in our plans.

222
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:27,063
What shall we do?

223
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:30,375
I don't know.

224
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:31,845
You,

225
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:33,403
you don't know?

226
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,570
My mind is consumed

227
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:38,073
by a near infinite web of variables,

228
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:40,023
more plentiful than there are atoms

229
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:41,592
in an exploding star,

230
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,413
so for the moment,

231
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:45,415
I do not know.

232
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,417
I fail to see the humor in this.

233
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:52,455
I heard that in your mind...

234
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:54,157
A flash of stimuli racing through

235
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,992
your ventromedial prefrontal cortex,

236
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,127
where belief is formed...

237
00:08:58,129 --> 00:08:59,328
and doubt.

238
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,997
I don't have any doubt.

239
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,934
And if you had asked,
instead of reading my mind,

240
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:08,705
then you would know.

241
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:12,241
I do know.

242
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,743
As for your earlier inquiry,

243
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:18,514
it's not about what we are going to do.

244
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,384
It's about what Barry
Allen is going to do.

245
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:56,418
Sitter, how goes it?

246
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,620
Hold your horses, almost done.

247
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,533
Looks like the trap got
clogged with a bunch of hair.

248
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,694
I'll head underneath, make
sure the stack is clear.

249
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:18,306
Good to go.

250
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:19,440
Thank you.

251
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:36,358
Okay, how's this?

252
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,960
You know that painting in "It,"

253
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:40,129
the one that comes to life?

254
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:41,775
It's like that.

255
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,294
This is impossible.

256
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:48,036
We might as well just gift wrap Barry,

257
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,605
hand him to Amunet, and call it a day.

258
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,241
No, Ralph, this is not impossible.

259
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:55,261
Your polymerized cells are
linked to your thoughts.

260
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:58,163
You should be able to change
into anyone you can think of,

261
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,849
just like when you squeezed
your belly into abs.

262
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:02,551
Okay, uh, first off,

263
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:05,087
I have been working out,
so this is au naturel now.

264
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,194
And second, that was just some abs.

265
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:09,424
This is an entire person.

266
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:11,393
Look,

267
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:14,196
when I first learned how to vibe,

268
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:16,759
I had to learn how to clear my mind

269
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:18,000
of all other thoughts.

270
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:20,650
You think you can do that?

271
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:21,953
Okay, uh,

272
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,671
all right, I'll try.

273
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:25,707
Do better than try.

274
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:27,376
Barry's life is in your hands,

275
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:29,970
and we're all counting on you.

276
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:32,548
I think what you meant to say was,

277
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,916
"No pressure, Ralphy."

278
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:36,051
- Here we go.
- All right, focus.

279
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,653
Be Wolfe.

280
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,889
Be Wolfe. Big, bad Wolfe.

281
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:56,338
Oh, wow, sweet, chiseled
cheekbones, I did it.

282
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,108
Wow, maybe I can save Barry.

283
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,077
Oh, uh-oh.

284
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,348
Uh, a little help?

285
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,818
Next, we need to work
on his motor skills.

286
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:48,156
Well done, boy.

287
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:49,758
And hey, for the record,

288
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,226
I was already planning on making

289
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,428
that stuff that you used, so...

290
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,897
Sure, right after your
lunch tray crowbar method.

291
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,171
Can we continue on with the
breaking and exiting, please?

292
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,502
You want us to follow
a cop on a prison break?

293
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:02,904
I'm not a cop in here. I'm a prisoner.

294
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,740
And I'm not about to let Amunet turn me

295
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,642
into a weaponized slave, are you?

296
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:09,077
Okay, you convinced me, let's go.

297
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,212
I'm staying.

298
00:13:10,214 --> 00:13:11,880
What? Why?

299
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,816
Because I don't wanna hurt anyone else.

300
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:16,752
Last time I was out there,

301
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,820
I almost destroyed the whole city.

302
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:20,088
Yeah, she can stay.

303
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,491
No, we're all leaving.

304
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:24,960
Becky, if Amunet sells you,

305
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:27,429
your powers will be used
to hurt a lot of people.

306
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,932
The only way to prevent
that is to escape with us.

307
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:33,041
Please, trust me.

308
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:39,107
Yay, oy, big happy.

309
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,310
Now what?

310
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:43,245
Wolfe said that this wing

311
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:47,149
was built on top of the old prison.

312
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:49,369
I also heard the plumber talking about

313
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:50,796
piping underneath us.

314
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:56,580
Once we're far enough
away from the meta-wing,

315
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,017
we'll get our powers back.

316
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,020
That's how we get our freedom.

317
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,142
Ew...

318
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:18,144
Aw, my bad, tiny.

319
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:19,846
Hey, as soon as we get out,

320
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:22,782
I'll steal you a brand
new pair of Timmy Choos.

321
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:25,657
It's Jimmy. I'm a size six.

322
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,787
You're so sweet.

323
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,989
If you wanna use your
powers for something useful,

324
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:32,091
you could help me steal
back some native artifacts.

325
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:33,693
If you two plan on going back to crime,

326
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,395
you might as well just turn around.

327
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:37,363
The Flash will just run you back here.

328
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:38,766
Same goes for all of you.

329
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:41,167
Don't look at me, I'm reformed.

330
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:43,338
From now on, I only commit legal crime.

331
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,807
Legal crime?

332
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,188
The stock market.

333
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:48,341
Come on, we have a long way to go.

334
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:53,179
Augmentation is complete.

335
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:56,049
Your chair will serve its purpose.

336
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:58,451
You have outdone yourself

337
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,420
once again.

338
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,398
That melody in your head.

339
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:17,103
You don't recognize it?

340
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:18,338
It was playing...

341
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,007
The first time we danced, yes.

342
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:22,384
So, you do remember?

343
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:25,445
June 27th, 1997,

344
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:27,614
at 8:13 p.m.,

345
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:31,684
in the countryside in the
small hamlet of Boars Hill.

346
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:34,394
It was also the first time we kissed.

347
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:35,963
And the first time I realized

348
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:38,590
I wanted to spend the rest
of my life by your side.

349
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:40,460
Marlize,

350
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:43,930
I forget nothing.

351
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:47,243
Perhaps our song was once

352
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,569
at the forefront of my consciousness,

353
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:51,204
but now...

354
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:58,378
That song playing in your head

355
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,247
makes it difficult
to read your thoughts.

356
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,682
Quite difficult.

357
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:04,817
Perhaps that's on purpose.

358
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,512
Of course not.

359
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:08,922
Of course not.

360
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:14,012
I know this unforeseen change

361
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,015
concerns you.

362
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,652
But fear not.

363
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:22,223
Once this next phase is complete,

364
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:25,261
I will erase every doubt from your head.

365
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:39,419
Wolfe man to S.T.A.R. base, I'm here.

366
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:41,454
Ralph, to help you stay as Wolfe,

367
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:43,423
I'm gonna hand you over to Joe, okay?

368
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:44,657
He's gonna quarterback.

369
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:45,858
Ralph, you copy?

370
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,493
Yep.

371
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,456
So, what's the next move?

372
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,727
Preferably something
without a lot of moving.

373
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,708
Okay, Amunet's point man is Norvok,

374
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:55,477
so you're gonna have
to talk to him first.

375
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,770
Grab a drink, act like a hard-ass.

376
00:16:57,772 --> 00:16:59,939
Barkeep,

377
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:02,842
something cold and
frosty, if you please.

378
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:04,010
Jeez.

379
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,416
That's on you, bro.

380
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:17,855
Snake's on the brain, 5:00.

381
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,224
Stay focused, Ralph,

382
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:20,860
no distracting thoughts.

383
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,662
Gingold on the rocks.

384
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:26,599
Hand it to me, please.

385
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:29,002
The hell you doing here?

386
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:31,237
I'd like to talk to Amunet,

387
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:34,507
please, about the deal.

388
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:37,558
You could talk to Amunet at the deal.

389
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:38,863
Damn it, Ralph,

390
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:40,779
nobody talks to Wolfe like that.

391
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:42,081
He's the Warden of the most

392
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:43,454
dangerous prison in the Midwest.

393
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:44,984
Demand some respect.

394
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:48,992
Listen, you lapdog.

395
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:50,962
Set the meeting with your boss now,

396
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:52,158
or I'll pull on your eye snake

397
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,751
and strangle you with it, understood?

398
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:56,896
All right, all right.

399
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:58,564
Let me see what I can do.

400
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:11,277
Oh, God.

401
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,550
- 'Sup?
- Ralph, you okay?

402
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:19,318
Yeah, fine, yeah.

403
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,020
No problem here.

404
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:24,657
I'm definitely holding it together.

405
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,959
Yeah, that doesn't sound too convincing.

406
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:28,394
I have complete control

407
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:29,796
of the situation.

408
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:32,165
Ol' Dibny won't let his friends down.

409
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:35,501
Wolfe.

410
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:42,375
Amunet's ready.

411
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:44,610
Then let's not keep her waiting.

412
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:49,248
Are you sure this is the right way?

413
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,718
Do you hear the water
in this sewer drain?

414
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,426
It's moving in this direction.

415
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:54,628
We keep going this way,

416
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:55,987
we'll head away from the prison,

417
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,056
find our exit.

418
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:59,492
Wow, good catch.

419
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:02,195
You must've been a really smart CSI.

420
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:04,530
A CSI who killed a teacher

421
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:07,200
in his own apartment and
left evidence everywhere.

422
00:19:07,202 --> 00:19:09,435
Yeah, doesn't sound so smart to me.

423
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:11,227
Hey, speaking of,
maybe we shouldn't be...

424
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:16,409
Crap.

425
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:17,910
Hey, easy, easy.

426
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:19,912
Rundine, easy.

427
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:22,110
We let him go, he will out us.

428
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:24,717
- We can't do that, can we?
- Deacon.

429
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:26,586
What are you doing?
No, we can't hurt him.

430
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,580
We have to do more than hurt
him... we don't have a choice.

431
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:31,157
No, hey, we do not have to kill him.

432
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:33,793
Yes, we do.

433
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:37,930
No, we don't, all right?

434
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,499
Just duct tape him.

435
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:40,933
Come on, let's move.

436
00:19:45,473 --> 00:19:47,340
Looked like it hurt.

437
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:50,743
Ding, ding!

438
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:53,012
Boys, have some orange slices.

439
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:55,548
Mommy needs to work, okay?

440
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,150
♪ Warden ♪

441
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,918
I'm going to assume this is not one

442
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,287
of those good emergency meetings...

443
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:05,491
A few hours before a major
criminal undertaking, hm?

444
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:06,826
We have to delay the deal.

445
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:07,960
What?

446
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:09,228
My ears outside tell me

447
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,521
the police have been tipped.

448
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:11,583
I don't know how.

449
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,034
Maybe CCPD

450
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,403
hacked into the cameras.

451
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:16,769
You said there were no cameras.

452
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:18,304
- I did?
- Mmm.

453
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,606
Yes, I did say that.

454
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,583
But then, afterwards,

455
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:24,577
I installed a few.

456
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:29,549
- Did you?
- Mm.

457
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:31,884
Hmm,

458
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:35,721
something seems off

459
00:20:35,723 --> 00:20:38,457
with the big, bad Wolfe,

460
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:41,127
if you even are Wolfe.

461
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:43,278
Stay in it, she's testing you.

462
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:45,498
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

463
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm the same man you've
always dealt with.

464
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:51,067
Okay, and who would that be?

465
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,673
The one who gives you your merchandise.

466
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:55,074
And trust me,

467
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:57,114
you need me a lot more than I need you.

468
00:20:57,117 --> 00:21:00,012
So, when I say the
deal has to be delayed,

469
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:03,216
it's because the deal has to be delayed.

470
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:06,619
Okay.

471
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:15,928
What the hell?

472
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,382
What?

473
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:20,532
You know, sometimes I hate
being right all the time.

474
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:21,634
Ralph, get out of there.

475
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:24,036
Uh...

476
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,846
Damn it.

477
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:44,390
Get me Wolfe, yeah?

478
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:46,459
I understand your concern, Amunet,

479
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:48,160
but you have my word.

480
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:50,630
Your metas are exactly where
they're supposed to be...

481
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,051
Locked up tight and in their cells,

482
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:54,433
waiting for you to claim them, heh.

483
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:57,169
Very good, I'll see you then.

484
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,679
Find them!

485
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:07,655
I mean, there has to be another way.

486
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:09,558
There isn't.

487
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,465
There is one card left to play:

488
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:13,800
go to Iron Heights,

489
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:15,435
and stop the deal before it happens.

490
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:17,003
You're talking about finding Amunet,

491
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:18,805
plus a prison full of armed meta-guards

492
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,306
on their turf.

493
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:23,977
This is the only option we have left.

494
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:25,983
You guys can do this.

495
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:27,452
Let's go.

496
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:29,055
Ralph.

497
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:32,014
Yeah, uh, maybe not this time.

498
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,453
What? Why?

499
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:34,592
Look, you...

500
00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:35,955
You're gonna have a better chance

501
00:22:35,957 --> 00:22:37,275
saving Barry without me.

502
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:39,206
Ralph, you know that isn't true.

503
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:41,311
I just screwed everything up.

504
00:22:41,314 --> 00:22:43,196
You know what could happen
if I screw it up again?

505
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:44,931
- You won't.
- Okay, you know what?

506
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:46,432
Maybe we just need to talk this out,

507
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:48,167
let's go visit with
Dr. Hallway, come on.

508
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:49,903
Look, bud, talk's not gonna fix my head.

509
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:54,974
I just can't do it this time, guys.

510
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,511
Sorry I let you down.

511
00:22:58,513 --> 00:23:00,513
Hey.

512
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:02,148
Hey, Ralph.

513
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:09,088
Looks like we're finally
in the old prison.

514
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,924
We must be close.

515
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:12,392
Getting closer than we think.

516
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:13,639
Hey, I know this lock.

517
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,803
It's the same kind they use

518
00:23:14,806 --> 00:23:16,206
in the general population wing,

519
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:17,963
which means there are no meta dampeners

520
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:19,432
on the other side of this door.

521
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:21,668
We get through, we get our powers back.

522
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,872
Well, that's all I needed to hear.

523
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:28,541
Out of the way.

524
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,678
You good?

525
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,313
No brains, no brawn.

526
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:35,248
Allow me.

527
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,983
I may not have my powers...

528
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:42,322
But I don't need them

529
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:44,958
to hack my way out of trouble.

530
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,559
Give me a few minutes.

531
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:47,819
Come here.

532
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:48,962
What, no, I'm fine,

533
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:50,697
it doesn't really hurt.

534
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,065
Are you sure?

535
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,633
- Yeah.
- I mean, it hurts a little.

536
00:23:53,635 --> 00:23:55,168
Yeah, come here.

537
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,170
There.

538
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:58,538
Thanks.

539
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,173
Guess I forgot what it feels like

540
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,775
to punch someone in the
face without my powers.

541
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:04,677
Judging by the swelling,

542
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,879
I'd say you have a fracture

543
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:10,550
on either the fourth
or fifth metacarpal.

544
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:13,252
- How...
- I used to fall down a lot.

545
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:15,622
Super klutz.

546
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:18,891
So, what are you gonna
do when you're free?

547
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:20,226
I hope it's not more of what you did

548
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:21,227
to get you in here.

549
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:23,045
Oh, no, trust me,

550
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:26,983
I am so over prison jumpsuits.

551
00:24:26,986 --> 00:24:30,370
Orange is not the new anything.

552
00:24:30,372 --> 00:24:33,233
Neither is gray, neither is gray, so...

553
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:35,708
So, what then?

554
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,110
I don't know.

555
00:24:37,112 --> 00:24:40,480
Using my powers just
hurt those around me.

556
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:46,119
My good luck just jinxed everyone else.

557
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:49,989
You know, you seem to
really care about people...

558
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:54,994
Not like the type of person who'd

559
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:58,064
take someone's life.

560
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,633
I didn't kill that teacher.

561
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:02,301
I wouldn't take a life.

562
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:07,173
You know, not every meta uses
their powers to hurt people.

563
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:09,842
Some use them to help others,

564
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:11,310
to protect people.

565
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:14,655
Our powers don't decide who we are.

566
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:16,859
We do.

567
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:22,589
Ralph?

568
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:24,057
Hey, Ralph, you in here?

569
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:28,161
Ick, the light!

570
00:25:28,163 --> 00:25:30,029
It burns!

571
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:32,365
All right, come on, time to get up.

572
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,186
I can't, I'm dead.

573
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:36,069
Okay, I don't know
what's going on with you,

574
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:38,137
but I'm betting it has
something to do with the reason

575
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,006
you literally fell apart at the bar.

576
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:43,509
I told Cisco that a talk
from him's not gonna help.

577
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:44,977
So, a talk from you

578
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,880
is not gonna help either, Caitlin.

579
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:49,682
Okay.

580
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:52,452
I'll get somebody else.

581
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:54,754
Hey...

582
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,836
Hello, Stretch.

583
00:26:09,838 --> 00:26:11,967
They call me a man who elongates now.

584
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,676
Hm, they should call you pathetic.

585
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:19,245
So, you screwed up, get over it.

586
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:20,947
You are a mean lady.

587
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:22,949
I am just telling you
what you need to hear.

588
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:24,884
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
miss you when you leave.

589
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:26,419
Leave?

590
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:28,321
Is that what this is about?

591
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:29,622
Well, yeah.

592
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:31,591
Everybody leaves Ralph Dibny eventually,

593
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:33,256
that's how this whole thing works.

594
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,066
I screw up big time,
and, tch, they take off.

595
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:42,201
This time, the people
who are gonna leave

596
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:44,270
are actually my friends.

597
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:46,773
They're the first ones that I've had

598
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:49,275
in a really long time.

599
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:50,616
That's stupid.

600
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:52,245
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
expect you to understand,

601
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:53,913
you kidnap and stab all your friends.

602
00:26:53,915 --> 00:26:57,083
Right, I'm the queen of
letting these people down.

603
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:59,318
But you know what? They're still here.

604
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,821
No matter how much I disappoint them,

605
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:03,623
they still show up for me.

606
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,037
I don't really understand it,

607
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,894
but I think that's part of
this whole friends thing.

608
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:10,830
So, unless you do something worse

609
00:27:10,832 --> 00:27:13,399
than kidnap and stab them,

610
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:15,468
I think you're gonna be just fine.

611
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,620
You really think so?

612
00:27:16,623 --> 00:27:19,305
Yes, I do.

613
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:21,274
Huh.

614
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:25,278
You know, that actually
wasn't a bad pep talk.

615
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,913
Well, it's your turn next time.

616
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:28,915
If I ever decide to
go full villain again,

617
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:31,851
you can give me the lame heart to heart.

618
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:33,619
Full villain?

619
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:35,888
Wait...

620
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,757
Wait.

621
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,693
I know how to fix this.

622
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:42,895
I gotta see a girl about a guy.

623
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:44,769
Thank you, Frosty Oprah.

624
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,108
Presto.

625
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,015
Everyone's powers work?

626
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:07,486
Yep.

627
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:09,789
Ah,

628
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:13,620
I can smell all the tech
within five miles of here.

629
00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:16,395
Thank you, Barry, you saved us.

630
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:17,496
You did good, boy.

631
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:22,401
Not good enough, it seems.

632
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,853
Everyone back inside,

633
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:31,392
and you'll live to see another day.

634
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:32,823
I think the only one
who should be worried

635
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:35,564
about surviving right now is you.

636
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:44,589
There's no cavalry.

637
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:46,558
No one's gonna see what happened here.

638
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,495
It's just you and us, Wolfe.

639
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:51,830
You want revenge?

640
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:53,361
Understandable.

641
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,733
Just one thing...

642
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,801
If you're thirsty for vengeance,

643
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:59,756
you might wanna start with The Flash.

644
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,514
Barry Allen is The Flash...

645
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:06,580
The same man who put you behind bars

646
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:07,883
and who will, no doubt,

647
00:29:07,886 --> 00:29:10,548
recapture you after your escape.

648
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,183
That was probably his plan all along...

649
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:15,186
Is all that true?

650
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:16,541
I'm gonna squash you so quick,

651
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:17,936
you won't even know what hit you.

652
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:20,692
No, not quick.

653
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:24,244
Let's take our time.

654
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:28,094
The Flash on his knees.

655
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:30,802
Suppose there is justice, after all.

656
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:32,270
Let's see how fast he can run

657
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,472
when he's the size of a flea.

658
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:35,740
Stop!

659
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:37,108
Stop.

660
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,710
What are you doing, runt?

661
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:41,212
Deciding who I am.

662
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,014
You're not gonna hurt him.

663
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:45,550
Join us, or get out of the way.

664
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:47,185
Either way, we're taking him.

665
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,289
Good luck with that.

666
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:03,601
Oh.

667
00:30:14,014 --> 00:30:15,880
Toldja.

668
00:30:18,518 --> 00:30:19,818
Shoot to wound.

669
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,119
They're no good to me dead.

670
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:23,822
They most certainly are not.

671
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,457
Amunet, you're early.

672
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,826
And you are exactly as I suspected,

673
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,087
a liar,

674
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,196
who's obviously in way over his head.

675
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:32,630
But no matter,

676
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:35,367
I will clean up your mess for you.

677
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,736
Step aside, boys.

678
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:39,904
Mommy needs to work.

679
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:44,509
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

680
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,746
Not again.

681
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,151
Oh.

682
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:03,995
DeVoe.

683
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,799
Oh, I don't pay me enough for this.

684
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,376
Powers won't work.

685
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,145
Mine neither.

686
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:22,147
He must have blasted us with something.

687
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,848
Who the hell are you?

688
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,051
I am your destiny.

689
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:43,835
No!

690
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:57,291
Help me.

691
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:08,726
Too late, Mr. Allen.

692
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:17,435
Oh, what an inconspicuous body.

693
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,971
This will be quite useful.

694
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,444
Not so fast, Warden.

695
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:36,428
You won't take my body.

696
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:39,157
I don't want your body.

697
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,811
I want your life.

698
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:58,643
Good-bye for now, Mr. Allen.

699
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:23,067
What happened?

700
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,503
DeVoe.

701
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,634
Well, party's over.

702
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:32,110
Let's get the hell out of here.

703
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:33,645
I'm staying.

704
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:35,747
What? Barry...

705
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:38,016
I was only willing to do this...

706
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,317
Try to break everybody out

707
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:40,785
because Wolfe was gonna sell us,

708
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:42,754
but that's not gonna happen now.

709
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:45,657
I'm staying

710
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:48,693
till you find a way to
get me out of here legally.

711
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,528
It's the only way I'd
ever really feel free,

712
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,463
you know that.

713
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:55,600
This could be our only
chance to save you.

714
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:58,536
We all have to decide who we are.

715
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,371
This is who I am.

716
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,682
Breakout in progress.

717
00:34:10,684 --> 00:34:14,149
Engage lockdown.

718
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,952
Code X prison breach.

719
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:18,323
Repeat, we have a Code X.

720
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:20,291
Move, move, move!

721
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:24,028
Get against the wall.

722
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,198
Cell block secure.

723
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:03,549
New evidence, Ms. Horton...

724
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,185
That's what you told this court

725
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,901
had come into your possession,

726
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,322
only I haven't heard it or seen it,

727
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:11,858
nor have the circumstances
changed in any way

728
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,694
that would convince me
to move for a retrial.

729
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:18,064
So, unless you have
something more to add,

730
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,267
this appeal hearing is over.

731
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:22,202
I understand, your honor, I do,

732
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:25,138
if we could just wait
a few more minutes,

733
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,173
I am sure that...

734
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:28,208
I am tired of waiting.

735
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,644
Either you have something new to add,

736
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:31,845
or you don't.

737
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:33,780
Which is it?

738
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:38,752
We have nothing further, your honor.

739
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:42,534
Then I hereby deem Barry
Allen's appeal den...

740
00:35:42,537 --> 00:35:43,790
Wait.

741
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:53,767
DeVoe?

742
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:55,735
Nope, not DeVoe.

743
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,370
It's Ralph.

744
00:35:57,372 --> 00:35:59,670
I believe you are looking for me,

745
00:35:59,673 --> 00:36:01,365
Your Honor.

746
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:05,904
I don't know how any of this happened.

747
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:08,174
You were found in Barry Allen's loft.

748
00:36:08,177 --> 00:36:09,216
You were dead.

749
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:12,285
I was stabbed.

750
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:14,754
I heard a voice saying something about

751
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,604
framing someone, then I blacked out.

752
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,692
- It's gonna work.
- And this morning,

753
00:36:18,694 --> 00:36:21,862
I woke up in my own home.

754
00:36:21,864 --> 00:36:25,832
Mrs. DeVoe, does any of
this make any sense to you?

755
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:27,300
No,

756
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:28,935
I am just as surprised

757
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,038
by all of this as everyone.

758
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,473
Your Honor,

759
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:35,141
the city has had reports in the past

760
00:36:35,143 --> 00:36:38,178
of people who have appeared dead,

761
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,119
only to later emerge very much alive.

762
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:42,518
That's impossible.

763
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:43,750
Impossible, Your Honor,

764
00:36:43,752 --> 00:36:45,886
is it as impossible

765
00:36:45,888 --> 00:36:48,154
as a man who can run faster

766
00:36:48,157 --> 00:36:50,145
than the speed of sound?

767
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:52,759
I submit that Central City is home

768
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,728
to the impossible.

769
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:59,032
I have as many questions
as you have, Your Honor,

770
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:02,569
and I am looking forward to
working with the authorities

771
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:04,404
to solve this mystery.

772
00:37:04,406 --> 00:37:06,339
Yes, I'm sure that CCPD

773
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:09,175
will be very interested in this.

774
00:37:09,177 --> 00:37:12,345
As for Barry Allen's appeal...

775
00:37:16,552 --> 00:37:19,319
I guess the court must deem that

776
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,888
Clifford DeVoe is alive and well.

777
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,324
Barry Allen is hereby
cleared of all charges

778
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:26,092
and ordered release from

779
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:29,696
Iron Heights Penitentiary immediately.

780
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:44,311
You're home.

781
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:47,147
- You're my home.
- Aww.

782
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,984
Oh, he couldn't wait to do that.

783
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:52,339
How you feeling, Barry, you okay?

784
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:53,753
I'm feeling great, yeah.

785
00:37:53,755 --> 00:37:55,555
Well, you look like you
could use a good meal,

786
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:58,373
and don't you worry,
I made a fresh batch

787
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,759
of Grandma Esther's meat loaf.

788
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:03,049
- Oh, yeah.
- Just like you like it.

789
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:05,699
Meat loaf? Gross.

790
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,634
I just meant, meat loaf is

791
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:09,603
a grossly undervalued menu item

792
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:11,287
in most restaurants, I think.

793
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,689
You guys,

794
00:38:12,692 --> 00:38:14,441
now that I'm free, I
don't care what I do.

795
00:38:14,443 --> 00:38:17,043
I'm just so happy to be
back with all of you again.

796
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,311
Team Flash.

797
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:22,682
Today, we celebrate Barry.

798
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:25,418
Tomorrow, we go back to stopping

799
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,520
the man that framed you.

800
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:28,989
I'll drink to that.

801
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:30,256
Here, here.

802
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:35,076
You okay, Barry?

803
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:39,049
Yeah, it's DeVoe.

804
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:41,001
Barry, we're gonna stop
him, I know we will.

805
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:42,602
No, that's not it, he...

806
00:38:43,872 --> 00:38:45,472
There was nothing keeping him

807
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:47,007
from going inside the meta-wing

808
00:38:47,009 --> 00:38:48,675
and absorbing the powers

809
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:51,277
of every meta in Iron Heights...

810
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:54,147
Peek-a-boo top weather wizard.

811
00:38:54,149 --> 00:38:56,683
Yeah, I mean, he could've
stolen their powers and more,

812
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:58,652
but he didn't.

813
00:38:58,654 --> 00:39:01,021
He only wants the bus metas.

814
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:03,023
He wants their powers for something...

815
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:05,291
All of them.

816
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:06,857
We know a bus meta.

817
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:09,362
Hey, guys.

818
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:10,630
Sorry I'm late.

819
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:12,165
Just couldn't get this left glute

820
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:16,803
to shape shift back
to its normal, perky...

821
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:19,439
Why is everyone looking
at me like I'm a dead man?

822
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:29,444
What's all this?

823
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:32,815
Well, after last night's success,

824
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:36,923
I thought a toast was in order.

825
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:38,170
Success?

826
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:39,792
Is that what you call last night?

827
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:44,764
Yes, how would you describe it?

828
00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:47,400
Barry Allen was...

829
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:49,235
supposed to remain
in the meta-human wing

830
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:54,374
at Iron Heights, but he's now free.

831
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:58,611
Even Team Flash has good luck sometimes.

832
00:39:58,613 --> 00:39:59,979
And the bus metas?

833
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,214
We were supposed to wait

834
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:02,549
till all of them were captured.

835
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:04,417
But you only got four.

836
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:07,987
I said I would retrieve
them from confinement.

837
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,524
I never said when or where.

838
00:40:16,898 --> 00:40:19,766
There is something else on your mind,

839
00:40:19,768 --> 00:40:21,401
isn't there?

840
00:40:21,403 --> 00:40:22,702
Warden Wolfe's death.

841
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:24,738
He needed to die.

842
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,241
I just don't recall it
being necessary for our plan.

843
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,131
The chair can wait till morning.

844
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:54,033
For now, to the enlightenment.

845
00:40:56,772 --> 00:40:59,239
To the enlightenment.

846
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:11,117
I love you, Clifford.

847
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,586
Yes, and I, you.

849
00:41:22,531 --> 00:41:27,901
♪ Yes, I think I'm going out of my head ♪
