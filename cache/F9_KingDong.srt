1
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,723
That's the cleanup crew up on the track,

2
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,251
and that's a lot of racers
involved there, folks.

3
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,468
Jack, you realize
you got this in the bag, right?

4
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,669
Season's wrapped up, man.
Doesn't matter where you place.

5
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:46,505
I'm telling you, I got intermittent miss.
Last two laps.

6
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:47,112
On it!

7
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:48,399
Get those plug wires!

8
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:50,078
Jakob! Now.

9
00:01:51,657 --> 00:01:52,774
Hey, Pop.

10
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,256
Tell me what you see, Dom.

11
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,937
Got an oil spill going into turn two.

12
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:59,249
Bell's driving safe. Corbin's got a sponsor
in the stands, so he's pushing it.

13
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:00,579
Talking about me?

14
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,171
You got a real problem with car 23.

15
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:04,838
- Linder.
- About to whip your ass, Toretto!

16
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:05,880
Settle down, pretty boy!

17
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:09,712
That's right. Yeah, you. You want to tell
your driver he's gonna get somebody hurt?

18
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:11,236
- Hey! Leave it!
- Go home! You suck!

19
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,186
He's just pissed I got that spot in
the Busch Series next season, not him.

20
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,068
Life's got no shortage of guys
like Kenny Linder.

21
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:18,353
You're good!

22
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:23,501
It's not about being
the stronger man, Dom.

23
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:25,399
It's about being the bigger one.

24
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:56,431
I swear to God, this guy.

25
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,569
Pop, turn two, turn two!

26
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:12,289
Got it. I'm walking him in.

27
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:18,616
Shit!

28
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:29,948
Tell me what you see, Dom.

29
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:37,733
He's gonna come at you for that.

30
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:45,921
Get ready on your left.

31
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,382
Three-eighths ratchet.

32
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:59,099
Three-eighths driver.

33
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,475
Six-inch extension.

34
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:07,483
Are you sure?

35
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:22,655
Remember what your daddy told you.
Be precise in life.

36
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,538
It can make all the difference.
Now, watch this.

37
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,324
- See how it's working now?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:33,811
And you see what's happening?
It's turning the screw.

39
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,217
You're right.

40
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,850
Water heater's out again.

41
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,827
It's the price we pay for peace and quiet.

42
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:45,089
Want to come and give us a hand?

43
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:51,077
Are you expecting someone?

44
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:55,889
Brian, remember what we practiced.

45
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:22,827
Yo, yo!

46
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:25,108
We come in peace.

47
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:27,452
We come in peace!

48
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:30,796
It's me!

49
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:37,233
Roman? Maybe you don't recognize me
'cause I've been tanning all week, bro.

50
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:41,999
B, come out, son.

51
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:52,379
What you gonna do with that thing, man?

52
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,519
What, you out here trying
to kill elephants or something?

53
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,098
We would've called first.

54
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,473
Except you actually need phones in order
to get phone calls. You know that, right?

55
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,004
- Little B!
- Wow, you're so big.

56
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,559
- Hi.
- Wow.

57
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,879
Now, I know you don't carpool.

58
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:08,934
So what's up?

59
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:13,871
Mayday! Mayday! My plane is
under attack by a rogue agent!

60
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:19,631
We're being boarded.
I've got dangerous cargo on board.

61
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,397
I need you to assemble the team.

62
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:23,412
...still alive. I'll explain...

63
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:28,246
It's an SOS transmission
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

64
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,309
It came through with
a mess of encrypted data,

65
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,949
most of which I'm still trying to crack.

66
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:34,215
- Did anybody else get this?
- Well, that's the thing.

67
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:36,020
He sent it only to us.

68
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,488
Why just us?

69
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:48,574
He caught Cipher.

70
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,123
But there was a midair attack,
and she was extracted.

71
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,101
It seems his plane crashed
somewhere here,

72
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,477
over the northwest region
of Montequinto.

73
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:59,983
If Mr. Nobody survived,
we need to find him.

74
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,650
But the whole area's sealed off.
Isolationist, run by military.

75
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,416
We're not on call anymore.

76
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:11,093
Wait, wait.

77
00:08:11,118 --> 00:08:13,816
Dom, this is Cipher.

78
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,150
The woman who killed
the mother of your child.

79
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:22,173
Things change.

80
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,549
Listen, we're wheels up at 8:00 a.m.,
if you change your mind.

81
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,697
Thank you.

82
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,822
Daddy, do you know where God is?

83
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,029
Where is God?

84
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,453
In your heart.

85
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,767
He's in your heart, too.

86
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,359
And you know something?

87
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:49,329
I'll always be in your heart.

88
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:50,815
Hey, little guy.

89
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,836
I have a gift for you.

90
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:56,119
Your father gave this to me.

91
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,174
And now I'm gonna give it to you.

92
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:02,955
It's very special.

93
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:05,158
Take care of it.

94
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:22,905
Good night.

95
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:35,734
This isn't who we are.

96
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:42,616
Brian and Mia got out of the game
when they became parents.

97
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:45,788
We're not them.

98
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,865
...under attack by a rogue agent!

99
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,101
We're being boarded.
I've got dangerous cargo on board.

100
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,565
...assemble the team.

101
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,461
...still alive. I'll explain...

102
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,382
...alive. I'll explain...

103
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,026
Coming up on the signal, two miles.

104
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:36,964
It's deep in the militarized zone of
Montequinto. I hope everyone's ready.

105
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:41,309
Ready? Y'all want to make jokes
about me not making practical decisions?

106
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,249
This is as prepared as it gets.

107
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:45,114
We all see you, man.

108
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,640
Nobody thinks you're compensating
for anything.

109
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:58,260
I'll take point.

110
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,335
Careful.

111
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:01,265
Careful's when you get hurt.

112
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:18,155
Right now, we have a ten-minute window
between patrols.

113
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:22,438
Mr. Nobody's signal is close,
but we've got to move quickly, guys.

114
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:24,596
We do not want to cross paths
with the military here.

115
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:52,093
-  It's inside.
-  Cover us.

116
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:14,374
The source of the SOS signal is
coming from inside this thing.

117
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,960
Somebody wanted in.

118
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:22,740
Plane must have gone down
before they could cut through.

119
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,712
Or it was sent down on purpose to stop 'em.

120
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:27,825
Yeah, well, their mistake
was trying to cut into it.

121
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,085
But just give me a minute. I can get in.

122
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:34,327
Dom.

123
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,140
There's not a soul in sight.

124
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:38,382
No sign of Mr. Nobody.

125
00:13:39,077 --> 00:13:39,993
Got it.

126
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:48,586
What the hell is this?

127
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:51,515
Whatever it is,
Mr. Nobody wanted us to find it.

128
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:52,984
How's that work-

129
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:54,812
Go!

130
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:35,296
What? You don't know who I am?

131
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:36,952
You think I'm scared?

132
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,476
Roman, where the hell are you?

133
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:13,773
Who's compensating now, Tej?

134
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,734
"Peligro minas." What does that mean?

135
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,390
Tej, how fast we got to go
to clear 'em?

136
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:43,655
Please don't tell me you're thinking
what I think you're thinking.

137
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,322
Why?

138
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,006
What does "peligro minas" mean?

139
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,121
Tej, how fast?

140
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:48,181
I don't know, man.

141
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,966
Somebody answer me!
What does "peligro minas" mean?

142
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:53,441
"Peligro minas" means "danger, land mines"!

143
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:54,398
What?

144
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:58,368
How fast, Tej?

145
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:03,423
Assuming a 50-foot blast radius and a half
a second trigger delay, I'd say about 80.

146
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,913
I can't! My speedometer only goes up to 70.

147
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:07,871
What do I do?

148
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:10,203
You put your foot to that floor,
and you pray!

149
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,390
Get to that palm plantation,
and then we're clear.

150
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,114
Whoa!

151
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:53,005
Whoa!

152
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:58,152
Roman, you good?

153
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:04,122
My ass is en fuego!

154
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,676
Tej! Wait! Land mine!

155
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,846
How in the hell are you not dead?

156
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:45,889
Wait, okay, I think
I found us another way out.

157
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:48,871
Two miles to what looks like
a bridge across the border.

158
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:51,018
Good. The sooner we get out of here,
the better.

159
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,213
Letty, on the right.

160
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:35,776
The device.

161
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,119
Get in.

162
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,502
That was Jakob back there, wasn't it?

163
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:53,947
Always check your mirrors, bitches!

164
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:55,955
Oh, hell no.

165
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,741
Are we supposed to drive across that?

166
00:22:57,766 --> 00:23:00,041
Well, I said it looked like a bridge.

167
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:15,682
Oh, my God!

168
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:36,999
The military's not giving up.

169
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:38,531
We got to get past the border.

170
00:24:35,882 --> 00:24:36,992
Where's the bridge?

171
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,152
No. No, no.

172
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:44,523
Dom.

173
00:25:19,654 --> 00:25:21,515
Well, that was new.

174
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,648
Look, we're in the clear.

175
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,851
But this thing is a mess.

176
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:48,258
The headlines out there?

177
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:51,320
Secret spy plane crashes
in a hostile country?

178
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,461
Followed by some kind of
covert ops firefight?

179
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,953
I'll get you where you need...
and then I'm gonna need to back off.

180
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,174
I appreciate the favor.

181
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,937
I got to stop doing so many favors.

182
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:17,633
What we doing, Ramsey?

183
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,273
Like, where are we going?

184
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,875
I-I was able to decrypt the data that
came through with Mr. Nobody's SOS,

185
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,804
and I found GPS coordinates,
definitely included on purpose.

186
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,695
You knew about Jakob?

187
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:36,874
Question: Who is Jakob?

188
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:39,492
Jakob is...

189
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:41,608
...or was Dom's brother.

190
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,664
Oh, my... my bad. I'm sorry.
I'm just processing.

191
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:50,797
Brother?

192
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,690
You got a brother?

193
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:59,134
Who also happens to be some kind
of super spy with his own private army,

194
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,368
who drives literally like
a bat out of hell,

195
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:07,011
who preplanned an aerial jump and
landed at the bottom of an airplane?

196
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:08,812
Who does that?

197
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:10,320
Who does that?

198
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:12,291
A Toretto.

199
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:17,306
That's my dad! That's my dad!

200
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:19,681
He's gone! He's gone!

201
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,291
We got to get him out of there.

202
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:23,734
We got to get him out of there!
That's my dad!

203
00:27:26,414 --> 00:27:29,013
That's my dad! That's my dad!

204
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,649
That's my dad!

205
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:32,812
Get him out of there!

206
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:35,195
That's my dad!

207
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:43,468
There's a couple of release forms
we've got to sign.

208
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,781
Few clearances.

209
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:52,601
Everything else is down there
around the corner.

210
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,302
Hey.

211
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:22,177
Nobody's supposed to be around here.

212
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:24,958
You Toretto's other son?

213
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,732
You're the useless one, right?

214
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:35,888
What is that?

215
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:38,443
Get out of here. Go.

216
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,826
So a man can't pay his last respects?
That's what that is?

217
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:43,708
No.

218
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,725
No, not you.
You're the one that killed him.

219
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,286
No, racing killed him.

220
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:51,607
Look, he knew that I was gonna
pit him into the wall. He knew that.

221
00:28:51,632 --> 00:28:53,514
Now, I don't know if he dropped gear.
I don't know.

222
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:54,607
I swear...

223
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,419
I swear to God,
if you don't get out of here...

224
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:57,482
What? What?

225
00:28:57,507 --> 00:28:58,818
Go find Buddy.

226
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:00,404
Now!

227
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,880
All right, well, now we got the golden boy.

228
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:13,943
Leave.

229
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,349
You here to make threats, too?

230
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:19,732
"Leave" is a simple word.

231
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:24,806
Man, what is it with you Torettos where
you're all the heroes in your own stories?

232
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,888
Look, I'm gonna tell you a secret.

233
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:30,944
You, your dad, me... we're all stuck,

234
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,724
going round and round
in the same shitty circle.

235
00:29:34,102 --> 00:29:35,927
And we ain't never getting out.

236
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:40,568
You ain't half the man my dad was.

237
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:43,802
At least I'm alive, asshole.

238
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:44,714
What did you say?

239
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:45,880
Get off me!

240
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,388
Dom! Dom!

241
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:49,779
Dom!

242
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,052
Dom, no! Dom!

243
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,442
No, man!

244
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,349
In here.

245
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:37,825
Jakob.

246
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,614
I simply cannot believe
that magnet trick actually worked.

247
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,560
It looked so damn cool.

248
00:30:42,585 --> 00:30:44,951
Look at this here.
I got this off the cockpit feed.

249
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,185
Oh, I love being rich.

250
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,302
It was sloppy. He almost had me.

251
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,068
- She say anything?
- Nope. Nada.

252
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:55,271
You know, I look at her
and I feel creeped out.

253
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:59,286
And sort of turned on at the same time.
Is that weird?

254
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,522
Nice operation.

255
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,293
You snatched me off Mr. Nobody's
plane midair without a scratch,

256
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:09,606
and you took him down.

257
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,137
Money well spent.

258
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:14,720
Do you know who I am?

259
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:17,728
I know who you are. Do you?

260
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:22,845
East L.A. is a tough enough place
to grow up.

261
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,976
But it was your brother's shadow
that turned you into this.

262
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:30,882
Isn't it?

263
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:39,804
So your whole life, you pushed yourself
to be faster than Dom. Smarter than Dom.

264
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:43,118
Stronger than Dom.

265
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:49,938
Tell me, do you hate him enough
that it keeps you up at night?

266
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,860
Still?

267
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:58,284
All these years later?

268
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:05,226
I should've just hired you
instead of coercing your brother

269
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:06,462
a couple of years back.

270
00:32:06,487 --> 00:32:07,967
I don't work for the competition.

271
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,835
That's cute.
You thinking you're the competition.

272
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,540
Says the woman in the box.

273
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,171
Look familiar?

274
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:22,134
The other half's hidden
in one of the agency's thousands of vaults.

275
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:25,110
I need you to find out which one.

276
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:28,985
We secured the master drive here
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

277
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,477
The rest of the hardware is a bit dated.

278
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:33,038
Pre-Internet.

279
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,157
To make sure you don't go hack into
anything we don't want you to.

280
00:32:38,496 --> 00:32:40,884
Say you get what you're after.

281
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,631
A weapon so dangerous it shouldn't exist
for another half century.

282
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:46,056
What would you do with it?

283
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:48,245
Launch some global attack?

284
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:50,552
Sell it to the highest bidder?

285
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:56,274
Or maybe you see yourself
as a necessary shock to the system.

286
00:32:57,204 --> 00:32:59,822
I bet all you ever wanted was a hug.

287
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:03,043
You read my psych eval. Good for you.

288
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,587
I read your second-grade report card.

289
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:07,798
That's what I do.

290
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:20,602
Your chin, it's distinctive.

291
00:33:22,313 --> 00:33:24,970
I know the Torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines,

292
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:28,079
but I never detected a Nordic strain.

293
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:41,603
Finding the two halves of Project Aries
is the easy part.

294
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:43,673
Add in your brother Dom to the mix?

295
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:45,980
You don't have a chance.

296
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:48,454
Plans are in motion.

297
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:54,665
Qasar Khan.

298
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:58,062
What?

299
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:00,326
Genghis Khan's little brother.

300
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:05,922
Nobody's heard of him either.

301
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:33,481
Talk about off the grid.

302
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,530
I don't think they had grids
when this place was built.

303
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:42,732
If a Ninja Turtle pop out on me,
tell you right now, I'm out.

304
00:34:42,757 --> 00:34:45,358
No way this place was sanctioned
by the agency.

305
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,663
This was definitely
Mr. Nobody's secret hideout.

306
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,183
What now, Dom?

307
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,702
Whoever Jakob has become...

308
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,896
...and whatever he's up to...

309
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:13,209
...it's on me.

310
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,739
And me alone.

311
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:16,772
Nah.

312
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:20,694
Whatever's on you, it's on us.

313
00:35:21,278 --> 00:35:22,655
Let's get to work.

314
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:42,678
Y'all ever thought about
how many wild missions we been on?

315
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:46,690
How we somehow... always survive?

316
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:49,159
Yeah. So far, so good, I guess.

317
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:50,148
It's just luck.

318
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,317
No, no, no, see, y'all not listening.

319
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:53,788
Think about this.

320
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:58,615
We've now been on insane missions
around the world,

321
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,663
doing what most would say is
damn near impossible.

322
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,790
And I ain't got one single scar
to show for it?

323
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,967
I mean, look at my jacket.

324
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:13,668
Those are bullet holes from
14 dudes trying to take my head

325
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,216
clean off its shoulders.

326
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:18,325
We've taken out cars, trains, tanks.

327
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,772
I'm not gonna even mention the submarine.

328
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,850
And yet we're still here.

329
00:36:23,173 --> 00:36:24,652
Exactly.

330
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,528
Ramsey, what happens when you test
a theory over and over again

331
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:29,452
only to come to the same result?

332
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:32,631
A hypothesis becomes fact.
But you're not actually suggesting that...

333
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:33,667
I don't know,

334
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:37,631
but when the improbable happens
again and again, that's more than luck.

335
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:40,825
Maybe we're not so normal.

336
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:42,784
That's what I'm saying.

337
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,491
We are not normal.

338
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:48,514
Okay, um... just to clarify,

339
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,368
are you two maybe suggesting
that we're what,

340
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:53,341
invincible?

341
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:55,616
Maybe.

342
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:56,779
Maybe.

343
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,600
Or maybe... you're just a dumbass.

344
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:09,264
Take your dumbass jacket with you, man.

345
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:19,468
Pretty impressive driving out there.

346
00:37:21,328 --> 00:37:22,920
You miss the old life.

347
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,427
Do you?

348
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,174
Every day.

349
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,045
Guys.

350
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,131
We got a little company.

351
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,491
Think you know this person.

352
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,202
It's so good to see you.

353
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,803
I missed you.

354
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,500
Thank you.

355
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:48,038
Of course.

356
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:53,608
You should've told me.

357
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:56,699
She deserved to know.

358
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:01,569
Jakob's my brother, too. I need to be here.

359
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:05,572
You get involved here,
you put everything you have at risk.

360
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:09,615
Your kids and the whole world
that you built.

361
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:12,436
We're all risking something.

362
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,178
Dom, listen to me.

363
00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:20,842
My kids and yours are in
the safest hands possible.

364
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:21,911
With Brian.

365
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:25,487
Our world's grown, Dom.

366
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:28,413
I got this one.

367
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:39,363
The firewall on this old thing
is actually pretty good.

368
00:38:39,388 --> 00:38:44,104
But, you know, port scan, UDP message peek,
pop to root shell, and...

369
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:48,456
...say hello to Project Aries.

370
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:49,850
What is it?

371
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:53,030
It's what we got from Mr. Nobody's plane.
Or at least part of it.

372
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:57,616
Aries was designed to override and
assimilate anything that runs on code.

373
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:01,545
Any computer anywhere. If it operates on
zeros and ones, it's vulnerable.

374
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:04,397
If you take Aries
and upload it to a satellite,

375
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:06,241
it'll spread like a virus.

376
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:10,661
Then it'll be a matter of time before
someone can control any weapon system,

377
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:13,483
traditional, nuclear,
stuff we haven't even seen yet,

378
00:39:13,508 --> 00:39:15,647
and just point it wherever they want.

379
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:21,358
Jakob reboots the world order
within minutes.

380
00:39:21,716 --> 00:39:23,928
Ares is the god of war, right?

381
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:26,556
If Jakob gets his hands on this,

382
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,561
he'll be the god of
damn near everything.

383
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,428
Because of how dangerous it was,

384
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:35,292
the Aries prototype was recovered
and split into two halves by Mr. Nobody.

385
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,022
Both of which are worthless
without the activation key.

386
00:39:38,764 --> 00:39:41,157
Jakob now has one of the pieces.

387
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:43,349
He'll be going after the other half next.

388
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:46,514
As for the key, it's... it's vanished.

389
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:47,819
So we find it.

390
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:51,427
If we're gonna beat Jakob to it,
we're gonna have to split up.

391
00:39:51,452 --> 00:39:52,616
Roman, Tej,

392
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:56,522
I know a couple of guys operating out of
Germany that could get us anything we need.

393
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:57,928
I'm on it.

394
00:39:57,953 --> 00:39:59,278
Wait, there's one more thing.

395
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:03,139
Mr. Nobody's transmission had
one name connected to the key.

396
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,920
You guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this.

397
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:13,803
No way.

398
00:40:14,097 --> 00:40:15,882
That's exactly what I said.

399
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,928
So you're saying Han's death is connected
to all of this?

400
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:21,967
He has to have something to do with it.

401
00:40:22,093 --> 00:40:23,483
I'll look into it.

402
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:26,471
Tej, can you send me all the files
you have on Han?

403
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:27,124
Yeah.

404
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,350
I'll go with you.

405
00:40:29,865 --> 00:40:30,811
Letty.

406
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,293
I got this the day Han died.

407
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,413
Mexico.

408
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:39,828
Check the postmark.

409
00:40:40,342 --> 00:40:43,506
Whatever he was up to, it ended here.

410
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:45,217
Tokyo.

411
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,077
What are you gonna do about Jakob?

412
00:40:49,303 --> 00:40:51,014
I'm gonna find him.

413
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:54,587
How?

414
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,272
An old friend.

415
00:41:25,428 --> 00:41:27,028
Yo, what do you think?

416
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:29,358
¿Es una ilusión o es real?

417
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:33,600
It doesn't matter.
It's all about how you choose to see it.

418
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,975
Shit. I told you I was right.

419
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:37,948
I'm Leo.

420
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:39,124
Santos.

421
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,502
Dom. What are you guys in for?

422
00:41:41,663 --> 00:41:43,006
Driving while brown.

423
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:55,889
You see that?

424
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,655
Hairline crack in the fuel line.

425
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,272
Air gets in there,
you got a lean condition.

426
00:42:00,827 --> 00:42:02,139
Lean condition?

427
00:42:49,288 --> 00:42:51,038
Yeah! Yeah, Jakob!

428
00:42:52,147 --> 00:42:53,756
That's what I'm talking about!

429
00:42:58,507 --> 00:42:59,936
Who wants next?

430
00:43:00,366 --> 00:43:01,945
I said, who wants next?

431
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,272
I got next.

432
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:07,038
Dom.

433
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:10,229
Well, when'd you get out, man?

434
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:12,413
I said I got next.

435
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,505
Come on, Dom.

436
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:19,233
You don't want to race me
in Buddy's old Charger.

437
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,405
Car don't make the driver.

438
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:30,420
Here's how this goes.

439
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:34,561
You win... you can come back home.

440
00:43:35,593 --> 00:43:40,319
You lose... you keep driving,
you don't stop,

441
00:43:40,344 --> 00:43:44,170
you don't ever come back. Ever.

442
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,208
What do you mean, Dom?

443
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:48,800
I know what you did.

444
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:56,014
The day we lost him, Dad kept talking
about a misfire. Remember?

445
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:59,789
You were the last one
under his hood that day.

446
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:04,319
A minute later, he was gone.

447
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:07,906
Tell me why you killed Dad.

448
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:17,031
Now let's race.

449
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:25,574
Armed robbery in Echo Park.
Fourth Street Bridge is open.

450
00:44:25,598 --> 00:44:26,820
Clear, clear, clear!

451
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:47,695
Ready?

452
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:49,817
Set.

453
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:52,398
Go.

454
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:18,776
Too soon.

455
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:28,524
No!

456
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:22,535
Line drive over the head of Gonzalez
on the field for a base hit.

457
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:25,843
Up next...

458
00:47:28,776 --> 00:47:30,778
Place still looks the same.

459
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:34,863
Just like your dad left it.

460
00:47:35,341 --> 00:47:37,255
I'm looking for Jakob.

461
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,247
Can't help you, man.

462
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,036
I know you took Jakob in
after my father died.

463
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:52,782
The worst thing you can do to
a Toretto is take away their family.

464
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:56,614
That's what you did to Jakob.

465
00:47:57,216 --> 00:48:01,699
You've got people who love you,
count on you, care for you.

466
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,614
He ain't got no one.

467
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:07,667
You get in his way, this ain't gonna end
until one of you guys are in the ground.

468
00:48:08,257 --> 00:48:10,474
I know you did the best you could, Buddy.

469
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:14,903
But we both know he's about
to cause a lot of hurt.

470
00:48:27,496 --> 00:48:30,034
I did my best to take care of Jakob.

471
00:48:32,154 --> 00:48:34,018
But I'm no Jack Toretto.

472
00:48:51,419 --> 00:48:54,104
You've got to make peace
with the past if you...

473
00:48:56,495 --> 00:48:58,604
...if you want hope for the future.

474
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,877
He's in London.

475
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,354
That's all I know.

476
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,440
Dom.

477
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,065
I hope you find your peace.

478
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:34,268
The chance for peace died
that day on the track.

479
00:49:58,685 --> 00:50:00,047
Arigato.

480
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,093
This place is a dead end.

481
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,789
Do you think
Jakob could be onto the Han connection?

482
00:50:09,067 --> 00:50:12,437
If he has all the information we do,
probably.

483
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:17,845
I never told Dom...

484
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:22,226
I stayed in touch with him for a while
after what happened.

485
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:25,476
He was over at Buddy's for about a year,

486
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:29,343
and then he was gone with
a message not to follow.

487
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:33,554
But after he disappeared, I was so
desperate to find him that I would've...

488
00:50:34,174 --> 00:50:35,802
...would've done anything.

489
00:50:35,827 --> 00:50:39,117
I even broke into a police archive,
but I didn't find anything.

490
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:42,062
You what? You were like 16.

491
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:45,234
I did what I had to do.

492
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:47,703
Yeah.

493
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:54,523
How about you? How are you doing?

494
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:56,995
It's a change of pace, huh?

495
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:01,156
Just as I was remembering...

496
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:06,484
...who I was, everything changed.

497
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:09,578
It slowed down.

498
00:51:10,824 --> 00:51:13,262
There's peace for me in the chaos.

499
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:18,086
It's like I... I need to face the world
head-on or something to feel alive.

500
00:51:19,442 --> 00:51:25,547
Seeing Little Brian hiding in a hole
because we had unexpected company...

501
00:51:26,865 --> 00:51:28,518
...that got to me.

502
00:51:30,044 --> 00:51:32,008
We never used to hide.

503
00:51:34,482 --> 00:51:37,703
Hey, Dom's my brother,
but you will always be my sister.

504
00:51:39,022 --> 00:51:42,015
Funny how we all have secrets.

505
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:49,812
What?

506
00:51:49,837 --> 00:51:51,742
You got to be kidding me.

507
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,742
What is it?

508
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:56,437
Remember what Han used to say
about Tokyo?

509
00:51:59,177 --> 00:52:01,093
You mean how in all the old Westerns,

510
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:05,426
cowboys would make a run for the border to
get away from the law, how Tokyo was his...

511
00:52:05,657 --> 00:52:06,832
Mexico.

512
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:12,359
No way.

513
00:52:29,033 --> 00:52:30,554
She's ready to roll.

514
00:52:30,579 --> 00:52:31,726
No.

515
00:52:31,977 --> 00:52:33,987
No! No, Sean!

516
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:37,523
Tell me you are not modding
the quick disconnect valve on the LOX line.

517
00:52:37,548 --> 00:52:38,623
Hey, man, chill out.

518
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:41,941
All right? It's all good.
That tweak just saved us 0.4 seconds.

519
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:44,664
"All good"? This isn't Top Gun, Maverick.

520
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:46,380
You don't follow the rules here, you die.

521
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:48,581
Hey, come on. That's a bit much.

522
00:52:48,606 --> 00:52:52,062
When you know what too much pressure
in the LOX line can do, come talk to me.

523
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:53,537
Till then, stay in your lane.

524
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,509
Yo, you're lucky to even be in my lane.

525
00:52:55,523 --> 00:52:56,523
In case you forgot,

526
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,867
I'm the one that figured out how to let
us build rocket engines and get paid.

527
00:52:59,892 --> 00:53:02,250
This whole thing was my idea.

528
00:53:02,275 --> 00:53:04,640
So who are you gonna trust
with your brilliant idea,

529
00:53:04,665 --> 00:53:06,578
this glorified mechanic...

530
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:08,911
...or a rocket scientist?

531
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,941
Without me, you'd be working at Jiffy Lube.

532
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:14,347
Guys, guys. Look, it's all good.
Who cares about who did what?

533
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,953
Kind of hard for you to do anything

534
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:17,893
when you pee your pants
every time you fly, Twinkie.

535
00:53:17,914 --> 00:53:19,633
Did I hear that right?

536
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:22,068
You a runner and you afraid of flying?

537
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:25,062
"Twinkie"?

538
00:53:25,525 --> 00:53:30,105
So you must be Ding Dong and Snoball.
Right?

539
00:53:30,129 --> 00:53:33,054
Yo, uh... I don't go by that name anymore.

540
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:35,281
You went by that name ever?

541
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:36,773
Like, ever?

542
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:38,389
I... That's, that's, that's...

543
00:53:39,506 --> 00:53:41,027
Hey! We're up.

544
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,156
Oh, good.

545
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,203
Hey, fellas.

546
00:53:45,418 --> 00:53:47,333
Y'all seen ten-second cars?

547
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,899
Well, say hello to the two-second car.

548
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:03,843
Is that a Pontiac Fiero
strapped to a rocket engine?

549
00:54:03,868 --> 00:54:05,826
Impressive, I know.

550
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:06,895
No.

551
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,748
No, that's not impressive.

552
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,901
Eyes up! Here it comes!
Let the race begin!

553
00:54:30,078 --> 00:54:31,199
Plane's taking off!

554
00:54:31,224 --> 00:54:32,747
Go, go, go, go!

555
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:50,343
Yes!

556
00:54:52,268 --> 00:54:53,390
We did it!

557
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:03,203
Uh... I'm confused.

558
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:05,890
Y'all didn't actually beat the jet.

559
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,453
It didn't explode.

560
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:09,218
- Yeah, or melt.
- Yeah.

561
00:55:09,243 --> 00:55:10,515
She's still in one piece.

562
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:18,554
You mean "pieces"?

563
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:22,492
Hey, Jiffy Lube, next time,
will you listen to me?

564
00:55:23,673 --> 00:55:26,066
Look, we heard
y'all could get us some wheels.

565
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:30,765
Preferably the kind that don't explode.
Is that possible?

566
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:33,914
Well, the Honda dealership's
about 3,000 miles that way.

567
00:55:34,087 --> 00:55:35,960
Dominic Toretto sent us.

568
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:45,453
Who's Dominic Toretto?

569
00:56:35,497 --> 00:56:36,507
Hmm.

570
00:56:39,374 --> 00:56:41,234
Nice necklace, Queenie.

571
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,710
Diamonds and emeralds
never looked so good.

572
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:48,217
Dominic Toretto.

573
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:53,046
The word on the street is
you got locked up.

574
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,562
Yeah, well, in and out, you know.

575
00:56:56,070 --> 00:57:00,203
When are they gonna learn?
Some birds can't be caged.

576
00:57:00,228 --> 00:57:02,109
Are you looking for one of me sons?

577
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,835
Not tonight.

578
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:08,570
You do the driving,
I'll cut you in for 15%.

579
00:57:13,111 --> 00:57:15,179
My thieving days are over.

580
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:17,398
Mine ain't.

581
00:57:19,442 --> 00:57:20,734
You coming?

582
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:54,010
I'm looking for someone.

583
00:57:54,534 --> 00:57:56,883
Would've shown up in town
a little while ago.

584
00:57:57,135 --> 00:58:00,146
A lot of guys, a lot of resources.

585
00:58:00,171 --> 00:58:04,742
Oh, yeah, yeah, word did go round on a crew
that just turned up, led by an American.

586
00:58:10,722 --> 00:58:13,178
Yeah, he bought some arms
off a local seller.

587
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:15,927
Rumor had it he was into something big
up in Edinburgh.

588
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:22,617
Local seller, huh?

589
00:58:23,252 --> 00:58:26,136
She wouldn't happen to be wearing
a stolen necklace, would she?

590
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,601
He paid well. What was I supposed to do?

591
00:58:33,828 --> 00:58:35,617
This geezer was about your height,
actually.

592
00:58:36,437 --> 00:58:37,968
Similar features.

593
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,702
Oh, bloody hell, he's not your cousin
or something, is he?

594
00:58:42,492 --> 00:58:43,955
He's my brother.

595
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:49,304
Get the hand brake for me,
would you, darling?

596
00:58:58,883 --> 00:59:01,718
Glad I'm not the only one with
a family full of eccentrics.

597
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:05,542
He offered payment for something else.

598
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,343
You.

599
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:40,320
You know, nothing's more powerful
than the love of family.

600
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:44,304
But you turn that into anger
and resentment,

601
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,931
nothing's more dangerous.

602
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,325
Dom?

603
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:55,942
Don't get yourself killed, okay?

604
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:58,138
You're my favorite American.

605
01:00:23,224 --> 01:00:25,964
This is your kind of party, isn't it, Dom?

606
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:30,612
Beautiful women, best cars, best
everything. You know, best security, too.

607
01:00:30,637 --> 01:00:32,783
I'm Otto. I'm your brother's partner.

608
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:39,924
Well, f-financier.

609
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:43,963
But, you know, my dad, he's a dictator, so
we're not talking regular people rich here.

610
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,145
No, no, no, no, no.

611
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,680
Everything you see here, I own.

612
01:00:46,705 --> 01:00:49,651
These girls, if you want to meet
one of them, maybe two, maybe three,

613
01:00:49,676 --> 01:00:51,323
just let me know.
They're on the payroll.

614
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:54,307
I offer a bomb-ass dental plan, too. Huh?

615
01:00:54,332 --> 01:00:55,768
Where is Jakob?

616
01:00:55,967 --> 01:00:57,502
He's inside.

617
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:41,799
The brother you're looking for...
he's from an old life.

618
01:01:43,426 --> 01:01:44,669
He's long gone.

619
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:48,420
All I see is the same scared little kid
that killed our father.

620
01:01:50,475 --> 01:01:52,182
That's your mistake.

621
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,908
The spy game...

622
01:01:56,718 --> 01:01:58,415
...this is my world.

623
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:04,615
So here's my offer.

624
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,674
It's the same one you gave me.

625
01:02:11,355 --> 01:02:12,573
You leave.

626
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:13,815
Now.

627
01:02:14,752 --> 01:02:20,323
You drive away, and you never come back.
Ever.

628
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,468
A deal?

629
01:02:23,597 --> 01:02:25,382
I showed you mercy!

630
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:29,573
And I won't show it to you again.

631
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:40,920
Toretto.

632
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:44,768
Since my dad is head of state,

633
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:50,263
it makes me a foreign dignitary
and this place an embassy.

634
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:54,397
Which means you just trespassed
into my country and attempted murder.

635
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:58,494
So, naturally, I called in a little favor
with all my good friends from Interpol.

636
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:03,901
You keep digging around in the past, Dom,
you're not gonna like what you find.

637
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:14,577
And here I thought my dad
was a pain in the ass.

638
01:03:15,953 --> 01:03:18,961
But your family is a train wreck.

639
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:22,382
Well, now that your brother's
finally out of the game,

640
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:24,265
it's time we go to Edinburgh.

641
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:28,258
Get the second piece,
maybe do a little sightseeing, huh?

642
01:03:29,912 --> 01:03:31,478
Any news on the key?

643
01:03:31,604 --> 01:03:33,601
Don't worry about it.
Our men are closing in.

644
01:03:35,722 --> 01:03:37,751
One week from now,

645
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:41,437
there won't be a superpower in the world
can take a piss without our permission.

646
01:03:41,613 --> 01:03:44,297
One week from now, your dad
will be asking you for an allowance.

647
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:46,561
I'd like that.

648
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:49,515
I'd like that.

649
01:04:02,325 --> 01:04:03,536
Whew.

650
01:04:05,873 --> 01:04:07,005
What's up?

651
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:10,029
Well done, Leysa.

652
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:14,024
Please. If it wasn't for you,
I'd still be stealing gas in the D.R.

653
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:16,088
So Queenie treating you right?

654
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:18,711
Like a princesa.
I'm her number-one pick, you know.

655
01:04:18,992 --> 01:04:20,905
Cara's little sister done good.

656
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:21,953
Good?

657
01:04:21,978 --> 01:04:23,936
You saw my fine ass in that white dress.

658
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:25,703
You see how I been rocking shit?

659
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:28,383
All this crew, this is mine. Huh?

660
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:30,102
I been around the world.

661
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:33,310
Oh, I almost forgot. You might need this.

662
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:36,307
Your boy Jakob biometrics
are encoded to this gun.

663
01:04:36,332 --> 01:04:39,086
You'll have no trouble tracking him now.

664
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:18,195
Hey, Letty.

665
01:05:19,602 --> 01:05:20,649
Yeah.

666
01:05:20,674 --> 01:05:22,149
Come look at this.

667
01:05:23,141 --> 01:05:24,297
What the hell?

668
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,313
Han never mentioned a girl, not ever.

669
01:05:28,907 --> 01:05:30,336
Letty, Mia!

670
01:05:31,158 --> 01:05:32,047
Down, now!

671
01:07:28,203 --> 01:07:29,649
You okay?

672
01:08:31,579 --> 01:08:34,868
Welcome to Saint Giles'
Cathedral of Edinburgh.

673
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:39,490
The High Kirk has a history
stretching back over 900 years.

674
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:44,865
Renowned for its stained glass windows,
you can see the intricate craftsmanship...

675
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:49,724
We're a go.

676
01:08:57,221 --> 01:08:58,789
Ramsey, talk to me. What do we got?

677
01:08:58,804 --> 01:09:01,029
I pulled Jakob's biometric signature
off the gun,

678
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:04,353
and the algorithm I've run says
Jakob's team is right on top of us.

679
01:09:04,378 --> 01:09:06,443
Anywhere between 80 and 100 meters.

680
01:09:06,468 --> 01:09:09,468
80 meters? That's a lot around here.

681
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:12,253
This whole area seems pretty packed in.

682
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:17,356
So, we don't know where the secret
vault facility Jakob is looking to hit is,

683
01:09:17,381 --> 01:09:18,502
now, do we?

684
01:09:18,527 --> 01:09:20,888
Wouldn't be a secret if we did.

685
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:22,383
You know what?

686
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:25,621
I'm starting to think your little English
accent makes you sound smarter

687
01:09:25,646 --> 01:09:26,873
than you are.

688
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,762
Man, can I point out that
a good old-fashioned tracking chip

689
01:09:34,787 --> 01:09:37,076
would've put us within
like six feet of this dude?

690
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:41,394
But, nah, instead, we out here with
biometrics and facial recognition imaging.

691
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:45,144
Feels like we looking for Where's Waldo
in Harry Potter world.

692
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:49,021
Yeah, uh, strong argument there,
Tej, but tracking chips follow the chip.

693
01:09:49,046 --> 01:09:50,005
Before we know it,

694
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:53,512
we'd be chasing some expensive
yet tacky jacket to the dry cleaner's.

695
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:56,217
Biometrics, on the other hand,
are impossible to...

696
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:58,888
Wait.

697
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,172
Guys, okay, we have a problem.

698
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:05,060
Cameras are going down all around us,
and my equipment is freaking out.

699
01:10:07,091 --> 01:10:08,787
What the hell, Jimmy?

700
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,207
Security alert. Cameras are down.

701
01:10:13,646 --> 01:10:14,756
Damn.

702
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:16,752
You see anything suspicious?

703
01:10:16,777 --> 01:10:18,518
Uh, where do I start?

704
01:10:18,543 --> 01:10:21,803
First of all, all of this
looks a little spooky.

705
01:10:22,029 --> 01:10:24,282
I even seen these two ladies walking

706
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:27,684
with George Washington wigs
on their head from the 1700s.

707
01:10:27,709 --> 01:10:30,459
I feel like I'm in Transylvania
or some damn where.

708
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,670
Ramsey, we're looking everywhere.
I just grew a new bunion.

709
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:48,374
This is hopeless.

710
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:51,258
What?

711
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:52,266
You see that?

712
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:53,467
See what?

713
01:10:53,504 --> 01:10:58,854
The ears. They got cauliflower ears.
They fight for a living.

714
01:11:00,578 --> 01:11:01,861
Don't worry about it.

715
01:11:01,885 --> 01:11:02,885
Roman.

716
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:07,685
Hey, man, I ordered a pair of Crocs
three weeks ago, and I'm still waiting!

717
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,279
Where are my shoes, man?

718
01:11:16,794 --> 01:11:19,449
Man, we really need to work
on your planning.

719
01:11:20,984 --> 01:11:23,857
Hey, Dom, you should get down
to the cathedral.

720
01:11:23,882 --> 01:11:27,209
Dumbass here just attacked some delivery
dudes 'cause he didn't like their ears.

721
01:11:29,694 --> 01:11:31,092
Wait, wait, wait.

722
01:11:31,117 --> 01:11:33,428
H-How much did you say
you paid for that again?

723
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:36,919
You know silver ain't magnetic, right?

724
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:39,193
You know what? Just shut up.

725
01:11:39,218 --> 01:11:40,567
Just shut up.

726
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:45,006
Ramsey, say we had a big electromagnet
turned up right around here.

727
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:47,826
Wouldn't that disrupt
all electronic signals?

728
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:50,368
Including security systems. That's it.

729
01:11:50,627 --> 01:11:52,717
That's how Jakob's getting into the vault.

730
01:11:56,877 --> 01:11:57,849
Guys?

731
01:11:58,786 --> 01:11:59,874
Guys?

732
01:12:02,865 --> 01:12:06,479
Okay, we've got police coming from
all sides. The area's locking down.

733
01:12:06,503 --> 01:12:08,123
He ain't using roads.

734
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,459
I got eyes on Jakob.

735
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:34,233
I see Otto.

736
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:37,834
I'm gonna tail him.

737
01:12:46,716 --> 01:12:48,975
He's heading towards a blue Jaguar.

738
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,132
Okay, follow him.

739
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:52,377
Me? I can't.

740
01:12:52,402 --> 01:12:53,381
Why not?

741
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,751
Okay, this is a bad time to tell you this,

742
01:12:55,756 --> 01:12:57,029
but I don't drive.

743
01:12:57,054 --> 01:12:59,237
Okay? I never got my license.
I don't know how to drive.

744
01:12:59,262 --> 01:13:01,443
And, you know,
no one really drives in London.

745
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,904
Okay? And that is not my contribution
to this group.

746
01:13:03,929 --> 01:13:05,303
It's you or no one.

747
01:13:18,476 --> 01:13:19,560
Shit.

748
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:21,366
Guys, come on, man.

749
01:13:21,391 --> 01:13:24,607
I feel like, between the six of us,
we can work this out, right?

750
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,318
Okay. I've got...

751
01:13:42,828 --> 01:13:44,395
Ramsey, shut it off!

752
01:13:44,638 --> 01:13:45,699
Shut it off!

753
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:48,738
Go, go, go!

754
01:13:48,964 --> 01:13:50,295
Okay. Uh...

755
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,636
Brake is on the left, accelerator right.

756
01:13:55,683 --> 01:13:56,675
Oh.

757
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:49,879
Shit.

758
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:54,881
Hey!

759
01:15:07,855 --> 01:15:09,503
Oh! Sorry!

760
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:28,589
Whoa!

761
01:15:53,766 --> 01:15:54,972
Oh, no!

762
01:15:57,577 --> 01:15:58,519
Move!

763
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,800
Hey, that was not my fault!

764
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:11,464
Okay, that one was my fault.

765
01:16:46,995 --> 01:16:47,964
See?

766
01:16:48,143 --> 01:16:49,488
What'd I tell you?

767
01:16:49,891 --> 01:16:51,066
Not even a scratch.

768
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:07,141
Otto, sending you new pickup location.

769
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,314
I've got it. I'm headed to you now.

770
01:17:56,864 --> 01:17:58,169
Otto, where are you?

771
01:17:58,415 --> 01:18:00,581
Jakob, I'm there. I don't see anybody.

772
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:04,445
It's because you're on the wrong street.

773
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:40,387
That's my car, pal!

774
01:18:40,411 --> 01:18:41,464
Dom!

775
01:18:45,753 --> 01:18:46,824
Go!

776
01:18:50,824 --> 01:18:51,917
Damn it.

777
01:19:24,066 --> 01:19:25,183
You're a natural.

778
01:19:26,276 --> 01:19:27,620
Of course I am.

779
01:19:41,305 --> 01:19:42,500
Okay, listen up!

780
01:19:42,525 --> 01:19:44,399
I want 50 of the best men!

781
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:48,664
I want guns! I want wheels,
freaking X-wing fighters, I don't care!

782
01:19:48,705 --> 01:19:51,634
The Millennium Falcon, Chewbacca
if you can get ahold of him.

783
01:19:51,659 --> 01:19:53,485
Money's no object. Go.

784
01:19:54,007 --> 01:19:55,493
Go!

785
01:20:05,485 --> 01:20:06,662
What?

786
01:20:08,895 --> 01:20:10,522
What's so funny?

787
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:12,381
I...

788
01:20:13,661 --> 01:20:16,917
I was thinking, if this was a movie,

789
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:21,498
this would be the moment where
the villain has an unexpected setback,

790
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:26,647
overcompensates without thinking it
through and gets crushed by the good guys.

791
01:20:28,226 --> 01:20:32,622
No offense, but you have no idea
what we're about to do.

792
01:20:33,107 --> 01:20:35,943
And for the record,
we're the good guys.

793
01:20:36,066 --> 01:20:38,498
Me? I'm Luke freaking Skywalker.

794
01:20:38,523 --> 01:20:40,003
Are you sure about that?

795
01:20:40,764 --> 01:20:43,273
I mean, I get the daddy issues, but...

796
01:20:45,019 --> 01:20:46,936
Look at what you've built.

797
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:50,303
Really? Luke?

798
01:20:51,484 --> 01:20:55,357
You're right. No, I'm more of a Han Solo.

799
01:20:56,267 --> 01:20:57,545
No.

800
01:21:00,186 --> 01:21:01,428
You're Yoda.

801
01:21:01,592 --> 01:21:03,268
- Yoda?
- Mm-hmm.

802
01:21:03,412 --> 01:21:04,826
No. The little green guy?

803
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:06,193
- Yeah.
- No.

804
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:12,512
Ah, shit, I'll take it.
Because he's a powerful Jedi, right?

805
01:21:12,537 --> 01:21:13,834
No.

806
01:21:14,777 --> 01:21:16,092
Yoda's a puppet.

807
01:21:18,508 --> 01:21:20,959
With someone's hand up his ass.

808
01:21:45,053 --> 01:21:46,354
So what now, Dom?

809
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:49,100
No one outruns their past.

810
01:21:49,817 --> 01:21:51,506
And yours just caught up to you.

811
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:02,355
Man.

812
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:05,811
There is literally zero industrial
or weapons-grade electromagnets

813
01:22:05,836 --> 01:22:07,845
I can find that are this powerful.

814
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:10,123
Look at the pull strength level here.
It's crazy.

815
01:22:10,148 --> 01:22:11,065
Yeah.

816
01:22:11,658 --> 01:22:12,936
Wait, watch this.

817
01:22:30,714 --> 01:22:32,045
Every time. I can't believe it.

818
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:35,191
What are you doing, bruh? I'm hungry.

819
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:36,906
Hey, guys.

820
01:22:37,331 --> 01:22:38,810
Surprise.

821
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,004
Nice clubhouse.

822
01:22:55,165 --> 01:22:56,564
'Sup, man?

823
01:23:01,197 --> 01:23:02,486
Nice to meet you.

824
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:20,772
So you got my postcard, huh?

825
01:23:38,852 --> 01:23:43,595
I'm just still trying to figure out
how are you still alive.

826
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:48,208
Well, after Gisele died,

827
01:23:49,484 --> 01:23:51,529
I didn't know what to do.

828
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:54,029
I was aimless.

829
01:23:55,522 --> 01:23:56,546
Lost.

830
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:57,371
Absolutely.

831
01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:02,385
But can you get to the part where
the car exploded and you're still alive?

832
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:03,409
Like, I'm trying to...

833
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:06,243
Roman, can you...
can you just be quiet for one minute?

834
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,241
We made plans.

835
01:24:09,607 --> 01:24:11,000
We had dreams.

836
01:24:11,389 --> 01:24:13,671
So what's our next adventure after this?

837
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:19,576
How about... we stay in one place?

838
01:24:20,866 --> 01:24:22,280
Where you thinking?

839
01:24:22,374 --> 01:24:23,358
Tokyo.

840
01:24:23,854 --> 01:24:25,913
We always talk about Tokyo.

841
01:24:26,257 --> 01:24:27,538
Tokyo it is.

842
01:24:28,889 --> 01:24:34,475
You know, it's funny, Gisele led me there,
and I wasn't even looking for it.

843
01:24:37,283 --> 01:24:38,762
But it became home.

844
01:24:40,218 --> 01:24:42,748
Then one day, Mr. Nobody came calling.

845
01:24:42,773 --> 01:24:44,731
I worked with Gisele.

846
01:24:44,756 --> 01:24:49,639
Back when I was a CIA operative
running the drug trade in Central America.

847
01:24:51,379 --> 01:24:52,728
The good old days.

848
01:24:52,753 --> 01:24:54,702
Gisele was my best.

849
01:24:55,351 --> 01:24:57,396
You can lose an asset at any time.

850
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,233
Bullet, knife, wire.

851
01:25:02,649 --> 01:25:06,983
But I never thought I'd lose her...
to love.

852
01:25:10,702 --> 01:25:11,845
What do you want?

853
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:14,725
I'm offering you a job, Han.

854
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,169
Here, in Tokyo.

855
01:25:17,616 --> 01:25:18,772
Why me?

856
01:25:18,797 --> 01:25:21,091
'Cause I saw your work with Gisele.

857
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,225
I saw that she trusted you.

858
01:25:24,849 --> 01:25:27,163
And that means I can trust you.

859
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:32,850
And that is very rare in this line of work.

860
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:43,054
And all I knew was that I had to steal some
tech from the home of a scientist couple.

861
01:25:47,027 --> 01:25:48,671
But as usual...

862
01:25:49,525 --> 01:25:51,788
...Mr. Nobody didn't tell me everything.

863
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:55,858
In fact, he left out
the most important part.

864
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,416
I was 11.

865
01:26:03,343 --> 01:26:05,849
My parents would take me
to the movies on Saturdays

866
01:26:05,874 --> 01:26:08,100
if I tried hard in school during the week.

867
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:15,341
I was so excited to go
I forgot my raincoat, so I went back in.

868
01:26:21,999 --> 01:26:24,044
At first, I didn't see it.

869
01:26:25,772 --> 01:26:28,014
By the time I looked out the window...

870
01:26:31,482 --> 01:26:33,440
Mom and Dad were gone.

871
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:35,850
Turns out I wasn't the only one
looking for this thing.

872
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:04,804
Get down!

873
01:27:14,582 --> 01:27:16,018
Han saved me.

874
01:27:16,999 --> 01:27:18,772
Wouldn't leave me behind.

875
01:27:19,218 --> 01:27:23,054
He knew I'd always be a target,
so he taught me how to survive.

876
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:27,725
We became a family.

877
01:27:30,355 --> 01:27:32,241
"Always be a target"?

878
01:27:33,939 --> 01:27:35,046
Why?

879
01:27:35,481 --> 01:27:37,309
'Cause she is the key.

880
01:27:42,039 --> 01:27:44,757
Everybody's been looking for a thing.

881
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,585
It was a person all along.

882
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:52,055
My parents didn't want Project Aries
to fall into the wrong hands,

883
01:27:52,087 --> 01:27:55,482
so they locked it with their own DNA,
something we share.

884
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,862
And then, one day,
Mr. Nobody gave me the heads-up

885
01:27:58,891 --> 01:28:01,655
that one of his best agents went rogue.

886
01:28:02,063 --> 01:28:06,063
So when Deckard Shaw came calling,
we used it as cover.

887
01:28:11,769 --> 01:28:14,850
But you got killed in a car crash, Han.

888
01:28:16,759 --> 01:28:19,296
Mr. Nobody had a way of
making things look real.

889
01:28:27,151 --> 01:28:28,975
Pretty nifty magic trick.

890
01:28:29,819 --> 01:28:31,864
Yeah, I've done better.

891
01:28:33,794 --> 01:28:35,647
Now for the hard part.

892
01:28:38,008 --> 01:28:39,662
Keeping you dead.

893
01:28:42,171 --> 01:28:43,389
My death...

894
01:28:43,646 --> 01:28:45,569
Became the best way to stay alive.

895
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:52,019
What's happening?

896
01:28:52,043 --> 01:28:54,285
It's some kind of hidden subroutine
the system follows.

897
01:29:18,004 --> 01:29:19,827
That's it, right there.

898
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,788
Yeah, nobody moves,

899
01:29:22,903 --> 01:29:24,499
everybody lives.

900
01:29:30,619 --> 01:29:31,483
Jakob.

901
01:29:32,985 --> 01:29:34,291
I'm sorry, Mia.

902
01:29:38,197 --> 01:29:39,975
I was the rogue agent.

903
01:29:40,962 --> 01:29:41,866
Me.

904
01:29:42,825 --> 01:29:45,402
Dom, you ever think about
how Mr. Nobody found you?

905
01:29:45,427 --> 01:29:47,951
Think he just dropped out of the sky
and chose you?

906
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:52,082
I ran missions with Mr. Nobody
out of this place for years.

907
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,327
I've been looking for that key
for a long time, Dom.

908
01:29:58,901 --> 01:30:00,475
And you just handed her over.

909
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:02,889
I told you.

910
01:30:04,305 --> 01:30:05,784
This is my world.

911
01:30:06,645 --> 01:30:07,921
Got it.

912
01:30:09,054 --> 01:30:10,913
Got a lot of guys here.

913
01:30:11,577 --> 01:30:13,014
You trust 'em?

914
01:30:13,327 --> 01:30:14,415
Trust this.

915
01:30:20,154 --> 01:30:22,417
You know the only good thing
to come from Dad dying?

916
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:28,250
If he hadn't, I'd have spent my entire life
in your shadow.

917
01:30:31,762 --> 01:30:35,810
And now you're gonna spend
the rest of yours living in mine.

918
01:30:39,357 --> 01:30:42,171
Only good thing about Dad dying...

919
01:30:43,133 --> 01:30:45,483
...was he didn't have to watch
what you became.

920
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,694
You never deserved the Toretto name.

921
01:30:51,288 --> 01:30:52,788
You think you knew Dad, huh?

922
01:30:52,813 --> 01:30:54,718
What, 'cause you were his favorite?
You don't know shit!

923
01:30:55,814 --> 01:30:56,874
Okay?

924
01:30:57,734 --> 01:30:59,366
You want the truth?

925
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:05,210
Dad died 'cause he was trying
to throw that race.

926
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:07,796
We were in deep debt.

927
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:12,718
'Cause of how he felt about you,
he had to ask me for help.

928
01:31:12,743 --> 01:31:15,436
How was I supposed to know
that car was gonna blow?

929
01:31:16,726 --> 01:31:18,771
A good son would've said no.

930
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:22,582
And a real brother would've come to me.

931
01:31:22,607 --> 01:31:23,819
Come to you?

932
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:31,660
He made me promise
you would never find out.

933
01:31:32,815 --> 01:31:34,632
And through all of it...

934
01:31:36,543 --> 01:31:38,023
...I kept that promise.

935
01:31:45,507 --> 01:31:47,022
The girl comes with me.

936
01:31:47,171 --> 01:31:48,215
Jakob!

937
01:31:51,436 --> 01:31:55,358
I will stop you. And that's my promise.

938
01:31:59,602 --> 01:32:00,639
Hey!

939
01:32:05,722 --> 01:32:07,663
Sue. Sue. Ah.

940
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:09,655
Come on. Come on.

941
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:39,379
Down!

942
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:51,499
Go! Go! Come on!

943
01:33:02,402 --> 01:33:03,578
This way!

944
01:33:24,145 --> 01:33:25,645
I'm always here.

945
01:33:26,122 --> 01:33:27,253
Tell him.

946
01:33:29,168 --> 01:33:32,494
No!

947
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,075
No!

948
01:35:09,033 --> 01:35:10,364
Dom.

949
01:35:10,966 --> 01:35:12,825
Tell me what you see, son.

950
01:35:20,418 --> 01:35:22,857
See, cars like this are immortal.

951
01:35:28,604 --> 01:35:33,658
'70 Chargers are designed so well
that if you take care of 'em,

952
01:35:33,683 --> 01:35:35,867
they'll run for 100 years.

953
01:35:35,937 --> 01:35:37,310
Immortal?

954
01:35:40,245 --> 01:35:41,899
Just like a family, Dom.

955
01:35:43,142 --> 01:35:45,755
Build it right, you take care of it...

956
01:35:47,599 --> 01:35:48,992
...it'll live beyond you.

957
01:35:49,228 --> 01:35:50,661
Daddy.

958
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:00,411
Little B.

959
01:36:00,997 --> 01:36:02,654
When are you coming home?

960
01:36:03,395 --> 01:36:04,200
Com...

961
01:36:22,342 --> 01:36:25,935
No. You know I'm good for it.
I promise I'll deliver.

962
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:10,699
I'm telling you, I got intermittent miss.
Last two laps.

963
01:37:10,713 --> 01:37:11,651
On it!

964
01:37:11,676 --> 01:37:13,419
Get those plug wires!

965
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:17,177
Jakob! Now.

966
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:44,114
You're good!

967
01:38:01,271 --> 01:38:03,974
No!

968
01:38:49,228 --> 01:38:51,151
You came to me, Letty.

969
01:38:51,771 --> 01:38:58,042
None of it is worth a thing if I lose you.
Do you hear me?

970
01:39:00,752 --> 01:39:02,526
Is this who we are?

971
01:39:07,924 --> 01:39:09,292
Yeah.

972
01:39:14,705 --> 01:39:17,783
From here, things move quickly.
Jakob has all the pieces he needs.

973
01:39:17,808 --> 01:39:21,065
Once he activates Aries, all he needs to do
is send the signal global.

974
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:23,086
And then there's no stopping him, ever.

975
01:39:23,111 --> 01:39:25,456
He'll have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite,

976
01:39:25,481 --> 01:39:27,570
something that'll act as an amplifier,

977
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:30,053
infecting other satellites in orbit
one by one.

978
01:39:30,069 --> 01:39:32,721
So we find him, stop him,
and then we get Elle back.

979
01:39:32,746 --> 01:39:34,400
Our odds are zero here, Han.

980
01:39:34,425 --> 01:39:36,423
Satellite equipment is
easy enough to track,

981
01:39:36,448 --> 01:39:38,250
but we're not gonna beat Jakob to a launch.

982
01:39:38,275 --> 01:39:40,174
Which gives us a two-target problem:

983
01:39:40,385 --> 01:39:41,725
Jakob on the ground...

984
01:39:41,732 --> 01:39:42,994
With his own private army.

985
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:44,303
And the satellite.

986
01:39:44,327 --> 01:39:45,476
Which can't be hacked.

987
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:47,407
Not remotely.
We'd have to do it physically,

988
01:39:47,432 --> 01:39:50,655
50 miles above ground
while the satellite is in orbit.

989
01:39:51,088 --> 01:39:52,252
Orbit?

990
01:39:52,569 --> 01:39:53,861
We need help.

991
01:39:53,886 --> 01:39:55,670
Otherwise, we have no chance.

992
01:39:56,734 --> 01:39:58,252
We do it ourselves.

993
01:39:59,275 --> 01:40:01,885
It's where we've been
that got us this far.

994
01:40:02,064 --> 01:40:04,197
No. No, no, no, no, no.

995
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:06,400
Do y'all not understand?

996
01:40:06,547 --> 01:40:08,201
Clearly, y'all don't.

997
01:40:08,383 --> 01:40:12,629
Because if you did, you'd be pissing
your pants like a normal person.

998
01:40:12,807 --> 01:40:13,939
Orbit.

999
01:40:14,057 --> 01:40:15,767
That's outer space.

1000
01:40:15,924 --> 01:40:17,768
That's another level.

1001
01:40:17,793 --> 01:40:20,565
What we gonna do? Hijack a space shuttle?

1002
01:40:21,026 --> 01:40:22,713
Put rockets on our backs?

1003
01:40:24,276 --> 01:40:26,430
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

1004
01:40:27,197 --> 01:40:28,057
What?

1005
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:45,440
There goes my father's diplomatic ties
with Eastern Europe.

1006
01:40:45,465 --> 01:40:48,244
This place is going to be crawling
with every cop in the city.

1007
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:50,947
Time to get the hell out of here.

1008
01:41:11,994 --> 01:41:13,174
Keep her close.

1009
01:41:23,963 --> 01:41:25,361
It's activated.

1010
01:41:29,182 --> 01:41:31,893
As soon as the satellite reaches orbit,
we start the uplink.

1011
01:41:35,376 --> 01:41:36,815
Ah, damn.

1012
01:41:37,971 --> 01:41:39,158
What?

1013
01:41:40,201 --> 01:41:43,752
You see that?
We can't have an air leak, man.

1014
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:50,227
Are you really patching yourself up
with duct tape?

1015
01:41:50,252 --> 01:41:51,244
Yes.

1016
01:41:51,269 --> 01:41:52,690
I don't know if you noticed or not,

1017
01:41:52,715 --> 01:41:55,345
but this whole operation is
Band-Aids and duct tape.

1018
01:41:55,370 --> 01:41:59,447
Man, this is insane.
We are headed to outer space.

1019
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:02,383
You acting like
we on our way to Home Depot.

1020
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:03,918
This is ridiculous, man.

1021
01:42:03,943 --> 01:42:07,252
I'm about to abort this whole mission
and take my Black ass home.

1022
01:42:07,277 --> 01:42:10,402
We're literally gonna be
in a perpetual freefall.

1023
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:13,008
Freefall? What does that even mean?

1024
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:15,825
Roman, it means numbers don't lie.

1025
01:42:15,886 --> 01:42:20,437
As long as we obey the laws of physics,
then we'll be fine, okay?

1026
01:42:20,462 --> 01:42:22,420
It's just all math and science.

1027
01:42:22,628 --> 01:42:24,830
I knew I should've listened to my teachers.

1028
01:42:24,855 --> 01:42:27,652
Four minutes to launch.
You fellas good to go?

1029
01:42:28,813 --> 01:42:32,010
Yeah, we just up here putting
a bunch of duct tape on shit.

1030
01:42:32,035 --> 01:42:33,769
You know, that's what Tej do.

1031
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:36,777
Man, please hurry up
so I can stop hearing his damn mouth.

1032
01:42:36,802 --> 01:42:37,953
Yes, we're good to go.

1033
01:42:37,977 --> 01:42:39,183
We're not good.

1034
01:42:39,201 --> 01:42:43,697
This is the same car that we watched
do a test run and explode.

1035
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:45,125
This is not smart, Tej.

1036
01:42:45,149 --> 01:42:46,178
Don't worry, man.

1037
01:42:46,203 --> 01:42:48,814
With my ceramic polymer coating,
you're gonna be just fine.

1038
01:42:48,839 --> 01:42:50,988
You're 100% fireproof.

1039
01:42:51,926 --> 01:42:53,014
Exactly.

1040
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:56,144
All eight thrusters fully functional.

1041
01:42:59,429 --> 01:43:02,519
Hey, please don't tell me
you're still running launch simulations.

1042
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:05,082
Virgin Galactic launched at 36,000 feet.

1043
01:43:05,107 --> 01:43:07,503
The space shuttle tests around 50,000 feet.

1044
01:43:07,528 --> 01:43:10,836
Our last test run with this load means
we'll have to go higher, way higher!

1045
01:43:10,861 --> 01:43:12,384
If we don't get them high enough,

1046
01:43:12,409 --> 01:43:15,754
these guys are gonna be pancakes at IHOP
before the coffee even gets to the table.

1047
01:43:15,988 --> 01:43:18,175
Hey! We can still hear you!

1048
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,691
Don't worry, guys. We got this.

1049
01:43:21,097 --> 01:43:22,543
We do got this, right?

1050
01:43:52,269 --> 01:43:54,812
I've run thermal imaging.
Elle's in the armory truck.

1051
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:57,863
And I've got a lock on the Aries signal.
It's coming from the beast up ahead.

1052
01:43:57,888 --> 01:44:01,168
We need to get in there to deactivate it
by the time Roman and Tej are in position.

1053
01:44:01,418 --> 01:44:03,355
Ramsey, power us up.

1054
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:08,816
Satellite is in low orbit.

1055
01:44:10,984 --> 01:44:12,066
Begin.

1056
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:30,195
All right, we're passing 50,000 feet!

1057
01:44:30,436 --> 01:44:32,259
Time to get ready, boys.

1058
01:44:32,284 --> 01:44:36,058
What we supposed to be doing
with these old-ass suits

1059
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:38,141
that ain't been used since World War I?

1060
01:44:38,166 --> 01:44:39,691
Oh, I'm sorry.

1061
01:44:39,716 --> 01:44:42,835
Astronauts "R" Us was closed
for shopping today.

1062
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:45,488
Listen, these suits are
just like space suits.

1063
01:44:45,513 --> 01:44:47,554
They both account for
pressure differential.

1064
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:50,574
Only thing is we may blow up like balloons
just a little bit.

1065
01:44:50,599 --> 01:44:52,214
- That's the only difference.
- What?

1066
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:55,512
We just hit the launch altitude.
You guys ready for a five count?

1067
01:44:55,532 --> 01:44:59,858
No, man! I'm barely ready to go
scuba diving in this old-ass thing.

1068
01:44:59,883 --> 01:45:01,363
Don't listen to him. We ready!

1069
01:45:01,388 --> 01:45:02,781
- "We"?
- Yes, I said "we"!

1070
01:45:02,806 --> 01:45:04,490
I thought you was invincible.

1071
01:45:04,515 --> 01:45:06,952
Let's see how invincible
your Black ass is after this.

1072
01:45:06,977 --> 01:45:08,631
- Punch it!
- No! Tej!

1073
01:45:12,106 --> 01:45:14,674
Oh, my God! I don't want to die!

1074
01:45:14,699 --> 01:45:15,871
Ignition!

1075
01:46:00,528 --> 01:46:03,753
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1076
01:46:07,694 --> 01:46:09,371
We're in outer space!

1077
01:46:10,294 --> 01:46:12,441
Told you numbers don't lie.

1078
01:46:13,112 --> 01:46:15,371
This is crazy, bro!

1079
01:46:26,599 --> 01:46:28,966
Man, how much candy did you eat?

1080
01:46:28,991 --> 01:46:31,733
Well, I-I... I eat candy
when I get nervous.

1081
01:46:41,184 --> 01:46:43,186
I thought you said you took care of this.

1082
01:46:44,853 --> 01:46:45,818
Yeah.

1083
01:46:45,842 --> 01:46:50,126
Hey. You take them back to
the freaking junkyard right now!

1084
01:48:25,523 --> 01:48:27,133
All right, Han, Mia, you're up!

1085
01:48:41,347 --> 01:48:42,238
Now.

1086
01:48:47,847 --> 01:48:48,879
Letty.

1087
01:49:09,509 --> 01:49:10,462
Han!

1088
01:50:08,525 --> 01:50:09,884
Not all of us.

1089
01:50:24,212 --> 01:50:27,204
Now, the satellite we looking
for should be somewhere...

1090
01:50:27,586 --> 01:50:30,376
There. Right there. You see it?

1091
01:50:30,563 --> 01:50:31,802
Got it.

1092
01:50:32,048 --> 01:50:34,211
Tell me you know
how to work the thrusters.

1093
01:50:34,236 --> 01:50:37,259
Tej, numbers is what you do, right?

1094
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:40,376
Driving is what I do.

1095
01:50:47,297 --> 01:50:50,837
Two dudes from the ghetto... outer space.

1096
01:50:52,863 --> 01:50:55,001
You know ain't nobody gonna believe us,
right?

1097
01:50:55,572 --> 01:50:56,837
You're right.

1098
01:51:05,374 --> 01:51:09,750
Something's wrong with the satellite array.
It's, uh, interfering with the uplink.

1099
01:51:12,167 --> 01:51:13,673
I'll handle it.

1100
01:51:32,181 --> 01:51:33,079
Han?

1101
01:51:34,525 --> 01:51:37,462
Grab the wheel. Something's up.

1102
01:51:39,324 --> 01:51:41,368
I think I can link into their feed.

1103
01:51:54,204 --> 01:51:55,685
Something you want to tell me, Otto?

1104
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:56,593
My bad.

1105
01:51:56,633 --> 01:51:59,204
Satellite uplink is actually
going splendid.

1106
01:51:59,229 --> 01:52:03,212
Oh, and by the way, I have a new
business partner. Maybe you know her.

1107
01:52:03,237 --> 01:52:05,509
Guess who's out of the box, Jakob.

1108
01:52:06,838 --> 01:52:08,883
But I did try to warn you.

1109
01:52:11,579 --> 01:52:13,728
You were never my competition.

1110
01:52:13,957 --> 01:52:15,576
Otto, there's something you should know.

1111
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,279
Yeah, go on. Lay it on me, dude.

1112
01:52:17,303 --> 01:52:19,599
You're a spoiled rich prick,
and I'm gonna kill you.

1113
01:52:19,615 --> 01:52:22,898
Oh, man, I am so sorry.
No one told you, huh?

1114
01:52:23,053 --> 01:52:27,126
Spoiled rich pricks run the world.

1115
01:53:50,998 --> 01:53:52,208
Come on.

1116
01:54:12,174 --> 01:54:13,154
Go.

1117
01:54:52,901 --> 01:54:53,945
What's happening?

1118
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:58,370
Uh, well, we appear to have lost 
our escort and Jakob.

1119
01:54:58,395 --> 01:55:01,770
And, well, Dom is making things
a little bit difficult here, but it's fine.

1120
01:55:01,803 --> 01:55:03,761
Really, it's peachy.
Don't worry, don't worry.

1121
01:55:03,786 --> 01:55:05,284
I'll finish this myself.

1122
01:55:09,644 --> 01:55:12,489
All right, let's see
what that beast is made of.

1123
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:13,932
You ready, Elle?

1124
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:28,612
Crank it.

1125
01:55:28,792 --> 01:55:30,964
If we can't break through, we stop it.

1126
01:56:01,946 --> 01:56:05,415
Guys, that thing is not slowing down
and the download's almost done.

1127
01:56:05,773 --> 01:56:08,571
Dom, we don't get out of here now,
we're dead.

1128
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:20,655
Letty, drop back and line up
with the front tires.

1129
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:21,563
What?

1130
01:56:21,588 --> 01:56:23,889
If we can't slow it
and we can't punch through,

1131
01:56:23,914 --> 01:56:25,947
we flip it and we hit the underside.

1132
01:56:25,972 --> 01:56:28,670
Goddamn it! Why do I have to say this?

1133
01:56:28,695 --> 01:56:30,157
Flatten these clowns!

1134
01:56:49,047 --> 01:56:50,208
Letty, the wires.

1135
01:56:50,232 --> 01:56:52,396
You read my mind. Han, get in front of me.

1136
01:56:54,311 --> 01:56:56,118
Dom, I can't get to you.

1137
01:56:57,532 --> 01:56:58,829
But I can.

1138
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:18,391
All right, the satellite is in range.
Let's power up these magnets and fry it.

1139
01:58:18,613 --> 01:58:19,938
All right, take our time.

1140
01:58:30,446 --> 01:58:31,922
Okay. All right.

1141
01:58:33,436 --> 01:58:34,368
Tej!

1142
01:58:34,393 --> 01:58:35,176
Hold on.

1143
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:38,071
Come on, baby. Power up. Power up.

1144
01:58:40,829 --> 01:58:43,220
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

1145
01:58:43,245 --> 01:58:44,219
What?

1146
01:58:44,244 --> 01:58:46,029
Talk to me. What's going on?

1147
01:58:46,054 --> 01:58:49,852
The pressure of the launch, it must have
jammed the cables to the power source.

1148
01:58:50,438 --> 01:58:53,024
Damn it, how did I not think of that?

1149
01:58:53,232 --> 01:58:58,133
Guys, where are you?
The upload is almost complete.

1150
01:58:58,969 --> 01:59:01,204
Why don't you just kill it?

1151
01:59:01,229 --> 01:59:03,546
Let's smash it. Let's run it over, right?

1152
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:07,102
No. If we crash into that satellite, 
we'll probably die.

1153
01:59:07,127 --> 01:59:10,141
And even if we don't,
the fuel that it would take to smash it,

1154
01:59:10,166 --> 01:59:12,446
we'd be stuck out here forever.

1155
01:59:13,356 --> 01:59:14,923
You got to have faith, bro.

1156
01:59:14,948 --> 01:59:17,777
Faith? Faith is not numbers.

1157
01:59:17,802 --> 01:59:19,383
You know what, Tej?

1158
01:59:20,805 --> 01:59:22,416
You're probably right.

1159
01:59:25,064 --> 01:59:26,631
We're not invincible.

1160
01:59:29,485 --> 01:59:33,016
We probably just been lucky
this whole time.

1161
01:59:38,411 --> 01:59:40,196
This might be it.

1162
01:59:42,976 --> 01:59:44,797
But you know what?

1163
01:59:45,812 --> 01:59:47,524
If we're gonna go out...

1164
01:59:49,168 --> 01:59:51,375
...let's go out on top of the world.

1165
01:59:52,438 --> 01:59:56,141
Guys, what's happening up there?
We've got seconds left.

1166
01:59:59,141 --> 02:00:00,435
Let's do it.

1167
02:00:00,593 --> 02:00:01,571
Let's go.

1168
02:00:06,304 --> 02:00:09,307
Five, four, three,

1169
02:00:09,332 --> 02:00:11,421
two, one.

1170
02:00:30,326 --> 02:00:31,547
We did it.

1171
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:33,775
We did it!

1172
02:00:34,092 --> 02:00:35,028
Let's go.

1173
02:00:35,053 --> 02:00:36,146
Yes!

1174
02:00:37,201 --> 02:00:38,186
Shit.

1175
02:00:38,211 --> 02:00:41,538
Not bad, man. Not bad at all.

1176
02:00:53,333 --> 02:00:54,600
Hold on!

1177
02:01:03,396 --> 02:01:04,318
Dom!

1178
02:01:57,048 --> 02:01:58,256
Yes!

1179
02:02:04,795 --> 02:02:06,311
Got to be kidding me.

1180
02:02:42,256 --> 02:02:43,094
Shit!

1181
02:03:35,495 --> 02:03:37,131
Think these belong to you.

1182
02:03:47,389 --> 02:03:50,049
There's gonna be a lot of people
coming after you, Jake.

1183
02:03:50,365 --> 02:03:51,404
Yeah.

1184
02:03:52,595 --> 02:03:54,154
This is the world I chose, Dom.

1185
02:03:55,781 --> 02:03:57,779
You know, Dad wasn't perfect.

1186
02:03:59,348 --> 02:04:01,451
And he loved us all the same.

1187
02:04:04,934 --> 02:04:10,660
Someone once gave me a ten-second car...
as a second chance.

1188
02:04:12,401 --> 02:04:14,514
I owe you that, little brother.

1189
02:04:27,968 --> 02:04:32,225
I lost you once.
Don't let that happen again, okay?

1190
02:05:14,081 --> 02:05:15,753
We come in peace!

1191
02:05:16,221 --> 02:05:17,472
Hey!

1192
02:05:46,103 --> 02:05:48,556
This was the last place
I saw your grandfather.

1193
02:05:50,758 --> 02:05:52,432
This is where he raced.

1194
02:05:52,457 --> 02:05:54,895
Did you race here, too, Daddy?

1195
02:05:54,957 --> 02:05:55,938
No.

1196
02:05:56,337 --> 02:05:58,202
But I'll tell you something.

1197
02:06:00,477 --> 02:06:03,903
Everything I needed to know about life,
I learned on this track.

1198
02:06:04,150 --> 02:06:05,274
You did?

1199
02:06:06,257 --> 02:06:07,556
I did.

1200
02:06:50,709 --> 02:06:52,509
It's all gonna be okay, Jakob.

1201
02:06:57,087 --> 02:06:59,133
We got some rough times ahead...

1202
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:03,422
...but it's gonna be okay.

1203
02:07:05,574 --> 02:07:07,228
'Cause we're family.

1204
02:07:32,650 --> 02:07:33,899
- Fellas.
- Hey.

1205
02:07:41,537 --> 02:07:42,662
What?

1206
02:07:42,688 --> 02:07:44,313
No way.

1207
02:07:55,145 --> 02:07:57,141
What's going on?

1208
02:07:59,156 --> 02:08:01,503
I couldn't believe it
when I heard you were alive.

1209
02:08:06,107 --> 02:08:07,704
It's a long story.

1210
02:08:08,737 --> 02:08:11,071
But for now,
let's just enjoy the moment, huh?

1211
02:08:12,188 --> 02:08:13,399
Guys, this is Elle.

1212
02:08:13,424 --> 02:08:15,600
Hey, Elle. I'm Sean.

1213
02:08:16,572 --> 02:08:18,137
- Just call me T.
- I'm Earl.

1214
02:08:18,162 --> 02:08:19,282
Nice to meet you.

1215
02:08:20,454 --> 02:08:21,461
Mia.

1216
02:08:25,785 --> 02:08:27,787
Hi. Nice to finally meet you.

1217
02:08:36,945 --> 02:08:38,657
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1218
02:08:39,313 --> 02:08:44,238
How much longer on this food?
Like, I'm-I'm... I'm ready to eat now.

1219
02:08:44,263 --> 02:08:46,744
I've been eating space food for weeks.

1220
02:08:46,769 --> 02:08:51,375
Oh. So Tootsie Rolls are space food?
'Cause that's all you ate.

1221
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,852
It was fat free, bruh.

1222
02:08:52,973 --> 02:08:54,658
Snickers and Twix fat free, too?

1223
02:08:54,683 --> 02:08:55,840
My forehead hungry.

1224
02:08:55,864 --> 02:08:57,954
- Yeah, okay. I'll see you later.
- Your forehead is overweight.

1225
02:08:59,649 --> 02:09:00,699
Oh!

1226
02:09:01,604 --> 02:09:03,594
You drive just like your dad.

1227
02:09:04,562 --> 02:09:06,102
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

1228
02:09:07,581 --> 02:09:12,172
Do you know, this is... this is where
I met your mom for the first time.

1229
02:09:12,774 --> 02:09:13,851
Right there.

1230
02:09:14,055 --> 02:09:16,158
She's watching over you from heaven.

1231
02:09:16,355 --> 02:09:18,047
- She is?
- Mm-hmm.

1232
02:09:21,144 --> 02:09:23,538
I think Daddy has a question for you.

1233
02:09:27,952 --> 02:09:29,961
You ready to say grace, kid?

1234
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:32,215
But I don't know what to say.

1235
02:09:33,270 --> 02:09:34,663
Oh, it's easy.

1236
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:37,609
Just say whatever's in your heart.

1237
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:39,961
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1238
02:09:47,145 --> 02:09:48,313
Hey, guys.

1239
02:09:48,338 --> 02:09:49,797
Hey.

1240
02:09:50,682 --> 02:09:52,743
Little Brian's ready to say grace with us.

1241
02:09:52,768 --> 02:09:54,461
- Uh-huh.
- Nice.

1242
02:09:55,073 --> 02:09:59,139
Now, hold on. There's still an empty chair.

1243
02:10:00,171 --> 02:10:01,649
He's on the way.

1244
02:13:01,223 --> 02:13:02,469
Thank you.

1245
02:13:02,494 --> 02:13:07,675
Please. I tell you where the drive is,
the plans we stole. I tell you where it is.

1246
02:13:07,905 --> 02:13:09,298
You mean this drive?

1247
02:13:10,253 --> 02:13:11,733
These plans?

1248
02:13:13,438 --> 02:13:15,266
But you already got it.

1249
02:13:15,291 --> 02:13:16,601
Yes, mate.

1250
02:13:17,337 --> 02:13:19,601
How else do you think
I stay in this good of shape?

1251
02:13:25,406 --> 02:13:26,898
Don't go anywhere.
