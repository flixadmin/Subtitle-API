Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

169

He didn't lose us.

170
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,809
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

171
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,130
And then something hit us, something...

172
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,939
Something big hit us!

173
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,011

I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

what we were walking into.

I would never have told him
what the project really was.

222

But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

01:32:49,461 --> 01:32:50,530
Dad?

801
01:32:50,861 --> 01:32:52,180
(GROANING)

802
01:32:53,061 --> 01:32:55,450
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

803
01:33:02,901 --> 01:33:04,698
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

804
01:33:06,901 --> 01:33:08,175
(GROWLING)

805
01:33:17,181 --> 01:33:18,500
(CHUCKLING)

806
01:33:50,581 --> 01:33:56,975
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

807
01:34:13,461 --> 01:34:14,894
(BOTH GRUNTING)

808
01:34:45,621 --> 01:34:47,213
Look out!

809
01:35:16,781 --> 01:35:17,975
General?

810
01:35:23,981 --> 01:35:26,449
Any last words?

811
01:35:29,141 --> 01:35:32,417
Hulk smash!

812
01:36:16,181 --> 01:36:17,933
(ROARING)

813
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:19,534
BETTY: Stop!

814
01:36:48,581 --> 01:36:49,775
(ROARING)

815
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:38,255
It's okay.

816
01:37:47,981 --> 01:37:49,573
Betty.

817
01:37:58,261 --> 01:37:59,489
(GROWLING)

818
01:38:33,221 --> 01:38:34,893
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

819
01:39:46,621 --> 01:39:48,100
(HEART BEATING)

820
01:39:53,141 --> 01:39:54,938
(HEART BEATING RAPIDLY)

821
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:12,815
GENERAL: Reload.

822
01:40:20,061 --> 01:40:21,210
Reload.

823
01:40:36,581 --> 01:40:39,618
TONY: The smell of stale beer and defeat.

824
01:40:39,701 --> 01:40:41,373
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

825
01:40:41,461 --> 01:40:45,693
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

826
01:40:45,781 --> 01:40:48,534
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

827
01:40:48,741 --> 01:40:50,936
- Stark.
- General.

828
01:40:53,181 --> 01:40:55,570
You always wear such nice suits.

829
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:57,775
Touché.

830
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:02,210
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

831
01:41:02,301 --> 01:41:03,734
You should listen.

832
01:41:06,301 --> 01:41:09,007
What if I told you we were
putting a team together?

833
01:41:09,741 --> 01:41:11,254
Who's "we"?
