1
00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:05,327
Key of A, watch me for the
changes and try to keep up.

2
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:07,296
Gideon and I have calculated
another Aberration

3
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:11,433
- in Bhopal, 1912.
- Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?

4
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:16,738
We are history's last line of defense.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,840
I like the sound of that.

6
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:24,813
Have you gentlemen heard
of the Spear of Destiny?

7
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,882
The Spear could alter reality itself.

8
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:30,152
Changes to history cause
timequakes and Aberrations,

9
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:31,720
which we can undo.

10
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:33,856
Changes to reality, those are permanent.

11
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:35,657
You're on the run
'cause you're a time remnant.

12
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,025
Now something's chasing you,

13
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:38,760
trying to correct the Aberration.

14
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:40,529
One of history's worst monsters.

15
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:42,331
The Legion have

16
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,133
the Spear of Destiny and
they're like gods now.

17
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:46,735
It appears that after
the Legion got the Spear

18
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:49,705
and change reality, they
kept us around as their pets.

19
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,112
You'll be forced to live your lives

20
00:00:57,114 --> 00:00:59,147
in a reality that I created.

21
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:02,951
We go back in time to 1916

22
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:04,720
and we stop the Legion from ever getting

23
00:01:04,722 --> 00:01:06,388
the Spear of Destiny in the first place.

24
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:12,394
All right, Gideon, try it now.

25
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:14,196
All systems nominal, Captain.

26
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:16,798
That's more like it.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,234
Any luck in contacting
the rest of the team?

28
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:21,103
Negative, but it stands to reason

29
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:22,838
that they would be facing
challenges of their own

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,940
- in this altered reality.
- Indeed.

31
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:27,643
Which is why it falls
to us to rescue them.

32
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:29,444
Engines to full power.

33
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:34,850
Can you pinpoint our location, Gideon?

34
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:37,986
- Central City, 2017.
- That's odd.

35
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:39,688
We must be in some sort of hangar.

36
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,124
One large enough to
accommodate the Waverider.

37
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:50,899
Gideon, what is that?

38
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,118
- Is that another ship?
- Negative.

39
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:58,707
It appears to be a desk lamp.

40
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,076
Oh, bollocks.

41
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,313
Right. Engage our
cloak and plot a course.

42
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:07,215
- Heading, Captain?
- The nearest open window.

43
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:15,390
Any luck?

44
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:16,792
You asked me that five minutes ago.

45
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:18,060
You know, it's not easy trying to get

46
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,262
a 21st century radio to communicate with

47
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:22,264
a 22nd century time ship.

48
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,366
Thawne never told you
what he did with Rip?

49
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:27,836
No, we weren't close like that.

50
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:29,771
How you holding up?

51
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:31,440
Better than Amaya.

52
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,375
I never knew about you guys.

53
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:35,043
It's nothing to know.

54
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:38,880
We were just, you know, figuring it out.

55
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,582
I figured it out.

56
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,551
We've been assuming that
Waverider's broadcasting

57
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:44,987
- using a quantum frequency, but...
- But only if the quad band

58
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,555
antenna array was in alignment.

59
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:49,324
- Ray, you are a genius.
- I guess I am.

60
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:50,759
I kinda forgot what it was like.

61
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,328
So can you communicate with Rip or what?

62
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,597
Sara? Sara, is that you?

63
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,333
Good job, guys. Good job.

64
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:00,235
We didn't do anything yet.

65
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:02,604
- Rip?
- Yes, Dr. Palmer,

66
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:04,606
I've honed in on your location.

67
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:06,908
Well haul ass over here
and come pick us up.

68
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,812
There may be one small
problem with that.

69
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:26,795
Look, it's the teeny, weenie Englishman.

70
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:29,664
Mr. Rory, will you please stop?

71
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,700
Ah, relax.

72
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:39,608
Why would Thawne use the
Spear of Destiny to shrink you?

73
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,276
Uh, I don't believe he did.

74
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:44,646
I'm assuming that he
used Dr. Palmer's exosuit.

75
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:48,050
Oh. Well then, he must
still have it in his lab.

76
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:50,447
We gotta steal it back and
then we can unshrink the ship.

77
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,454
- And then what?
- Rip, we have a plan

78
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:54,990
to put reality back as it was.

79
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:56,758
But you're not gonna like it.

80
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,071
Haircut, where to now?

81
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:10,705
Uh, I don't know.

82
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:12,641
I never exactly saw my exosuit here.

83
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:14,743
I just figured, where
else would Thawne hide it?

84
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:16,511
All right, let's split up.

85
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,336
Psst, Ray!

86
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,020
Ah. Yes.

87
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,756
Oh, I have missed you.

88
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:28,990
Really, dude?

89
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,593
I will never, ever leave you again.

90
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:33,195
Rip, we found the suit.

91
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:34,663
You need to close in on our position

92
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:36,932
before I have to watch
Ray do anymore weird stuff.

93
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:39,101
En route.

94
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,903
- Weird stuff?
- Yeah, you got issues, dude.

95
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:51,813
We got two more
rent-a-thugs down the hall.

96
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:54,048
I thought that Thawne
should've killed you morons

97
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:57,052
at the reactor.

98
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:59,955
- Ah!
- Then I realized,

99
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:04,993
now I get to kill the Legends myself.

100
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:12,533
Gideon, fire! Fire everything!

101
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:16,037
Aww, isn't that adorable?

102
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,073
- Is that the best you got?
- How about this?

103
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:25,013
Sara, reinforcements
will be on their way.

104
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:29,284
We're heading to you, Ray.

105
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,653
Let's blow the roof off this place.

106
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:37,259
All right, Rip. Keep
the Waverider steady.

107
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:52,149
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

108
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,645
We have returned to
the Battle of the Somme

109
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,747
- in the year 1916.
- And apparently,

110
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:01,183
we're ready to destroy time
itself by interfering in events

111
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:02,918
that we've already participated in.

112
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,287
If that's what it takes
to save Amaya, count me in.

113
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:06,755
Yeah, there's no way
I'm letting Grey go out

114
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,123
as one of Thawne's lackeys.

115
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,158
We can't allow Doomworld to continue

116
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,827
- no matter what the risk.
- Okay. Well, look,

117
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,429
like time, reality needs to set.

118
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:16,932
Essentially, we're in a
race. Not against time,

119
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:19,868
but from a reality wave
initiating from 2017.

120
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,236
All the more reason to get moving.

121
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:23,071
At the very least, we need to mitigate

122
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:26,041
the scope of the time
paradox by avoiding contact

123
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:29,477
with our former selves at all costs.

124
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,947
So all we have to do is
help us... I mean, them...

125
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:35,182
Destroy the Spear without them
knowing that we're helping.

126
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:36,818
- Kinda like Secret Santa.
- We already know

127
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,320
where the Blood of Christ is.

128
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:41,656
So me, you and Ray, we go
back to the Church of Amiens

129
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:44,025
and we leave the Blood for
our former selves to find.

130
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:46,094
I got a question.

131
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:50,131
What happens to us when our
former selves destroy the Spear?

132
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,801
Well, we cease to exist.

133
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,302
Because we never would have existed

134
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:56,438
if the Legion hadn't gotten the Spear.

135
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,007
You're saying we're the Aberrations.

136
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,913
In order to save the world,

137
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:06,348
we have to erase ourselves.

138
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,584
Huh, listen. Why don't
we just go to Aruba,

139
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:12,320
get drunk... what?

140
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:15,724
Sunshine. Mai tais.

141
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,860
Girls in... bikinis.

142
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:25,233
- All right, Ray. You're up.
- I'm on it.

143
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:29,537
Pardon me.

144
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:31,273
Excuse me.

145
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,257
Coming through.

146
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,043
Don't mind the tiny man flying through

147
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:37,545
the middle of no man's land!

148
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:40,248
I'm closing in on the
Blood's burial spot, Captain.

149
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm here.

150
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,409
Well, that was easier
the second time around.

151
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:15,717
I knew you idiots would
come back from 2017.

152
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:17,619
Apart from being incredibly stupid,

153
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,754
you are just so predictable.

154
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,389
Give me back the vial.

155
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:27,228
What vial?

156
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,098
Ray? Ray, get out of there!

157
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,134
You know, my allies
keep giving me the same,

158
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,370
simple piece of advice.

159
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:58,226
They were right.

160
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:00,428
I should've done that ages ago.

161
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:03,365
Hey, what are you doing?

162
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,509
You're gonna get yourself killed!

163
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,224
- We have to get him...
- Sara, you can't!

164
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:09,637
- Gideon...
- Sara! Sara.

165
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,373
He's gone.

166
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:27,409
So what?

167
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:30,579
Haircut said it himself,
we're all Aberrations

168
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:32,080
living on borrowed time.

169
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:35,183
Besides, he's alive and well in 1916.

170
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:38,253
Mick's right. The
mission hasn't changed.

171
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:39,788
Except we can't destroy the Spear

172
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,389
because we don't have
the Blood of Christ.

173
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:43,792
So we steal the spear
and get it out of 1916.

174
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:45,560
Now, you do realize that
there's a big problem

175
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:46,861
with that plan, Sara.

176
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:49,097
The other us's have the Spear.

177
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:52,867
Oh, never stolen anything
from myself before.

178
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:53,851
Could be interesting.

179
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,637
Ugh, need I remind you

180
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,373
that we cannot interact with ourselves.

181
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,342
Which is why the three of you

182
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:02,577
are gonna sneak into the other Waverider

183
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,646
while the other you's are at the church.

184
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:07,916
Now that... That sounds like a plan.

185
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:10,285
I suggest you hurry. Events
are already in motion.

186
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:11,987
Mr. Rory's earlier self is currently

187
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:13,989
being contacted by Mr. Snart.

188
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:16,024
All right, if we're gonna
go impersonating ourselves...

189
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:19,194
- You're gonna need a haircut.
- Yeah.

190
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:22,897
Not for nothing, but Aruba
would've been a better option.

191
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:26,267
You're not real.

192
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,370
You're an illumination.

193
00:10:28,372 --> 00:10:32,407
- A hallucination.
- Yeah, that's it.

194
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:37,746
Now, did that feel like a hallucination?

195
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:53,428
And how was the reunion?

196
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,097
I'm gonna let him,
uh, spin out for a bit,

197
00:10:56,099 --> 00:11:00,402
then go in for the kill, so to speak.

198
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:02,070
- Gentlemen.
- What the hell

199
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:04,239
- is going on here?
- That's what I was gonna ask.

200
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:05,407
Aren't you supposed to be searching for

201
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:07,375
- the Kalabros Manuscript?
- I was.

202
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:09,010
And I found him and I brought him here.

203
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:11,012
We no longer need the Manuscript.

204
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:13,381
We have a different problem.
The Legends are here.

205
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:15,250
We know. I just punched Mick.

206
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:17,152
Not those Legends.

207
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,421
And I'm not your Eobard.
I'm from the future.

208
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,722
Yeah, what else is new?

209
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:22,991
Okay. I mean your future.

210
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:24,926
One where we have the Spear of Destiny.

211
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:27,662
And the Legends from that
future are here now, too.

212
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:29,330
Wait, there are two sets of Legends?

213
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:32,734
- When do I get to rob a bank?
- Just deal with them.

214
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:35,203
Where do you think you're going?

215
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:38,707
To get backup.

216
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,976
I hate when he does that.

217
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:53,988
- You know what to do.
- We'll hang back

218
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,623
and make sure everybody
sticks to the script

219
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,759
Okay, I figure we got
about an hour before we...

220
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,794
Shut up, pretty. I'm calling the shots.

221
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:02,630
I'm the thief.
Englishman, disable Gideon.

222
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:04,733
We can't risk her blowing our cover.

223
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:09,904
You round up everyone in the library.

224
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:11,806
Make sure the coast is clear.

225
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:14,008
Then I can snatch the item.

226
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,011
You know what? This is
gonna be a piece of cake.

227
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:21,282
Hey. What are you guys doing?
You just left for the church.

228
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,184
So we did. And now we're back.

229
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:25,620
The church was a dead end, I'm afraid.

230
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:28,256
- Where's Ray?
- He is returning

231
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:30,859
Lieutenant Tolkien
to the field hospital.

232
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,629
You guys all right?

233
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:37,132
Yeah! I'm just seeing double.

234
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:38,633
Yeah, we're... we're fine. We're fine.

235
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:40,335
I just need to get to
the library so I can,

236
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:43,638
you know, locate Christ's blood.

237
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,974
I need to run some repairs on Gideon.

238
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:49,744
Yeah, and I need to
get the Spear... a beer.

239
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,121
Yeah, well, as long as we get it first.

240
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:58,686
Are you not supposed to be
guarding the Spear of Destiny?

241
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:00,922
Mr. Rory offered to spell me.

242
00:13:00,924 --> 00:13:02,757
I thought you and Lieutenant Tolkien

243
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,692
were going to the Church at Amiens.

244
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:06,194
Uh, yeah, that didn't work out.

245
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:10,231
But I did happen to find the...

246
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:14,769
Nate.

247
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:17,939
I, um, I... I was
just saying that I, uh,

248
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:21,242
believe I found the final
resting place of Sir Gawain.

249
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:27,419
- So do you wanna tell us?
- Tell you?

250
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:29,417
- Are you feeling all right?
- You look like

251
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,186
you've seen a ghost.

252
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:32,954
No... yeah, no. I'm... I'm fine.

253
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:34,556
Yeah, sorry, I...

254
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,858
I... I think the location
of Gawain and, you know,

255
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,828
the Blood of Christ is in the, um...

256
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,534
Galapagos Islands.

257
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:49,337
The Blood of Christ is
in the Galapagos Islands?

258
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,407
Yeah. In 1984.

259
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,375
How could a relic from the Crusades

260
00:13:54,377 --> 00:13:58,413
wind up in the Galapagos during
the Reagan Administration?

261
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:02,116
Perhaps Gideon can help. Gideon?

262
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,586
Oh, no. Where's Gideon?

263
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:06,221
I'm gonna go and check on her.

264
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:08,289
I'll come with you.

265
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,693
Why are you looking at me like that?

266
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:13,261
What's going on?

267
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:15,530
I miss you so much.

268
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,432
You've been gone for five minutes.

269
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:23,771
I got it!

270
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:28,610
Where's pretty?

271
00:14:28,612 --> 00:14:31,212
- Away team, what's your status?
- Uh, we have the Spear,

272
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:32,881
but Dr. Heywood is running behind.

273
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:34,515
What the hell is he doing?

274
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:43,057
- Where the hell have you been?
- Eh, um...

275
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:45,994
I'm, uh, I'm sorry. I just
got... I got distracted.

276
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:47,295
We gotta get out of here.

277
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:49,664
Negative.

278
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,165
We got a new problem.

279
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,268
Your old selves are back.

280
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,970
Hang on. You mean that we've
returned from the church?

281
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:58,439
Yes, and if you come
out of the ship now,

282
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:01,476
they'll see you and wreck time itself.

283
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:04,279
You're trapped in there.

284
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,847
Good one!

285
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:15,485
We have to stop them
from getting to the ship.

286
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,914
Guys.

287
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,550
We have a... a new problem.

288
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:25,052
The ship... it's broken.

289
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:28,356
Uh, well what Sara means
is there's a radiation leak.

290
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,825
- Radiation leak?
- Yes, and it's very dangerous

291
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:32,093
so we need to keep our distance.

292
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,227
If you could just follow me this way.

293
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:34,495
Wait, where's Amaya?

294
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:37,231
She's safe. We got everyone...

295
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:39,000
off of the ship right away.

296
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:42,904
Except Grey, who's working
on fixing the ship right now.

297
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:45,406
I thought you said it was
too dangerous to be on board.

298
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,542
What's a little radiation

299
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:50,444
for one half of Firestorm?

300
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:56,684
I assumed we'd be on
our way to 1984 by now.

301
00:15:56,686 --> 00:15:58,686
Yeah, Rip took Gideon offline.

302
00:15:58,688 --> 00:16:01,055
Said something about an efficiency scan,

303
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:02,690
which should've been done by now.

304
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:04,792
- How strange.
- Yeah, like how Nate was acting

305
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:07,595
- in the library.
- Shouldn't Raymond be back

306
00:16:07,597 --> 00:16:09,730
from returning Tolkien to his regiment?

307
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:11,899
Ray. What's your 20?

308
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:15,369
Uh, I'm standing right in front of you.

309
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:18,472
Ray, listen to me: whoever
that is, she's an imposter.

310
00:16:18,474 --> 00:16:21,409
- Take her out.
- What about the other Jax?

311
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:24,412
Whoa, whoa, wait. There's
a fake version of me, too?

312
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:26,790
- Yeah.
- Ray, whoever this bozo is,

313
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:28,282
kick his ass!

314
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:33,521
- With pleasure.
- Okay. Huh.

315
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:36,122
- Sorry, Sara.
- For what?

316
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,525
Listening to you.

317
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,126
- Whoa!
- Big dude, chill out, bro!

318
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,395
- What are you doing?
- We're not imposters!

319
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:44,065
This is madness! What
has come over you people?

320
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,399
If you would...

321
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:48,669
- Oh, Ray!
- ...just...

322
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:51,405
let me explain!

323
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:53,674
If fake me is anything like real me,

324
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,643
Ray's gonna need some help.

325
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:58,279
Copy that, Captain.

326
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,017
Enough waiting, we
gotta get out of here.

327
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:05,853
We can't. Our prior selves
are out there right now.

328
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:08,389
If we leave, they'll see us.

329
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,490
Then don't go.

330
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:10,891
Whoa.

331
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:12,593
Mr. Jackson, I can explain.

332
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:14,128
That you're the Legion in disguisg?

333
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,398
Yeah, I know.

334
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,636
Thawne's face changing
technology is incredible.

335
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:22,903
Hang on.

336
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:27,708
I don't think she's an imposter.

337
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,045
This is the genuine Ms.
Lance and Mr. Jackson.

338
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,480
W-what?

339
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:35,182
But you told us never
to revisit our past.

340
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:37,018
Why would they do that?

341
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,919
You'll have to ask them that.

342
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:45,426
They almost made it
off the ship with this.

343
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:48,662
All right. Who's wearing whose faces?

344
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:51,332
We are not the Legion.
Believe it or not,

345
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,701
we are actually future
iterations of yourselves

346
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:55,102
who've travelled back in time to prevent

347
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:57,371
some form of calamity.

348
00:17:57,373 --> 00:18:00,041
I don't believe it. Why would Rip Hunter

349
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:02,309
break the first rule of time travel?

350
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:07,048
I'm asking myself the
very same question.

351
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,883
Oh, bollocks.

352
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:13,421
What the hell was that?

353
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:14,855
It's a timequake.

354
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:17,224
The result of us
interacting with ourselves.

355
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,627
- Well, that wasn't so bad.
- Yeah, give it time.

356
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,262
Whose bright idea was it

357
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:24,565
to do the one thing that
could jeopardize all of time?

358
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:25,733
Yours.

359
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:27,468
What the hell are you staring at?

360
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,970
Just imagining what you'd
look like without teeth.

361
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:31,272
Knock it off, Rory.

362
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:32,740
I can't believe that even we

363
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:33,941
would do anything so foolish,

364
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:35,976
unless something went terribly wrong

365
00:18:35,978 --> 00:18:37,411
the first time you were here.

366
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,580
Uh, I can't help but notice...

367
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:41,882
Not all of us came back with you.

368
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:44,418
What happens to us in the future?

369
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:49,523
Well...

370
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,893
dead, dead, good as dead.

371
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:54,895
Look, the Spear ended
up in the Legion's hands.

372
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:56,764
Bad things happened and it sucked.

373
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:59,266
But if we prevent the Legion
from ever getting the Spear

374
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:01,435
in the first place, everything
goes back to normal

375
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:02,837
and you all get to live.

376
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:10,277
- Where are you going?
- To think.

377
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,079
Perhaps you should go with her.

378
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:15,616
- Two heads are better than one.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:24,792
In the future you're from,
the Legion gets the Spear.

380
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:27,862
Yes.

381
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:30,064
So this is my fault.

382
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:33,634
It's more of a team effort, really.

383
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:36,604
Can I ask you a question?

384
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:38,906
Do you wish you would have used it?

385
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:40,441
- No.
- But you could've

386
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:42,143
stopped all of this.

387
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:45,215
You could've erased the
Legion of Doom from existence.

388
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,847
You could have kept your team alive.

389
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:52,486
You know why I... We can't use it.

390
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:57,625
The Spear... It draws on our desires,

391
00:19:57,627 --> 00:20:01,428
our weaknesses, our hatred.

392
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,798
Our darkness.

393
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,868
We're not strong enough to wield it.

394
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,137
The spear is a weapon.

395
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:12,406
And you know what we do with weapons.

396
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:22,249
Doing some light reading
on Zembezi, I see.

397
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:24,018
What do you want?

398
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:26,519
I came here to drop some
future knowledge on you.

399
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,022
You need to do yourself a favor

400
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:29,723
and stop being the ambassador of chill

401
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:32,526
and tell Amaya how you feel about her.

402
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:35,663
Okay. How do I feel about her?

403
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:38,566
You're in love with her.

404
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:41,769
Look, I...

405
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:45,873
I really, really like Amaya.

406
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,476
I saw Leonard Snart put a
gun to her head and kill her.

407
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:52,179
I watched Amaya die.

408
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:54,782
I lost her forever.

409
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:58,719
You understand me?

410
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,588
What do you want me to do?

411
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,956
We all wanna change the future.

412
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,424
I'm not talking about the future.

413
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:05,559
I'm talking about
changing who you are now.

414
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:08,529
I want you to do the things
I wish I would've done

415
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:11,398
instead of the things
I wish I would've said.

416
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,667
You wanna know why?

417
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:17,304
Because there's nothing... Nothing worse

418
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:21,008
than looking back at
your life with regret.

419
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:37,758
- Yep. Still weird.
- Please tell me you two

420
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,393
have figured a way out of this mess.

421
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:42,563
Uh! Clearly not.

422
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:44,565
- Was that another timequake?
- I don't think so.

423
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,634
- Someone's firing at us.
- Captain, our shields

424
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:51,572
- are nearly depleted.
- Copy that.

425
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:55,609
Sorry, habit.

426
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:58,712
That was a bit powerful for
World War I air artillery.

427
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:08,622
That would explain it.

428
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,224
The ship's taking too much damage.

429
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:11,558
We gotta make a time jump.

430
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,294
I really would not recommend that.

431
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,831
- Outta my way.
- Hey, that's my seat!

432
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,833
Travelling through time with ourselves

433
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:21,969
could create a paradox
exponentially larger

434
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:24,038
than the one we have already created.

435
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,474
- What do you think?
- That we have to do

436
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:28,809
whatever it takes to keep the Spear

437
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:30,511
out of the Legion's hands.

438
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:32,313
Hold on.

439
00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:40,955
- What's going on?
- It's the result of us

440
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:43,023
interacting with our previous selves.

441
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:44,358
It's a time-storm.

442
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:06,865
We're still in World War I.

443
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,666
Gideon, get us out of here.

444
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:10,068
Negative, Captains.

445
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,970
The ship has sustained critical damage.

446
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:13,938
Well, good news. The time-storm seems

447
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,274
to have caused a temporary ceasefire.

448
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:19,911
The bad news is the Legion of
Doom's still trying to kill us.

449
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:22,280
Wait, how far do you
even think we'll be able

450
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,715
- to make it out there?
- You only have to make it

451
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:26,117
as far as the other Waverider.

452
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,987
You want us to time jump together again?

453
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:30,755
Uh... you saw what just happened.

454
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:33,191
We won't be time jumping together.

455
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:36,728
You're not coming with us.

456
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,864
This has always been a
one-way ticket for us.

457
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:46,204
Your team has to get
the Spear of Destiny

458
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:49,908
away from here.

459
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,010
We won't fail you guys.

460
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,118
- Guys, we've got company.
- I see 'em.

461
00:24:01,388 --> 00:24:03,454
Everybody clear on the plan?

462
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:06,157
Run like hell. Try not to die.

463
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,060
What about you guys? You ready?

464
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:10,628
Other than the fact
that I can't Firestorm

465
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,896
and Nate can't Steel?

466
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,998
You bet your sweet ass we're ready.

467
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,293
- Damn it.
- Damien, I think we should

468
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:45,263
- go back to basics.
- Yeah, you're right.

469
00:24:45,265 --> 00:24:48,333
Killing's gotten so gosh
darn impersonal lately.

470
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:52,103
Ah.

471
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:58,576
Uh, uhh!

472
00:25:02,282 --> 00:25:03,882
Ah, ahh.

473
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:12,624
No!

474
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:21,399
No.

475
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:25,069
Jefferson, no, please. Please!

476
00:25:28,074 --> 00:25:31,542
Ah!

477
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:37,482
Grey!

478
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:39,450
Come on, Grey.

479
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:41,119
Come on, come on.

480
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:50,662
Ahh!

481
00:25:50,664 --> 00:25:53,264
Let him go, Mick.

482
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:55,133
I'm not listening to you anymore.

483
00:25:55,135 --> 00:25:58,303
Come on, is that any way
to talk to your old partner?

484
00:25:58,305 --> 00:26:01,339
I don't have a partner. I have a team.

485
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:04,142
Yeah, Darhk said you'd gone soft.

486
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:07,111
Lemme fix that for you.

487
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:11,883
Uh.

488
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:15,119
Mick, no! No!

489
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:23,027
- What's your problem?
- You're... you're alive!

490
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:26,497
You hug me, I'll kill you.

491
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:28,032
Okay. Later.

492
00:26:32,105 --> 00:26:34,138
Hey! The Waverider's just around...

493
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,708
Ahh!

494
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,679
I thought you were made of steel.

495
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:42,880
No!

496
00:26:42,882 --> 00:26:45,149
Get this in the ship.

497
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:49,387
Oh, I've been waiting for this.

498
00:26:54,594 --> 00:26:56,127
Ah, ahh!

499
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:10,541
Ahh!

500
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:12,310
Ohh!

501
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:17,148
Ah.

502
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:21,219
What are you waiting for?

503
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:23,721
Do it.

504
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:25,957
Death would be too kind.

505
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:31,262
Nice work. Both of you.

506
00:27:31,264 --> 00:27:32,630
Where's the Spear?

507
00:27:32,632 --> 00:27:34,699
You took it to the rendezvous point.

508
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:36,100
Oh, did I? Right.

509
00:27:36,102 --> 00:27:38,136
If you don't wanna get stuck in 1916,

510
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:39,971
get to the ship now.

511
00:27:39,973 --> 00:27:42,673
That means you, Amaya.

512
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:47,145
Nathaniel.

513
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:50,014
Don't be a douche.

514
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:52,050
Excuse me?

515
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:54,986
I won't, bro.

516
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:14,105
- I can't believe we made it.
- Don't jinx it.

517
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:17,909
Aw, he jinxed it!

518
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:21,612
I hate that guy.

519
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:26,517
Not that guy.

520
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:31,422
These guys!

521
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:36,561
You travelled back in
time to help yourselves,

522
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:38,262
I figured I could do the same.

523
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:39,630
You know, it's true what they say.

524
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:42,066
If you want something done right,

525
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,202
you really have to do it yourself.

526
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:57,810
Give me the Spear and
I'll spare your team.

527
00:28:57,812 --> 00:28:59,145
You can go to hell.

528
00:28:59,147 --> 00:29:01,547
No, but I'll make a hell for you.

529
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:04,550
Do you really wanna lose another one?

530
00:29:04,552 --> 00:29:06,719
Last chance.

531
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,721
Use the Spear.

532
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:14,026
B'khi-eel.

533
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:15,761
Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.

534
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:19,365
K'i-aheen. Kh'det Bay-all-ma-ah.

535
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:28,240
It can't be me. Use it. Fix the world.

536
00:29:28,242 --> 00:29:30,276
- Just do it, Sara!
- Look, I can't.

537
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:31,710
There's too much darkness inside of me.

538
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:32,945
I can't control it.

539
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,719
I believe in you.

540
00:29:40,721 --> 00:29:42,588
You're stronger than you know.

541
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:03,642
There's no place like home.

542
00:30:03,644 --> 00:30:04,977
Well, the cork broke off,

543
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:08,314
but I think I managed to salvage it.

544
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:09,882
Here.

545
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:18,181
To doing movie night more often.

546
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:27,916
This never happened.

547
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,938
This is the Spear doing this.

548
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,774
This isn't real.

549
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,910
No, it's not,

550
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:40,513
but it can be.

551
00:30:40,515 --> 00:30:44,950
You can remake reality
however you see fit.

552
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:55,895
You were always
the better of us, Laurel.

553
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:59,498
You were the strong one.

554
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,868
I'm damaged.

555
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,637
I know.

556
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,981
The Gambit,

557
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:18,150
Lian Yu,

558
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:20,085
League of Assassins,

559
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,321
you dying.

560
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:25,524
I could take it all back.

561
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,459
But you won't.

562
00:31:30,364 --> 00:31:33,032
Everything...

563
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:36,068
that has happened to me...

564
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,805
All the suffering that I endured,

565
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:44,376
it's all led to this moment, hasn't it?

566
00:31:44,378 --> 00:31:47,713
The Spear doesn't need
someone pure of heart.

567
00:31:47,715 --> 00:31:52,084
It needs someone strong
enough to do the right thing.

568
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:55,321
Sara, it needs you.

569
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:58,891
Even if doing the right thing...

570
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:01,527
means not having you back?

571
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,531
I'm never too far away.

572
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:13,372
I love you.

573
00:32:13,374 --> 00:32:16,475
I love you, too.

574
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:24,016
Too slow, Ms. Lance.

575
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:26,385
Far too slow.

576
00:32:26,387 --> 00:32:30,756
To think you had actual godhood

577
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:34,026
literally in your grasp.

578
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:37,029
Well, I'm not going to make the
mistake I made the first time.

579
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:40,866
I'm going to erase
you all from existence.

580
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:42,368
You won't even be dead.

581
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:46,705
B'khi-eel. Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.

582
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:48,040
K'i-aheen.

583
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,575
Kh'det Bay-all-ma-ah.

584
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:57,216
I may have made one
small change to reality.

585
00:32:57,218 --> 00:33:01,220
You depowered the Spear.

586
00:33:01,222 --> 00:33:05,424
Well, I guess we'll just have
to do this the old fashioned way.

587
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:08,327
I am going to drive
this through your heart.

588
00:33:10,831 --> 00:33:14,366
Yeah. About that...

589
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:21,774
No.

590
00:34:21,569 --> 00:34:23,102
You did it.

591
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,971
You would've done the same thing.

592
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,078
Remember, Legends never die.

593
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:43,255
Really? "Goonies"?

594
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:45,290
What's a goonie?

595
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,059
Ehh.

596
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:04,584
All right, Malcolm is back
in 2016, where he belongs.

597
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:07,487
- In prison?
- No.

598
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:09,188
His crappy apartment.

599
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,224
And what are your
plans for the two of us?

600
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:14,227
We're dead in 2017, remember?

601
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:17,130
I'm not taking you back to 2017.

602
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,206
Should've done this in France, Mick.

603
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,909
Could've saved us both a lot of time.

604
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:32,738
I didn't bring you here
to kill you, Leonard.

605
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:35,175
So what are we doing here?

606
00:35:35,178 --> 00:35:38,351
This is where Thawne
recruited you for the Legion.

607
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,259
I'm gonna wipe your memory
and put you on the right path.

608
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:49,395
You mean the path where I
join up with some Brit twit

609
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,165
and die trying to save the world?

610
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:56,469
No, you die trying to save your friends.

611
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:58,905
Still a death sentence.

612
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,774
You know what your
punishment is, Leonard?

613
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:04,944
You end up being a better man.

614
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:06,713
And so do I.

615
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:08,181
Better?

616
00:36:08,183 --> 00:36:10,249
You mean softer.

617
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,452
No.

618
00:36:12,454 --> 00:36:14,253
I mean better.

619
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:18,391
Mm.

620
00:36:28,303 --> 00:36:30,236
All right, so let me get this straight.

621
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:33,373
In retaliation for me
helping kill your team,

622
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,341
bending reality and torturing you,

623
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:39,145
I'm to wear this ridiculous
outfit and shoes without socks?

624
00:36:39,147 --> 00:36:40,913
Just setting things right.

625
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:44,717
You mean setting me on the
path to killing your sister.

626
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,553
I've already made that choice.

627
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:49,722
I'm okay with it.

628
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:52,325
And so is Laurel.

629
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:53,960
And how do you know that?

630
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:07,340
Hey, Gideon said we're
going back to 1942.

631
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:09,842
The mission's over. The
Legion's been put back

632
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:12,812
in their proper places
in the timeline, so...

633
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,448
now it's my turn.

634
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,166
Okay, um...

635
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,286
Well, if you don't
mind, I'd like to get off

636
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:24,424
- at that stop with you.
- What?

637
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:26,659
Look, I lost you once already,

638
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:31,164
even though it was a different
me and a different you.

639
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,533
And I don't ever wanna do that again.

640
00:37:33,535 --> 00:37:37,103
Or at all.

641
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:39,072
I don't know what to say.

642
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:42,942
Say, "Nate, come with me to 1942."

643
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:46,079
I can't say that, Nathaniel.

644
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:50,349
Because I don't want to go back to 1942.

645
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,985
I know that I'm supposed to.

646
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:55,588
I know I have a destiny and
that we shouldn't damage time

647
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,092
any more than we already
have, but I have to believe

648
00:37:59,094 --> 00:38:01,961
that time is stronger than that.

649
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:05,198
And that if I have a destiny,

650
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,567
it'll wait for me.

651
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,478
Hey, you going on a trip?

652
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,881
Uh, yes, in fact.

653
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,183
I was joking.

654
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,385
Right. Yes, well, we both know

655
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,187
that I don't have a
sense of humor at times.

656
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:31,861
But, uh, yes, I am taking my leave.

657
00:38:31,864 --> 00:38:33,397
What do you mean, "leave"?

658
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,561
This team has functioned
far better in my absence

659
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,563
than it ever did under my leadership.

660
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,734
- You saved reality itself.
- Well, you were there, too.

661
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,704
Yes, but I've realized
that there's nothing further

662
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:46,672
for me to teach you.

663
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:48,674
- Any of you.
- So, what?

664
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:51,911
You're just gonna walk out
of here and not say good-bye?

665
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,980
I was going to borrow
the jump ship, actually.

666
00:38:53,982 --> 00:38:55,982
I think Mick would call that stealing.

667
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:57,817
Oh, yes. Well, maybe Mr. Rory

668
00:38:57,819 --> 00:39:00,987
has had somewhat of an affect on me.

669
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:03,189
And you on me, Captain.

670
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:05,558
Ah, I'm no longer the captain.

671
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,894
You are.

672
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:12,064
And in that spirit...

673
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:15,434
permission to depart, Captain Lance.

674
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,637
Permission granted.

675
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,376
Stay out of trouble.

676
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:25,244
What, without you lot?

677
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:27,580
I think that'll actually be quite easy.

678
00:39:42,664 --> 00:39:45,765
Mick, you wanna do the
honors? Plot a course?

679
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:47,633
You earned it.

680
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,703
Gideon, set a course for Aruba.

681
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:52,138
Roger that, Mr. Rory.

682
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,274
Setting a course for
Aruba, the year 2017.

683
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:58,477
- What was that?
- This is what happens

684
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,247
when you put Mr. Rory
in charge of navigation.

685
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:03,349
In fact, it was another time-storm.

686
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:05,885
It seems the disruption
you created in 1916

687
00:40:05,887 --> 00:40:07,687
was just the start.

688
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:14,260
We've been ejected out
of the Temporal Zone.

689
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,731
- Get ready for a hard landing.
- Oh, come on!

690
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:21,968
Can we please go five minutes
without crashing the Waverider?

691
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,583
Is everyone okay?

692
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:38,851
This ain't Aruba.

693
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,021
No, this is Los Angeles, 2017.

694
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,990
Oh, boy.

695
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,653
Guys.

696
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:54,459
I think we broke time.

697
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:12,232
