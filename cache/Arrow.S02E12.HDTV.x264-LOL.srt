1
00:00:00,907 --> 00:00:02,691
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:06,663
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:09,065
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:11,752
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:16,707
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:21,461
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:25,699
I must be something else.

8
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:28,510
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:31,162
You're telling me you don't have
a substance abuse problem?

10
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,548
The D.A.'s office has a generous
severance package.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,184
Wait, let me explain
to the D.A.--

12
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:37,752
I'm sorry, but you're done.

13
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:40,421
Time to choose, Oliver,
who lives and who dies.

14
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:42,923
You got what
you came for!

15
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,925
Time's up.
Freaking psychopath!

16
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:47,145
No!
I guess you made your choice.

17
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,781
No!

18
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:50,890
Roy was injected with the serum.

19
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,701
We are going to have
to keep an eye on him.

20
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:55,019
Roy! Roy, I think
you're killing him!

21
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,155
You're stronger,
you heal faster,

22
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,340
but you're not in control.

23
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:01,392
I can teach you.
Let me help you.

24
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,294
When do we start?

25
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:12,787
Got your latest
customer.

26
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,555
Genius who held up
the convenience store

27
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:16,474
across the street
from a police precinct.

28
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,176
Not the smartest plan.

29
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:22,513
Come on through.

30
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,151
Bum knee.

31
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,020
I had it replaced
a few years ago.

32
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,406
Well, I guess we'll have
to do this old-fashioned-like.

33
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:33,408
Arms up.

34
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:38,613
Got your new bunk mate.

35
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,417
Play nice.

36
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,924
Ben Turner?

37
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,426
Tonight.

38
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:54,812
Midnight. Redwood Drive
and Larkspur Avenue.

39
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,581
What the hell
are you talking about?

40
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,051
Redwood and Larkspur.
The rooftop. Be there.

41
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,803
I don't know
if you've looked around,

42
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:04,555
but we don't exactly
have in and out privileges here.

43
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,391
My son is with his mother.

44
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,410
I won't get to see him, anyway.

45
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:11,646
This way, he's set.

46
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:14,615
I do this, he gets the money.

47
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:18,736
Do what?

48
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:45,346
What's going on
down there?

49
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,816
Crap.

50
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,956
What the hell
did you do to him?

51
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,191
I didn't do
anything.

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,320
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Arrow 2x12 ♪</font>

Original Air Date on January 29, 2014

54
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:13,007
Again.

55
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,428
You know, I slapped water
out of a bowl yesterday.

56
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,297
And I slapped water
out of a bowl the day before.

57
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,799
You must be getting
pretty good at it.

58
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,635
Yeah, well, I can't wait to get
attacked by a dog dish.

59
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,521
This is how an archer
builds arm strength.

60
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,255
I'm not sure if you've
been paying attention,

61
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:30,107
but strength
isn't my problem.

62
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,528
No, controlling it is.

63
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,897
Again.

64
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:42,703
And that...

65
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:45,656
is how you put a guy
in the hospital last week.

66
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:51,829
How'd you know
about that?

67
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,080
It's none
of your business.

68
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:54,465
You made it my business

69
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,417
when you agreed
to let me help you.

70
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,504
I knew someone like you.

71
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,258
Someone injected
with the Mirakuru.

72
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,960
He was my friend.

73
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,462
But it warped his mind
to the point

74
00:04:08,464 --> 00:04:11,432
where I didn't even
recognize him anymore.

75
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,968
Who was this guy?

76
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,988
How come I've never
heard of him?

77
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,458
Or that Mirakuru?

78
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,244
Is there anything
you can tell me about him?

79
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:26,130
Yeah.

80
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,117
I had to put an arrow
through his eye.

81
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,759
If I'm reading this right,
then Slade is back at the cave.

82
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,345
Well, why would he go back
to where the graves are?

83
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,997
We'll find out
when we find him.

84
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:46,183
And when we do...
You can't tell him.

85
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,936
Tell him what?

86
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:51,338
Don't talk to me like
I'm other people.

87
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,059
You've got that look
on your face.

88
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,561
The same one that you had
after the first time we kissed.

89
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,179
Pure guilt.

90
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:01,115
Because I am
guilty, Sara.

91
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,984
Ivo killed Shado
because of me.

92
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:04,452
But that's not true.

93
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:06,037
And even if it was,

94
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,188
nothing good comes
from telling Slade

95
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,740
that you think
you're responsible

96
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,877
for the death
of the woman he loved.

97
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,629
Love's the most
powerful emotion.

98
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:17,415
And that makes it
the most dangerous.

99
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,637
Great.

100
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,171
You still know how
to get to the cave?

101
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:25,890
Yeah.

102
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,259
It's this way.

103
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:35,149
Thea?

104
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,434
What are you doing home?

105
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,152
I thought you were
staying at Roy's.

106
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:40,604
Just needed
a little "me" time.

107
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,890
What's with
the fancy fancy?

108
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:45,526
Oh, I'm--
I'm going out to dinner.

109
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:48,162
With Walter.

110
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:49,780
Like a date?

111
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,983
Like a dinner.

112
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,452
Truly, I don't know
what the evening holds.

113
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:58,756
Are you all right?

114
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,841
Yeah. I'm fine.

115
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,877
Mostly. Uh...

116
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,662
It's Roy.

117
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,099
He had some trouble
last week, and...

118
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,268
I don't know
how to help him.

119
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,603
Do you want me to stay home?

120
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,522
I can call Walter
and we can reschedule.

121
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,107
Absolutely not.

122
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:20,111
If you and Walter
are going to patch things up...

123
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,864
No pressure.
But you're going.

124
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:26,183
It may be nothing.

125
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,486
Only one way
to find out.

126
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:39,830
No, please, Dad,
come right in.

127
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,717
Well, I guess you're going for
that lived-in look.

128
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,470
Can't afford a housekeeper
without a job.

129
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,640
Got enough beverage
money, I see.

130
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,976
I'm going to need to crack open
another bottle if we're going to fight.

131
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,427
I didn't come here
to fight.

132
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,012
Then why are you here?

133
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,347
Because I'm fine, really.

134
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,433
In fact, I have
a job interview.

135
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,435
At Joanna's new firm.

136
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:03,654
That's good. Good.

137
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,824
But the real reason
I came here is--

138
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,193
Is because you realized
that you didn't reach your weekly quota

139
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,179
of reminding me of how much
I'm ruining my life?

140
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,165
It's 'cause
I miss you, Laurel.

141
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,503
For a long time,
it was just you and me.

142
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,011
Whatever else was going on,

143
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:22,803
no matter how bad
either of us was doing,

144
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,510
we didn't disappear
on each other.

145
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,730
Because
you're my family.

146
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:33,267
And I miss my family.

147
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,554
So how about
we have dinner?

148
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,222
You and me, tonight.

149
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,442
I already ate.

150
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,110
Yeah.

151
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:45,563
How about
tomorrow night?

152
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,866
Sure.

153
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,735
Dinner tomorrow.

154
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:55,239
Thank you.

155
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,965
How's it
going with Roy?

156
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,717
Not well!

157
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:10,054
I don't know the kid
all too well,

158
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,173
but he seems to be
five kinds of angry.

159
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:14,308
You might be underestimating.

160
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,923
Roy was mad at the world

161
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,845
before he was injected
with Mirakuru.

162
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,599
You say you've seen this before?

163
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,568
Slade Wilson.
He was my friend.

164
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,654
Troubling use of
past tense there.

165
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:31,192
I thought I could
help him control it.

166
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,410
I was wrong.

167
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,079
But I know more now,
and I'm not going

168
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,614
to make the same
mistake with Roy.

169
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,032
What's that?

170
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,284
Iron Heights.
Due to their low security

171
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,569
post-quake, I thought it would be
a good idea to keep an eye on

172
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:45,589
their internal
communication for a while.

173
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,842
You hacked into
a prison system network?

174
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:49,710
Is that judgment
I'm hearing?

175
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:52,046
Pride.

176
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:54,014
Iron Heights just put out
a BOLO for Ben Turner,

177
00:08:54,016 --> 00:08:56,583
aka Bronze tiger,
which, btw,

178
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:59,803
is a terrible nickname,
because tigers are not bronze.

179
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,921
Turner escaped?

180
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:02,306
Killed ten guards
on his way out.

181
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,641
You think that would
have made the news.

182
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,808
Iron Heights is better
at keeping secrets

183
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,143
than they are
at keeping prisoners.

184
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,361
Any idea where
he's headed?

185
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:09,480
No.
Get one.

186
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,124
Tell your men
to take a walk.

187
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,992
Leave us.

188
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,995
They can leave
their weapons, too.

189
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,804
Thank you for
the early release.

190
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,874
Thought about
taking off, but I'm...

191
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,625
Curious.

192
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:41,128
Who would break a stranger
out of prison?

193
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,681
Someone who wishes
to hire you for a job.

194
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:49,103
I need you to help mn
retrieve a certain item.

195
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:51,689
This is the item.

196
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,073
You know it, yes?

197
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:55,309
Yes, I do.

198
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:58,362
Do you know
what you're messing with here?

199
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,915
Won't be cheap.

200
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:03,200
This is not a problem.

201
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,920
You do know that thing could kill
hundreds of people?

202
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:07,955
No, Mr. Turner.

203
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:10,741
It will kill thousands.

204
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:27,216
Now you.

205
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:29,552
Go slowly.

206
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,096
Stop!

207
00:10:34,097 --> 00:10:36,798
This is not about learning
to throw a punch.

208
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,182
This is about learning

209
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,968
to control
your strength.

210
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,524
First water slapping,
now this.

211
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:47,775
When are you going
to run out of ways

212
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:50,278
to make me look stupid?!

213
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,115
All I'm learning is new ways
to get pissed off.

214
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:55,366
And in case
you haven't noticed,

215
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:56,801
I'm already
pretty good at that.

216
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,119
There's nothing wrong
with anger, Roy.

217
00:10:58,121 --> 00:10:59,871
Anger is energy.
But you need to learn

218
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:02,573
to channel it
in a positive way.

219
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:05,326
Like putting the hurt on guys
going after the city.

220
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:08,412
Let me try hitting something
that'll actually hit back.

221
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:09,464
Too soon.

222
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,165
Get me out there
with you.

223
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,301
One night.

224
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:16,854
All this, it would be
a lot easier to take.

225
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:28,483
Moira.

226
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:33,137
Ah. I didn't realize
we'd have company.

227
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,106
This is Mark Frances.

228
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,807
Mark's CFO at Kardak Holdings.

229
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,793
We've been putting
in some hours

230
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,311
with the party's
election steering committee.

231
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:42,363
Oh.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

232
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:45,333
Those are words I'm not
accustomed to hearing these days.

233
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:47,702
Oh, well.

234
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:50,338
You were a lioness doing what
she had to do to protect her cubs.

235
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,540
You know, I'm not
the only person in Starling

236
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,825
who sees it that way.
That's a comfort.

237
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:56,377
It's the truth.
Please.

238
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,846
Thank you.

239
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:03,184
Well, it's unlike you to show
such an interest in politics, Walter.

240
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:06,554
It's part of my new position
at the Starling National Bank.

241
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:08,890
My Board of Directors
is very concerned

242
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,892
about the trajectory
of the city.

243
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:13,227
You mean Sebastian Blood.
Yeah.

244
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:15,530
We believe that his policies
will bankrupt Starling

245
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:17,031
within the next
eight months.

246
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,566
Not that the average
voter cares.

247
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:20,201
They're all caught up
in his charisma.

248
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:22,787
And he's not running
against a viable opponent.

249
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:25,990
Blood's trounced every potential
candidate we've focus-tested.

250
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:28,626
But we believe that he's vulnerable
on regulation.

251
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:31,295
Even if he is,
it hardly matters.

252
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:34,698
Banking regulations
are an SEC issue.

253
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,086
Starling City needs to use
the means at a city's disposal.

254
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:43,674
Walter
said you were smart.

255
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:48,262
But you didn't invite me to dinner
to hear my opinions.

256
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:51,766
You want to hear
my positions.

257
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:55,186
You want me to run
against Sebastian Blood.

258
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,725
I'm starving.
Where are we going?

259
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,528
It's little hole in
the wall right here.

260
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,627
Laurel, wait.

261
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,513
Don't touch me.

262
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:24,581
I can't believe you would
do something like this.

263
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,133
Well, you wouldn't
have come otherwise.

264
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:27,802
Well, you got that right.
Laurel, you need help.

265
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:29,470
Not from them.

266
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,472
There is not one
person in that room

267
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:33,257
who knows what I
have been through.

268
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:34,942
Yeah, you're right.
Some of them,

269
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,611
they've been through worse.
But for better or worse,

270
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:38,663
everyone in that room
needs to be there,

271
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,615
and you need to be there.

272
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:43,534
You think you're the only person,

273
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:46,821
who ever got fired, who ever
got their lives into a mess?

274
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:48,706
You think again, kiddo,
'cause you're not.

275
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,826
Now, look, we're here now.

276
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:53,711
So why don't you just
stay for a bit?

277
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,998
You don't have to share
or talk. You just listen.

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,401
I thought I made
myself clear.

279
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:02,887
I'm hungry.

280
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,339
And now I think
I'll eat alone.

281
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:15,599
Go ahead.

282
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:18,569
SCPD's network
just lit up with a fresh homicide,

283
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:21,439
multiple stab wounds.
Like claw marks.

284
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:22,683
The victim was an architect.

285
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,341
Turner ransacked his place;
Took blueprints of his designs.

286
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,979
One of the aforementioned
designs--Malcolm Merlyn's house.

287
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:31,882
I don't know much about architecture,
but this can't be good.

288
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,085
What would Turner want
with Merlyn's house?

289
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,652
Not sure yet. All of
Malcolm's holdings,

290
00:14:35,654 --> 00:14:37,588
including the house,
are in receivership.

291
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,707
Who's that
you're talking to?

292
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,826
Oh, wait, let me guess, you can't
tell me that, either.

293
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,819
A guy that I put in prison
got out,

294
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:46,559
and I have an idea
where he's headed.

295
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:53,187
Do you have one
of your hoodies?

296
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:55,973
Do you seriously
have to ask?

297
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,779
Whatever happens,
whoever we run into,

298
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,532
do not engage.

299
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:08,069
And don't touch anything.

300
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:11,138
This is his kid,
right?

301
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,076
The guy that died?

302
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:18,446
Yes.

303
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:22,249
You know your way
around this place.

304
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,085
You been here
before?

305
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,474
What was that?

306
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,810
It came from underground.

307
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:34,145
Merlyn has a large garage.

308
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:36,564
Let's go.

309
00:15:59,988 --> 00:16:02,790
What the hell is that?

310
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,091
Looks like a prototype.

311
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,410
Of what?

312
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,763
A machine that
killed 503 people.

313
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:12,583
Merlyn's own
earthquake device.

314
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:14,935
Ok, a simple
snatch and grab.

315
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:16,420
Don't know
why Mr. Armitage

316
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:18,222
thought
we needed you.

317
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:19,807
For that.

318
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:31,652
Step away
from the device.

319
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:34,872
You don't know
what it is you're dealing with.

320
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:36,791
Big machine, makes earthquakes?

321
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:38,325
Do you have any idea
what happens

322
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:39,994
if the wrong people
have it?

323
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:42,046
Yeah. I get paid.

324
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:45,049
Close it up.

325
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:08,022
That thing killed
eight of my friends.

326
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:25,289
Hey!

327
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,130
Uh-oh. You got angry face.

328
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,264
What happened?

329
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:47,931
Roy Harper.

330
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:49,148
You took him
out in the field--

331
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,733
He wasn't listening
to me, Diggle!

332
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:52,536
I'm trying  to reach him,
but he lost control.

333
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:54,436
Then he nearly
killed somebody,

334
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:56,872
which I obviously couldn't let happen,
and in the process--

335
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,491
Turner got away.

336
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,793
What was he there to steal?
Merlyn's art collection?

337
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:03,713
Something much
more dangerous.

338
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,881
It's a prototype
earthquake machine.

339
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,034
Oh, holy God.

340
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:09,719
Why would Turner
want to destroy the city?

341
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,138
He doesn't.
He's a mercenary

342
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,639
selling his services
to the highest bidder.

343
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:15,107
This watch belonged
to one of the guys

344
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,959
Turner was working with.
Fingerprints.

345
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:19,845
Turner's a loner, which mean
that guy works for his client.

346
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:21,731
Fingerprints equals name,
equals known associates.

347
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:22,965
I'm on it.

348
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,167
It was the look
in Roy's eyes.

349
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,703
It was Slade
all over again.

350
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,338
Oliver,
what happened with Slade?

351
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,257
Me.

352
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:32,692
Someone killed Shado.

353
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:36,696
Slade loved Shado,
and it was my fault.

354
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:39,949
I wanted to tell him,

355
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:41,784
because it would have been better
coming from me,

356
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,853
but I didn't.

357
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:46,005
And he found out another way.

358
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:49,875
If I had just
told him the truth,

359
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:51,961
I could have gotten
through to him.

360
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,163
And that's why it's so important
for you to get through to Roy.

361
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:56,732
I lived
a five year nightmare.

362
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,352
But if I learn
something

363
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:03,139
that could help me
reach Roy now...

364
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:08,361
It'll all be worth it.

365
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:17,203
He's not here.

366
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,572
Where else could he be?
We already checked the plane.

367
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:22,708
I don't know.

368
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:28,080
Do you remember
seeing these before?

369
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:29,799
I didn't really look around.

370
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,001
They look familiar.

371
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:34,203
This could be Lian Yu.

372
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:36,088
No, I mean
the calculations.

373
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,539
I've seen those before.

374
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,258
Maybe the first
time you were in the cave.

375
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,060
I don't think so.

376
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:43,062
Fyer's launcher.
What?

377
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:45,231
Oh, there were soldiers
on the island last year,

378
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:47,600
and they had a missile launcher.
I saw one of these

379
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:50,936
on the display.
They're firing calculations...

380
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:54,690
He's going to blow it up.

381
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,575
Blow what up?

382
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:59,695
The freighter.

383
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:08,254
Oh, thank God you're here,
I need your help--

384
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:11,240
I have to talk to you.
It's important.

385
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:14,176
Ok. You look stressed out,
is everything ok?

386
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:16,045
You have to leave town.

387
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,848
Grab your mother and your brother,
if you can, and leave.

388
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,182
It's just for a few days.

389
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:22,017
A reason
would be nice.

390
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,352
I need you to trust me, Thea.

391
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:25,054
I do. I just--

392
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:27,022
I can't up and leave
with my family without a reason.

393
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:28,307
No, you have to.

394
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:29,975
Roy, you're not

395
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:31,610
making any sense
right now.

396
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:32,778
Would you just tell
me what's going on?

397
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,813
Why aren't you listening to me?

398
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,115
I need you to listen to me!

399
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:39,618
Roy, you're
hurting me!

400
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,121
I didn't...I didn't...

401
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:44,290
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

402
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,908
I know!

403
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,787
Well. Your work
environment

404
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,790
has definitely
improved since CNRI.

405
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:04,626
This place is bigger
than my apartment!

406
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:07,062
Well, there is a limit to
the glamour, unfortunately.

407
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,732
I spend my days
in document production--

408
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:12,852
And answering interrogatories.

409
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,187
It doesn't feel like
practicing law so much as

410
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,180
pushing papers.

411
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:18,220
If I didn't know any better,

412
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,685
I'd think that you were trying
to talk me out of the job here.

413
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:25,998
I guess I do know better.

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:30,819
What's going on?

416
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:33,038
One of the partners
serves on

417
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,207
the bar association's
disciplinary committee,

418
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:38,065
and...Well, when
I sent your résume,

419
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,829
he did some checking.

420
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,348
That was a complete
misunderstanding.

421
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,683
I mean, sure, yeah,
I had some problems,

422
00:21:44,685 --> 00:21:47,303
but I'm fine now.

423
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:51,557
The bar is going
to open disciplinary proceedings.

424
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,858
What for?

425
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,260
Conduct affecting

426
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,061
your fitness
to practice.

427
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:58,063
That's--
that's ridiculous.

428
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,348
I know.

429
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,952
But while
this is out there,

430
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:07,323
the firm
can't hire you.

431
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,741
Thanks.

432
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:12,411
Thanks for letting me know.
I have to go.

433
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:14,663
Laurel, Laurel.

434
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,332
You can fight this, ok?

435
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,300
I'll help you, and--

436
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:21,003
I need some time to...process.

437
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:23,138
I'll call you.

438
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:27,092
Can I fix you a drink?

439
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:28,310
Whatever
you're having.

440
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:29,812
It was good
to see you

441
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,013
the other night,
Moira.

442
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,681
It was lovely.

443
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:36,068
It's been a while
since I've had such a good laugh.

444
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,987
It was
no joke, Moira.

445
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,055
Mark was telling
the truth.

446
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:42,224
A significant number of people
in Starling City

447
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:45,077
feel that your actions
with Malcolm Merlyn

448
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,196
were justified to
protect your family.

449
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,331
43.6%, in fact.

450
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,783
You polled people about me?

451
00:22:50,785 --> 00:22:52,167
Prudent course of
action when vetting

452
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:53,836
a potential
candidate, yes.

453
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:56,956
600,000 people in Starling City.

454
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,458
I'd think you could find
someone not responsible

455
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,844
for destroying it
with an earthquake machine.

456
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:04,246
Not with your
name recognition.

457
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:07,967
We need a game change
candidate, Moira.

458
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,469
And there's no one in Starling
with a higher profile than you.

459
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:12,388
Charles Manson
is rather well-known,

460
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,940
and no one is going to vote for him.
True.

461
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:17,610
Equally true, voters like
redemption stories.

462
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:20,646
Bill Clinton,
Elliot Spitzer,

463
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:21,947
Martha Stewart.

464
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:23,699
Oh, I don't believe
she ran for office.

465
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,401
But if she had,
she would have won.

466
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,735
Would have won what?

467
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:29,955
Ah, Thea.

468
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:32,124
Mmm, what's going on?

469
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:35,544
I'm just convincing
your mother to run for mayor.

470
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:36,829
Of what?

471
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:39,048
You see?

472
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,549
Sweetheart, are you all right?

473
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:44,303
You really need
to stop asking that.

474
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:46,589
Are you serious?

475
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,557
It's hard to believe, I know.

476
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,626
No. No, it's not.

477
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:53,962
Look, this is actually
the first election I can vote in,

478
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:57,132
and...as a newly
minted voter,

479
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:59,518
I don't think it
sounds that crazy.

480
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,906
From out of the mouths
of babes.

481
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:14,483
You're late.

482
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:17,503
I tried to get
my girlfriend to leave town.

483
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:20,422
But she won't.

484
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:24,660
You cannot bring her into this.

485
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,662
But how am I
supposed to lie to her

486
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:28,263
and protect her
at the same time?

487
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:30,182
How do you do it?

488
00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:32,834
How do you keep secrets
from people in your life?

489
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:36,105
By remembering
it's the only way to keep them safe.

490
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,724
No, keeping them safe
is what keeps them safe.

491
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:40,225
Telling people
the truth.

492
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:41,843
But you, you won't
tell me anything.

493
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:44,196
Not about the Mirakuru,
and this other guy.

494
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:46,231
And you got me slapping
water and hitting dummies instead.

495
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:49,735
Roy, you're spiraling
and you need to calm down.

496
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:52,204
No. I need
to save Thea.

497
00:24:52,206 --> 00:24:55,741
That thing is out
in the open because of you.

498
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:57,292
I think you've done enough.

499
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:59,294
Let go of me.

500
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:01,613
Roy...
I said let go of me!

501
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:03,949
Get control.

502
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:06,135
If not for me or yourself,

503
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,753
then do it for Thea.

504
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,588
What the hell
do you know about Thea?

505
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,807
Don't you talk about her!

506
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:19,898
Are you done?

507
00:25:27,857 --> 00:25:30,559
No. I'm not done.

508
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,394
I'm going
to stop this thing.

509
00:25:32,396 --> 00:25:34,279
And if you want
to stop me, try.

510
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:36,832
Try putting another arrow
in me. Go ahead.

511
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,852
'Cause I heal fast now.
But get in my way,

512
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:42,287
then I'll give you a good look at that
anger you're so worried

513
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:44,256
about me
losing control of.

514
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,928
You both scoffed
when I said we should invest

515
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,899
in an X-ray machine
for down here.

516
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,400
What do you want
to do about Roy?

517
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:04,602
Where are we
with the fingerprint?

518
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,604
I struck out
on domestic agencies,

519
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,639
but I'm checking Interpol,
PRC public security

520
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:10,975
and MVD databases now.

521
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:14,211
Oliver, I know
you've taken Roy on, and why,

522
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:17,114
but Roy, Slade,
a lot of guys I've served with...

523
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,101
Some people
are just broken, man.

524
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:22,936
And nobody can put them
back together.

525
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:25,606
I refuse
to believe that.

526
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:28,876
I'm not letting what
happened to Slade happen to Roy.

527
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,245
I'm not.

528
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:41,589
Yeah.

529
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:44,558
Are you near the club?

530
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,678
I'm pretty close. Why?

531
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,897
Laurel's here.

532
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,099
She doesn't look good.

533
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:56,904
Hey. Laurel's
upstairs.

534
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:08,549
Ohh! Excuse me.

535
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:10,534
Can I get something with olives?

536
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:14,505
I don't care what it is, as long as
there are a lot of olives.

537
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,374
How about coffee?

538
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:18,459
Coffee and olives?

539
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:21,429
Bad combination.

540
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,497
What are you doing?

541
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:25,666
This is where it's happening,
right? The big club?

542
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:27,852
Here you go,
Martini, triple olives.

543
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,470
Thanks.

544
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:31,188
Laurel, go home.

545
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,941
Thea Queen, telling me

546
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,609
enough is enough.

547
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:38,696
Now that is rich.

548
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:45,653
Fine.

549
00:27:45,655 --> 00:27:47,788
Bar me from your bar.

550
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,573
That's today's theme,
right?

551
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:51,325
Disbarment.

552
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:52,710
Laurel, are you being disbarred?

553
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,129
Yeah, looks like
my law career's over.

554
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,664
But you know what?

555
00:27:56,666 --> 00:28:00,534
Maybe Thea here can
hire me as a waitress.

556
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:03,137
Or, Ollie, I could
come be your secretary.

557
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,556
But that would mean you
would have to fire her.

558
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,842
Hi, Laurel. How are you?

559
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:14,482
Did you need
to borrow my car?

560
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,067
Did your limo
break down?

561
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,768
Oliver, can I talk to you
for a second?

562
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,988
Get her a cab, please.

563
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:25,242
Fingerprint was in
Interpol's database.

564
00:28:25,244 --> 00:28:27,595
The guy worked
for Milo Armitage.

565
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:29,163
He's a black market
arms merchant.

566
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,781
He's trying
to sell the device.

567
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:32,416
I need you to search
for any indication

568
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:33,868
that Armitage
is in Starling.

569
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,753
I already did.
His ship filed a loadlog manifest

570
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,404
at the Starling City docks.

571
00:28:37,406 --> 00:28:39,173
I'll get you
the slip number.

572
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,304
Hi, it's Oliver.

573
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:56,357
I just ran into Laurel,
and something's wrong.

574
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,312
She needs you.

575
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:05,282
Slade?

576
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:07,368
Oliver...

577
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,870
Slade!

578
00:29:09,872 --> 00:29:11,322
Get back!

579
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:13,624
We know you're
targeting the boat.

580
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,160
I'm going to send
that son of a bitch

581
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:17,995
to the bottom of the ocean.

582
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:20,164
You're going to destroy our only
way off of the island!

583
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:23,334
As long as Ivo is dead,
it's worth it.

584
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,557
I can't let you do it.

585
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,642
Get back, or so help me,

586
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,928
I will put you down!

587
00:29:35,347 --> 00:29:37,464
Mom? What
are you doing here?

588
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:39,483
I came by to get
your advice on something.

589
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:41,018
Step into my office.

590
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,636
Ahh.

591
00:29:42,638 --> 00:29:44,989
This is about
the campaign, right?

592
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,525
It's really awesome
you're thinking of doing this.

593
00:29:47,527 --> 00:29:50,578
You said something
that stayed with me.

594
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,014
The idea that there
could be voters out there

595
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:57,451
that wouldn't dismiss me
out of hand.

596
00:29:57,453 --> 00:30:00,538
Well, you did run
a multi-billion dollar company.

597
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,840
Yes, and an undertaking
that destroyed the city.

598
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,125
People will
get over that.

599
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:06,760
What makes you so certain?

600
00:30:06,762 --> 00:30:09,180
Because I did.

601
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,598
Can I make
a suggestion?

602
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,165
Instead of
punishing yourself

603
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:14,268
because you think
you destroyed the city,

604
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,388
how about you start
by saving it?

605
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:25,446
$10 million,

606
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,699
I believe was
the negotiated amount.

607
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:34,405
Congratulations, you're now
in a new tax bracket.

608
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:36,624
Just out of curiosity,

609
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:40,244
you pay me ten million,
and you get...

610
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:42,529
Three times that.

611
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:45,216
You already
have a buyer?

612
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,736
I recommend
that you stay clear

613
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:51,222
of Markovia for a few months.

614
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,074
I believe our business
is now concluded.

615
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:58,639
Not yet.

616
00:31:06,655 --> 00:31:09,890
Looks like your partner
abandoned you.

617
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:12,693
He's not my partner.
He's someone I hired

618
00:31:12,695 --> 00:31:15,496
to do a job.

619
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:19,283
And it turns out
it was money well spent.

620
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:31,797
Just too dumb
to stay down.

621
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:42,725
Don't do it!
You'll kill everyone here.

622
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:45,595
If I don't deliver this device
to my buyer in Markovia,

623
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:48,347
I'm dead anyway.
No!

624
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:04,287
Roy! I need you help!

625
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,870
Roy, stop!

626
00:32:05,895 --> 00:32:08,696
Roy! Roy,
I need you to stop!

627
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:14,674
The earthquake device
is in there.

628
00:32:14,676 --> 00:32:17,076
The steel is military grade;
It's built to withstand a bomb,

629
00:32:17,078 --> 00:32:20,179
but not you.

630
00:32:20,181 --> 00:32:22,748
Think about Thea.

631
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,685
Because she could die
without your help.

632
00:32:25,687 --> 00:32:27,053
I know you love her...

633
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,805
Because I've seen it.

634
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:32,358
Save my sister.

635
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,144
Control.

636
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:38,197
Focus on Thea.

637
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,900
She needs you right now,

638
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:42,201
or she is dead.

639
00:32:42,203 --> 00:32:44,520
Everyone is dead.

640
00:33:08,261 --> 00:33:11,580
You're...

641
00:33:11,582 --> 00:33:14,417
Yeah. Yeah.

642
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,653
Last year,
you saved my life.

643
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:20,106
And I don't mean
from the guy who kidnapped me.

644
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:22,975
I mean, you...
you saved me.

645
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:26,645
You gave me purpose.

646
00:33:34,955 --> 00:33:37,323
We're just getting started.

647
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:47,611
So...The secret society
gets a new member.

648
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:53,095
Where is he now?

649
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:54,795
Home.

650
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:57,264
He's, uh...

651
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:59,767
Processing.

652
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:01,835
When I found out
who you really were,

653
00:34:01,837 --> 00:34:05,172
I processed my way
through a pint of mint chip.

654
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:07,975
I stress eat.

655
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:10,728
Speaking of stress...

656
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,064
I'm not trying to Monday morning
quarterback here--it's Wednesday.

657
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:16,734
Didn't this all start
because you were worried

658
00:34:16,736 --> 00:34:19,820
that Roy's marble collection
was on the short side?

659
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:21,622
She has a point,
Oliver.

660
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:24,708
Roy's a loose cannon. Now he
knows your secret.

661
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,745
You're right,
and I wasn't thinking

662
00:34:27,747 --> 00:34:30,097
about the consequences.

663
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:35,202
I only knew that
I needed his strength.

664
00:34:35,204 --> 00:34:37,988
His power.

665
00:34:40,142 --> 00:34:42,042
On the island,

666
00:34:42,044 --> 00:34:47,598
Sara told me that love
is the most powerful emotion.

667
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,384
Well, the Arrow
couldn't get Roy

668
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:54,205
to think about Thea.

669
00:34:54,207 --> 00:34:57,191
But I could.

670
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:02,563
I said get back!

671
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:04,064
Think about Shado.

672
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:08,902
I am...

673
00:35:08,904 --> 00:35:11,288
Thinking about her!

674
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,091
There's something
I have to tell you about Shado.

675
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:17,244
It's something
you deserve to know.

676
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:23,184
She loved you,
Slade.

677
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:27,087
Maybe not the way
that you wanted her to,

678
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:28,722
but she loved you.

679
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:31,775
And she wanted you
to make it home.

680
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:34,862
She wanted you
to see Joe again.

681
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:38,265
She wanted you
to hug your son.

682
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:43,537
I know you're angry.

683
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:46,707
And I know
you want revenge.

684
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:49,543
If you destroy
Ivo's freighter,

685
00:35:49,545 --> 00:35:51,996
Shado will have
died for nothing.

686
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:09,013
What is happening to me?

687
00:36:09,015 --> 00:36:11,015
I don't know.

688
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:13,634
I am not going
to let you go through it

689
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:16,136
on your own.

690
00:36:16,138 --> 00:36:18,138
The man who killed Shado

691
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,157
is still out there.

692
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,943
And whether that freighter's
on the bottom of the ocean or not,

693
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:26,914
we're still suck
on this island.

694
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,866
Not for long.

695
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,206
Because we're going
to take the freighter.

696
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,722
I was glad
to receive your email.

697
00:36:51,724 --> 00:36:53,641
Does it portend
what I'm hoping?

698
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:56,176
I'm going to run.

699
00:36:56,178 --> 00:36:59,947
What changed your mind?

700
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:01,565
Thea.
Hmm.

701
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:04,234
She reminded me that
I still owe this city.

702
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:07,154
And I want to be remembered
as something more

703
00:37:07,156 --> 00:37:09,073
than Malcolm Merlyn's pawn.

704
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:10,624
As you should.

705
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:12,242
But you know there was

706
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:14,328
another reason
for my reticence.

707
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,046
You're afraid
the people will learn

708
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:18,415
that Robert wasn't
her biological father.

709
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:21,251
I managed to get through a criminal
trial without the truth coming out,

710
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:24,254
but political campaigns
tend to be a bit more adept

711
00:37:24,256 --> 00:37:27,308
at extracting skeletons
from closets.

712
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,709
But no one else knows.

713
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:31,028
Someone does.

714
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,180
My ob, Dr. Gill.

715
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:35,899
There were complications
when Thea was born,

716
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:40,521
and I had to tell him
that Robert wasn't her father.

717
00:37:40,523 --> 00:37:43,557
If we're going
to move forward,

718
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,693
we need to make certain

719
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:48,612
that he won't be
a problem for us.

720
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:50,864
Hmm?

721
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:04,712
Mr. Turner.

722
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:10,434
Hmm.

723
00:38:10,436 --> 00:38:14,588
I didn't know this place
allowed conjugal visits.

724
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,976
My name is Amanda Waller.

725
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:20,361
You say that like it's supposed
to mean something.

726
00:38:20,363 --> 00:38:22,730
To the contrary.

727
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:24,982
My identity
is highly classified.

728
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:27,551
Then why are you
introducing yourself to me?

729
00:38:27,553 --> 00:38:29,603
I have an offer for you.

730
00:38:29,605 --> 00:38:32,322
A way to work off your sentence.

731
00:38:32,324 --> 00:38:34,341
As it turns out,
I have need of someone

732
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:36,360
with your...

733
00:38:36,362 --> 00:38:39,096
singular qualifications.

734
00:38:39,098 --> 00:38:41,131
For what?

735
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:43,250
For a unit
I'm putting together.

736
00:38:43,252 --> 00:38:46,086
What type of unit?

737
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:48,756
Actually...

738
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:52,760
It's more of a squad.

739
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:58,565
Is this the part where you kill me
'cause I know your secret?

740
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:01,018
Do you actually think
that I'd kill my sister's boyfriend?

741
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,636
Well, you did shoot me
in the leg.

742
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:06,240
Forgiven, by the way.

743
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:08,192
Thea.

744
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:10,277
She can never know.

745
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:12,913
I get the feeling
that if I did tell her,

746
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:14,915
that would be when you kill me.

747
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,200
Trust that instinct.

748
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:17,984
Ok. All right.

749
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:19,953
How many people know what--

750
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:21,622
who you are?

751
00:39:21,624 --> 00:39:23,257
Too many.

752
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:26,326
But these are the only
two that matter.

753
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:34,167
John Diggle
and Felicity Smoak.

754
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:38,605
Does this group have a name?

755
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:40,724
Like team Arrow,
or something?

756
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:41,975
We don't call
ourselves that.

757
00:39:41,977 --> 00:39:44,144
I do. Occasionally.

758
00:39:44,146 --> 00:39:46,730
Stop.
Whatever.

759
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,482
Welcome aboard.

760
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:31,992
Sara...

761
00:40:32,017 --> 00:40:37,017
