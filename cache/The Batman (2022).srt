Our top story tonight,

Just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Real in a dead heat.

gut the Gotham Renewal Program,

for those who need it.

are still rampant.

Killer may have come

[Gordon] You said there was a card.

169
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,680
[lead detective] Yeah.

170
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,860
[Gordon] "From your secret friend. Whoo?

Haven't a clue?

172
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,324
Let's play a game, just me and you.

173
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,911
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

174
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,331
There's a cipher too.

175
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,965
Any of this mean anything to you?

176
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,718
What's going on here?

177
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,223
I asked him to come, Pete.

178
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:34,975
[Pete] This is a crime scene.

179
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:37,394
It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!

180
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,479
I got the press downstairs.

181
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,315
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

182
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,234
But this is way over the line.

183
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:48,989
Wait.

184
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:50,782
-He's involved in this?
-No, he's not involved.

185
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,992
How do you know?

186
00:15:52,075 --> 00:15:55,078
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

187
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,913
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

188
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,623
[Gordon] I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

189
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,250
He lies still.

190
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:02,752
Excuse me?

191
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,380
The riddle.

192
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,384
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

193
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:20,020
Oh, Jesus.

194
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,067
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

195
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,904
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

196
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,323
[Martinez] Excuse me, Commissioner.

197
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,075
They're ready for your statement.

198
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:39,831
I want him outta here.

Come on.

[camera shutter clicking]

00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:03,355
Yeah.

203
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,024
The kid found him.

204

[detective] Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

[melancholy song playing]

206
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:32,634
We really gotta go, man.

207
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,935
[Pete] Tonight, a son lost a father.

208
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,229
A wife lost a husband.

209
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:46,982
And I lost a friend.

210
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,610
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

211
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,780
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

212
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,408
This was a truly senseless crime,

213
00:17:57,158 --> 00:18:00,579
and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have

214
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:04,749
in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.

215
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,084
I've spoken to the governor...

216
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,004
[Bruce] / wish I could say
I'm making a difference,

217
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,672
but I don't know.

218
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,425
[melancholy song continues]

219
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,472
Murder, robberies, assault.

220
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,641
Two years later, they're all up.

221
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,727
And now this.

222
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:27,480
The city's eating itself.

223
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:31,443
Maybe it's beyond saving.

224
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:35,822
But I have to try.

225
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,866
Push myself.

These nights all roll together in a rush

behind the mask.

231
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:36,132
Sometimes in the morning,

232
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,095
I have to force myself to remember

233
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,057
everything that happened.

[newscaster on TV] Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.

236
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:04,160
Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

237
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,080
was found murdered last night
inside his home

238
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,915
in the exclusive Crest Hill district.

239
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:10,667
[newscaster 2]
Exact details of the crime

240
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,252
still have not been released,

241
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:15,213
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

242
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:18,550
as police and FBI search
for the brazen Killer.

243
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,468
And this certainly is not the first time

244
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,096
Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.

245
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,434
In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week

246
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,269
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist

247
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:31,312
Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha

248
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,232
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.

249
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:38,153
It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.

250
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,029
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career

251
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,782
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs

252
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,119
when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,

253
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:50,165
resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni

254
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:54,419
with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.

255
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:55,920

All this blood is from his head?

You're becoming quite a celebrity.

Why is he writing to you?

It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!

I don't know yet.

Here? Why?

276
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,612
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

I haven't got time for this.

278

It's getting serious, Bruce.

If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

280

I don't care about that.

Any of that.

You don't care about
your family's legacy?

What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

If I can't change things here,

if I can't have an effect,

286

[Alfred smacks lips]

301
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,110
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

302
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,613
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

So, I'm looking for any double symbols

What if this is the whole key?

313

Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

314

Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

Blank. Yeah, I understand.

00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,794
[Gil] You wanna take a seat over there?

661
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,963
-Richie, Glen.
-[Richie] Hey.

662
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,924
That's half the DA's office.

663
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:49,175
[Gil] You know Carla here, huh?

664
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,218
Hi.

665
00:48:50,301 --> 00:48:52,345
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

666
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,305
Drowning our sorrows.

667
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:55,932
You want a drop?

668
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:58,059
[Selina] Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.

669
00:48:58,351 --> 00:48:59,769
[music continues on speakers]

670
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:01,688
Hope you don't mind.

671
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:03,815
I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.

672
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,233
He's wasted.

673
00:49:05,316 --> 00:49:06,359
No shit.

674
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:09,028
[chuckles] I like this girl.

675
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:11,072
Oh, hey, I like you too!

676
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:17,954
I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.

677
00:49:18,037 --> 00:49:19,122
He knows so much.

678
00:49:19,205 --> 00:49:20,498
[Travis] He doesn't know shit, man.

679
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,834
[Gil] What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...

680
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:23,835
[Richie] Hey, hey, Gil, come on.

681
00:49:23,918 --> 00:49:25,837
-Think maybe you had a little too much.
-Hey. The rat.

682
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,881
-[Richie] Slow down.
-Ask him about the rat.

683
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,718
[Selina] Hey, what's this about a rat?

684
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,598
[inhales deeply]

685
00:49:42,061 --> 00:49:43,271
I mean...

686
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:47,692
there was a rat. We had an informant.

687
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,695
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

688
00:49:50,778 --> 00:49:52,489
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.

689
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,157
He's talking about the Maroni case.

690
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,535
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.

691
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:00,413
And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.

692
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,415
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

693
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,126
This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.

694
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,461
What do you know about that?

695
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:09,255
Does anybody want a drink?

696
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,298
[Gil] I want a drink.

697
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,716
Keep him talking.

698
00:50:14,802 --> 00:50:15,887
Wait, where are you going?

699
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,013
She knows Annika.

700
00:50:17,096 --> 00:50:18,515
No, stay on the DA.

701
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,517
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

702
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,771
-Where's Annika?
-Out of my face. I don't know you.

703
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:25,897
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

704
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,525
-What have you heard? Is she okay?
-Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.

705
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,859
What, you got a death wish?

706
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,403
[man] Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

707
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,406
[Carla]
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

708
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,991
Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?

709
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,159
[Carla] Sure thing, Oz.

710
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,957
Hey.

711
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,625
Hey.

712
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,963
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

713
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,465
How you been?

714
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,511
Yeah, I've been okay.

715
00:50:57,845 --> 00:50:59,222
I was just...

716
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,101
I was just headed back upstairs.

717
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:04,852
Well...

718
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,605
don't be a stranger.

719
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,080
-You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

720
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:25,748
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

721
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,625
I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?

722
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,544
-Well, that's not what it looked like.
-Forget it.

723
00:51:29,627 --> 00:51:30,712
Wait, what are you doing?

724
00:51:30,795 --> 00:51:33,214
-Listen, I can't do this anymore.
-No! No!

725

[heavy breathing]

729
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:43,766
[Gil] Hey!

730
00:51:45,476 --> 00:51:46,561
I lost you in there.

731
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:47,729
Yeah, I gotta go.

732
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,023
Oh, you need a ride?

733
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,025
That's me right there.

734
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,277
[eerie music playing]

735
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,198
Taxi!

736
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,408
I'm good.

737
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:03,536
I hope, uh...

738
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,542
I'll see you around.

[switch clicks]

757
00:54:38,357 --> 00:54:39,275
[Batman] What do you know about

758
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:41,652
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

759
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,449
Yeah, sure, there was.

760
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,993
That's the rat we're looking for.

761
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,788
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

762
00:54:52,371 --> 00:54:55,374
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

763
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,918
Where are you getting this?

764
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:59,879
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

765
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:02,131
Gil's very nervous.

766
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:05,635
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

767
00:55:05,718 --> 00:55:07,595
I worked that case.

768
00:55:07,678 --> 00:55:09,639
Riddler's not after you.

769
00:55:09,722 --> 00:55:10,640
How do you know?

770
00:55:11,015 --> 00:55:12,433
You're not corrupt.

771
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,019
Colson's dirty?

772
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,401
Maybe I, uh...

773
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:26,405
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

774
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,784
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

775
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,328
Who knows how many people it touches.

776
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:35,623
Politicians. Police. The courts.

777
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,626
It could tear the whole city apart.

778
00:55:39,043 --> 00:55:41,087
[Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.

779
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:44,465
[Batman] And Riddler's the match.

780
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,509
[Batman on video]
You know Carmine Falcone.

781
00:55:46,592 --> 00:55:47,885
[Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.

782
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,387
[Batman] You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

783
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:50,972
[Selina] I don't have a relationship...

[video rewinds]

785
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:53,599
[Batman] You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

786
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,351
[Selina] I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?

787
00:55:55,476 --> 00:55:56,394
[video rewinds]

788
00:55:56,477 --> 00:55:57,937
[Batman] You know Carmine Falcone.

789
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,063
[Selina] I told you it's a mob spot.

790
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:00,773
[Batman] You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

791
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,692
[Selina] I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?

792
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:04,026
-[Alfred] Pretty.
-[tape clicks off]

793
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:07,405
She a new friend of yours?

794
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,202
I'm not so sure.

795
00:56:14,036 --> 00:56:15,538
Looks like you upset her.

796
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,833
Shall I take this as a good sign?

797
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:19,917
What?

798
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:20,918
Your attire.

799
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,129
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

800
00:56:23,212 --> 00:56:25,214
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

801
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,967
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

802
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,595
Riddler might not be able to resist.

803
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,138
Oh, that reminds me.

804
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:37,268
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

805
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,312
The one from the rat maze.

806
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,815
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

807
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,026
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

808
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:48,362
"You are El Rata Alada.”

809
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,406
[Bruce] Rata Alada?

810
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:51,699
"Rat with wings"?

811
00:56:51,782 --> 00:56:54,285
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

812
00:56:54,368 --> 00:56:55,620
Yeah.

813
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,205
A stool pigeon.

814
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,082
Where are your cufflinks?

815
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,125
I couldn't find them.

816
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,545
Well, you can't go out like that.

817
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,422
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

818
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,387
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

819
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,472
[scoffs]

820
00:57:15,097 --> 00:57:17,308

01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:21,453
You hear me?

986
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:22,538
[softly] Okay.

987
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,706
[Riddler groaning comically]

988
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:28,752
[Riddler laughing]

989
01:07:31,296 --> 01:07:33,382
[Riddler] I'm giving you a chance.

990
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:37,302
No one ever gave me a chance.

991
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,389
Now,

992
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,184
ever since I was a child,

993
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:47,854
I've always loved little puzzles.

994
01:07:48,438 --> 01:07:50,857
For me, they are a retreat

995
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:54,278
from the horrors of our world.

996
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:59,575
Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.

997
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,910
-You want me to do puzzles?
-[chuckles excitedly]

998
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:04,746
Three riddles in two minutes.

999

You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.

01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,336
-Do you understand?
-Yeah.

1001
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,589
Okay, okay. So I just...

1002
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:14,756
-You want me to...
-[device beeps]

1003
01:08:14,881 --> 01:08:17,217
-[whimpers]
-Riddle number one...

1004
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:20,929
-[timer beeping]
-"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,

1005
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:25,684
but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."

1006
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:28,186
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

1007
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,354
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

1008
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,856
-"Justice."
-Huh?

1009
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:31,982
The answer's "justice."

1010
01:08:32,065 --> 01:08:33,275
-Justice?
-Yes!

1011
01:08:33,358 --> 01:08:34,943
-Oh, God.
-Justice!

1012
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:39,364
[dramatically] And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,

1013
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,825
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

1014
01:08:41,908 --> 01:08:44,286
were you not, Mr. Colson?

1015
01:08:44,369 --> 01:08:45,579
Of course, of course. Of course.

1016
01:08:45,662 --> 01:08:48,040
Riddle number two.

1017
01:08:48,123 --> 01:08:52,252
"If you are justice, please do not lie.

1018
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:56,506
What is the price for your blind eye?”

1019
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:58,383
-"The price"?
-[Batman] "Bribes."

1020
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,718
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

1021
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:01,970
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

1022
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,305
[hesitating]

1023
01:09:03,388 --> 01:09:04,514
[shouting] Fifty-eight seconds!

1024
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:05,849
-How much?
-Nothing!

1025
01:09:05,932 --> 01:09:08,143
-[raises voice] How much?
-Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

1026
01:09:08,226 --> 01:09:10,520
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

1027
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:11,438
What cases?

1028
01:09:11,521 --> 01:09:12,648
He didn't ask me that!

1029
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:13,732
-Come on! Ten grand.
-[Riddler laughing]

1030
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:17,152
-That's my answer. It's ten grand!
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

1031
01:09:17,235 --> 01:09:19,863
Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.

1032
01:09:19,946 --> 01:09:23,784
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

1033
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:26,286
[singsongy] Last riddle.

1034
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:30,707
[dramatically]
"Since your justice is so select,

1035
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:35,087
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect.”

1036
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:37,255
-"Which vermin"?
-[Batman] The rat.

1037
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,883
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

1038
01:09:39,966 --> 01:09:41,760
-How do you know about that?
-What's his name?

1039
01:09:41,843 --> 01:09:43,053
Twenty seconds.

1040
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:44,805
-No.
-He's gonna kill you.

1041
01:09:44,888 --> 01:09:46,848
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

1042
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,475
If I go out this way, it's just me.

1043
01:09:48,558 --> 01:09:51,687
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

1044
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,230
-He'll kill them too.
-Who will?

1045
01:09:53,313 --> 01:09:54,648
-People are watching.
-What people?

1046
01:09:54,731 --> 01:09:56,858
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

1047
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,111
-It's the whole system!
-Five!

-Four!

You're protecting this guy, Jim?

He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

Colson's blood is on his hands.

Maybe it's on yours.

1071

What'd you say?

1072
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:08,096
He would rather die than talk.

1073
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,182
What was he afraid of?

1074

You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

1078
01:11:24,237 --> 01:11:25,947
You could be an accessory to murder.

You too now?

Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

1091
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:55,685
Okay, give him the room.

1092
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:12,619
Two minutes.

1093
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:25,966
You listen to me.

[softly] We gotta get you out of here.

1095

That would put a lot of heat on you.

1096
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:34,933
Well, you punched me in the face.

That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

1106
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:07,632
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

1107
01:13:10,343 --> 01:13:12,304
Or he moonlights as a cop.

Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

You think Penguin's the rat?

1126

His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

1127

Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

DA was a regular too.

Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

It means "a rat with wings."

A penguin's got wings too.

Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

It's all connected.

01:48:45,643 --> 01:48:49,188
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1624
01:48:51,774 --> 01:48:53,317
He was protecting your mother.

1625
01:48:54,277 --> 01:48:57,822
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1626
01:48:57,905 --> 01:49:00,033
He cared about her,

1627
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:01,409
and you,

1628
01:49:01,492 --> 01:49:04,412
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1629
01:49:04,495 --> 01:49:07,957
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1630
01:49:08,833 --> 01:49:12,170
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1631
01:49:12,253 --> 01:49:15,381
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1632
01:49:15,465 --> 01:49:17,300
That's who Falcone is.

1633
01:49:19,552 --> 01:49:21,763
And that was your father's mistake.

1634
01:49:21,846 --> 01:49:23,890
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1635
01:49:23,973 --> 01:49:26,726
your father was distraught.

1636
01:49:27,602 --> 01:49:30,813
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1637
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:33,066
that he would confess everything.

1638
01:49:34,567 --> 01:49:36,569
And that night,

1639
01:49:36,652 --> 01:49:40,573
your father and your mother were Killed.

1640
01:49:42,992 --> 01:49:45,161
[soft music playing]

1641
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:47,830
It was Falcone?

1642
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:53,795
[smacks lips]

1643
01:49:53,878 --> 01:49:56,005
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1644
01:50:00,718 --> 01:50:04,263
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1645
01:50:04,347 --> 01:50:07,100
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1646
01:50:07,183 --> 01:50:12,396
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1647
01:50:14,148 --> 01:50:18,027
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1648
01:50:18,694 --> 01:50:20,488
I know you always blamed yourself.

1649
01:50:20,571 --> 01:50:23,116
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1650
01:50:25,284 --> 01:50:27,578
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1651
01:50:28,996 --> 01:50:31,374
but I didn't know how to help.

1652
01:50:31,457 --> 01:50:33,960
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1653
01:50:35,336 --> 01:50:38,005
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1654
01:50:38,089 --> 01:50:39,924
You needed a father.

1655
01:50:41,884 --> 01:50:44,303
And all you had was me.

1656
01:50:46,681 --> 01:50:47,890
I'm sorry.

1657
01:50:49,642 --> 01:50:51,561
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1658
01:50:58,359 --> 01:50:59,443
God.

1659
01:51:02,488 --> 01:51:06,909
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1660
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:11,747
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1661
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:19,422
I mean,

1662
01:51:20,631 --> 01:51:22,758
I'm not afraid to die.

1663
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:26,888
I realize now there's something

1664
01:51:28,014 --> 01:51:29,891
I haven't got past.

1665
01:51:30,808 --> 01:51:32,560
This fear...

1666
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:37,982
of ever going through any of that again.

1667
01:51:42,236 --> 01:51:44,447
Of losing somebody I care about.

1668

Hey.

01:52:36,082 --> 01:52:38,834
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1673
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:40,836
I thought it was you.

- I see that.

1676
01:52:55,393 --> 01:52:56,894
He had my shit and my phone.

She left a message
the night they took her.

She called me...

Gordon! Help me out, man!

1680
01:53:01,065 --> 01:53:02,358

She called me!

Hey! Get back here!

-[Annika whimpering]
-Where you going? Come back here!

1687
01:53:22,169 --> 01:53:24,255
[Falcone] Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?

1688
01:53:24,338 --> 01:53:25,673
You're scaring her.

1689
01:53:25,756 --> 01:53:27,466
[Kenzie] I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1690
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:28,592
[Annika, tearfully]
Please, please, please.

1691
01:53:28,676 --> 01:53:29,969
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1692

[Falcone]
Hey, don't be scared. Come here.

1693
01:53:34,598 --> 01:53:36,642
Now let me ask you again.

1694
01:53:37,351 --> 01:53:39,895
-What did Mitchell tell you?
-[Annika] No, nothing. He...

1695
01:53:39,979 --> 01:53:42,898
[Falcone] Don liked to talk.
I know that.

1696
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:45,693
Especially to pretty girls like you.

1697
01:53:46,235 --> 01:53:48,237
That's why I made him
take your passport...

1698
01:53:48,946 --> 01:53:51,824
until we could have
this little conversation.

1699
01:53:51,907 --> 01:53:54,618
[Annika] All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?

1700
01:53:54,702 --> 01:53:56,829
You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...

1701
01:53:56,912 --> 01:54:00,041
[Falcone] We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

1702
01:54:00,875 --> 01:54:03,419
But first, I gotta know...

1703
01:54:04,503 --> 01:54:05,838
What did he tell you?

1704
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:10,176
[Annika] He just said
they all made a deal with you.

1705
01:54:10,676 --> 01:54:11,886
[Falcone] Oh. Hmm.

1706
01:54:11,969 --> 01:54:13,929
He told you about that, huh?

1707
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:15,306
The deal.

1708
01:54:15,389 --> 01:54:20,311
[Annika] He said you gave some
information on some drops thing

1709
01:54:20,394 --> 01:54:23,105
and that's how he became mayor.

1710
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:25,566
He said you were a very important man.

1711
01:54:25,649 --> 01:54:26,776
[Falcone] Right.

1712
01:54:27,526 --> 01:54:28,903
Mm-hmm.

No.

1729
01:55:33,175 --> 01:55:34,176
How?

1730
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:35,845
Through Renewal.

1731
01:55:36,637 --> 01:55:38,013
Renewal is everything.

1732
01:55:38,097 --> 01:55:39,432
-The Renewal Fund?
-[Kenzie] Yeah.

1733
01:55:40,015 --> 01:55:43,727
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1734
01:55:43,811 --> 01:55:47,398
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1735
01:55:47,481 --> 01:55:50,860
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1736
01:55:50,943 --> 01:55:53,028
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1737
01:55:53,112 --> 01:55:54,822
Everybody got a piece.

1738
01:55:54,905 --> 01:55:56,740
But Falcone wanted more.

1739
01:55:58,534 --> 01:56:01,745
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1740
01:56:03,164 --> 01:56:05,499
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1741
01:56:05,875 --> 01:56:08,586
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1742

then install them all as his puppets.

You think this goddamn election matters?

Falcone's the mayor.

01:56:18,262 --> 01:56:20,764
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

Come on, Vengeance.

-But not that way.
-There is no other way!

I gotta do this my way.

And then what?

01:57:19,698 --> 01:57:21,075
We do what Riddler said.

02:10:22,105 --> 02:10:24,524
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1944
02:10:24,607 --> 02:10:28,153
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1945
02:10:28,236 --> 02:10:29,779
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1946
02:10:29,863 --> 02:10:32,157
Edward Nash ton. Works at KTMJ.

1947
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:34,075
-He's a forensic accountant.
-Accountant?

1948
02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:36,578
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1949
02:10:36,661 --> 02:10:38,413
What about chain of evidence?

1950
02:10:39,247 --> 02:10:40,457
You should see this.

1951
02:10:46,421 --> 02:10:47,922
He's wearing gloves.

1952
02:10:49,382 --> 02:10:51,634
"Friday, July 16th.

1953
02:10:51,718 --> 02:10:55,430
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1954
02:10:55,764 --> 02:10:58,808
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1955
02:10:58,892 --> 02:11:00,310
But then, today, I saw it.

1956
02:11:00,393 --> 02:11:04,522
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1957
02:11:05,857 --> 02:11:07,650
'Renewal.'

1958
02:11:07,734 --> 02:11:12,155
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1959
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:15,367
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1960
02:11:15,450 --> 02:11:18,787
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1961
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:21,331
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1962
02:11:21,414 --> 02:11:24,417
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

-[rats squeaking]
-"If you want people to understand,

1964
02:11:27,462 --> 02:11:29,297
really understand,

1965
02:11:29,381 --> 02:11:31,674
you can't just give them the answers.

1966
02:11:31,758 --> 02:11:33,218
You have to confront them,

1967
02:11:33,301 --> 02:11:35,720
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1968
02:11:35,804 --> 02:11:37,972
just like they tortured me.

1969
02:11:38,056 --> 02:11:40,850
I know now what I must become."

1970
02:11:43,812 --> 02:11:45,146
Jesus.

[bat screeching]

1972
02:11:51,236 --> 02:11:53,196
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1973
02:11:53,738 --> 02:11:55,240
This one's not a rat.

[screeching violently]

1976
02:12:11,881 --> 02:12:13,007
[Gordon] What is that?

1977
02:12:15,718 --> 02:12:17,220
[bat screeching frantically]

1978
02:12:44,622 --> 02:12:45,832
[officer] Some kind of pry tool?

1979
02:12:45,915 --> 02:12:47,292
Is it a chisel?

1980
02:12:47,375 --> 02:12:48,835
[Batman] It's a murder weapon.

1981
02:12:48,918 --> 02:12:50,295
He killed Mitchell with it.

1982
02:12:50,962 --> 02:12:53,840
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1983
02:13:02,432 --> 02:13:04,434
"My confession"?

1984
02:13:04,517 --> 02:13:07,395
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1985
02:13:07,479 --> 02:13:08,855
This isn't over.

1986
02:13:08,938 --> 02:13:11,357
[officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1987
02:13:11,774 --> 02:13:13,985
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1988
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:15,653
[typing]

1989
02:13:22,076 --> 02:13:24,287
His final post was last night.

1990
02:13:24,370 --> 02:13:27,582
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1991
02:13:27,665 --> 02:13:30,668
-[Gordon] Can you get in?
-[officer 2] Copying his drive now.

1992
02:13:30,793 --> 02:13:34,214
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1993
02:13:34,714 --> 02:13:36,299
[ominous music playing]

1994
02:13:45,558 --> 02:13:48,102
-[Gordon] Show me the post.
-[officer 2] It's right here.

1995
02:13:49,729 --> 02:13:51,439
[Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."

1996
02:13:52,273 --> 02:13:53,900
I think I'm his last target.

1997
02:13:56,486 --> 02:13:57,570
You?

1998
02:13:57,946 --> 02:13:59,989
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1999
02:14:00,532 --> 02:14:01,908
What is?

2000
02:14:02,367 --> 02:14:03,785
The Batman.

2001
02:14:04,035 --> 02:14:05,203
[cell phone ringing]

2002
02:14:09,165 --> 02:14:10,333
Yeah?

2003
02:14:21,636 --> 02:14:22,845
Right.

2004
02:14:25,723 --> 02:14:29,686
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

2005
02:14:37,151 --> 02:14:38,653
You're a good cop.

2006
02:15:03,261 --> 02:15:05,638
[over speaker]
I told you I'd see you in hell.

2007
02:15:06,389 --> 02:15:08,224
[Batman] What do you want from me?

2008
02:15:08,308 --> 02:15:09,851
[Riddler] "Want"?

2009
02:15:10,435 --> 02:15:14,063
If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.

2010
02:15:15,273 --> 02:15:16,608
For this moment.

2011
02:15:17,650 --> 02:15:20,653
I've been invisible my whole life.

2012
02:15:21,738 --> 02:15:24,365
I guess I won't be anymore, will 1?

2013
02:15:25,908 --> 02:15:28,328
They'll remember me now.

2014
02:15:28,411 --> 02:15:30,246
They'll remember both of us.

2015
02:15:40,632 --> 02:15:42,592
Bruce...

2016
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:47,305
Wayne.

2017
02:15:49,682 --> 02:15:53,436
[slowly] Bruce...

2018
02:15:54,854 --> 02:15:57,732
Wayne.

2019
02:16:03,488 --> 02:16:04,530
[exhales deeply]

2020
02:16:08,993 --> 02:16:11,412
You know, I was there that day.

2021
02:16:13,998 --> 02:16:17,377
The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,

2022
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:19,837
made all those promises.

2023
02:16:22,298 --> 02:16:26,552
Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.

2024
02:16:27,095 --> 02:16:30,640
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.

2025
02:16:30,723 --> 02:16:34,394
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

2026
02:16:34,977 --> 02:16:36,521
Orphan.

2027
02:16:42,193 --> 02:16:47,323
Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.

2028
02:16:48,616 --> 02:16:53,246
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.

2029
02:16:53,913 --> 02:16:55,456
Don't you tell me.

2030
02:16:58,084 --> 02:17:00,753
Do you know what being an orphan is?

2031
02:17:01,129 --> 02:17:03,715
It's 30 kids to a room.

2032
02:17:05,007 --> 02:17:09,053
Twelve years old and already a drop head,
numbing the pain.

2033
02:17:10,763 --> 02:17:15,435
You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.

2034
02:17:16,602 --> 02:17:19,772
And every winter one of the babies die

2035
02:17:19,856 --> 02:17:22,150
because it's so cold.

2036
02:17:23,443 --> 02:17:26,028
But oh, no.

2037
02:17:27,321 --> 02:17:28,573
[smacks lips]

2038
02:17:28,948 --> 02:17:32,118
Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy

2039
02:17:32,201 --> 02:17:35,121
because at least the money
makes it go down easy.

2040
02:17:35,204 --> 02:17:36,205
Doesn't it?

2041
02:17:37,665 --> 02:17:39,709
Bruce...

2042
02:17:40,752 --> 02:17:42,670
Wayne.

2043
02:17:46,340 --> 02:17:49,427
He's the only one we didn't get.

2044
02:17:52,847 --> 02:17:55,975
But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?

2045
02:17:57,435 --> 02:18:01,314
All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.

2046
02:18:04,484 --> 02:18:05,651
God.

2047
02:18:06,652 --> 02:18:07,945
Look at you.

2048
02:18:09,614 --> 02:18:12,074
Your mask is amazing.

2049
02:18:12,158 --> 02:18:15,077
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

2050
02:18:15,161 --> 02:18:16,245
Ain't it funny?

2051
02:18:16,329 --> 02:18:20,750
All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.

2052
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:24,253
You and I both know

2053
02:18:25,213 --> 02:18:27,715
I'm looking at the real you right now.

2054
02:18:27,799 --> 02:18:31,427
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

2055
02:18:31,511 --> 02:18:33,054
No shame,

2056
02:18:33,971 --> 02:18:34,972
no limits.

2057
02:18:35,056 --> 02:18:36,724
Why did you write me?

2058
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:38,601
What do you mean?

2059
02:18:38,684 --> 02:18:40,394
All those cards.

2060
02:18:40,478 --> 02:18:41,687
I told you,

2061
02:18:42,396 --> 02:18:44,315
we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.

2062
02:18:44,398 --> 02:18:46,609
-We didn't do anything together.
-We did.

2063
02:18:46,692 --> 02:18:48,152
What did we just do?

2064
02:18:48,236 --> 02:18:50,238
I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.

2065
02:18:50,321 --> 02:18:51,489
We're such a good team.

2066
02:18:51,572 --> 02:18:52,573
We're not a team.

2067
02:18:52,657 --> 02:18:55,159
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

2068
02:18:55,243 --> 02:18:57,662
I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.

2069
02:18:57,745 --> 02:19:00,915
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.

2070
02:19:00,998 --> 02:19:02,625
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

2071
02:19:02,708 --> 02:19:03,918
You gave me that.

2072
02:19:04,001 --> 02:19:05,127
I gave you nothing.

2073
02:19:05,211 --> 02:19:07,797
You showed me what was possible.

2074
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:12,760
You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.

2075
02:19:12,844 --> 02:19:14,387
You inspired me.

2076
02:19:14,470 --> 02:19:15,972
You're out of your goddamn mind.

2077
02:19:17,098 --> 02:19:18,182
What?

2078
02:19:18,266 --> 02:19:20,434
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.

2079
02:19:20,518 --> 02:19:21,894
How can you say that?

2080
02:19:21,978 --> 02:19:23,479
You think you'll be remembered?

2081
02:19:23,563 --> 02:19:25,231
You're a pathetic psychopath,

2082
02:19:25,731 --> 02:19:27,483
-begging for attention.
-No.

2083
02:19:27,567 --> 02:19:29,235
-You're gonna die alone in Arkham.
-No.

2084
02:19:29,318 --> 02:19:30,361
No, no!

2085
02:19:30,444 --> 02:19:31,362
A nobody!

2086
02:19:33,155 --> 02:19:34,949
No!

2087
02:19:36,868 --> 02:19:39,245
Ahhh!

2088
02:19:39,495 --> 02:19:42,081
This is not how this was supposed to go!

2089
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:46,669
Ahhh!

2090
02:19:46,752 --> 02:19:49,380
I had it all planned out!

2091
02:19:50,381 --> 02:19:52,383
We were gonna be safe here.

2092
02:19:52,758 --> 02:19:56,053
We could watch the whole thing together.

2093
02:19:56,137 --> 02:19:57,138
Watch what?

2094
02:19:57,221 --> 02:19:58,973
Everything!

2095
02:20:00,725 --> 02:20:02,143
[tense music playing]

2096
02:20:07,315 --> 02:20:08,983
It was all there.

2097
02:20:11,152 --> 02:20:13,487
You mean, you didn't figure it out?

2098
02:20:14,655 --> 02:20:15,865
[Riddler gasps slowly]

2099
02:20:17,783 --> 02:20:21,704
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.

2100
02:20:23,748 --> 02:20:25,833
I guess I gave you too much credit.

2101
02:20:26,292 --> 02:20:27,543
What have you done?

2102
02:20:28,252 --> 02:20:33,132
What's black and blue and dead all over?

2103
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:37,803
You.

If you think you can stop
what's coming...

2105
02:20:42,934 --> 02:20:44,477
What have you done?

2106
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:51,859

What are you doing in here?

2116
02:22:06,142 --> 02:22:08,728
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

[Riddler] Hey, guys.

2130
02:23:44,365 --> 02:23:46,575
Uh, thanks for all the comments

2131
02:23:46,659 --> 02:23:49,620
and a special thanks to everyone
for the tips on detonators.

2132
02:23:49,703 --> 02:23:50,704
Detonators?

2133
02:23:50,788 --> 02:23:55,835
I just want to say this will be my last
post for a little while, and, uh...

2134
02:23:58,087 --> 02:24:00,172
what this community has meant to me

2135
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:03,259
these weeks, these months,

2136
02:24:04,176 --> 02:24:06,595
let's just say none of us...

2137
02:24:08,305 --> 02:24:10,432
is alone anymore. Okay?

2138
02:24:11,142 --> 02:24:12,226
Jesus.

Tomorrow's Election Day.

[laughing]

2143
02:24:21,861 --> 02:24:24,488
And Bella Real will win.

2144
02:24:24,572 --> 02:24:27,199
She promised real change.

2145
02:24:27,908 --> 02:24:30,286
But we know the truth, don't we?

2146
02:24:30,369 --> 02:24:32,454
You've seen Gotham's true face now.

2147
02:24:32,538 --> 02:24:34,415
Together, we've unmasked it.

2148
02:24:34,498 --> 02:24:37,459
Its corruption, its perversion

2149
02:24:37,543 --> 02:24:41,380
masquerading under the guise of renewal.

2150
02:24:41,463 --> 02:24:45,301
But unmasking is not enough.

2151
02:24:47,511 --> 02:24:51,515
The day of judgment is finally upon us.

2152
02:24:51,599 --> 02:24:53,976
[in playful tone] And now it is time

2153
02:24:55,060 --> 02:24:57,438
for retribution.

2154
02:24:57,521 --> 02:25:00,316
I've parked seven vans

2155
02:25:00,608 --> 02:25:02,943
all along the city seawall.

2156
02:25:04,153 --> 02:25:06,030
And on the big night,

2157
02:25:06,113 --> 02:25:08,365
[whispers] they will go boom.

2158
02:25:12,119 --> 02:25:13,829

-[inaudible] Boom!

2162
02:25:33,265 --> 02:25:35,517
When the vans blow,

2163
02:25:35,601 --> 02:25:41,232
the flooding will happen so fast,
evacuation will not be an option.

2164
02:25:41,565 --> 02:25:44,526
Those who are not washed away

2165
02:25:44,610 --> 02:25:47,613
will race through the streets in terror.

2166

...celebrations will turn to panic,

[sirens wailing]

And that's where all of you come in.

2174
02:26:16,016 --> 02:26:19,311
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

2175
02:26:19,395 --> 02:26:21,563
The pigs will have me in their custody,

2176
02:26:21,647 --> 02:26:23,691
but that's okay.

2177
02:26:23,774 --> 02:26:28,279
Because then it will be your turn.

2178
02:26:28,362 --> 02:26:32,241
You'll be there, waiting.

2179

[dramatic music playing]

2180
02:26:43,294 --> 02:26:46,213
It's time for the lies to finally end.

2181
02:26:46,297 --> 02:26:50,426
[dramatically]
False promises of renewal?

2182
02:26:50,509 --> 02:26:51,593
Change?

2183
02:26:52,011 --> 02:26:55,806
We'll give them real, real change now.

2184
02:26:55,889 --> 02:27:00,894
We've spent our lives in this
wretched place, [shouts] suffering!

2185
02:27:01,353 --> 02:27:03,856
Wondering, "Why us?"

2186
02:27:03,939 --> 02:27:07,067
Now they will spend
their last moments wondering,

2187
02:27:07,151 --> 02:27:09,320
[screams] why them?

2188
02:27:09,403 --> 02:27:11,447

I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

2193
02:27:24,501 --> 02:27:26,462
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

We got an active situation.

2202
02:27:42,728 --> 02:27:44,021
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

2203
02:27:44,104 --> 02:27:45,314
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

[man] Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

[Bella] I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
SO we can get everyone in.

It's not safe for you here.

with this city.
