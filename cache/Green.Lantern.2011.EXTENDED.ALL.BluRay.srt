Billions of years ago...

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,039
...a race of immortals harnessed
the most powerful force in existence:

3

The emerald energy of willpower.

4
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,253
These immortals,
the Guardians of the Universe...

5
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,798
...built a world from where they could
watch over all of existence:

The planet Oa.

7
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:57,431
They divided the universe
into 3600 sectors.

8
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:03,103
A ring powered by the energy of will
was sent to every sector to select a recruit.

9
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:08,650
In order to be chosen by the ring,
it was said one must be without fear.

10
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,779
Together, these 3600 recruits...

11
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:17,910
...formed the intergalactic peacekeepers
known as the Green Lantern Corps.

Of all the threats the Corps ever faced...

...the gravest was an entity of fear
known as Parallax.

Only the legendary Green Lantern
Abin Sur...

...was capable of capturing
and imprisoning this beast...

was too unpredictable.

The chance of corruption too great.

could be mastered.

813

...Abin Sur was charged with
imprisoning Parallax in the Lost Sector.

814

But he escaped.

815
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,320

he grew larger, more powerful.

816

And is now headed here...

...to take his revenge on you
and destroy the Corps.
