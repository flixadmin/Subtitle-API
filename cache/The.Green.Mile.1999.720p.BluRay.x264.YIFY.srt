1
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,076
Katie!

2
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,245
Cora!

3
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,038
You love your sister?

4
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,791
You make any noise,
you know what happens.

5
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,755
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,634
- How am I looking, Paul?
- That's better. That's better.

7
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,527
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

8
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,987
Some Danish this morning?

9
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,407
No, just two pieces of dry toast,
Hector. Thanks.

10
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,950
Leftover's fine.

11
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,621
- Dry and cold, same as always.
- Cold is better.

12
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,122
Hmm.

13
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,124
Especially on those long walks.

14
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,752
Am I right?

15
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,798
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

16
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,092
We're not supposed to let you
wander off.

17
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:46,308
Where do you go every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

18
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,393
Just walk.

19
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,562
I like to walk.

20
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,067
You try not to fall
down, bust a hip.

21
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,362
I don't wanna be in
no damn search party.

22
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,058
You want this man
constantly in your life?

23
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,227
Explain the moral basis of that.

24
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,520
I've made mistakes.

25
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,939
Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.

26
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,985
She can't ask nothing. You can't
ask nothing. I have six kids myself.

27
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,697
Why do we always
watch this stuff?

28
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,907
It's interesting.

29
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:31,288
Interesting?
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

30
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,082
All they ever talk
about is fucking.

31
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,084
Ain't no way in this green earth...

32
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,586
...I'd have a father like that.

33
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:42,466
If what you saying is true...
No, I'm talking now. I'm talking now.

34
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,051
What kind of a mother are you?

35
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,761
One that causes people more...

36
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,347
Is going to let you try the bodystrider...

37
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,265
You're dead!
You can't come back!

38
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,769
It's back.
The Popeil Pocket Fisherman.

39
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,854
Take my husband, take my kids...

40
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,024
- Are you all right?
- Hmm?

41
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,693
You look tired.
You're not yourself.

42
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,571
No, I'm fine. I promise.

43
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,658
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day, I think.

44
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,786
Not that you asked me.

45
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,955
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

46
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,293
I had a few bad dreams.
It happens.

47
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,128
I'll be fine.

48
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,306
If Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.

49
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,641
Neither do I.

50
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,477
Now, this here is worth a look.

Paul, what is it?

63
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,194
My God.

64
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,743
I've got to get out of here.

65
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,227
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you...

66
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,522
...whether you want it to or not.
It's silly.

67
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,234
Was it the film?
It was, wasn't it?

68
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,907
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

69
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,533
Over 60 years.

70
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,536
Paul, I'm your friend.

71
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,836
I ever tell you that I was a prison guard
during the Depression?

72
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,922
You've mentioned it.

73
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,258
Did I mention that I was
in charge of death row?

74
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,719
That I supervised
all the executions?

75
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,811
Usually, death row is called
"The Last Mile."

76
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,606
We called ours
"The Green Mile."

77
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,360
The floor was the color
of faded limes.

78
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,863
We had the electric chair.

79
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,115
"Old Sparky,"
we called it.

80
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,329
Oh, I've lived a lot of years,
Ellie...

81
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,959
...but 1935, that
takes the prize.

82
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,128
That year, I had...

83
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,549
...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

84
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,677
It was...

85
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,972
It was also the year of...

86
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,683
...John Coffey...

87
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,270
...and the two dead girls.

88
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,076
All right, now, hold on!

89
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,207
Up on the tower!

90
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,709
New prisoner's coming in!

91
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,837
You men down in the yard,
step off the fence! Clear that gate!

92
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,888
Put me through to E Block.

93
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,278
E Block.

94
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,072
Yeah.

95
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,740
Right.

96
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,338
Oh.

97
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,180
Paul? Prisoner.

98
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,973
Christ, give me a minute.

99
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,772
You all right in there?

100
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:38,363
For a man pissing razorblades, yeah.
Ahh...

101
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,295
You should've took the day off
to see the doctor.

102
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,215
With a new arrival?
You know better.

103
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,300
Besides...

104
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,304
...it's not as bad as it was.
I think it's clearing up.

105
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,268
- All right. Let's look alive, Dean.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,860
Damn.

107
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,155
They're riding on the axle.

108
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,207
What'd they do?

109
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,209
They bust the springs?

110
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,758
Ho...

111
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,511
Dead man!

112
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,972
Dead man walking!

113
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,684
- Who...?
- We got a dead man walking here!

114
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,021
Jesus, please us,
what is he yelling about?

115
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,525
Paul...

116
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,154
...you might reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

117
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,781
He's enormous.

118
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,949
Can't be bigger than you.

119
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,753
Dead man!

120
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,088
Dead man walking!

121
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,757
Dead man!

122
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,509
Dead man walking!

123
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,678
Dead man walking here!

124
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,223
Dead man!

125
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,771
We got a dead man walking here!

126
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,564
Dead man walking!

127
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,153
- We got a dead man walking here!
- Percy.

128
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,113
That's enough.

129
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,764
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

130
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,937
Can you talk?

131
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,488
Yes, sir, boss. I can talk.

132
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,624
Move your ass. Let's go.

133
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,501
Come on.

134
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,675
Percy...

135
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,928
...they're moving house
down in the infirmary.

136
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,432
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help.

137
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,809
They got all the men they need.

138
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,145
Why don't you just go
and make sure.

139
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,190
- Uh-uh.
- I don't care where you go...

140
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,651
...as long as it's not here
at this very moment.

141
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,240
All right.

142
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,336
Ow!

143
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,505
God, you bust my finger.

144
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,091
I wiped that grin off your face,
didn't I?

145
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,720
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

146
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,060
Uh-huh.

147
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,691
Fuck you, Percy.

148
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,153
We'll get that looked at, Del.
In the meantime, you stay quiet.

149
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,281
Yeah. Yeah.

150
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,496
I let Harry take those
chains off you...

151
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,331
...you gonna be nice?

152
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,016
Your name is John Coffey.

153
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,018
Yes, sir, boss.

154
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,730
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

155
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,524
Oh, you can spell, can you?

156
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,111
Just my name, boss.

157
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,239
J-O...

158
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,574
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

159
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,286
If I'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger...

160
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,581
...Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton.
These gentlemen right there.

161
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,252
Questions?

162
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,422
Do you leave the light on
after bedtime?

163
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,594
Because I get a little scared
in the dark sometime...

164
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,889
...if it's a strange place.

165
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,773
It stays pretty bright around here
all night long.

166
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,568
We always keep a few lights burning
out in the corridor.

167
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,654
The corridor?

168
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,657
Right out there.

169
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,395
You can sit.

170
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,045
I couldn't help it, boss.

171
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,715
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

172
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:22,183
Dean, take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

173
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,871
- Yes, sir.
- Of course they're broken.

174
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,728
I heard the bones crack.

175
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,731
You hear what he was yelling
when we brought the dummy in?

176
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,983
How could I miss it?
The whole prison heard.

177
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,027
Goddamn Percy.

178
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,697
You'll have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

179
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,867
I'll chew that food
when I have to.

180
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,539
Right now I wanna hear about this new
inmate. Aside from how big he is, okay?

181
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,416
Monstrous big. Damn.

182
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,627
Oh, he seems meek enough.

183
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,597
- Is he retarded, you figure?
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,715
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

185
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,219
Imbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

186
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,808
Make your blood curdle.

187
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,752
- What?! For God's sake, what?
- The girls! The girls are gone!

188
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,423
Papa! Papa, look!
There's blood.

189
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,596
Oh, my God.

190
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,855
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone
now. You tell them we headed west.

191
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,150
You mind what I'm saying!
We headed west!

192
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,777
Central! Are you on the line?

193
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:01,157
Oh, God, please.
Somebody took my little girls.

194
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,295
Katie!

195
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,839
Cora!

196
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:51,874
Jesus.

197
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:09,558
I'll kill you!

198
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,047
I couldn't help it.

199
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,677
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

200
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,100
Boy, you under
arrest for murder.

201
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,062
I interrupt?

202
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,275
Well, I'm just about done.

203
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,411
Hey...

204
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,539
...how's that pretty
gal of yours?

205
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,751
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

206
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,711
Not so well at all.

207
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,922
More headaches?

208
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,134
Got laid up
with another one yesterday.

209
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,219
Worst one yet.

210
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,891
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

211
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,644
Head x-rays
and who knows what else.

212
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,606
She is scared to death.

213
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,693
Truth to tell, so am I.

214
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,822
If it's something they can see
on the x-ray...

215
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,283
...maybe it's something
they can fix.

216
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,827
Maybe.

217
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,708
This just came in.

218
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,294
DOE on Bitterbuck.

219
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,800
You didn't come all the way down here
to hand me a DOE.

220
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:11,263
I had an angry call from
the state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

221
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,808
Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore
off the block?

222
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,309
It is.

223
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,730
Now, I'm sure you
had reason, Paul...

224
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,734
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

225
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,820
...and his name
is Percy Wetmore.

226
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,947
Little Percy calls his aunt...

227
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,659
...and squeals like
a schoolroom sissy.

228
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,373
He also mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

229
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,334
Broke three fingers
on Edouard Delacroix's left hand.

230
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,170
I didn't hear that part.
I'm sure she didn't either.

231
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,256
The man is mean and careless
and stupid...

232
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,342
...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

233
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,011
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

234
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,555
Stick with it, Paul.

235
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,515
It may not be much longer.

236
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:59,311
I have it on good authority that Percy
has an application in at Briar Ridge.

237
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,022
Briar Ridge?
The mental hospital.

238
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,566
Administration job.

239
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,276
Better pay.

240
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,735
Hmm.

241
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,988
Then why is he still here?

242
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,200
He could get that application
pushed through.

243
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,706
Hell, with his connections, he could
have any state job he wants.

244
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,167
You know what I think?

245
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,755
I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.

246
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:33,721
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Wort he?

247
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,726
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. In the meantime...

248
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,229
- ...you'll keep the peace?
- Of course.

249
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,857
Of course.

250
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,902
Thank you, Paul.

251
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,407
Hal...

252
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,452
...you give Melinda
my love, okay?

253
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:01,207
I'm sure that x-ray will turn out
to be nothing at all.

254
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,792
You bet.

255
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,238
Paul.

256
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,156
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

257
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,242
The music too loud?

258
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,914
There's just this empty spot in the bed
where my husband usually sleeps.

259
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,128
He said to tell you he's having
a little trouble with that tonight.

260
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,759
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

261
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,929
Is that what's got you up?

262
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,139
Yeah, that...

263
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,934
...and things.

264
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,478
Things.

265
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,069
We got a new inmate today.

266
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,697
Simple-minded fella.

267
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,242
Do I wanna know what he did?

268
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,953
- No.
- Mmm.

269
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,331
Things that happen
in this world.

270
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,793
It's a wonder God allows it.

271
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,049
Why don't you come to bed.

272
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:38,012
I think I have something
that'll help you sleep.

273
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,515
You can have all you want.

274
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,144
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

275
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,354
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

276
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,482
- Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?
- No.

277
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,568
Paul.

278
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,404
He'll just want me
to take sulfa tablets...

279
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,073
...and I'll spend the week
puking in my office.

280
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,369
It will run its course all by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

281
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,707
Poor old guy.

282
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,502
Oh.

283
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,724
Paul. Dean.

284
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,438
Yeah?

285
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,190
Come here. Go on.

286
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,237
I guess the legislature
loosened up the purse strings enough...

287
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,906
...to hire on a new guard.

288
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,874
Look again.

289
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,584
He's right...

290
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,294
...there.

291
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,056
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people.

292
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,142
- Maybe it's rabid.
- Oh, my Christ.

293
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,145
- Yeah, it could be.
- Oh, the big mouse expert.

294
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,523
The Mouse Man.

295
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,651
You see him foaming at the mouth,
Mouse Man?

296
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,070
I don't see its mouth at all.

297
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:31,500
- Brutal, no. We'll be hip-deep in mice.
- I just wanna see what he'll do.

298
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,086
In the interest
of science, like.

299
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,503
He's in the damn restraint room.

300
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,173
And you just know he's chewing
the padding out of the walls...

301
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,341
...making himself a
nice little nest.

302
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,182
All right.

303
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,018
Let's go get the damn mouse.

304
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,323
Boss.

305
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,325
Saw me a mouse go by.

306
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,702
Can't put anything over on you.

307
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,842
Just watch your toes.
Watch your toes.

308
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,904
You let him get past you.

309
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,532
No, I did not.
I been here all the time.

310
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,575
Then where the hell is he?

311
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,244
Well, I don't know.

312
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,581
Three grown men...

313
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,918
...outsmarted by a mouse.

314
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:45,259
Well, bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

315
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,761
Yeah, yeah.

316
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,764
Yeah, that's the last
we'll see of him.

317
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,818
You little son of a bitch.

318
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,322
Well, I'll be damned.

319
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,410
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

320
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,330
- That's a goddamn mouse.
- Yeah.

321
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,500
Brute said he was in here last night...

322
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,294
...begging for food.

323
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,963
He come right on up to the desk.

324
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,925
- Give him some room, Percy.
- Huh?

325
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,344
- See what he does.
- All right.

326
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:25,192
He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

327
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,180
Goddamn!

328
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,767
You little scurvy! Damn!

329
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,937
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?!

330
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,231
I'm gonna kill you!

331
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,069
- I'm gonna take you out!
- Percy! Percy!

332
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,739
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

333
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,950
It's just a little
mouse, dumb merde.

334
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,910
You ugly little piece of sh...

335
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,788
- Are you listening to me?
- Fuck!

336
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,750
- Percy!
- I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

337
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,377
...you little piece of shit!

338
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:30,424
- Get on out of there!
- I want you to stop this!

339
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,468
- Hey, boss!
- What's going on?

340
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,650
Percy met your mouse.

341
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:55,532
It's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

342
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,328
Percy, we already tried that.

343
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,540
Huh?

344
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,292
What'd you say?

345
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,960
I said that we...

346
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,967
Knock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

347
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,887
Oh, yeah.

348
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,151
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

349
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,488
Don't that beat the mousy band?

350
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,700
Percy...

351
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,662
...you wanna think about
what you were doing?

352
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,500
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

353
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:50,170
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

354
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,005
...not to mention the inmates.

355
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,590
So what?

356
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,344
They aren't in cradle school,
in case you didn't notice.

357
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,971
Although you treat
them that way.

358
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,350
We don't scare them
any more than we have to, Percy.

359
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,479
- They're under enough strain as it is.
- Men under strain can snap.

360
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,191
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

361
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,610
...talking...

362
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,862
...not yelling.

363
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,991
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward.

364
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,703
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

365
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,580
That's all.

366
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,667
Anybody doesn't like it?
Hmm?

367
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,086
You can kiss my ass.

368
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,172
Don't. Yeah, you try it.
Go on.

369
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,051
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

370
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,886
Okay, Brutal.

371
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,609
We all know who
your connections are.

372
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:59,239
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

373
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,032
Job be damned.

374
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,078
You done?

375
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:12,335
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

376
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,942
Arlen...

377
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,445
...your daughter and her family
are here.

378
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,955
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

379
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,461
Sitting down, sitting down!

380
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,338
Rehearsing now.
Everybody settle!

381
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,465
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

382
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,302
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

383
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,805
- Is his head properly shaved?
- Nope. It's all dandruffy, and it smells.

384
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,017
I will take that as a yes.
Let's go, Arlen.

385
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,896
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

386
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:17,442
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

387
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,985
...walking the Mile.

388
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,239
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

389
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,158
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

390
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:29,829
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people I've tramped on.

391
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,499
And I hope they forgive me...

392
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,502
...and I'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

393
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,547
Paul, we're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

394
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,716
...hollering and shaking his dick,
are we?

395
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,511
- Well, actually...
- Still praying, still praying.

396
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,515
- Getting right with Jesus.
- Do it quietly! You old gink!

397
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,769
As I was saying, I don't believe
they actually shake their dicks.

398
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,481
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

399
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,193
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked-up.

400
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,280
On your feet. Come on, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

401
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,241
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

402
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,786
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

403
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,871
Walking the Mile.

404
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,790
Walking in the Mile.

405
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,710
Sitting down now.

406
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,755
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

407
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,215
What do I do?

408
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,553
- Watch and learn.
- Watch and learn.

409
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,268
Getting strapped.

410
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,062
Getting clamped.

411
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,399
Getting wired.

412
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,569
All right.

413
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,905
Getting all electrode.

414
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,704
Roll on one.

415
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,583
"Roll on one" means I turn
the generator up full.

416
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,960
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

417
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,920
Arlen Bitterbuck...

418
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,757
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

419
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,135
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

420
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,138
You've anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

421
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,806
Yeah.

422
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:16,936
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and I want to shit in your hat.

423
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:22,484
I got to have Mae West sit on my face
because I'm one horny motherfucker.

424
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,156
You bastard.

425
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,784
That's a good one.

426
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,369
Quiet.

427
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,912
Quiet! Shut up!

428
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,623
- Shut up!
- Sorry, boss.

429
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,960
Toot, one more remark like that,
I'll have Van Hay roll on two for real.

430
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,671
And I'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

431
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,840
It was pretty funny.

432
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,635
That's why I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

433
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:53,431
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

434
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,725
Ever try not to
laugh in church...

435
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,269
...when something funny gets stuck
in your head?

436
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,189
I'm sorry, Paul.
You're right.

437
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,024
Let's keep going.

438
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,609
Harry.

439
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,615
Soak the sponge.

440
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,870
Putting on the black hood.

441
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,375
And putting on my cap.

442
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,627
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

443
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,797
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

444
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:30,009
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

445
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,764
Hush up there, Toot.

446
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,686
Getting screwed.

447
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,564
I'm getting the cap.

448
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,194
Arlen Bitterbuck...

449
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,781
...electricity shall be passed through
your body until you are dead...

450
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,242
...in accordance with state law.

451
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,036
God have mercy on your soul.

452
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,789
Amen.

453
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,334
Roll on two.

454
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,882
And that's that.

455
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,221
I'm frying! I'm frying!

456
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,059
I'm a done tom turkey!

457
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,606
This is a shocking experience!

458
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,401
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

459
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,119
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

460
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,747
Get that idiot out of the chair.

461
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:45,478
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

462
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,983
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

463
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,360
...and live there forever?

464
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,823
Could that be what heaven's like?

465
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,827
I just about believe
that very thing.

466
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,582
Hmm.

467
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,169
Had me a young wife
when I was 18.

468
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,508
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

469
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,304
And she'd lie there after...

470
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,599
...bare-breasted
in the firelight.

471
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,061
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

472
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,609
That was my best time.

473
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,297
It'll be fine.

474
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,216
You'll do fine.

475
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,545
Arlen Bitterbuck...

476
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,048
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body...

477
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:41,302
...until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

478
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,930
God have mercy on your soul.

479
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,826
Roll on two.

480
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,164
Again.

481
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,046
Adios, chief.

482
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,010
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

483
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,765
He's paid what he owed.

484
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,476
He's square with
the house again...

485
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,353
...so keep your goddamn hands
off him.

486
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,375
What's up his ass?

487
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,877
You.

488
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,464
Always. You, Percy.

489
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,218
You gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

490
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,515
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

491
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,893
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

492
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,688
Sounds to me like a
pretty good job.

493
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,527
I might just take it too,
soon as you put me out front.

494
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,071
Yeah, you heard me.

495
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,282
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

496
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:16,123
Seeing a man die, that's not enough.
You gotta smell his nuts cook.

497
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,751
I just wanna be out
front, is all.

498
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,046
Come on. One time.

499
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,757
And then you know what?

500
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,885
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

501
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,929
And if I say no?

502
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,600
Well, I might just stick around
for good.

503
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,311
Make me a career of this...

504
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,939
...boss.

505
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,994
You are not gonna believe this.

506
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,880
Look.

507
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,009
I done tame me that mouse.

508
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,386
We see that.

509
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:57,433
Ooh, ooh. Watch this.
Watch what he do.

510
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,442
Ain't he something, now?

511
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,654
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

512
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,031
- Mr. Jingles?
- That his name.

513
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,575
He whispered in my ear.

514
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,202
Hey, captain...

515
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:20,039
...could I have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

516
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,917
Your English gets better
when you want something.

517
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,044
Wanna see what else he can do?

518
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,047
Watch, watch.

519
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,258
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle,
wanna play fetch?

520
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,551
Wanna play fetch?

521
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,180
Play fetch. Watch, watch.

522
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,911
He fetch it every time.
Every time.

523
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:03,749
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or something.

524
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,130
Correct. That just what he is too.
He's a circus mouse.

525
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,382
When I get out,
he'll make me rich.

526
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,093
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

527
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,595
Play fetch?
We play fetch again?

528
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,098
Well, well, well.

529
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,767
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend.

530
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,769
Don't hurt him.

531
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,773
- Okay?
- Is that the one I chased?

532
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,817
Yeah, that's the one.

533
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,612
Only Del says his name is
Mr. Jingles.

534
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,740
Is that so?

535
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,617
Del's been asking for a box.

536
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,247
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it,
I guess. Might keep it for a pet.

537
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,917
What do you think?

538
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,964
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box...

539
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:57,094
...and get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

540
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,221
Yeah.

541
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,475
Yeah. That should do real nice.

542
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,320
Man said get a cigar box.

543
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,372
Morning.

544
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,254
Hal, you wanted to see me?

545
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,839
Yeah.

546
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,883
Close the door.

547
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,558
So you know...

548
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,896
...you got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

549
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,690
"William Wharton."

550
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,068
He's what you call...

551
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,362
...a problem child.

552
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,908
Got "Billy the Kid" tattooed
on his left arm.

553
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:05,204
Been rambling all over the state
last few years...

554
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,832
...causing all kinds of trouble.

555
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,543
Finally hit the big time.

556
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,214
Killed three people in a holdup.

557
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,550
One of them a pregnant woman.

558
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,054
Bad news all around.

559
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,558
Hal?

560
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,736
It's a tumor, Paul.

561
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,157
A brain tumor.

562
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,577
They got...

563
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,996
...x-ray pictures of it.

564
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,916
It's the size of a
lemon, they said.

565
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,920
And...

566
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,590
...way down...

567
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,635
...deep inside,
where they can't operate.

568
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,347
I haven't told her.

569
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,101
I can't think how.

570
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,982
For the life of me, Paul...

571
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,486
...I can't think how
to tell my wife...

572
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,950
...she's going to die.

573
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,594
Oh.

574
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,475
Aah.

575
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,270
Aah!

576
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,448
Oh!

577
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:53,914
Oh, God.

578
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,211
I'm going.

579
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:03,382
- What?
- To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

580
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,217
Today.

581
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,637
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

582
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,306
That bad?

583
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,141
Oh, yeah.

584
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,415
The boy is doped to the gills.

585
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,251
Hmm?

586
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,627
Hand me them clothes.

587
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,591
William Wharton?

588
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,219
Hey! You put on these clothes now,
you hear?

589
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,438
We're gonna have to do this.

590
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,274
Hellraiser, huh?

591
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,027
Look more like a
limp noodle to me.

592
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,280
Hey. Hey.

593
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:12,743
You've been declared competent, son.
You know what that means?

594
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,163
Means you're gonna ride the lightning.
Yeah.

595
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,917
Percy, could you shut up,
give us a hand here?

596
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,461
Hellraiser.

597
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,952
You don't look so good.

598
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,872
Look like you're
running you a fever.

599
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,255
Boss Edgecomb?

600
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,675
I needs to see you
down here, boss.

601
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,764
I got things to tend to just now,
John Coffey. You just...

602
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:20,602
You just stay still in your cell.

603
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,407
E Block.

604
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,153
Come on, let's go.

605
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,490
Come on.
Look alive, big boy.

606
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,422
Careful.

607
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,095
- Careful.
- Step up. Step up.

608
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,924
Where you going?
Where you going?

609
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,137
Ain't this a party now?

610
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,639
- Is it or what?
- Let him go.

611
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,474
- Shoot him.
- See who you hit.

612
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,643
- Shoot the son of a bitch.
- Shoot me!

613
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,146
- Shoot him!
- Hit him, Percy! Goddamn it! Hit him.

614
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,815
Hit me, you limp noodle.

615
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,317
Hit him, Percy!
Goddamn it, hit him!

616
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,487
- Come on, Percy. Hit me.
- Wharton, I'm warning you.

617
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,532
- You warning me? Warn me now.
- I'm warning you!

618
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,784
- You're warning me?!
- Shoot him!

619
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,327
Well, come on...

620
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,836
You're a big fucker.

621
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,629
Where'd you come from?

622
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,726
Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

623
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,519
All right. Now, just breathe.

624
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,188
That's it. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

625
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,775
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

626
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,987
- Didn't see it coming.
- Come on, boy, breathe.

627
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,197
Come on. Just breathe.

628
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,202
We thought he was doped.

629
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,707
Didn't we? Didn't we, all of us,
think he was doped?

630
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,667
You didn't ask?

631
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,879
Well, I guess that's not a mistake...

632
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:37,424
...you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

633
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:55,108
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

634
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:59,071
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

635
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,865
Say the situations’ under control.
It's not a story.

636
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,743
He won't appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

637
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,162
What about you?
You're about to collapse.

638
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,749
I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

639
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,460
Go on, now. Go.

640
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,262
Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

641
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:53,291
Boss, I needs to see you down here.

642
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,090
This is not a good
time, John Coffey...

643
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,259
...not a good time at all.

644
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:06,596
But I needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

645
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:29,953
Closer.

646
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,539
Boss, you know you ain't
supposed to do that.

647
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,168
Mind your business, Del.

648
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,846
What do you want, John Coffey?

649
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,015
Just to help it.

650
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,103
Don't be afraid.

651
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:56,688
Help!

652
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:00,317
Help! John Coffey's
killing Boss Edgecomb!

653
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,027
Help!

654
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,447
- What are you doing?
- Help!

655
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,868
Boss Howell! Help!

656
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,329
Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

657
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,623
Help!

658
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,424
Aah!

659
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,266
Help! Boss Howell!
Boss Stanton!

660
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,436
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

661
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,272
Del, for chrissakes, shut up!

662
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,113
What did you just do to me?

663
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,783
I helped it.

664
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,452
Didn't I help it?

665
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,789
I just took it back, is all.

666
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:41,084
Awful tired now, boss.

667
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,295
Dog-tired.

668
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,488
Boss, what that man do to you?

669
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,280
Ahh.

670
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,720
Hey, honey.
How you feeling?

671
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:20,266
Oh, not too bad.

672
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,269
What did the doctor say?

673
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,232
Oh, you know doctors.

674
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,567
Gobbledygook, mostly.

675
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,070
Gobbledygook.

676
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:48,920
Having stew tonight.

677
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,932
What are you doing?

678
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,482
What does it feel like?

679
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,777
Well, I know what it feels like.

680
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,324
It feels great.

681
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,652
- Paul.
- Yeah?

682
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,822
- Not that I'm complaining...
- Uh-huh.

683
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,702
...but we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 19.

684
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:05,330
- Yeah, we did, at your mom's.
- Mm-hmm.

685
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,833
Wanna tell me what's going on?

686
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,005
Well...

687
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,300
...see, the thing is...

688
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:22,055
...I never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

689
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:28,019
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

690
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:32,690
I'm thinking of taking the morning
off sick. You cover the fort for me?

691
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,027
That's swell. Thanks.

692
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,863
Yeah, no, I'm sure
I'll feel better.

693
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,699
Okay. Okay.

694
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,040
You're sure you
ought to do this?

695
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:52,877
I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

696
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:12,730
Burt, you got some company.

697
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,983
Can I offer you a cold drink?

698
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,319
Oh, yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

699
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,739
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home.

700
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,616
Hope I'm not troubling you.

701
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,411
Well, that depends, Mr...?

702
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:30,623
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

703
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,209
The Green Mile.

704
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:36,546
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

705
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,924
I'd like to ask you
about one of them.

706
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,178
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

707
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,684
Which client?

708
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,938
Now you got my
curiosity aroused.

709
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,524
- John Coffey.
- Ah.

710
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,109
Coffey.

711
01:09:58,277 --> 01:09:59,485
He causing you problems?

712
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:03,531
No. Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

713
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,617
...but other than that...

714
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:09,078
He cries, does he?
Well, got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

715
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,830
You know what he did.

716
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:13,541
I read the court transcript.

717
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,212
- Thank you, missus.
- My pleasure.

718
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:21,382
Kids! Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

719
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:22,926
Coming, Mama!

720
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,262
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

721
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:29,182
I've wondered if he did anything
like that before.

722
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,644
Why? Has he said anything?

723
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,980
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

724
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:40,109
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

725
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,197
...that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail. Find out.

726
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:48,785
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

727
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,996
You'd think so,
but you'd be wrong.

728
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,332
Believe me, we tried.

729
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,335
Like he'd dropped
out of the sky.

730
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,587
How can that be?

731
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:04,008
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

732
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:08,263
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

733
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:11,641
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

734
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,727
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

735
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:17,188
He is...

736
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,565
...strange, I admit.

737
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:24,237
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

738
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:27,115
I know violent men,
Mr. Hammersmith.

739
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,201
I deal with them day
in and day out.

740
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,663
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

741
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,791
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

742
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,877
Do you?

743
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,256
One seldom sees
a less ambiguous case.

744
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,550
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

745
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,552
And yet you defended him.

746
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,139
Everyone is entitled
to a defense.

747
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,182
Kids! Lunch!

748
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,684
Y'all listen to your mama!

749
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,898
I'll tell you something.

750
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:05,570
And you listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

751
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,113
I'm listening.

752
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,491
We had us a dog.

753
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,702
Just a sweet mongrel.

754
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:14,412
You know the kind.

755
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:19,208
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

756
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:21,836
You get to know it.

757
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:26,424
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

758
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:30,136
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

759
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:35,767
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

760
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,062
My wife and I were not so lucky.

761
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,565
Caleb, come here for a second.

762
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,151
Come here.

763
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,862
Please, son.

764
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,949
He still has the one good eye.

765
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:55,578
I suppose he's lucky...

766
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,122
...not to be completely blind.

767
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:04,629
We get down on our knees
and thank God for that much at least.

768
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,672
Right, Caleb?

769
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,468
Okay, go on in now.

770
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,808
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

771
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:19,644
Just got it in his mind one day.

772
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,854
The same with John Coffey.

773
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:26,317
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

774
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,820
But those little girls...

775
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,489
...stayed raped and murdered.

776
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:34,158
Maybe he'd never done it before.

777
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,079
My dog never bit before.

778
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,542
But I didn't concern
myself with that.

779
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:47,505
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

780
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,049
Is Coffey guilty?

781
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:54,720
Yes, he is.

782
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:57,014
Don't you doubt it.

783
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:59,851
And don't you turn
your back on him.

784
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:04,856
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

785
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,358
...but in the end...

786
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,820
...you'll get bit.

787
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,918
Oh, me! Oh, my!

788
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:31,215
John. John.

789
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:35,011
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

790
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,346
It's from my missus.

791
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:43,394
She wanted to thank you.

792
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:46,189
Thank me for what?

793
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:47,899
Well, you know.

794
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:52,028
For helping me.

795
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,280
Helping you with what?

796
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,115
You know.

797
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,661
Oh.

798
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,624
Was your missus pleased?

799
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,127
Several times.

800
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:27,146
Oh, John, I can smell that
from over here. I surely can.

801
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:32,318
Can I give Del and
Mr. Jingles some?

802
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:36,489
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

803
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,037
Here. This for Del and
Mr. Jingles.

804
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,458
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't I?

805
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,672
It's yours, John. As you please.

806
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:55,967
I think I'll just
keep the rest, then.

807
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,016
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

808
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:09,063
Oh, John, that's so
very fine of you.

809
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:11,899
I thank you.
Mr. Jingle thank you.

810
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,943
My mama would thank you too,
but she dead.

811
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,778
Welcome.

812
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:21,325
Hey! What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

813
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,872
Ooh, here come the boss man.

814
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:30,209
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

815
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,681
You get that one for free.

816
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,309
But that's the last one.

817
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:50,021
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

818
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,899
I guess I'm gonna have
to pay you out for the rest.

819
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:08,080
Yee-haw!

820
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:10,166
Good shot, weren't it?

821
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:13,669
The look on your face!

822
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,592
Do you believe this?

823
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,053
That son of a bitch
pissed on me.

824
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:23,929
Did y'all like that?

825
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:27,224
I'm currently cooking up some turds
to go with it.

826
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,060
Nice soft ones.

827
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,480
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

828
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,026
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

829
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,402
Oh, yeah.

830
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:42,239
Hey! Hey!
Be careful with that. That's fragile.

831
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:46,911
Hey. Hey! What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

832
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,246
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

833
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:53,626
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

834
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,016
You can come in here
on your legs...

835
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,602
...but you'll go
out on your backs.

836
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:15,064
Billy the Kid gonna
guarantee you that.

837
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,776
Come on, fuck-stick.
No sneaking up on me this time.

838
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,945
We'll go man-to-man.

839
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:25,491
Piss on me?

840
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:54,770
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

841
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:59,316
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

842
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:01,569
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

843
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:04,697
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

844
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,491
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

845
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:11,996
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

846
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:15,791
Thank you, Wild Bill.

847
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:26,719
Not in there. Not in there.
I'll be good.

848
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,513
Honest injun, I will. I will.

849
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:38,314
- Christ, he's pitching a fit.
- He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on this.

850
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:39,690
One, two, three.

851
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,319
Hey. Hey!

852
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,617
Hey, fellers.

853
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:52,495
Hey, it's not funny.

854
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,876
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

855
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,670
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

856
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:11,722
I learned my lesson.

857
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:13,516
I'll be good.

858
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,403
Psst.

859
01:20:26,571 --> 01:20:27,613
Hey, Toot.

860
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,784
Give you a nickel
for that Moon Pie.

861
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:10,322
Ooh, ooh.

862
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:12,741
Little Black Sambo!

863
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:17,621
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

864
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,250
Hope your bags are packed.

865
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,627
My bags are packed!
I'm ready to go!

866
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,796
Where are we going? Let's go!

867
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,674
No! No! No!

868
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:38,976
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

869
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:43,314
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original. Gotta give him that.

870
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:46,817
Oh, yeah.

871
01:22:01,374 --> 01:22:05,044
Del, grab up your things.
It's a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

872
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:06,629
What you talking about?

873
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:10,424
Important folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

874
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,092
Not just prison guards either.

875
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:15,512
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol.

876
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,099
You fellas coming?

877
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:22,811
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

878
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,357
But you knock them for a loop.

879
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:28,359
You knock them for a loop, Del.

880
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,986
Just like Mr. Harry says.

881
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:45,042
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

882
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:48,212
All right, rehearsing now!

883
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,881
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

884
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:54,551
I been fixing the plumbing here
for 10 years.

885
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,012
Ain't never had to wear
no damn tie before.

886
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:00,474
Well, you're the VIP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

887
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:05,020
All right, everybody
have a seat.

888
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:22,538
This is great.

889
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:30,754
All right.

890
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:35,926
Edouard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

891
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,636
...until you are dead...

892
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,222
...in accordance with state law.

893
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,100
God have mercy on your soul.

894
01:23:51,776 --> 01:23:52,943
Roll on two.

895
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,782
That's that.

896
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:04,621
Very good.
Very professional.

897
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,751
Let's do it again.

898
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:12,337
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

899
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:13,922
- Thank you.
- Yep.

900
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:17,009
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

901
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:20,304
You got that chin strap tight
because his head will buck...

902
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,598
All right, break it up.

903
01:24:26,686 --> 01:24:29,730
- So?
- Oh, they love Mr. Jingles.

904
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:30,939
They laugh over there.

905
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:35,486
They cheer.
They clap their hands.

906
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,613
Well, that's just aces.

907
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,074
Isn't that something?

908
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,451
You done good, old-timer.

909
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,453
We're happy for you.

910
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:47,790
Yeah, we are.

911
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:01,345
- Boo!
- Aah!

912
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,682
Percy, you shit.

913
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,687
Come on. Del, get up.

914
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:14,483
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

915
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:17,528
I was just playing.
Come on, now.

916
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:19,822
I was just having... Aah!

917
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:23,700
- Ain't you sweet.
- Wharton.

918
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:26,537
- Soft like a girl.
- Let him go.

919
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,705
I'd rather fuck your asshole...

920
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:30,916
...than your sister's
pussy, I think.

921
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,501
Wharton!

922
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:41,802
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

923
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:44,429
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty little head.

924
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:47,975
Your noodle ain't limp at all,
lover boy.

925
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:50,894
I think you sweet on
old Billy the Kid.

926
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:55,399
Ooh, but smell you.

927
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,574
Look.

928
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,242
He done piss his pants.

929
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,246
Oh, my God.

930
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,499
Look what the big man done.

931
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:16,086
- He bust other people with a stick.
- Come on, get in.

932
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:22,467
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

933
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,763
Del! Learn when to shut up.

934
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:29,725
All right, now.

935
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,811
Don't touch me.

936
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,869
You...

937
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,747
You talk about this to anyone...

938
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:54,333
...I'll get you all fired.

939
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:58,712
I swear that to God.

940
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:03,842
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

941
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,478
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

942
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:17,189
You just keep on laughing!

943
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:22,611
Wetmore a good name for you!

944
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:26,782
Percy Wetmore do a dance.

945
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:29,868
Listen to him
squishing in his pant.

946
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,589
Well, what about Dean?

947
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,341
He's got a little boy.

948
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:47,135
He'd love to have a
pet mouse, I bet.

949
01:27:49,722 --> 01:27:52,557
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

950
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,352
Maybe forget to feed him.

951
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:59,523
How he keep up with his training?
I mean, he just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

952
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,316
Mmm.

953
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:11,868
All right. I'll take him, then.

954
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,246
Me.

955
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:17,499
Merci beaucoup,
thank you kindly, but...

956
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:20,877
...you live out in the woods.

957
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:23,046
Mr. Jingle, he be...

958
01:28:23,756 --> 01:28:27,009
He be scared to live
out in the big woods.

959
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,557
How about Mouseville?

960
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:38,395
- Mouseville?
- Tourist attraction down in Florida.

961
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,897
Tallahassee, I think.

962
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:45,068
- Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?
- Yeah. Tallahassee.

963
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:48,864
It's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

964
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,078
You think they'd take
Mr. Jingles?

965
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:59,750
- You think he's got the stuff?
- Well, he is pretty smart.

966
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:02,711
What is Mouseville?

967
01:29:02,962 --> 01:29:04,921
Tourist attraction, I said.

968
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:06,923
They got this big
tent you go into.

969
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:10,260
- You have to pay?
- Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

970
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:14,264
- Dime apiece. Two cents for the kids.
- For the kids.

971
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:16,641
Inside the tent they got this...

972
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:19,436
...mouse city...

973
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,104
...made out of...

974
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:25,984
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

975
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:30,781
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

976
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:34,951
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

977
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:38,663
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

978
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:43,877
Yeah, that's it.

979
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,339
That's the place for
Mr. Jingles.

980
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:55,430
You gonna be a circus
mouse after all.

981
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:59,768
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

982
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,232
There he goes.

983
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:14,449
No! Mr. Jingles!

984
01:30:14,617 --> 01:30:17,536
No! No! No!

985
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:26,336
- You kill my mouse.
- I knew I'd get him sooner or later.

986
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:29,464
It was just a matter
of time, really.

987
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,801
You fucking cruel bastard!

988
01:30:41,352 --> 01:30:42,894
Give him to me.

989
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:46,189
Give him to me.
Might still be time.

990
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,412
What are you doing?

991
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,123
Paul?

992
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,667
What the hell...?

993
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:07,669
Please, John.

994
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:10,046
Help him.

995
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,508
Please, Johnny, help him.

996
01:31:17,388 --> 01:31:19,973
Oh, dear Jesus.

997
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:21,558
The tail.

998
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:23,393
Look at the tail.

999
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:55,068
What did you do?

1000
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:58,321
I helped Del's mouse...

1001
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:00,031
...he's a circus mouse.

1002
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,951
Gonna live in a mouse city...

1003
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:04,661
...down in...

1004
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:07,872
Florida.

1005
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:12,919
Boss Percy bad.

1006
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:17,173
He mean.
He step on Del's mouse.

1007
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:20,010
I took it back, though.

1008
01:33:20,534 --> 01:33:22,134
Merci

1009
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:28,685
Brute...

1010
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,521
...you come along with me.

1011
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:34,899
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

1012
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:01,343
Now, don't start in on me.

1013
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:03,720
It was just a mouse.

1014
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:06,306
Never belonged here
in the first place.

1015
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:08,266
The mouse is fine.

1016
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:13,021
Just fine. You're no better
at mouse-killing than you are...

1017
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:15,482
...at anything else around here.

1018
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:19,944
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?
Huh?

1019
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:24,366
I heard the goddamn
thing crunch.

1020
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:26,910
Aren't you glad
Mr. Jingles is okay?

1021
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:30,246
After all those talks
we had about...

1022
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:32,582
...keeping the prisoners calm?

1023
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,211
- Aren't you relieved?
- What kind of game is this?

1024
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,046
It's no game.

1025
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,589
See for yourself.

1026
01:34:42,718 --> 01:34:43,927
Go on.

1027
01:34:57,274 --> 01:34:59,317
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle.

1028
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:07,659
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

1029
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:12,622
I always keep a spare mouse
in my wallet for occasions such as this.

1030
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,542
Yeah, you playing with me, huh?
Both of you.

1031
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:18,128
Just who the hell
you think you are?

1032
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:20,755
Aah!

1033
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,799
We're the people you work with.

1034
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,968
But not for long.

1035
01:35:26,011 --> 01:35:27,971
Percy, I want your word.

1036
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:29,973
My word?

1037
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:32,642
I put you out front for Del...

1038
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:36,813
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the very next day.

1039
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:43,820
Well, what if I just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

1040
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:46,322
- Bullying me.
- Go ahead.

1041
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:50,076
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

1042
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:52,954
- Over a mouse?
- No.

1043
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:55,999
But four men
will swear you stood by...

1044
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,167
...while Wild Bill
tried to strangle Dean to death.

1045
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:02,297
About that, people will care. Even your
uncle the governor will care about that.

1046
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:05,049
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

1047
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:09,846
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

1048
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:11,973
I put you out front...

1049
01:36:12,349 --> 01:36:14,559
...you put in for that transfer.

1050
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:17,520
That's the deal.

1051
01:36:21,817 --> 01:36:26,070
All right.

1052
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:35,205
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1053
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,269
Hey, boys.

1054
01:37:40,604 --> 01:37:43,898
No, now, say hey,
Mr. Jingles.

1055
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:48,653
Edouard Delacroix, will you step forward?

1056
01:38:03,252 --> 01:38:04,544
Boss Edgecomb.

1057
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,671
Yes, Del?

1058
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:09,465
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1059
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:13,803
Here. You take him.

1060
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:21,436
Del.

1061
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:25,648
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1062
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:28,902
...you know.

1063
01:38:30,237 --> 01:38:31,988
I'll take him, boss.

1064
01:38:32,656 --> 01:38:35,158
Just for now,
if Del don't mind.

1065
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:39,495
Yeah.

1066
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:44,334
Yeah, you take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1067
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:08,191
You gonna take him to Florida,
to that Mouseville?

1068
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,526
We'll do it together,
most likely.

1069
01:39:11,737 --> 01:39:15,198
- Maybe take a little vacation time.
- Yeah.

1070
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:18,201
People pay a dime
apiece to see him.

1071
01:39:18,535 --> 01:39:21,371
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1072
01:39:21,538 --> 01:39:23,206
That's right, Del.

1073
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:27,043
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1074
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:32,215
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1075
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:39,764
I sure wish I could've
met you guys somewheres else.

1076
01:39:45,088 --> 01:39:48,388
Au revoir, mon ami.
Je t'aime, mon petit.

1077
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,596
Hope he's good and scared.

1078
01:40:20,889 --> 01:40:25,601
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1079
01:40:34,903 --> 01:40:36,696
Del, it's all right.

1080
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:20,656
Roll on one.

1081
01:41:32,419 --> 01:41:35,254
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1082
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:40,093
You be so quiet and so still.

1083
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:45,181
Edouard Delacroix...

1084
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:49,018
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1085
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:53,022
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1086
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:56,359
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1087
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:06,911
I sorry for what I...

1088
01:42:14,044 --> 01:42:16,379
I sorry for what I do.

1089
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:19,132
I give anything to take it back.

1090
01:42:20,175 --> 01:42:21,843
But I can't.

1091
01:42:23,053 --> 01:42:25,221
God have mercy on me.

1092
01:42:26,207 --> 01:42:28,015
Ainsi soit-il,
amen.

1093
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:38,317
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1094
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:42,446
Hey...

1095
01:42:43,532 --> 01:42:44,949
...there's no such place.

1096
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:49,370
That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

1097
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:54,584
Just thought you
should know, faggot.

1098
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:58,564
Edouard Delacroix...

1099
01:43:58,732 --> 01:44:02,318
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1100
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:05,029
...in accordance with state law.

1101
01:44:06,156 --> 01:44:08,741
God have mercy on your soul.

1102
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,156
Roll on two!

1103
01:45:05,882 --> 01:45:07,091
The sponge is dry.

1104
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:09,176
What?

1105
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:17,476
- The goddamn sponge is dry!
- Well, don't you stop it!

1106
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:20,313
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1107
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:36,912
Is this normal?

1108
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:39,832
God, the smell.

1109
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,586
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1110
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:45,671
They're about done, I reckon!

1111
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:53,012
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1112
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:02,271
He's cooking now!

1113
01:46:02,439 --> 01:46:04,774
We gonna have a hoedown!

1114
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:08,027
'Cution gumbo. Give me some!

1115
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:10,154
Give me some!

1116
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:12,365
I'm smelling gumbo!
I'm smelling...

1117
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,785
I said, give me some!

1118
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:21,290
I smell it!

1119
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:24,293
- Aah!
- Smell it!

1120
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:34,970
- Should I kill the juice?
- No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1121
01:46:58,578 --> 01:47:01,831
He's frying now!
He's frying now!

1122
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:06,168
Why don't you shut it down?

1123
01:47:06,336 --> 01:47:09,755
He's still alive. You want me to
shut down while he's still alive?

1124
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:18,764
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1125
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,852
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1126
01:47:23,353 --> 01:47:26,230
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1127
01:47:32,195 --> 01:47:33,988
Kill it!

1128
01:47:40,162 --> 01:47:43,289
You do it!
You're running this show, ain't you?

1129
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:13,777
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1130
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:16,071
Aah!

1131
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:17,323
Brutal!

1132
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:19,074
Brutal, no!

1133
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:20,493
- No!
- What do you mean, no?

1134
01:48:20,702 --> 01:48:22,411
You saw what he did!

1135
01:48:22,579 --> 01:48:25,581
Delacroix's dead!
Percy is not worth it!

1136
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:28,292
So he just gets away with it!
Is that how it works?

1137
01:48:36,801 --> 01:48:40,012
What in the blue fuck was that?

1138
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:42,431
Jesus Christ.

1139
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:45,559
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1140
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:47,520
And the smell.

1141
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:52,107
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for five years.

1142
01:48:52,317 --> 01:48:53,943
That's what I'm betting.

1143
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:58,239
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1144
01:48:58,698 --> 01:49:00,115
You can hear him up there!

1145
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,201
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1146
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:16,215
Okay, boys, okay.

1147
01:49:16,716 --> 01:49:19,760
Now, what in the hell happened?

1148
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:22,930
An execution. A successful one.

1149
01:49:23,348 --> 01:49:27,476
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1150
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,813
Edouard Delacroix is dead.

1151
01:49:32,482 --> 01:49:34,358
Isn't he?

1152
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:39,738
Percy...

1153
01:49:40,448 --> 01:49:41,657
...something to say?

1154
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:48,080
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1155
01:49:49,457 --> 01:49:52,084
How many years you spend
pissing on a toilet seat...

1156
01:49:52,294 --> 01:49:56,463
- ...before someone told you to put it up?
- Percy fucked up, Hal.

1157
01:49:56,673 --> 01:49:58,257
Pure and simple.

1158
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:00,634
That's your official position?

1159
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:02,803
Don't you think it should be?

1160
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:07,182
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1161
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,893
Moving on to bigger
and better things.

1162
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:11,687
Isn't that right, Percy?

1163
01:50:13,189 --> 01:50:14,648
Yeah. Yeah.

1164
01:50:14,816 --> 01:50:16,525
Barbecue.

1165
01:50:16,693 --> 01:50:20,154
Me and you
Stinky, pinky,

1166
01:50:21,197 --> 01:50:24,283
weren't Billy, Jilly,
Hilly or Pa.

1167
01:50:24,492 --> 01:50:27,453
It was a French-fried Cajun
Named Delacroix.

1168
01:50:27,912 --> 01:50:29,288
Whoo.

1169
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:32,499
Barbecue
Me and you.

1170
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:36,045
Stinky, pinky
Phew phew phew.

1171
01:50:36,212 --> 01:50:37,713
Weren't Billy, Jilly...

1172
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:43,218
You're 10 seconds away from spending
the rest of your life in the padded room.

1173
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:02,446
Poor old Del.

1174
01:51:04,199 --> 01:51:05,741
Yeah.

1175
01:51:06,368 --> 01:51:08,035
Poor old Del.

1176
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:12,247
John...

1177
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:15,459
...you okay?

1178
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:18,962
I could feel it from here.

1179
01:51:19,589 --> 01:51:21,006
What do you mean?

1180
01:51:21,966 --> 01:51:23,550
You could hear it.

1181
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,011
Is that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1182
01:51:26,262 --> 01:51:28,180
He out of it now, though.

1183
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:30,849
He the lucky one.

1184
01:51:31,434 --> 01:51:35,104
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

1185
01:51:41,903 --> 01:51:43,529
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1186
01:51:44,614 --> 01:51:47,116
He run away under that door.

1187
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:50,869
Don't think he'll be back.

1188
01:51:52,288 --> 01:51:54,790
He felt it too, through me.

1189
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:58,627
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1190
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:02,131
All that hurt just spill out.

1191
01:52:08,888 --> 01:52:11,223
Awful tired now, boss.

1192
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:14,768
Dog-tired.

1193
01:52:20,608 --> 01:52:22,234
Me too, John.

1194
01:52:24,988 --> 01:52:26,655
Me too.

1195
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:27,716
I hate this.

1196
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:29,843
I know.

1197
01:53:44,859 --> 01:53:47,653
Melinda, hi.

1198
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:53,242
I am so happy to see you.

1199
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:56,995
Look at you.

1200
01:53:57,914 --> 01:53:59,915
We missed you at church.

1201
01:54:03,753 --> 01:54:06,129
My hair...

1202
01:54:06,381 --> 01:54:09,216
- You look fine.
- I'm just a mess.

1203
01:54:14,597 --> 01:54:16,890
She's having one
of her good days.

1204
01:54:17,433 --> 01:54:19,351
I thank God for that.

1205
01:54:21,896 --> 01:54:23,605
What's a bad day?

1206
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:28,861
Sometimes she's...

1207
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,697
She's not herself anymore.

1208
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:33,782
She swears.

1209
01:54:34,033 --> 01:54:35,450
She swears?

1210
01:54:35,743 --> 01:54:37,286
It just pops out.

1211
01:54:37,954 --> 01:54:40,622
Most awful language
you can imagine.

1212
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:43,125
She doesn't even
know she's doing it.

1213
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:47,296
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1214
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:50,716
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice...

1215
01:54:54,929 --> 01:54:57,431
I'm glad she's having
a good day, Paul.

1216
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:00,976
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1217
01:55:17,076 --> 01:55:18,493
Honey...

1218
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:21,330
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1219
01:55:21,956 --> 01:55:25,167
...I'm afraid I'll have to smother you
with a pillow.

1220
01:55:34,093 --> 01:55:36,136
I'm thinking I love you.

1221
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:41,516
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1222
01:55:43,436 --> 01:55:44,853
Oh.

1223
01:55:47,857 --> 01:55:51,276
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1224
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:57,991
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1225
01:55:58,159 --> 01:55:59,493
Well, thank you.

1226
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:02,537
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1227
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:04,206
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1228
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:06,875
Hey, Brutal, you gonna hog
all them taters?

1229
01:56:07,043 --> 01:56:09,670
Yes, I am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1230
01:56:09,879 --> 01:56:12,047
- Come on, now.
- What?

1231
01:56:12,715 --> 01:56:15,075
Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1232
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:17,552
You all saw what he
did to the mouse.

1233
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:22,950
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1234
01:56:23,059 --> 01:56:24,810
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1235
01:56:25,269 --> 01:56:27,062
He did the same thing to me.

1236
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:29,564
He put his hands on me.

1237
01:56:30,316 --> 01:56:32,401
He took my bladder
infection away.

1238
01:56:37,323 --> 01:56:40,867
It's true. When he came home that day,
he was...

1239
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:43,787
...all better.

1240
01:56:45,289 --> 01:56:48,250
Oh, now, wait. You're talking about...

1241
01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:50,085
...an authentic healing?

1242
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:52,796
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1243
01:56:53,548 --> 01:56:54,798
I am.

1244
01:56:55,675 --> 01:56:57,259
Oh, yeah.

1245
01:56:57,427 --> 01:57:00,345
Well, if you say
it, I accept it.

1246
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:03,306
What's it got to do with us?

1247
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:06,768
- You're thinking about Melinda.
- Melinda?

1248
01:57:07,353 --> 01:57:10,105
- Melinda Moores?
- Yeah. So, Paul...

1249
01:57:10,273 --> 01:57:12,607
...you really think
you can help her?

1250
01:57:12,859 --> 01:57:17,112
It's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1251
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:20,949
- ...but there might be a chance.
- Hold on now.

1252
01:57:21,117 --> 01:57:25,120
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1253
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:28,290
Oh, no. No, no.
Hal would never stand for that.

1254
01:57:28,458 --> 01:57:31,293
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything if it fell on him.

1255
01:57:31,461 --> 01:57:33,462
So you're talking about...

1256
01:57:33,629 --> 01:57:35,630
...taking John Coffey to her.

1257
01:57:40,636 --> 01:57:43,305
That's more than
just our jobs, Paul.

1258
01:57:44,307 --> 01:57:46,975
- That's prison time, we get caught.
- Dang right it is.

1259
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:48,977
No, not for you, Dean.

1260
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:52,314
The way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1261
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:54,149
That way, you can
deny everything.

1262
01:57:54,984 --> 01:57:56,485
Why do I have to stay behind?

1263
01:57:57,153 --> 01:58:00,489
Well, our boy's grown up...

1264
01:58:00,656 --> 01:58:01,990
...gone off to school.

1265
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:04,993
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1266
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:06,411
Brutal's a single man.

1267
01:58:06,662 --> 01:58:09,998
You're the only one here with
two children, another one on the way.

1268
01:58:10,374 --> 01:58:13,460
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1269
01:58:15,671 --> 01:58:18,381
Brutal, help me out here.

1270
01:58:19,675 --> 01:58:23,178
- I'm sure she's a fine woman.
- The finest.

1271
01:58:23,346 --> 01:58:25,680
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1272
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:28,350
...to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1273
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:30,685
I have no doubt.

1274
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:33,688
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1275
01:58:33,898 --> 01:58:37,025
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1276
01:58:38,152 --> 01:58:40,362
Now, what if he escapes?

1277
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:43,698
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1278
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:47,202
...but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1279
01:58:47,453 --> 01:58:49,538
I don't think that's
gonna happen.

1280
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:52,290
In fact...

1281
01:58:54,919 --> 01:58:56,711
...I don't think
he did it at all.

1282
01:58:59,882 --> 01:59:03,635
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1283
01:59:03,845 --> 01:59:05,929
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1284
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:10,559
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1285
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:13,562
And plus...

1286
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:16,022
...he's huge.

1287
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:20,861
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1288
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:25,240
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1289
01:59:25,658 --> 01:59:26,950
I'd insist on that.

1290
01:59:28,244 --> 01:59:30,996
If he tried anything,
anything at all...

1291
01:59:31,664 --> 01:59:33,540
...we'd have to take him down.

1292
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:36,042
You understand?

1293
01:59:47,013 --> 01:59:48,722
So...

1294
01:59:49,098 --> 01:59:51,266
...tell us what you had in mind.

1295
01:59:58,107 --> 02:00:00,901
- Oh, there it is.
- Oh, I see it.

1296
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:13,580
You think this is enough?

1297
02:00:14,749 --> 02:00:16,291
I don't know.

1298
02:00:53,037 --> 02:00:54,829
You fellas thirsty?

1299
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:56,539
Fresh out of the icebox.

1300
02:00:56,749 --> 02:01:00,418
- You bet. That's swell, Brutal. Thanks.
- Oh, yeah.

1301
02:01:00,628 --> 02:01:02,837
Hot in here. Boy, howdy.

1302
02:01:03,047 --> 02:01:06,299
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't I?

1303
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:09,928
- My ass, you get some too.
- What makes you think you deserve any?

1304
02:01:10,554 --> 02:01:12,681
Because I got a big pecker.

1305
02:01:12,848 --> 02:01:15,684
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1306
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:17,978
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.

1307
02:01:18,145 --> 02:01:20,605
Come on, now.
Don't be stingy hogs.

1308
02:01:23,859 --> 02:01:25,193
Come on.

1309
02:01:26,362 --> 02:01:28,363
Come on now, fellers.

1310
02:01:29,573 --> 02:01:30,782
Come on, boss.

1311
02:01:31,033 --> 02:01:32,867
I been good all day.

1312
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,789
It's hot in here.

1313
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,543
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1314
02:01:41,711 --> 02:01:43,628
Why don't you give me some?

1315
02:01:50,386 --> 02:01:51,678
Come on.

1316
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:58,727
You gonna stay behaved?

1317
02:01:58,894 --> 02:02:02,230
- Come on, you clunk, give me that.
- You promise me...

1318
02:02:02,606 --> 02:02:04,816
...or I'll drink this myself
right here.

1319
02:02:05,067 --> 02:02:07,736
Don't... Come on, now.
Don't be that way.

1320
02:02:08,237 --> 02:02:09,738
I'll be good.

1321
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,056
Cup.

1322
02:03:26,482 --> 02:03:28,983
Anybody wants out,
now's the time.

1323
02:03:29,693 --> 02:03:31,486
After this, there's
no turning back.

1324
02:03:32,988 --> 02:03:34,197
So?

1325
02:03:35,074 --> 02:03:36,616
We gonna do this?

1326
02:03:36,784 --> 02:03:39,786
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1327
02:03:39,995 --> 02:03:42,205
I'd like to take a ride.

1328
02:03:47,461 --> 02:03:49,504
Guess we're all in.

1329
02:04:00,516 --> 02:04:01,850
What is this?

1330
02:04:04,311 --> 02:04:07,021
- Payback.
- That's right.

1331
02:04:11,735 --> 02:04:14,612
- No, you let me go! Let go of me!
- Settle down.

1332
02:04:14,822 --> 02:04:15,864
- Let go!
- Settle down.

1333
02:04:16,031 --> 02:04:18,366
- What are you doing?
- Settle down.

1334
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:25,957
Ooh.

1335
02:04:26,542 --> 02:04:29,377
- "Miss Lotta Leadpipe."
Oh, Percy.

1336
02:04:29,545 --> 02:04:32,797
- What would your mother say?
- You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1337
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:35,758
I know people. Big people!

1338
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:39,220
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1339
02:04:39,388 --> 02:04:41,389
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1340
02:04:41,557 --> 02:04:44,225
You're dead wrong about that,
you know.

1341
02:04:49,899 --> 02:04:52,233
You gonna put your arms up?

1342
02:04:53,068 --> 02:04:55,920
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1343
02:04:56,405 --> 02:04:58,198
Aah!

1344
02:04:58,365 --> 02:05:00,033
There you go.

1345
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:09,667
Please, Paul.

1346
02:05:09,877 --> 02:05:13,671
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1347
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:16,841
You would think that.

1348
02:05:18,552 --> 02:05:20,929
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1349
02:05:21,096 --> 02:05:23,598
You can't do this to me.
You can't.

1350
02:05:23,807 --> 02:05:26,184
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Percy.

1351
02:05:26,393 --> 02:05:29,521
We can and we are.

1352
02:05:36,278 --> 02:05:40,907
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1353
02:05:41,116 --> 02:05:44,786
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1354
02:05:53,629 --> 02:05:55,797
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1355
02:05:55,965 --> 02:05:58,132
What do you say
if somebody stops by?

1356
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:01,803
Coffey got upset
after lights out...

1357
02:06:01,971 --> 02:06:05,265
...so we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1358
02:06:05,474 --> 02:06:07,350
They hear kicking,
they'll think it's him.

1359
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:08,601
What about me?

1360
02:06:08,769 --> 02:06:11,646
You're in Admin pulling Del's file,
going over the witnesses...

1361
02:06:11,855 --> 02:06:14,732
...on account of how big a screwup
the execution was.

1362
02:06:16,986 --> 02:06:18,736
We going for the ride now?

1363
02:06:18,988 --> 02:06:21,614
That's right. We
going for the ride.

1364
02:06:23,742 --> 02:06:25,159
What about us, Dean?

1365
02:06:25,369 --> 02:06:29,163
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1366
02:06:29,415 --> 02:06:32,000
Probably take a few hours
before you're back.

1367
02:06:35,379 --> 02:06:37,505
Where you think you going?

1368
02:06:44,096 --> 02:06:45,513
You a bad man.

1369
02:06:45,681 --> 02:06:48,016
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1370
02:06:55,816 --> 02:06:57,692
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

1371
02:06:58,027 --> 02:06:59,444
What's wrong?

1372
02:07:19,465 --> 02:07:21,883
Whoo!

1373
02:07:23,385 --> 02:07:26,554
Whole room...
Whole room's spinning.

1374
02:07:26,722 --> 02:07:29,015
It's like I'm shitty-ass drunk.

1375
02:07:29,224 --> 02:07:31,559
Had me some shine or...

1376
02:07:32,311 --> 02:07:33,686
Or what?

1377
02:07:35,939 --> 02:07:38,691
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1378
02:07:38,901 --> 02:07:40,526
White man...

1379
02:07:40,736 --> 02:07:45,323
...ought not to have to sit in
no nigger electric chair. No, sir.

1380
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:55,208
He a bad man.

1381
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:15,978
Look, boss.

1382
02:08:20,567 --> 02:08:23,111
- It's Cassie, the lady in the rocking chair.
- Shh!

1383
02:08:23,904 --> 02:08:25,697
John, we have to be quiet now.

1384
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:28,616
You see her? You see the lady?

1385
02:08:28,867 --> 02:08:30,952
Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

1386
02:08:42,297 --> 02:08:44,298
Let's go. Go, go!

1387
02:08:48,637 --> 02:08:49,804
Now!

1388
02:09:25,966 --> 02:09:28,968
All right, big boy. Let's get moving.
Come on.

1389
02:10:02,586 --> 02:10:04,003
Upsy-daisy.

1390
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:15,890
John, do you know
where we're taking you tonight?

1391
02:10:19,228 --> 02:10:20,478
Help a lady?

1392
02:10:22,397 --> 02:10:23,898
That's right.

1393
02:10:24,733 --> 02:10:25,900
But how do you know?

1394
02:10:27,736 --> 02:10:29,111
Don't know.

1395
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:35,618
Tell the truth, boss,
I don't know much of anything.

1396
02:10:36,912 --> 02:10:38,120
I never have.

1397
02:11:13,448 --> 02:11:15,449
We can still turn back.

1398
02:11:17,369 --> 02:11:19,954
Boss, look. Someone's up.

1399
02:11:22,165 --> 02:11:23,958
This was a mistake.

1400
02:11:24,376 --> 02:11:29,672
- Oh, Christ, what were we thinking?
- It's too late now. John, you stay.

1401
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:37,138
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

1402
02:11:47,316 --> 02:11:49,567
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

1403
02:11:49,735 --> 02:11:52,486
Hal, it's us.
It's Paul and Brutal.

1404
02:11:52,738 --> 02:11:54,155
- It's us.
- Jesus.

1405
02:11:54,323 --> 02:11:56,490
It isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1406
02:11:56,742 --> 02:12:00,328
No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

1407
02:12:00,495 --> 02:12:02,330
Are you hostages?

1408
02:12:02,831 --> 02:12:04,206
Who's out there?

1409
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:06,500
- Who's by that truck?
- Harry, the lights!

1410
02:12:11,006 --> 02:12:12,840
John Coffey.

1411
02:12:13,342 --> 02:12:14,508
- Halt!
- Hal.

1412
02:12:14,718 --> 02:12:16,999
- You stay where you are!
- Relax, now. Take it easy, now.

1413
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:19,138
- Don't you move!
- Wait!

1414
02:12:19,348 --> 02:12:20,640
- I'm warning you.
- John, wait!

1415
02:12:20,849 --> 02:12:22,489
- Hal, listen!
- Halt or I'll shoot!

1416
02:12:22,601 --> 02:12:24,641
- I said, halt! Halt!
- Hal, put the gun down!

1417
02:12:24,853 --> 02:12:26,687
- Hal.
- Hal!

1418
02:12:28,732 --> 02:12:32,777
Hal, who you talking
to down there?

1419
02:12:33,028 --> 02:12:37,365
- Goddamn it!
- Hal, now, nobody is hurt.

1420
02:12:37,532 --> 02:12:38,658
And we are here to help.

1421
02:12:38,867 --> 02:12:42,036
Help what? I don't understand.

1422
02:12:42,287 --> 02:12:45,122
You're just gonna
have to trust me.

1423
02:13:01,723 --> 02:13:04,767
- What do you want?
- Hal!

1424
02:13:05,811 --> 02:13:07,812
Make them go away!

1425
02:13:08,689 --> 02:13:10,690
I don't want no salesmen...

1426
02:13:10,899 --> 02:13:14,527
...in the middle of the night.

1427
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:18,823
Tell them to take a flying fuck
at a rolling...

1428
02:13:19,074 --> 02:13:20,408
Just to help.

1429
02:13:21,159 --> 02:13:23,995
Just to help, boss. That's all.

1430
02:13:24,579 --> 02:13:27,915
You can't. No one can.

1431
02:13:39,261 --> 02:13:41,679
- Stay out of here!
- Don't you go in there!

1432
02:13:41,930 --> 02:13:44,849
- Whoever you are, just stay out!
- Don't you do it!

1433
02:13:45,434 --> 02:13:48,102
I'm not dressed for visitors.

1434
02:13:49,771 --> 02:13:52,314
You stop now. You hear me?

1435
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:55,609
- Paul, I don't want him up there.
- Boss...

1436
02:13:55,944 --> 02:13:58,112
...you just be quiet now.

1437
02:14:45,869 --> 02:14:48,245
It's all right, Hal.
It's all right.

1438
02:14:48,497 --> 02:14:50,998
Hal, watch. Just watch him.

1439
02:14:57,172 --> 02:14:59,757
Don't come near me, pig fucker.

1440
02:15:13,605 --> 02:15:15,898
Why do you have so many scars?

1441
02:15:18,777 --> 02:15:21,028
Who hurt you so badly?

1442
02:15:22,614 --> 02:15:24,949
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1443
02:15:27,452 --> 02:15:29,286
What's your name?

1444
02:15:29,871 --> 02:15:33,040
John Coffey, ma'am.
Like the drink...

1445
02:15:33,375 --> 02:15:35,709
...only not spelt the same.

1446
02:15:42,384 --> 02:15:43,467
Ma'am?

1447
02:15:51,476 --> 02:15:53,435
Yes, John Coffey?

1448
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:58,566
I see it.

1449
02:16:05,740 --> 02:16:08,409
What's happening?

1450
02:16:09,244 --> 02:16:13,914
Shh, you be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1451
02:17:40,585 --> 02:17:43,045
Come on, John. Sick it up.

1452
02:17:43,338 --> 02:17:45,589
Come on. Cough it out
like you done before.

1453
02:17:47,175 --> 02:17:50,928
He's choking. Whatever he sucked out
of her, he's choking on it.

1454
02:17:51,554 --> 02:17:52,596
John.

1455
02:17:54,182 --> 02:17:56,767
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

1456
02:18:10,532 --> 02:18:11,782
How did I get here?

1457
02:18:16,204 --> 02:18:19,290
We were going to the hospital
in Vicksburg.

1458
02:18:19,582 --> 02:18:20,874
Remember?

1459
02:18:21,084 --> 02:18:23,794
Shh, Melly...

1460
02:18:23,962 --> 02:18:25,796
...it doesn't matter.

1461
02:18:26,548 --> 02:18:28,048
It doesn't matter anymore.

1462
02:18:28,216 --> 02:18:30,884
Did I have the x-ray?

1463
02:18:31,553 --> 02:18:33,053
Did I?

1464
02:18:35,724 --> 02:18:36,974
Yes.

1465
02:18:37,892 --> 02:18:41,895
Yes. It was clear.
There was no tumor.

1466
02:18:57,912 --> 02:19:02,166
John, can you stand up?
Can you turn around and see this lady?

1467
02:19:15,597 --> 02:19:17,181
What's your name?

1468
02:19:18,433 --> 02:19:20,642
John Coffey, ma'am.

1469
02:19:22,103 --> 02:19:23,771
Like the drink.

1470
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:27,274
Only not spelt the same.

1471
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:31,362
No, ma'am, not spelt
the same at all.

1472
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:37,618
Melly... No, you can't.

1473
02:20:02,310 --> 02:20:04,395
I dreamed of you.

1474
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:10,067
I dreamed you were wandering
in the dark.

1475
02:20:11,569 --> 02:20:13,487
And so was I.

1476
02:20:15,323 --> 02:20:17,491
And we found each other.

1477
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:20,994
We found each other in the dark.

1478
02:20:40,515 --> 02:20:42,266
Take it, John. It's a present.

1479
02:20:42,684 --> 02:20:44,768
It's St. Christopher.

1480
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:48,230
I want you to have it,
Mr. Coffey.

1481
02:20:49,023 --> 02:20:51,525
And wear it.
He'll keep you safe.

1482
02:20:51,943 --> 02:20:53,444
Please.

1483
02:20:53,862 --> 02:20:55,529
Wear it for me.

1484
02:21:10,044 --> 02:21:11,879
Thank you, ma'am.

1485
02:21:13,965 --> 02:21:15,799
Thank you, John.

1486
02:21:22,515 --> 02:21:27,311
Christ, he goes down, it'll take three
mules and a crane to pick him up again.

1487
02:21:27,562 --> 02:21:31,315
Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1488
02:21:46,998 --> 02:21:50,083
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1489
02:21:50,418 --> 02:21:52,586
He swallowed that
stuff for a reason.

1490
02:21:53,421 --> 02:21:55,589
I give him a few days.

1491
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:59,760
One of us will be doing a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1492
02:21:59,928 --> 02:22:02,221
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1493
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:04,681
Let's just get him
back on the Mile.

1494
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:21,114
Am I happy to see you.
You were gone so long.

1495
02:22:21,324 --> 02:22:23,408
Wild Bill's making noise
like he's waking up.

1496
02:22:23,618 --> 02:22:28,121
- What the hell happened to him?
- He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

1497
02:22:31,584 --> 02:22:34,795
Okay, John. We gonna...

1498
02:22:34,963 --> 02:22:38,632
...set you down on your bed now.
Here we go.

1499
02:22:56,651 --> 02:22:57,818
Well?

1500
02:22:59,654 --> 02:23:01,488
What about Mrs. Moores?

1501
02:23:03,575 --> 02:23:05,492
Was it like the mouse?

1502
02:23:06,828 --> 02:23:07,911
Was it...

1503
02:23:09,998 --> 02:23:14,501
- ...you know, a miracle?
- Yes.

1504
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:17,838
Yes, it was.

1505
02:23:18,381 --> 02:23:19,506
Damn.

1506
02:23:35,189 --> 02:23:36,857
Now...

1507
02:23:37,025 --> 02:23:39,693
...I want to talk, not shout.

1508
02:23:39,944 --> 02:23:42,446
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1509
02:23:42,905 --> 02:23:44,489
Mm-hmm.

1510
02:23:45,450 --> 02:23:48,619
My mother always says you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

1511
02:23:49,287 --> 02:23:52,039
Mmm! Mmm!

1512
02:23:52,415 --> 02:23:54,124
Guess she was wrong.

1513
02:23:57,378 --> 02:23:58,920
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1514
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:00,464
- In a minute.
- Now!

1515
02:24:00,715 --> 02:24:02,507
Right now! I want out now...!
Aah!

1516
02:24:06,971 --> 02:24:08,972
Shut up and listen.

1517
02:24:09,724 --> 02:24:13,644
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

1518
02:24:14,395 --> 02:24:18,023
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born. We'll tell people...

1519
02:24:18,191 --> 02:24:21,818
- ...how you sabotaged Del's execution...
- Sabotaged?

1520
02:24:22,028 --> 02:24:26,239
...how you pissed yourself like a
frightened little girl. Yes, we will talk.

1521
02:24:27,408 --> 02:24:28,909
But, Percy...

1522
02:24:29,577 --> 02:24:31,578
...you mind me, now.

1523
02:24:31,996 --> 02:24:36,083
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1524
02:24:37,585 --> 02:24:38,835
We know people too.

1525
02:24:40,338 --> 02:24:42,589
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

1526
02:24:45,176 --> 02:24:48,261
Let bygones be bygones, hmm?

1527
02:24:49,263 --> 02:24:51,932
Nothing's hurt so
far but your pride.

1528
02:24:52,350 --> 02:24:56,520
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

1529
02:24:56,938 --> 02:25:00,440
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1530
02:25:01,484 --> 02:25:02,859
Always has.

1531
02:25:07,198 --> 02:25:08,782
Hmm.

1532
02:25:12,036 --> 02:25:14,538
May I be let out
of this coat now?

1533
02:25:34,475 --> 02:25:35,642
My things?

1534
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:40,814
Think it over, Percy.

1535
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:43,400
Oh, I intend to.

1536
02:25:44,318 --> 02:25:47,404
I intend to think
it over very hard.

1537
02:25:49,157 --> 02:25:51,074
Starting right now.

1538
02:26:00,668 --> 02:26:04,045
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

1539
02:26:18,436 --> 02:26:20,645
- Hey, let him go!
- John, let go!

1540
02:26:20,855 --> 02:26:23,982
- Let go, John!
- John, goddamn it! Let him go!

1541
02:26:24,192 --> 02:26:25,942
Let go, John! No!

1542
02:26:26,986 --> 02:26:28,528
- Aah!
- Back off!

1543
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:32,449
- John, stop it! Stop it, John!
- Let him go! Back off!

1544
02:26:32,658 --> 02:26:33,700
John, let him go!

1545
02:26:49,717 --> 02:26:51,218
Oh, my God!

1546
02:27:34,679 --> 02:27:37,430
Easy, now. Easy.

1547
02:27:38,683 --> 02:27:40,100
Easy.

1548
02:27:41,352 --> 02:27:42,769
Hey.

1549
02:27:46,524 --> 02:27:47,566
Percy.

1550
02:27:50,570 --> 02:27:51,695
Are you all right?

1551
02:28:24,896 --> 02:28:26,980
Boy, what you looking at?

1552
02:28:34,822 --> 02:28:38,491
What you looking at?
You limp noodle.

1553
02:28:38,826 --> 02:28:42,996
You wanna kiss my ass?
You wanna suck my dick?

1554
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:56,927
No!

1555
02:29:04,477 --> 02:29:06,686
Grab the gun! Grab the gun!

1556
02:29:12,944 --> 02:29:14,694
No, no.

1557
02:29:14,862 --> 02:29:16,863
No, no.

1558
02:29:17,490 --> 02:29:19,199
Oh, no.

1559
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,584
I punished them bad men.

1560
02:30:12,086 --> 02:30:13,837
I punished them both.

1561
02:30:14,088 --> 02:30:15,338
Why?

1562
02:30:16,257 --> 02:30:17,507
Why Wild Bill?

1563
02:30:18,843 --> 02:30:23,096
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1564
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:25,932
I saw what Wild Billy had done.

1565
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:28,935
Saw it plain as day.

1566
02:30:30,104 --> 02:30:32,939
You can't hide what's
in your heart.

1567
02:30:33,274 --> 02:30:34,441
What?

1568
02:30:36,277 --> 02:30:37,444
You saw what?

1569
02:30:41,323 --> 02:30:43,450
Take my hand, boss.

1570
02:30:46,579 --> 02:30:48,329
You see for yourself.

1571
02:30:50,332 --> 02:30:51,875
Paul...

1572
02:30:52,043 --> 02:30:53,126
...no.

1573
02:30:57,131 --> 02:30:58,548
Please.

1574
02:31:06,974 --> 02:31:08,641
No, no.

1575
02:31:09,935 --> 02:31:12,645
- Please.
- I gots to, boss.

1576
02:31:12,813 --> 02:31:15,315
I gots to give you
a little bit of myself.

1577
02:31:16,984 --> 02:31:18,485
A gift.

1578
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:23,990
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

1579
02:31:37,254 --> 02:31:39,297
Paul!

1580
02:32:18,003 --> 02:32:19,921
Klaus!

1581
02:32:21,882 --> 02:32:23,383
Suppertime!

1582
02:32:23,551 --> 02:32:25,468
Bring the girls.

1583
02:32:28,931 --> 02:32:31,891
Girls! You heard your mama!

1584
02:32:32,726 --> 02:32:35,478
Yes, Papa! We're coming!

1585
02:32:53,831 --> 02:32:57,584
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

1586
02:32:57,751 --> 02:32:59,460
Come get you some supper.

1587
02:33:02,423 --> 02:33:06,593
God is great, God is good,
and we thank you...

1588
02:33:30,993 --> 02:33:32,702
You love your sister?

1589
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:35,747
You make any noise,
you know what happens?

1590
02:33:35,956 --> 02:33:38,041
I'm gonna kill her
instead of you.

1591
02:33:38,292 --> 02:33:41,794
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her. You understand?

1592
02:33:42,004 --> 02:33:43,630
You understand?

1593
02:33:44,215 --> 02:33:45,924
Shh.

1594
02:34:02,149 --> 02:34:06,152
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1595
02:34:07,321 --> 02:34:09,656
Now you see how it is.

1596
02:34:11,033 --> 02:34:13,910
That's the way it is every day.

1597
02:34:14,161 --> 02:34:18,331
That's the way it is
all over the world.

1598
02:34:28,550 --> 02:34:29,676
Percy.

1599
02:34:29,843 --> 02:34:31,052
Percy Wetmore.

1600
02:34:32,012 --> 02:34:35,348
- Son?
- Percy. Percy Wetmore.

1601
02:34:36,058 --> 02:34:37,350
Son?

1602
02:34:38,018 --> 02:34:41,020
- Son, can you hear me?
- Speak up if you can hear us.

1603
02:34:42,022 --> 02:34:45,066
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1604
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:49,779
Percy, I got to ask you
a few questions.

1605
02:34:50,030 --> 02:34:53,283
That's right. One minute,
he was fine, and the next, blammo.

1606
02:34:53,534 --> 02:34:55,868
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars.

1607
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:58,705
Scared the boy so
bad, he wet hisself.

1608
02:34:59,707 --> 02:35:02,583
See, we didn't even
see it happen.

1609
02:35:06,547 --> 02:35:09,882
I'll cover for you
as much as I can...

1610
02:35:10,092 --> 02:35:12,385
...even if it means my job.

1611
02:35:13,053 --> 02:35:15,054
But I have to know...

1612
02:35:15,222 --> 02:35:18,850
...does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

1613
02:35:21,395 --> 02:35:22,895
Does it, Paul?

1614
02:35:24,898 --> 02:35:26,107
No.

1615
02:36:53,487 --> 02:36:57,323
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1616
02:36:58,575 --> 02:37:00,326
Well, can he help?

1617
02:37:00,828 --> 02:37:03,663
Does he have the influence to do
something about this?

1618
02:37:03,831 --> 02:37:06,666
- Stop the execution?
- No.

1619
02:37:09,837 --> 02:37:11,337
Then don't tell him.

1620
02:37:12,005 --> 02:37:14,257
If it can't help,
don't tell him.

1621
02:37:14,591 --> 02:37:15,842
Ever.

1622
02:37:18,220 --> 02:37:19,679
I won't.

1623
02:37:31,358 --> 02:37:33,734
There's no way out of this for you,
is there?

1624
02:37:35,237 --> 02:37:36,529
No.

1625
02:37:37,614 --> 02:37:40,199
And I've been thinking about it,
believe me.

1626
02:37:40,367 --> 02:37:45,037
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways. No.

1627
02:37:46,123 --> 02:37:48,249
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1628
02:37:49,793 --> 02:37:54,630
I've done some things in my life
that I am not proud of...

1629
02:37:55,215 --> 02:38:00,052
...but this is the first time
I've ever felt real danger of hell.

1630
02:38:01,054 --> 02:38:02,388
Hell?

1631
02:38:04,141 --> 02:38:05,975
Oh, Paul.

1632
02:38:08,312 --> 02:38:09,896
Talk to him.

1633
02:38:11,064 --> 02:38:12,899
Talk to John.

1634
02:38:14,735 --> 02:38:16,777
Find out what he wants.

1635
02:38:33,670 --> 02:38:34,921
Hello, boss.

1636
02:38:35,923 --> 02:38:37,256
Hello, John.

1637
02:38:38,675 --> 02:38:41,552
I guess you know
we're coming down to it now.

1638
02:38:41,845 --> 02:38:43,596
Another couple of days.

1639
02:38:57,110 --> 02:38:59,946
Is there anything special
you wanna eat that night?

1640
02:39:00,322 --> 02:39:02,615
We can rustle you
up most anything.

1641
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:17,630
Meat loaf be nice.
Mashed taters, gravy.

1642
02:39:17,881 --> 02:39:19,298
Okra.

1643
02:39:20,384 --> 02:39:23,219
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make...

1644
02:39:24,054 --> 02:39:26,138
...if she don't mind.

1645
02:39:28,433 --> 02:39:29,850
Now...

1646
02:39:30,352 --> 02:39:35,273
...what about a preacher?
Someone to say a little prayer with.

1647
02:39:35,482 --> 02:39:37,650
Don't want no preacher.

1648
02:39:38,652 --> 02:39:41,153
You can say a prayer,
if you like.

1649
02:39:41,863 --> 02:39:43,155
Me?

1650
02:39:45,993 --> 02:39:48,828
Suppose I could, if
it came to that.

1651
02:39:52,916 --> 02:39:54,458
John...

1652
02:39:57,004 --> 02:39:59,839
I have to ask you something
very important now.

1653
02:40:01,508 --> 02:40:03,676
I know what you gonna say.

1654
02:40:04,177 --> 02:40:05,678
You don't have to say it.

1655
02:40:06,013 --> 02:40:09,348
No, I do. I do.
I have to say it.

1656
02:40:10,392 --> 02:40:11,809
John...

1657
02:40:13,270 --> 02:40:15,605
...tell me what you
want me to do.

1658
02:40:16,523 --> 02:40:18,524
You want me to take
you out of here?

1659
02:40:19,693 --> 02:40:23,696
Just let you run away?
See how far you could get?

1660
02:40:25,198 --> 02:40:27,908
Why would you do
such a foolish thing?

1661
02:40:29,911 --> 02:40:32,538
On the day of my judgment...

1662
02:40:32,873 --> 02:40:35,041
...when I stand before God...

1663
02:40:35,208 --> 02:40:39,045
...and he asks me why did I...

1664
02:40:39,296 --> 02:40:41,922
Did I kill one of his true...

1665
02:40:42,799 --> 02:40:44,383
...miracles...

1666
02:40:45,552 --> 02:40:47,720
...what am I going to say?

1667
02:40:48,639 --> 02:40:50,389
That it was my job?

1668
02:40:52,559 --> 02:40:54,560
It's my job.

1669
02:40:54,853 --> 02:40:59,482
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1670
02:41:02,569 --> 02:41:05,237
I know you're hurting
and worrying.

1671
02:41:05,906 --> 02:41:09,575
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

1672
02:41:10,744 --> 02:41:13,746
I want it to be
over and done with.

1673
02:41:14,414 --> 02:41:15,915
I do.

1674
02:41:20,337 --> 02:41:22,338
I'm tired, boss.

1675
02:41:23,757 --> 02:41:28,094
Tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1676
02:41:29,262 --> 02:41:32,098
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with...

1677
02:41:32,599 --> 02:41:37,269
...to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

1678
02:41:38,105 --> 02:41:42,274
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1679
02:41:43,443 --> 02:41:47,405
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world...

1680
02:41:47,614 --> 02:41:49,281
...every day.

1681
02:41:49,616 --> 02:41:51,617
There's too much of it.

1682
02:41:51,952 --> 02:41:55,788
It's like pieces of glass
in my head...

1683
02:41:55,997 --> 02:41:58,290
...all the time.

1684
02:41:59,793 --> 02:42:01,794
Can you understand?

1685
02:42:04,798 --> 02:42:07,758
Yes, John, I think I can.

1686
02:42:10,137 --> 02:42:13,514
Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

1687
02:42:15,642 --> 02:42:17,727
There must be something
that you want.

1688
02:42:27,154 --> 02:42:31,657
I ain't never seen
me a flicker show.

1689
02:42:32,159 --> 02:42:34,285
<i>♪ Heaven. ♪</i>

1690

1694

1695
02:44:00,914 --> 02:44:03,582
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1696
02:45:04,227 --> 02:45:06,228
I'll be all right, fellas.

1697
02:45:07,647 --> 02:45:09,899
This here's the hard part.

1698
02:45:11,192 --> 02:45:12,735
I'll be all right in a while.

1699
02:45:13,820 --> 02:45:18,407
John, I should have
this just for now.

1700
02:45:22,412 --> 02:45:24,830
I'll give it back after.

1701
02:45:28,001 --> 02:45:32,504
You know, I fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1702
02:45:33,715 --> 02:45:35,841
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

1703
02:45:37,010 --> 02:45:38,218
Did you, John?

1704
02:45:39,012 --> 02:45:43,349
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1705
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:45,851
That Mouseville place.

1706
02:45:46,186 --> 02:45:48,520
I dreamed there's kids.

1707
02:45:49,022 --> 02:45:52,524
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1708
02:45:55,028 --> 02:45:58,822
I dreamed that those two little
blond-headed girls was there.

1709
02:45:59,032 --> 02:46:00,866
They's laughing too.

1710
02:46:01,034 --> 02:46:04,036
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1711
02:46:04,245 --> 02:46:08,290
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1712
02:46:08,541 --> 02:46:11,877
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1713
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:16,799
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we were!

1714
02:46:32,565 --> 02:46:34,400
John.

1715
02:46:35,068 --> 02:46:40,072
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1716
02:46:41,074 --> 02:46:43,075
I can feel it.

1717
02:46:43,326 --> 02:46:45,077
It's like bees stinging me.

1718
02:46:45,412 --> 02:46:47,788
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1719
02:46:49,082 --> 02:46:50,290
We don't hate you.

1720
02:46:51,668 --> 02:46:53,252
Can you feel that?

1721
02:46:55,422 --> 02:46:57,589
Kill him twice, you boys!

1722
02:46:58,425 --> 02:47:02,428
You go on and kill that raping
baby killer twice!

1723
02:47:02,595 --> 02:47:04,430
That'd be fine!

1724
02:47:21,114 --> 02:47:23,615
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1725
02:47:23,825 --> 02:47:25,117
Yes, sir.

1726
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:38,464
Roll on one.

1727
02:47:46,473 --> 02:47:49,975
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1728
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:53,062
I hope it hurts like hell.

1729
02:47:54,981 --> 02:47:59,068
John Coffey, you have been condemned to die
in the electric chair by a jury of your peers.

1730
02:47:59,319 --> 02:48:02,863
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1731
02:48:03,156 --> 02:48:06,408
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1732
02:48:08,161 --> 02:48:10,662
I'm sorry for what I am.

1733
02:48:22,675 --> 02:48:24,426
Please, boss...

1734
02:48:25,845 --> 02:48:28,514
...don't put that
thing over my face.

1735
02:48:29,682 --> 02:48:32,017
Don't put me in the dark.

1736
02:48:32,852 --> 02:48:35,187
I's afraid of the dark.

1737
02:48:44,864 --> 02:48:46,532
All right, John.

1738
02:49:06,719 --> 02:49:09,721
<i>Heaven, I'm in heaven.</i>

1739
02:49:09,931 --> 02:49:12,724
<i>Heaven, heaven,</i>

1740
02:49:12,976 --> 02:49:14,810
<i>I'm in heaven.</i>

1741
02:49:15,395 --> 02:49:17,980
<i>Heaven, heaven,</i>

1742
02:49:18,231 --> 02:49:19,940
<i>I'm in heaven.</i>

1743
02:49:40,837 --> 02:49:42,462
John Coffey...

1744
02:49:43,464 --> 02:49:46,592
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1745
02:49:46,759 --> 02:49:48,969
...in accordance with state law.

1746
02:49:51,347 --> 02:49:55,100
May God have mercy on your soul.

1747
02:50:29,427 --> 02:50:30,636
Paul.

1748
02:50:33,806 --> 02:50:35,724
You have to say it.

1749
02:50:37,393 --> 02:50:39,645
You have to give the order.

1750
02:50:57,664 --> 02:50:59,998
He killed them with they love.

1751
02:51:00,166 --> 02:51:05,045
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1752
02:51:18,851 --> 02:51:20,269
Roll on two.

1753
02:53:04,957 --> 02:53:08,293
It was the last execution
I ever took part in.

1754
02:53:08,628 --> 02:53:12,297
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1755
02:53:13,466 --> 02:53:18,220
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1756
02:53:18,471 --> 02:53:20,222
It was all right.

1757
02:53:20,807 --> 02:53:23,809
"Catch them young"
became my motto.

1758
02:53:26,979 --> 02:53:28,188
You don't believe me.

1759
02:53:28,981 --> 02:53:31,566
I don't imagine you'd
lie to me, Paul.

1760
02:53:32,318 --> 02:53:34,486
- It's just that...
- It's quite a story.

1761
02:53:34,737 --> 02:53:36,988
It's quite a story.

1762
02:53:37,323 --> 02:53:39,741
One thing I don't understand.

1763
02:53:39,992 --> 02:53:41,743
You said you and Jan...

1764
02:53:41,994 --> 02:53:45,497
...had a grown son in 1935.

1765
02:53:45,832 --> 02:53:47,332
Is that right?

1766
02:53:47,708 --> 02:53:49,668
The math doesn't work, does it?

1767
02:53:55,174 --> 02:53:57,926
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1768
02:54:18,656 --> 02:54:20,031
Watch your step.

1769
02:54:20,533 --> 02:54:22,868
Now let your eyes adjust.

1770
02:54:34,547 --> 02:54:35,755
There.

1771
02:54:38,384 --> 02:54:41,261
Hey. Wake up, old fella.

1772
02:54:41,554 --> 02:54:42,804
Wake up.

1773
02:54:46,392 --> 02:54:50,270
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

1774
02:54:54,400 --> 02:54:55,775
Come over here, boy.

1775
02:54:56,277 --> 02:54:58,653
Come on over here
and see this lady.

1776
02:55:01,574 --> 02:55:04,576
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1777
02:55:10,300 --> 02:55:15,800
Monsieur et Madame,
bienvenue au cirque de Mouseville.

1778
02:55:27,266 --> 02:55:29,851
Go on, you can do it.

1779
02:55:36,943 --> 02:55:41,446
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1780
02:55:42,198 --> 02:55:46,117
But we make do.
Don't we, old fella?

1781
02:55:52,625 --> 02:55:56,294
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1782
02:55:56,712 --> 02:56:01,591
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1783
02:56:01,801 --> 02:56:04,135
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1784
02:56:04,387 --> 02:56:07,806
And I think a part of...

1785
02:56:07,974 --> 02:56:10,809
...whatever magic was
inside of him...

1786
02:56:10,977 --> 02:56:14,312
...just leapt into
my tiny friend here.

1787
02:56:15,481 --> 02:56:17,482
As for me...

1788
02:56:18,651 --> 02:56:21,152
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1789
02:56:21,487 --> 02:56:23,655
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1790
02:56:23,990 --> 02:56:27,409
...so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1791
02:56:29,829 --> 02:56:31,997
When John did that...

1792
02:56:33,499 --> 02:56:35,834
...when he took my hand...

1793
02:56:36,836 --> 02:56:40,672
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1794
02:56:41,674 --> 02:56:43,508
...spilled into me.

1795
02:56:43,884 --> 02:56:45,677
He what?

1796
02:56:46,178 --> 02:56:49,681
He infected you with life?

1797
02:56:51,267 --> 02:56:53,602
It's as good a word as any.

1798
02:56:55,104 --> 02:56:58,023
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1799
02:56:58,190 --> 02:56:59,691
With life.

1800
02:57:03,696 --> 02:57:06,865
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

1801
02:57:07,033 --> 02:57:11,453
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1802
02:57:14,373 --> 02:57:18,126
You mustn’t blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1803
02:57:18,377 --> 02:57:22,922
He was just a force of nature.

1804
02:57:23,382 --> 02:57:27,552
Oh, I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1805
02:57:28,554 --> 02:57:31,556
Another century come to pass.

1806
02:57:31,807 --> 02:57:33,683
But I've...

1807
02:57:34,310 --> 02:57:38,730
I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1808
02:57:39,148 --> 02:57:41,232
Hal and Melinda...

1809
02:57:41,651 --> 02:57:43,068
...Brutus Howell...

1810
02:57:43,235 --> 02:57:45,945
...my wife, my boy.

1811
02:57:48,908 --> 02:57:50,742
And you, Elaine.

1812
02:57:51,744 --> 02:57:53,578
You'll die too.

1813
02:57:55,081 --> 02:57:59,459
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

1814
02:58:00,920 --> 02:58:03,338
It's my atonement, you see.

1815
02:58:03,923 --> 02:58:05,590
It's my punishment...

1816
02:58:05,841 --> 02:58:08,468
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1817
02:58:10,179 --> 02:58:12,972
For killing a miracle of God.

1818
02:58:14,475 --> 02:58:17,268
Almighty, everlasting God...

1819
02:58:17,561 --> 02:58:19,938
...the source of all
being and life...

1820
02:58:20,106 --> 02:58:22,524
<i>You'll be gone like all the others.</i>

1821
02:58:22,692 --> 02:58:24,484
<i>I'll have to stay.</i>

1822
02:58:26,487 --> 02:58:30,699
<i>Oh, I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.</i>

1823
02:58:31,450 --> 02:58:35,453
<i>I have no illusions
of immortality.</i>

1824
02:58:35,788 --> 02:58:38,415
<i>But I will have
wished for death...</i>

1825
02:58:38,582 --> 02:58:41,209
<i>...long before death finds me.</i>

1826
02:58:42,294 --> 02:58:46,131
<i>In truth, I wish for it already.</i>

1827
02:58:58,227 --> 02:59:00,228
Mr. Jingles?

1828
02:59:09,155 --> 02:59:11,322
Where you been?

1829
02:59:11,657 --> 02:59:15,076
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1830
02:59:15,911 --> 02:59:18,329
Let's go see if we can't find you
something to eat.

1831
02:59:19,498 --> 02:59:23,168
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1832
02:59:24,670 --> 02:59:26,004
Look at you.

1833
02:59:27,673 --> 02:59:31,593
<i>I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.</i>

1834
02:59:31,802 --> 02:59:33,845
<i>And I wait.</i>

1835
02:59:34,555 --> 02:59:37,474
<i>I think about all the people
I've loved...</i>

1836
02:59:37,683 --> 02:59:39,851
<i>...now long gone.</i>

1837
02:59:40,352 --> 02:59:43,021
<i>I think about my
beautiful Jan...</i>

1838
02:59:43,189 --> 02:59:46,191
<i>...how I lost her
so many years ago.</i>

1839
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:52,197
<i>And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...</i>

1840
02:59:52,448 --> 02:59:55,116
<i>...each in our own time.</i>

1841
02:59:56,202 --> 02:59:59,370
<i>But one thought
more than any other...</i>

1842
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:02,207
<i>...keeps me awake most nights,</i>

1843
03:00:03,375 --> 03:00:07,378
<i>If he could make a mouse
live so long...</i>

1844
03:00:07,713 --> 03:00:10,882
<i>...how much longer do I have?</i>

1845
03:00:14,220 --> 03:00:17,013
<i>We each owe a death.</i>

1846
03:00:17,223 --> 03:00:19,724
<i>There are no exceptions.</i>

1847
03:00:20,476 --> 03:00:22,477
<i>But, oh, God...</i>

1848
03:00:23,395 --> 03:00:25,188
<i>...sometimes...</i>

1849
03:00:25,731 --> 03:00:29,400
<i>...the Green Mile seems so long.</i>
