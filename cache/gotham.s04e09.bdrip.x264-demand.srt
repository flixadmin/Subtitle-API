00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,999
<i>that you could never imagine.</i>

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,039
I know, I've been down it.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,878
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,280
<i>ALFRED: Then it's gonna be
a long, bumpy journey back.</i>

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,514
<i>You've met Martin, Isee.</i>

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,796
You and I, we're more than friends.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,679
<i>We 're conspirators.</i>

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,669
Oh, no.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,517
<i>You are relieved of duty,
Harvey Bullock.</i>

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,758
As of this moment, I am assuming the
captaincy of Gotham Central.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,751
What did you have to do to get it?

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,671
<i>NEWSREADER: Gotham finds itself in
the hands of a ritualistic cop killer</i>

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,273
<i>Being called Professor Pyg.</i>

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,837
THE <i>PYG: It doesn't stop until I've
butchered every single swine</i>

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,071
<i>on Penguin's payroll.</i>

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,309
I'm gonna find you.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,279
I hope you do, it's a Spectacle.

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,359
And you're my muse, Jimmy Gordon.

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,515
My poor lost lambs.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,475
I come to you today with an offer
for this evening.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,278
Fresh biscuits and
a hearty bowl of soup.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,037
I have place settings for six.

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,471
Nobody wants some fresh pumpkin pie?

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,831
Smile.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,880
My children.

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,112
There are two Gothams.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,555
The haves.

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,517
And the have-nets.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,193
I know what it is

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,316
to feel like a have-not.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,630
But I say. "Enough."

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,275
Here's to giving the haves a taste

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,351
of what it is like to be

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,115
a have-not.

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,954
Let's begin.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,475
Shall we?

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,157
I'Il be out of yourway
in just a second, Captain.

40
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Harvey.

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,438
This isn't how I wanted
things to go down.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,037
And yet. here we are.

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,640
You know what
I was thinking about today?

44
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,155
Our first case.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,176
When I told you to walk Penguin
to the end of the pier,

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,874
put a bullet in his head
and dump him in the water,

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
and you wouldn't.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,277
- You thought it was wrong.
- It was.

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,040
Well, maybe if you would have done it,

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,317
Falcone would still be running things

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,117
and a lot of people who are dead
would be alive today.

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,315
If I could go back,

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
I'd do the same thing.

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,400
'Cause you still don't understand
how the city works, Jim.

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,114
You want to be a hero.

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,913
And Gotham doesn't need heroes.

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,832
It needs people
who will do what is necessary.

58
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,396
You're wrong. If you show 'em the way,

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
the people will follow.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,160
I guess we'II just have to
wait and see, huh?

61
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,154
When your leave is up,

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
there'II be a desk here waiting for you.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,634
Sit around, watch you all day?

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
No, thanks.

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,030
Right there's perfect. Thank you.

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Beautiful.

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,596
I predict this evening's fundraiser
will be a smashing success.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,200
If I want Gotham's wealthiest families

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,749
to support the orphanage,
things have to be perfect.

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,753
I appreciate you taking part, Oswald.

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Yes.

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,398
- Sadly, a situation has arisen.
- No.

73
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,279
That thing in The Narrows
with your former chief of staff?

74
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,909
No, no. This is far more serious.

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,151
It has to do with Mayor Burke
promoting James Gordon

76
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,231
to captain of the GCPD.

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,717
You're not really
worried about James Gordon.

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Please.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,119
The issue is the person
who ordered his appointment.

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,909
- I see.
- Do you?

81
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,034
Oswald, we both know
the mayor is a weasel.

82
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,519
Someone must've paid him off.

83
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,273
But I don't see why that means
you can't attend my dinner.

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,230
Because, my dear,
the mayor has vanished.

85
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,399
But I will find him.

86
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,633
I will learn the name of my enemy.

87
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,272
And there will be a reckoning.

88
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,440
And that is why I might
not be able to make it this evening.

89
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Very well.

90
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,117
But a few of the children
are doing a song.

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,714
Martin is taking part.

92
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,896
It would mean the world to him
if you could come.

93
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,035
Of course.

94
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,676
Now, don't let me keep you.

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,998
If you think she's the one,

96
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,712
we could have Victor talk to her.

97
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,152
You do realize she is

98
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,513
literally my only friend.

99
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,155
I need the mayor.

100
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,990
I need proof.

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,635
But. sir, what if Ms. Falcone,
not to say it is her,

102
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,833
has seen to it that the mayor
is missing, well,

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Permanently?

104
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,514
I could be Chasing a ghost
while she prepares her next move.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,636
I wish I had a spy close to her.
Someone quiet.

106
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,195
Bring me Martin.

107
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Who?

108
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,998
The boy with the pad around his neck.

109
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,552
The one who can't talk.

110
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,073
I thought I was clear. We're done.

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,114
<i>Penguin suspects something.</i>

112
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,896
What are you talking about?

113
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,816
He was just here saying
that he couldn't come to the party

114
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,320
I'm having tonight for the orphanage.

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,720
He knows someone paid the mayor
to make you captain.

116
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,595
<i>I think he suspects me.</i>

117
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,056
<i>- Have you warned the mayor?
- I'm not a fool, Jim.</i>

118
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,800
I had him leave town
after your appointment.

119
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,390
Sounds like you have
your bases covered as usual.

120
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,479
Thanks for the heads up about Penguin.

121
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,195
Don't call me again.

122
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,314
This is Harper.

123
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,596
Gordon, line one. Says it's private.

124
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Sofia.

125
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,034
<i>Wrong. Try again.</i>

126
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,270
You son of a bitch.

127
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,033
Attaboy, Jim.

128
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,799
Or should I say "Captain"?

129
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,878
<i>Congratulations, by the way.</i>

130
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,436
<i>So, do you remember when you said</i>

131
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,194
the rot in Gotham went from high to low?

132
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,194
<i>Y0u've hit the nail on the head.</i>

133
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,354
Police were low,

134
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,270
and now it's time for Gotham's elite

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
to feel the pain.

136
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,000
Enter phase two.

137
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,756
I won't spoil the reveal.

138
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,074
Hurry outside for a little taste

139
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,874
of what's to come.

140
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
<i>Ciao, mon ami.</i>

141
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,075
He's outside. Let's go.

142
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
GCPD.

143
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,835
GCPD.

144
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,913
Make way. GCPD.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,240
- Back up. Back up.
- Excuse me.

146
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,429
Are they dead?

147
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,669
Get forensics here.

148
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,435
And I want this whole area
closed off. No press.

149
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,796
That pig's eating that guy.

150
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,034
Now, Harper.

151
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,871
Excuse me. Excuse me.

152
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Where's breakfast?

153
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,915
Breakfast was produced and consumed
by yours truly at breakfast time.

154
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,277
It is now a fast approaching
Iuncheon, Master Bruce.

155
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,839
Whatever. Just give me a coffee.

156
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Enjoying the benefits

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,671
of another night out on the tiles
with Tommy Elliot

158
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,751
and his band of miscreants, are we?

159
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,278
How absolutely delightful.

160
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,376
I know what you're going through,
you know, Master Bruce.

161
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Yeah?

162
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,910
I went out with my friends.
I'm hungover.

163
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,296
It doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.

164
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,879
You're lost is what you are.

165
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,669
I've seen that countless times
in young men.

166
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,518
Going off to war with a clear purpose

167
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,473
only to return home to a normal life,
unable to assimilate,

168
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,079
confused, angry.

169
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,320
And they make a complete tosh of it.

170
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,951
I don't really care.

171
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,758
You killed Ra's al Ghul.

172
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,478
Vengeance for your parents' death

173
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,312
has been your driving force for so long.

174
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,473
You are completely lost without it.

175
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I need to call Tommy.

176
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,080
Have you forgotten what day it is today?

177
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,630
- Give me my phone.
- You have, ain't you?

178
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,597
Today is the day
my father took me camping.

179
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,353
We put a rock on top of Mount Bristol.

180
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,750
We did it every year.
Now give me my phone.

181
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,318
You are Bruce Wayne,
son of Thomas Wayne.

182
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,920
And the sooner you start
remembering that, the better.

183
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,955
S0, you drink your coffee.

184
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,916
You go upstairs, you put your kit on
'cause you and I,

185
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,989
we're going for a walk.

186
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,351
According to the medical examiner,

187
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,393
both victims had been
living outdoors for some time,

188
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,834
most likely homeless.

189
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,235
Now, see these incisions.

190
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
He removed their organs.

191
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,759
- Any idea why?
- Not yet.

192
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,910
The Pyg all but announced
that his next victims

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,434
would be the rich and powerful.

194
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,119
The high in Gotham.

195
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,958
So why is he killing the homeless?

196
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,280
You are asking for logic
from a psychopath.

197
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,240
From him, yeah. Everything he's done
has been thought through carefully.

198
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,710
There was a card on the table in French.

199
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,073
It said. "Long live the revolution."

200
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,630
Maybe he's using them
to make a statement.

201
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,354
He wants the city's attention.

202
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
For what?

203
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,189
He said this is just a taste
of what's to come.

204
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,113
There's a piece that's still missing.

205
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,753
The homeless are densest in The Narrows

206
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,035
I'm gonna start there.

207
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,952
A hell of a first day to be captain.

208
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Yeah.

209
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,800
Call me if you find anything else.

210
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,856
We checked all buildings
in the three-block radius, Captain.

211
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Nothing.

212
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,117
AII right. Widen it out
a couple of blocks.

213
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,476
Focus on buildings
with protected loading docks.

214
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,270
Captain, that was Lucius Fox.

215
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,115
Final tox came back.

216
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,238
Both victims had sodium sulfide
and chlorine residue on their skin.

217
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,516
He says it's common
in paper manufacturing.

218
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,997
There's an old paper plant
a few blocks from here

219
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,430
that closed down a while back.
Let's check that out.

220
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
Backup still incoming. Should we wait?

221
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
No.

222
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
GORDON: Over here.

223
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
What is he doing to them?

224
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,754
Taking their organs.

225
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
HARPER: A smoker oven?

226
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
He's cooking them.

227
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Harper.

228
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,476
Drop the gun, Captain.

229
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
Shoot this bastard.

230
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Drop m

231
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,995
Thank you.

232
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,355
You found me too soon, James.

233
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,636
The table is not yet set
and no meal should be served

234
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,155
before its time.

235
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,074
You want a hostage? Take me.

236
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,151
No, no, no, no, no.
That won't do at all.

237
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,798
You must see my final act.

238
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,073
Along with all of Gotham!

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,798
Right. Well, it's a lovely day for it.

240
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Best foot forward.

241
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,555
Very distinguished.

242
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,760
Sofia tells me you're taking part
in a performance this evening.

243
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,871
Well, she's quite a lady, isn't she?

244
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,158
She's been a friend to both of us.

245
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,395
Or has she?

246
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
Martin.

247
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,470
I worry Sofia is only
pretending to be my friend.

248
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
And worse,

249
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,679
I fear she may be using you.

250
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Now.

251
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,800
I have been
running this over in my mind.

252
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,433
And there are two ways
this might have gone.

253
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,476
One, Sofia chose a specific orphan, you,

254
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,480
to place in my path. She groomed you,

255
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,639
she told you how to act.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Or,

257
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,919
Sofia simply
collected a group of children

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,753
hoping one would gain my trust,

259
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,558
and make me easier to manipulate.

260
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,637
In this version. you are innocent.

261
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Martin.

262
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,359
This is the version
I very badly want to believe.

263
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,995
But I need proof

264
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,240
of our friendship.

265
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,836
I need to know
if my suspicions are correct.

266
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,920
And if so, what Sofia is planning.

267
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,513
And who she is planning it with.

268
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,436
I need you to be my eyes and my ears.

269
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,520
Do you think you could do that?

270
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,153
Don't let me down, Martin.

271
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Please.

272
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,517
<i>GORDON: I want a city-wide BOLO
on that van.</i>

273
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,196
I want every cop in Gotham
on the streets looking for Harper.

274
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,591
She will not be the Pyg's next victim.

275
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
- Go.
- AII right.

276
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,236
- AII right. Let's go.
- Let's go.

277
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,280
- Captain Gordon.
- Captain Gordon!

278
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,794
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

279
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,599
Is it true that the serial killer
known as the Pyg is back?

280
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,117
That he's responsible for the scene
outside the GCPD this morning?

281
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,114
We believe so, yes.

282
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,714
We've also heard
he's kidnapped a GCPD detective.

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,640
How can you
keep the people of Gotham safe

284
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,796
when you can't protect
your own officers?

285
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,672
We remain hopeful
for Detective Harper's safe return.

286
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Let me be clear.

287
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,796
The GCPD will stop this monster.

288
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,038
- Thafs a promise.
- And if you fail.

289
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,316
Will you be pushed aside
like Harvey Bullock was?

290
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,440
We're done here. Thank you.

291
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,595
Captain Gordon!

292
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,639
What about the rumor that the Pyg
is now cooking his victims?

293
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Who told you that?

294
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Is it true?

295
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,152
As I said, the GCPD
will bring the Pyg to justice.

296
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,475
That's all.

297
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,718
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

298
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,280
Someone leaked to the press
that the Pyg is cooking his victims.

299
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,434
Maybe it was the Pyg.

300
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,794
We know he wants attention.

301
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
Look, Jim.

302
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,077
Everyone in the department
is on your side.

303
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Yeah.

304
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,273
There is something you need to see.

305
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,359
"I gran! this food
will be somewhat dear,

306
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,399
["and therefore
ven] proper for landlords who.

307
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,838
"As they have already devoured
most of the parents,

308
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,480
"seem to have the best title
to the children."

309
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,635
It's Jonathan Swift, <i>A</i> Modest Proposal.

310
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,395
He made an argument for cannibalism
about the rich eating the poor.

311
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,834
The poor are the homeless.

312
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
But who are the rich?

313
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,036
Swift didn't just talk about
the rich eating the poor.

314
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,111
He specifically mentioned the orphans.

315
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
I know where he's going.

316
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,030
He left this for me.

317
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,834
He's doing exactly what he did
with Harvey. It could be a trap.

318
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,080
And I won't lead more officers
to their deaths.

319
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,231
- You're going alone?
- I'm sorry, Lucius.

320
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,190
Where's Chef Louis?

321
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,832
<i>Ici, mademoiselle.</i>

322
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,515
It's such a pleasure
to meet you in person.

323
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,639
I was expecting you earlier.

324
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,712
Apologies. I was detained.

325
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,873
But I've made
a small change in the menu.

326
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,470
I've steered us away from haute cuisine

327
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,396
to something a bit more mundane.

328
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
<i>Voila.</i>

329
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,716
I'm calling them Gotham meat pies.

330
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,438
Your guests will die for them.

331
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,634
I've made us a delicious
brown English stew

332
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,393
with herb dumplings, Master Bruce.

333
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,158
Your father used to love it
when I made stew.

334
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,154
Did I ever tell you
howl met your old man?

335
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
In London.

336
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,876
He was doing postgrad work there.
He told me.

337
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,075
Yeah, but no details.

338
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,356
Well, I was just out of the army.
Two months.

339
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,914
I don't remember any of it.

340
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,753
Alla bit of blur, really.
Booze, drugs, brawling.

341
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,033
A sucking great black cloud.

342
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,077
One day I wake up
and I'm lying in this alley.

343
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,389
And I'm covered in blood.

344
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,955
Don't know how.

345
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,676
So, I picked myself up,
I took myself straight down

346
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,280
to the police station, turn myself in,

347
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,715
hoping that they would chuck me
into the big house

348
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,075
and throw away the key.

349
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,874
And they told me to shut up,
sit down and wait.

350
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,991
And there was this really annoying
Yank wandering about,

351
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,912
dressed like he's ready
for a game of tennis,

352
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,070
and it was your dad.

353
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,793
Anyway, he bowls up to me
and asks me what I'd done.

354
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,835
Asking me questions.

355
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,911
Eventually, you know,
I found myself telling him

356
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,875
stuff that I was too frightened
even to think about.

357
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
But I guess it'd just been building.

358
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,510
Anyway, at that point,
the desk sergeant called him over

359
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,557
and your dad turned around
at me, and he said,

360
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,792
"Alfred, last night, Iwas
being attacked in the alley.

361
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,238
"And you started fighting this geezer.

362
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,920
"I headed on my toes, and I ran away."

363
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,159
And I said, "Yeah, but that's not
what happened, is it, Thomas?"

364
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,349
And he says, "It is now."

365
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,640
Your father saved my life.

366
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,599
His friendship saved me.

367
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,116
You see, I know what
it's all like being lonely,

368
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,669
hoping that the world will punish you.

369
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
I can help you.

370
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,596
- Bruce, listen to me...
- Alfred, I hear you.

371
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,200
I just don't want
to talk about this right now.

372
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
AII right.

373
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,360
Well, this looks lovely.

374
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,830
The rocks are gone.
They musfve fell out in the car.

375
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,633
The keys are in the bag, just there.

376
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,314
(ENGINE STARTING)

377
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,951
- BeautifuL
- So nice to see you, dear.

378
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
- Thanks.
- Yes.

379
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,549
Oswald. you came!

380
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,469
Look at you two.

381
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,035
So handsome.

382
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,509
I know how important
tonighfs party is to you.

383
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,158
And I wouldn't have forgiven myself

384
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,072
if I had missed Martin's performance.

385
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,520
Why don't you go
find the other children?

386
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,115
Did you locate the mayor?

387
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,595
Unfortunately, no.

388
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,837
But I've not given up hope.

389
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,080
Well, I, for one, am happy.

390
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,760
This way you get to come to my dinner.

391
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,431
I need to go check on the chef.
He seems a bit odd.

392
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,754
Please. try and enjoy yourself.

393
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Hello, Martin.

394
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
What are you writing?

395
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Don't make a noise.

396

(SHUSHING)

397
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,152
I'm a cop. Who are you?

398
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,269
A waiter.

399
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,632
I'm looking for a man.
Caucasian, about five foot ten.

400
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,718
He would've brought the food.
Maybe the chef.

401
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,630
The chef's in the kitchen

402
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,673
Look, Ijust got hired tonight.

403
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,256
Whatever the dude's into,
I have no idea.

404
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,475
You're okay. You're okay.

405
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,837
Do me a favor.
Find Ms. Falcone, bring her to me.

406
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,479
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah.

407
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,840
What's that in your jacket?

408
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
I don't...

409
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,077
Jim Gordon really is
an impressive policeman.

410
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,357
- Was he alone?
- It seems so.

411
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,635
But, man.

412
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,878
Whatever it is you're into.

413
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,554
My partner and I,
our rates just doubled.

Harper.

416
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,791
Hi, friends. The Falcone orphanage

417
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,918
is the realization
of a long-cherished dream.

418
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,197
And one that
would have not been possible

419
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,954
without your support. So, thank you.

420
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,470
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

421
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,416
Now. if you could please
take your seats in the next room.

422
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,158
A few of the children
have prepared a song.

423
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Where's Martin?

424
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,473
I wanted to wish him luck.

425
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,478
Ah. Off getting ready, no doubt.

426
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,400
Oswald. I've been thinking.

427
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,112
Maybe things happened for a reason.

428
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,352
Licensing crime was a bold move,

429
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,238
but it would've destroyed you.

430
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,519
Whoever had Jim Gordon
appointed captain.

431
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,754
May actually have saved you.

432
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,158
By attempting to destroy
everything I ever created?

433
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,873
- Oswald...
- Enough!

434
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,080
If you're going to confess, confess.

435
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,718
And face the consequences.

The servers are getting everyone seated.

439
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,831
We don't want the food to get cold.

440
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,795
Shall we go in to dinner?

441
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,189

I stopped the bleeding, I think.

That's the best I can do
until I can get you out of here.

445
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,795
I gotta get that door open.

446
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,791
- Gordon.
- Maybe I can get the hinges off.

447
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
Gordon.

448
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,554
Idiots forgot to search me.

449

No.

Don't.

Now, to answer your question, my dear,

the other children and your staff
are safely locked in the kitchen.

of Gotham for years.

Well, these are made of people.

Yes.

you wouldn't listen.

There seemed no other way.

554
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,759
Of course, it's equally plausible
that you are my enemy

you went behind my back.

going to do for Martin.
