1
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,406
Illuminat...

2
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:32,492
Illuminat...

3
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:34,661
Illuminat...

4
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,460
Illumination!

5
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:57,225
The year was 1985,

6
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,644
and the number one
show on TV was...

7
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:02,105
Evil Bratt!

8
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:06,443
<i>The show starred young
Balthazar Bratt as a child prodigy</i>

9
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:10,989
<i>and criminal mastermind
bent on world domination.</i>

10
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:12,490
<i>There he is! Get him!</i>

11
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,080
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

12
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,958
Bratt was the biggest
child actor of the 1980s,

13
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:25,378
<i>striking a chord with
audiences all over the world.</i>

14
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,215
<i>There he is! Get him!</i>

15
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:32,719
<i>But it all came
to an end in Season 3, when...</i>

16
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,680
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

17
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,616
<i>The young star experienced
an unexpected growth spurt.</i>

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,058
<i>Boy? Ugh!</i>

19
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:42,395
The show was canceled.
Hollywood rejected him

20
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:45,482
<i>and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral,</i>

21
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:50,820
<i>starting to actually believe he was
the character he played on TV.</i>

22
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,447
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

23
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,824
<i>Leading us all
to wonder,</i>

24
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,951
<i>where is he now?</i>

25
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,709
You know what, Clive?

26
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,212
Playing a villain
on TV was fun,

27
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:10,840
but being one in real life
is even better.

28
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,217
Heist music!

29
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:13,510
Here it comes.

30
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,057
What? Clive, what are you doing?

31
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,809
How is that
heist music?

32
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,393
Sorry. My bad.

33
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,637
Ew!

34
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,309
Mommy!

35
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,937
Stop or I'll...

36
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:12,026
Sir, the ship has been boarded
by some kind of monster!

37
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,150
Wait! That's not
a monster.

38
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,614
That's a man
wearing shoulder pads!

39
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,324
There's only
one supervillain

40
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:20,660
whose fashion sense
is quite that dated.

41
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:22,620
Balthazar Bratt.

42
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,373
Blast it! The Dumont
Diamond is on that ship.

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,544
<i>I want every agent in the area
on the scene immediately!</i>

44
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,677
We're already here.
Agents Grucy are closing fast.

45
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,471
Yes! Wait.
What did you call us?

46
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:43,808
"Grucy." You know, Gru and
Lucy mushed together. Try it.

47
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,769
Oh! I like it,
but not a lot.

48
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:47,854
I don't like it.

49
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,069
Stop!
On the ground!

50
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,594
Go, go, go!

51
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,351
Eh?

52
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,028
Too late again, Gru!

53
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,579
Wha?

54
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:47,747
He's getting away!

55
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,582
That's what he thinks.

56
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,048
Go! Go! Go...

57
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,718
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!

58
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,265
I don't think we
can make it, Gru!

59
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,392
We can make it!

60
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:12,605
We can make it!

61
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,401
No, we can't!

62
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:17,652
Ahh!

63
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:18,987
Get ready!

64
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,490
Get ready for...

65
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,503
Hey. How you doing?

66
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,298
Are you okay?

67
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,969
You guys are so cute.

68
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,595
Go get him, Gru-Gru!

69
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,723
Hello, Gru.

70
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,600
How's your
transition coming?

71
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,477
You know,
from world's worst villain

72
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,312
to world's
worst agent?

73
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,690
Oh, that's hilarious.
You should be on TV.

74
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:59,360
Oh, that's right. You were!
But then you got canceled!

75
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:01,237
Ha-ha!

76
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,156
What about that?
Ugh!

77
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,117
What? Oh, girls!
Oh!

78
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:09,995
Dance fight!

79
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:24,385
Ow!

80
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:32,143
Alpha Team, the diamond is secure.
Come and pick up the package.

81
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,520
<i>Copy that.
Alpha Team in approach.</i>

82
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,152
Gru!

83
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:43,571
Did you actually
think I was unconscious?

84
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:46,115
Huh! It's called acting,
hoser.

85
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,534
And clearly,
I've still got it!

86
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:06,219
I've been a bad boy!

87
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,281
Freeze! Don't move!

88
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:10,515
Son of a Betamax!

89
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,183
Go, go! Get him!

90
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,893
He's getting away!

91
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,312
This isn't over, Gru.

92
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:19,357
You hear me?
This is not over.

93
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,235
Yeah? Well,
I still have the diamond.

94
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,279
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

95
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,032
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

96
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:33,996
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dan</i>

97
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:39,210
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

98
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,285
I can't believe
Bratt got away again.

99
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,328
How is this
possible? How?

100
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,088
And it's not just
that he got away,

101
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:25,882
it is he's so
smug about it.

102
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:29,177
"Ooh, I've been
a bad boy!"

103
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:33,097
Gah! Edna, hey!
Looking hot today.

104
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,141
Got cats on you.

105
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:40,271
And it was so humiliating, dangling
there in the bubble-gum Speedo.

106
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,191
And I didn't have time to
go to the gym this week,

107
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:47,904
and I had a big breakfast.
And was feeling a little bloated.

108
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:52,283
You know what?
He's not even worth talking about.

109
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,454
I don't even want to waste
another breath about the guy.

110
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,456
And another thing!

111
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:03,377
Next time I see Bratt, I will
moonwalk all over his stupid face!

112
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:11,219
Thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

113
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:16,641
It is with great sadness that I
inform you that, as of today,

114
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:20,436
I am retiring as
head of the AVL.

115
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:23,731
Oh, no!

116
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:29,195
Your new leader is coming
directly from head office.

117
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,656
Effective immediately.

118
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,909
She is the very gifted,

119
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:39,080
very ambitious,
Miss Valerie da Vinci.

120
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,209
As I look out
over all your faces,

121
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:45,753
I am flooded with
so many memories.

122
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,422
Oh, boy!
This is a snooze fest!

123
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:49,524
Excuse me,
this is my last...

124
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,567
Blah, blah, blah!
We understand.

125
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,802
You're old, you're fat,
you're done.

126
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:54,762
Let me breathe in.

127
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,975
Ooh, broke a little sweat,
there.

128
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,061
First order of business,

129
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,897
which one of you losers
is Agent Gru?

130
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,442
Oh, that would be me.

131
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,780
Although, I don't know if
I'd say "loser," per se.

132
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,449
Kind of is...

133
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,702
Oh, it's the girls!

134
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,996
Not a good time.

135
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,205
Hey!
Ahh!

136
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,249
Yes, sir!
Uh...

137
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,710
Ma'am?
You're making me nervous.

138
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,963
How could you let
Balthazar Bratt,

139
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,215
the AVL's most
wanted villain,

140
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:32,550
just get away?

141
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,885
That is the opposite
of what we do here!

142
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,095
Okay, okay.

143
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,098
Yes, maybe
he got away. Again.

144
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,892
But he didn't
get the diamond.

145
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,937
And I am this close
to bringing him in.

146
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,231
This close.

147
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,066
Huh. Interesting.

148
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,443
You're fired!

149
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,861
What?

150
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,572
That's totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent!

151
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:55,990
You know what?
If you fire him,

152
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,409
you're gonna have to
fire me, sister-sister.

153
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,453
And do you
really wanna do that?

154
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,079
Do ya?

155
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,206
No, no, no!

156
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,839
Well, I guess
she did.

157
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,513
Honey, you didn't
have to do that.

158
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,265
I know how much
you love your job.

159
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:23,601
Well, I love
other things more.

160
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,856
You know, we're gonna
have to tell the girls.

161
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,691
Can you do it?

162
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:33,444
The whole "mom" thing
is still kind of new to me.

163
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,945
Oh, sure.

164
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,157
Huh?

165
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,951
Psst!

166
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,003
Hello?

167
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,182
<i>Aloha!</i>

168
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,309
Oh!

169
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,521
This is unexpected.

170
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,940
Well, you never got to
go on a honeymoon, so...

171
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,358
We made you dinner!

172
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,567
It's a luau!

173
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:16,445
We got pineapples and
coconuts and ukuleles!

174
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,280
Oh! Yay!
Yay!

175
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,422
The soup of the day.

176
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,048
<i>Madame</i> and <i>Monsieur.</i>

177
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,384
The gummy bears
were my idea.

178
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,350
Mmm! Looks too good
to even eat.

179
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:47,726
Am I right?

180
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,604
But I made it
for you. Oh.

181
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,775
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

182
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:58,487
Good soup!
I love the combination

183
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,322
of gummy bears

184
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,657
and meat.

185
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,206
I'm gonna hold it
in my mouth.

186
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,173
'Cause it's so good,
I don't wanna swallow it.

187
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,793
So, how was work?

188
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,130
Ooh, did you take that guy down?
Did anything explode?

189
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:18,757
Well, actually,

190
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:23,429
today, Lucy and I were
invited to not work

191
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,389
at the AVL anymore.

192
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,892
No!

193
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,312
You got fired?

194
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,647
Oh, no!
No, no, no.

195
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,859
Yes.

196
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,736
But don't worry.

197
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,489
I'm sure we'll get
new jobs. Real soon.

198
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,866
Even better ones.

199
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,660
What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?

200
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,664
Ooh, I know!
You could gamble online!

201
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,666
That's what
Katie's dad does.

202
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,711
Okay. We will definitely
look into that.

203
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,546
That's a good
suggestion.

204
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:01,342
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.

205
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,094
Hmm?

206
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:10,518
Guys! Shh! I don't think
you heard me right.

207
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,810
No, no, no.

208
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,563
This does not mean that we are
going back to being villains.

209
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,735
Okay, all right.
I get it.

210
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,446
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately.

211
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:27,701
Especially with Dr. Nefario accidentally
freezing himself in carbonite.

212
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,083
But our life of crime
is over!

213
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:38,504
Mel! Mel, you're
with me on this, right?

214
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:00,609
Guys, listen to me!
Read my lips!

215
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:08,993
What? What?

216
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,745
Oh... What did I say?
It's not "comquit"?

217
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,539
Ah, okay.

218
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,626
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

219
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,172
Don't take that tone with me!
We're not going back to villainy.

220
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,510
Yes! And I don't want to
hear another word about it.

221
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,269
Look, if you guys don't stop right now,
there will be consequences.

222
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,898
Hey! Don't say anything
you're going to regret.

223
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,030
What? You quit?

224
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,158
You're serious?
Come on!

225
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,499
Dave! Jerry!

226
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,045
Great news, guys.
You have been promoted.

227
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,256
You're in charge now.
Huh? Not bad.

228
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,642
Jeesh!

229
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,913
Ah,
<i>Monsieur</i> Pompeux!

230
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,166
To what do we owe
the presence

231
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,252
of the world's
foremost gem expert?

232
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,421
The chief of police
sent me.

233
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,508
He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,

234
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,969
the Dumont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.

235
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:09,822
Ooh, la-la!

236
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,366
You have been duped!

237
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,118
What? We have?

238
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,452
Yes.

239
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:16,954
By me!

240
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:21,625
But, what is...

241
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,255
Oh, no! Help!

242
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:43,981
Ooh!

243
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,152
I've been a bad boy!

244
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,653
Or should I say...

245
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,172
Oh!

246
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,279
Hey, Gru.

247
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,198
What you doing
down here?

248
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,992
In the dark. Alone.

249
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,203
Oh, nothing.
Just thinking.

250
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,330
You okay?

251
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,041
Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

252
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,043
It's just...

253
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,922
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like

254
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,632
a failure.

255
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,301
Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.

256
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,429
Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.

257
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,933
If only I could
have nailed Bratt.

258
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:04,436
So many times,
I almost had him.

259
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,231
But now I'll never
get the chance,

260
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,733
'cause I have been
kicked to the curb.

261
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,318
Gru, you've got
to let this go.

262
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,070
It's time to
look forward.

263
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,405
Things will get
better. I promise.

264
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,346
Excuse me.

265
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,516
Pardon me, young people?

266
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,686
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?

267
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,025
I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.

268
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,498
Idiots.

269
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,712
No! Kyle!

270
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,755
Stop! Kyle, let go!

271
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,094
No! No!

272
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,138
You've got to be kidding me!

273
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,222
Lucy, did you...

274
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,986
He helps you if
you have nightmares.

275
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,435
And he's really
good to snuggle with.

276
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:27,978
Oh, no, no, no.
Agnes! Agnes!

277
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,147
So
take good care of him.

278
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,940
Thank you!

279
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,234
Agnes, what are
you doing?

280
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,403
You sold your unicorn?

281
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:41,074
Well, I just wanted to help,
since you don't have a job.

282
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,993
I got two whole
dollars for it.

283
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,706
Uh, excuse me?

284
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,917
Sorry, buddy,
the sale's over.

285
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,710
Yes, but this will
only take a...

286
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,338
Hey, eyebrows,
get off the lawn.

287
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,589
Yeah, but...

288
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,882
Hey, could you...

289
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,842
Oh, uh, of course.

290
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,386
Now, as I was
saying, I...

291
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,596
Uh... Oh.

292
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,139
Goodbye!

293
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,690
Listen, Agnes, you don't need to worry.
We're going to be fine.

294
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:14,858
For real?

295
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,026
For real.

296
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,320
Now, come on,
let's pack this stuff up.

297
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,197
Ow! Ow!
Seriously?

298
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,658
Buddy, you're not
getting the hint.

299
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,494
Excuse me, Mr. Gru,

300
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,747
but I really must
have a word with you.

301
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,415
How do you know my name?

302
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,961
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Fritz.

303
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,754
Ow!

304
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,047
Good puppy.

305
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:41,593
And I am inquiring on behalf
of your twin brother, Dru.

306
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,178
He needs your help.

307
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,888
What? Twin brother?

308
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,015
Twin brother?

309
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:48,392
Oh, <i>ja.</i>

310
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,645
He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.

311
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,690
Your father has recently
passed away and...

312
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,775
Okay, cuckoo.

313
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,820
I'm sorry, but my dad
died when I was a baby,

314
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,489
and I don't have any brother.
You got the wrong guy.

315
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:07,285
Really? Well, then,
how do you explain this?

316
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,795
<i>Bellissimo!</i>

317
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,340
Oh, hello, Gru.

318
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:21,508
Hi, Mom.

319
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,554
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.

320
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,222
Oh!

321
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,808
There you are,
you cutie, you.

322
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,435
Oh!

323
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,689
Uh, these are my
diving instructors.

324
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:39,109
Vincenzo <i>und</i> Paolo.

325
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,695
Ciao, boys.

326
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,448
So, what do you want?

327
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,701
Mom, do I have
a twin brother?

328
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,954
Ah! How did you find out?
Who told you?

329
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,539
Wait, what? It's true?

330
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,583
You never told me
I had a brother!

331
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,170
And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born.

332
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:01,423
<i>Ja, ja</i>.
That was the agreement.

333
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,468
Agreement?
What are you talking about?

334
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,891
Shortly after you and
your brother were born,

335
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,185
your father and I divorced.

336
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:16,563
We each took one son
to raise on our own

337
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:20,025
and promised never to
see each other again.

338
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,612
Obviously,

339
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,655
I got second pick.

340
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,452
I have a brother!

341
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,003
Hey, girls!
How are things in Row B, huh?

342
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,631
I put together some fun
activities for the trip!

343
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,717
Who is up for
some gin rummy?

344
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,677
Yeah, um...

345
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,638
We're good.

346
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,598
Oh, okay.

347
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,017
I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.

348
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,519
I hope I win.

349
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,272
I wonder what Dru
will be like. Ooh!

350
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,941
Maybe we'll
have the twin thing

351
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,027
when you can read
each other's minds, no?

352
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,779
How cool would that be?

353
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,531
Um, super cool!

354
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,583
Ooh!

355
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:28,885
Freedonia!
Freedonia! Freedonia!

356
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,054
Hi, piggy, piggy!

357
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:34,182
Whoa!
Look at that house!

358
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,226
It's like a castle!

359
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,896
I can't wait to
meet my brother!

360
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,649
Ugh. What's with
all the pigs?

361
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,110
This is
the family business.

362
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:48,488
The largest pig farm in
the whole of Freedonia.

363
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:52,033
Okay, nice pig.

364
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,578
No! That's my
private part!

365
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,541
This pig has issues!

366
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,002
Please, come in.

367
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,514
Oh, this is amazing!

368
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:18,560
Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel!
But with pigs.

369
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,109
My brother!

370
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,407
My brother!

371
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:33,617
Gru!

372
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:34,951
Dru!

373
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,167
Oh!

374
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,088
Brother! I am hugging you!

375
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,757
I'm so happy!

376
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:53,136
After all of these years,
finally I'm meeting you!

377
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,013
Yup. All right.
Good.

378
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,390
Oh, look at that.

379
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,935
You must be
the beautiful wife.

380
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,895
Beautiful?
Oh!

381
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,980
Stop it.
Sweet talker.

382
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,107
How is my brother
finding a wife like you

383
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,901
when he is so bald?

384
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,527
I'm joking!

385
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:15,116
These
must be my nieces!

386
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,204
You're Agnes!
You are small with big eyes.

387
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,289
And it makes me wanna
put you into my pocket.

388
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,916
You can't do that!

389
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,834
I'm too big.

390
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:29,714
Edith! I can tell that you
are a little mischievous.

391
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:32,092
We're gonna have to make
a little trouble later.

392
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,344
I already have!

393
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,930
Ow! Ow! Please!

394
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,182
Why are you
doing that? Ow!

395
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:43,061
Fist bump for
mischievous behavior!

396
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,189
And Margo.
Oh, you are so mature!

397
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,817
I'm guessing...
Mmm... 15?

398
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,360
15?

399
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,863
She's 12. She looks 12
and will always be 12.

400
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,033
So, Dru, this place
is amazing!

401
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,452
I mean, you just walk through
the doors and you're like...

402
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,456
Oh, it's nice,
I guess, sure.

403
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,834
I'm not really into things.

404
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,131
- This is so cool!
- Look at that!

405
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,508
Oh, my gosh!
He's even got a helicopter!

406
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,926
This is the best!

407
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,846
Yes, the best!

408
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:19,282
All right,
let's go home now.

409
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:20,390
Home? Why?

410
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:24,019
I don't know. This guy with
the mansion and the cars

411
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:28,732
and all of the hair, with the
silky smooth, luxurious hair.

412
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,151
I feel worse than
I did before I came.

413
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,321
But he's your brother, Gru.
Give this a chance.

414
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:35,923
Oh, I was thinking,
while Gru and I

415
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:37,657
catch up on
some brother stuff,

416
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:40,452
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you!

417
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,995
Yay!
Awesome!

418
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,288
I love surprises!

419
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,415
Oh, this is perfect!
Mother-daughter bonding time.

420
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,708
Let's do it!
Woot-woot!

421
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,878
Bye! You boys
have fun!

422
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:52,255
Whoopi!

423
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,927
<i>Now you can be as
evil as Balthazar Bratt</i>

424
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,305
<i>with the</i> Evil Bratt
<i>action figure.</i>

425
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:04,059
<i>Featuring music-activated
breakdance mode.</i>

426
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:07,645
<i>Also featuring bubblegum-launching
shoulder pads!</i>

427
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:12,108
<i>And the all-new
Mega Diamond Laser!</i>

428
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,528
<i>No more math!</i>

429
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,073
<i>I've been a bad boy!</i>

430
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,452
<i>The Mega Diamond Laser
does not actually incinerate books.</i>

431
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,205
How could
Hollywood cancel a show

432
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,499
that produced toys
like this, Clive?

433
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,835
<i>Evil Bratt</i> was
a masterpiece!

434
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,463
Does no one value
true art anymore?

435
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,715
It's a disgrace
and a travesty, sir.

436
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:39,552
Well, now that I've got the
diamond, it's payback time.

437
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:43,598
Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be
around to try and stop me.

438
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,351
Oh, wait! No, it's not.
I hate that dweeb!

439
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,186
And you, Hollywood!

440
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:51,439
This time, I'm canceling you

441
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,234
and all the losers
who rejected me!

442
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,741
Oh, piggy, piggy!

443
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:05,078
So, how are things going
for you career-wise?

444
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,790
Great!
So, so great!

445
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:09,999
Crushing it.

446
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,585
Well, I've got
something that I think

447
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,839
you will find
very interesting.

448
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,968
Hold onto your
face, brother.

449
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,227
Yee-haw!
Yah, yah!

450
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,071
Ow!

451
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:51,833
Come on!
Come on!

452
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,171
What is all this?

453
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:01,009
The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.

454
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:11,352
Now, feast
your eyes on

455
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,564
Dad's lair!

456
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,274
Ta-da!

457
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:19,319
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

458
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:22,489
So, our dad was a villain?

459
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:24,866
No, no, no,
not just a villain.

460
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:28,077
One of the greatest
of all time!

461
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:32,248
He was known as
the Bald Terror!

462
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:36,002
That's him? Our dad?

463
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,506
He was so proud of you.
And what a great villain you were.

464
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,174
He was?

465
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:44,844
But me, eh,
not so much.

466
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:49,974
To Dad, I was
just a failure.

467
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,394
He never thought I had what
it took to be a villain.

468
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:56,689
But now, you can help
me prove him wrong!

469
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:58,900
Brother,

470
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,903
teach me
the art of villainy!

471
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,031
No.

472
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,950
No, no, no.
I can't do that.

473
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,744
What?
But it's our family tradition!

474
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,371
You can't say
no to that!

475
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,665
Look, I'm sorry.

476
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:16,751
I left that life behind me.
End of story.

477
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,044
Oh.

478
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,172
Okay. I understand.

479
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:23,800
Hmm! I wonder
what this does.

480
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:41,943
Holy moley!

481
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,153
Dad's villain wheels!

482
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,489
Pretty slick, huh?

483
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:50,952
Hey, you wanna take her out for a spin?
Just for some fun?

484
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,038
Mmm!

485
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:01,004
Oh, oh, oh! Look out!

486
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,551
What a beautiful day!

487
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,178
Zero to 400
in three seconds.

488
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,055
Able to withstand
a nuclear blast.

489
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,557
Armed to the teeth.

490
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:17,103
Okay, that's pretty nice.

491
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,230
And it's a hybrid.
Look out!

492
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:43,838
Help me!

493
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:49,385
I am not enjoying this.

494
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,606
Whoa! What is
going on here?

495
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:05,234
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese Festival.

496
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:06,569
Go!

497
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:14,035
Look, look!
Look at all the candies!

498
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:16,871
Whoa!
Eep, eep, eep!

499
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,916
Lucy, can we get these?
Please.

500
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,044
Okay, but only
one each. I mean it.

501
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:24,671
Aw!
Oh, man!

502
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,132
No, I don't. Get as
many as you want. I don't care.

503
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,926
Yay! Awesome!

504
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:31,636
Uh...
What?

505
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:35,473
Well, it's okay to tell them
no sometimes, too, you know?

506
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,016
Moms need to be tough.

507
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,143
Right, right.
Tough. Good one.

508
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:40,520
I can totally do that.

509
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:42,647
You know, still figuring
out this mom thing.

510
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:45,233
Gettin' my sea legs, matey!

511
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,151
It's a unicorn!

512
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:54,158
Can we go in there?
Please, please, please!

513
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,665
Um... Sure! Yeah!
You know, but first let's...

514
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,667
Um...
Oh, look!

515
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,086
It's a traditional
Freedonian dance.

516
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,796
How amazing does that look?

517
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,507
<i>Say, say, say cheese!</i>

518
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:12,009
Cheese! I love this.

519
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,722
The little girls go and get the
cheese from the little boys.

520
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:17,306
That's adorable!

521
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:23,896
Aw, look at that poor little guy.
With his little boots.

522
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,773
Nobody picked him.

523
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,401
Oh, Margo, why don't
you go up there?

524
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:29,569
No way!

525
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:30,820
Okay.

526
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,113
Wait a minute.

527
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,573
No!

528
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,908
Go take a bite of
his cheese, young lady.

529
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:38,161
Right now!
What?

530
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,204
I'm being tougher, you know?
Like you said.

531
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:43,458
No! I meant be tougher on them.
Not me!

532
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:46,377
Oh, come on, just do it.
What's the worst that could happen?

533
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,171
Mmm...

534
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,548
Fine.

535
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:56,679
Wow!

536
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,724
Hey, there.
I'm Margo.

537
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:02,101
Hello, Margo!

538
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,686
I am Niko.

539
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,938
Would you like
some of my cheese?

540
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:08,399
Mmm...

541
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:09,668
<i>Say, say, say cheese!</i>

542
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:12,612
Yes! Thank you, Margo.
Thank you!

543
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,282
Bam! I am a great mother!

544
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,910
Did you see that, girls?
I laid down the...

545
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,954
Oh, no! Where are they?

546
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,749
Oh... Agnes? Edith?

547
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:28,753
Hello.

548
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,424
Look!
A unicorn horn!

549
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,514
My little brain is
going to explode!

550
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,891
Agnes, that's fake.

551
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,228
It's real,
all right.

552
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,524
That horn came from
the Crooked Forest.

553
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:54,445
The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.

554
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,202
Huh!

555
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,412
Laugh, laugh, all of you.

556
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,915
They all think
I'm crazy.

557
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:09,252
But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.

558
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,170
With my own eye.

559
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:14,841
Wait, wait, wait.
You saw a for-real live unicorn?

560
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,175
What did it look like?

561
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:18,261
Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?

562
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:21,264
Was it fluffy?

563
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:23,266
It was so fluffy,

564
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,935
I thought
I was gonna die.

565
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:29,272
Mmm! Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?

566
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:32,358
Oh! They say if a maiden
pure of heart

567
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,527
goes into
the Crooked Forest,

568
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,447
the unicorn will
come and be hers.

569
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:39,782
Forever.

570
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,118
Hmm...

571
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:47,874
Agnes!

572
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:54,797
Goal!

573
00:36:56,007 --> 00:36:57,675
Excuse me.

574
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,427
Girls, don't worry.
I'm here.

575
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,345
Are you okay?

576
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,598
Yeah, we're fine.

577
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:05,099
Are you?

578
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,642
Unicorns are really real!

579
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:09,979
And I'm gonna find one!

580
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:14,066
Sorry. Went a little
mama bear on ya.

581
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,902
You know,
I heard a scream and...

582
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,867
Yeah, okay, have a good one.

583
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,659
Wait for me here.

584
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,120
Stop that!
Ah! You kicked me.

585
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,917
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

586
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:34,337
Did you just steal candies?
Yes!

587
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,672
That's a lot of effort
for two lollipops.

588
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,096
Oh, no! The police!

589
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,598
What do we do?
What do we do?

590
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:48,768
Come on!
This is gonna be fun!

591
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,405
The police are gonna get us!
I'm freaking out!

592
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:02,615
Pigs!

593
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,411
Cops!

594
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:24,053
Whoa! They're back!

595
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:27,348
All right!

596
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:51,163
Oh, man,
that was crazy!

597
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:52,748
We were so close
to getting busted.

598
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:53,916
Tell me about it.

599
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,085
I thought you were going
to pee your pants.

600
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:58,129
I did!

601
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,672
You did!

602
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,944
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

603
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,826
Hey! What are
you doing?

604
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,454
Intruders! Intruders!

605
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,919
There they are! Stop!

606
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,296
Hey, you, don't move!

607
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,547
Halt!

608
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,971
Call for backup!

609
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,069
Ooh, uh...

610
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:52,868
Get 'em! Go! Go!

611
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:33,284
Hey, you!
Freeze! Don't move!

612
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,245
Hands in the air!

613
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,714
Face it, Gru. Villainy
is in your blood.

614
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,426
You can't tell me you don't
miss the rush. A little?

615
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:52,011
Uh...

616
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,762
Eh, maybe a little.

617
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,599
And now you've got the
chance to get back on top.

618
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:57,808
Get your mojo back.

619
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,687
Become Gru again.
How awesome would that be?

620
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:03,856
Hmm.

621
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,610
Oh, please, come on.
Just one heist.

622
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:12,156
There's got to be something
out there, somewhere

623
00:42:12,406 --> 00:42:15,576
that you still wanna steal.

624
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:18,370
Huh.

625
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,289
There is something.

626
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:23,375
How about we steal

627
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:26,670
the largest diamond
in the world?

628
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:29,215
Yes! I love it!

629
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,592
Oh, thank you, brother!

630
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:34,470
Thank you from
the bottoms of my heart.

631
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:39,683
Oh, you know what? We should
do something to celebrate!

632
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,310
Oh!

633
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,938
I've got
the perfect idea.

634
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:50,152
Fritz, my good fellow, could you
get me another napkin, please?

635
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,488
Ah, yes.
Of course, Miss Edith.

636
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:00,829
Hey, where are
Gru and Dru?

637
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,998
Here we are!

638
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,251
Oh, how's it going?

639
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,254
It's me! Gru.

640
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,089
And me, Dru.

641
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:14,927
I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.

642
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:17,513
Why are they pretending
to be each other?

643
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:22,685
Ah! What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.

644
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:25,854
I'm so grumpy
all the time. Hmm.

645
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:30,192
I laugh a lot.
And I'm kind of an idiot!

646
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:42,288
Oh, I'm busting a gut!

647
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:45,833
Look at them!
They had no idea!

648
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:47,876
Total burn.

649
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,129
Oh, look, it's me, Gru!

650
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:53,090
And I'm Dru!
We switched places!

651
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,843
Oh, it's so nice to see
you two are getting along.

652
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:58,929
Oh, we're getting...
Along perfectly.

653
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,015
Wait. Did we...
Just finish...

654
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:02,141
Each...
Other's...

655
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,475
Sentences?
Sentences?

656
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,104
Oh, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.

657
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:08,748
And you're gonna stop
now though, right?

658
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,733
Sorry, it's
a twin thing.

659
00:44:11,025 --> 00:44:12,192
Uh-huh...

660
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:15,237
So, uh, what did
you guys do today?

661
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:18,073
Nothing.

662
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:19,658
Okay.
What does it...

663
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:21,493
All done!

664
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:24,079
Pardon me! Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!

665
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:26,832
Hey! Hey! Put the brakes on.
What's the rush?

666
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,668
I need to get to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!

667
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:30,919
Good night!

668
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:34,173
What was that about?

669
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:38,177
Agnes thinks she's gonna find a
real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.

670
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:40,054
She's totally
freaking out.

671
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:42,681
I feel like someone's
gotta tell her the truth.

672
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:43,766
Not it!

673
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:48,187
Oh, don't worry.
Parenting 101. I got this.

674
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:51,690
Um...

675
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:53,942
And please bless that
when I find the unicorn

676
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,653
he'll want to come home with me,
and sleep in my room.

677
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:59,698
And that I can ride him
to school every day.

678
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:03,786
And he'll use his magical
powers to help me do math.

679
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,037
Amen.

680
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:09,124
Oh, hi, Gru.

681
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:13,962
Hey. So, big day tomorrow.

682
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:17,966
Yeah, I'm finally gonna get
to see a unicorn. For reals.

683
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:21,637
If I do, can I bring it home?
Please?

684
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:23,889
Oh, yeah. Sure.

685
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:28,477
Tell you what, every unicorn you find,
you can bring it home.

686
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:31,313
I'd better build
a big pen, right?

687
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:34,983
But, you know,

688
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:38,153
there's a chance that
you might not find one.

689
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:40,239
Huh?

690
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:46,328
It might not be good
unicorn-finding weather.

691
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:52,334
Um... They're tricky
to find them.

692
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:56,588
And I don't know.
Maybe...

693
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:59,842
Maybe unicorns

694
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,303
don't really

695
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:09,518
explore that part of the woods.

696
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:17,025
But the man said a maiden could
find one if she was pure in heart.

697
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:19,653
And I'm pure
in heart, right?

698
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:22,072
The purest.

699
00:46:26,535 --> 00:46:30,038
Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.

700
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:31,373
Good night, sweetie.

701
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:33,083
Good night, Gru.

702
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:36,545
<i>Unicorns, I love them</i>

703
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:39,214
<i>Unicorns, I love them</i>

704
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:42,217
Huh!

705
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,220
I'm okay.

706
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:55,689
Hey! Give
that back!

707
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:01,945
Oh, no! Run!

708
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,766
We've been waiting
a long time. Can we...

709
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:32,184
No!

710
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:34,186
No, please!

711
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,605
Gru?

712
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:38,857
Uh-oh!

713
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:52,371
Ha!

714
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,310
Huh?

715
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:40,836
<i>Because
I'm training for the big day</i>

716
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:43,255
<i>Nobody's gonna stop me</i>

717
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:45,841
<i>'Cause I am super sassy</i>

718
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:48,343
<i>Super sassy, super sassy</i>

719
00:48:49,428 --> 00:48:51,346
What's today's
plan, boss?

720
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,932
What's the plan?
Silly robot.

721
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:55,434
I'll show you
the plan!

722
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:58,645
Time to watch a very special
episode of <i>Evil Bratt</i>

723
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:02,065
to see exactly what I'm gonna
do to stupid Tinseltown.

724
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:06,320
<i>This week on</i> Evil Bratt...

725
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:11,450
<i>It's a giant
Evil Bratt robot!</i>

726
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:12,701
<i>Open fire!</i>

727
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:13,952
<i>I have him
in my sights!</i>

728
00:49:18,248 --> 00:49:21,001
<i>Nice try, coppers!
Chew on this!</i>

729
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:25,964
<i>He's shooting
his super sticky,</i>

730
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:27,633
<i>self-inflating gum!</i>

731
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,635
<i>Run!</i>

732
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:32,638
<i>Gum one, gum all!</i>

733
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,516
"Gum one, gum all."

734
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,478
Seriously, how did this
show never win an Emmy?

735
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:46,234
<i>And now, it's your turn
to shine, my diamond!</i>

736
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:01,333
<i>Hey, Clive. I guess you
could say our plan was</i>

737
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:03,293
<i>out of this world!</i>

738
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:09,675
Now, that's
entertainment!

739
00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:12,135
Come on!
Let's make it a reality!

740
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:19,434
<i>Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest</i>

741
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:21,520
<i>in search of
the mythical unicorn.</i>

742
00:50:21,687 --> 00:50:23,105
<i>For some reason.</i>

743
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:26,483
<i>And here she is!
The fearless unicorn hunter seeking...</i>

744
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,026
<i>Edith, stop it!</i>

745
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,445
You're gonna scare
away the unicorn.

746
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,614
If, somehow,
we actually find a unicorn,

747
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:34,741
I'm gonna film it
and get rich.

748
00:50:34,825 --> 00:50:36,159
Look over there!

749
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,453
Whoa!

750
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,163
This is it!

751
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:41,623
This is where we're
gonna see it.

752
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,960
Unicorns, here we come.

753
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:46,627
What's that for?

754
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,588
Bait! Duh.

755
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:49,673
Come on!

756
00:50:52,134 --> 00:50:54,177
Now, all we have
to do is wait.

757
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:01,393
Okay, this is Bratt's lair.
It may not look like much,

758
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,270
but this place is
armed with some of

759
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:05,230
the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.

760
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,982
It's considered
impenetrable.

761
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:10,527
But a piece of cake
for us, right, brother?

762
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:14,239
Yes. This is not
like stealing lollipops.

763
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,325
Whoa!

764
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:24,124
His security system can detect an
air assault from any direction.

765
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:29,171
<i>Ouch! No! Ouch!</i>

766
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,506
<i>Please, stop! Ouch!</i>

767
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:36,511
So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.

768
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:38,847
Next. Ah...

769
00:51:39,431 --> 00:51:41,641
Then there are
these deadly spikes.

770
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:44,019
<i>Geronimo!</i>

771
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:48,356
Covered with enough
poison to blow your mind.

772
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:49,566
Literally.

773
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:51,067
<i>Ouch!</i>

774
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,861
Ah, good to know.

775
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:56,698
So here's the plan.
You're the getaway driver.

776
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,867
So you'll
wait in the boat...

777
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:01,161
Wait, hold on!
Wait in the boat?

778
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:04,206
But I wanna be
in on the actions!

779
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:09,294
Dru, the getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.

780
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,797
Do you know how hard it is

781
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,007
doing nothing,
touching nothing

782
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,052
when all of that adrenaline
is coursing through your veins

783
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:18,720
and you must wait?

784
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:20,180
Can I count on you?

785
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:21,723
Yeah.

786
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,558
Ah, I guess so.

787
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:27,312
So, I'll climb up to
the cube and enter here.

788
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:29,898
Then once I'm inside,
find the diamond.

789
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:34,027
I've underestimated Bratt before.
It's not going to be easy.

790
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:36,238
I think we can handle it.

791
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:42,410
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable!

792
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,621
Whoa! <i>Ay, chihuahua!</i>

793
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,832
I call the black one.

794
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:51,419
It's go time!

795
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:03,139
Hello.

796
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:04,266
Oh, hi!

797
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:07,602
Hello, mother of Margo.
I am Niko.

798
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,771
I present you
with pig to confirm

799
00:53:09,855 --> 00:53:12,691
my engagement to your daughter.

800
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,735
Hey, what now?

801
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:17,612
What's going on?
Uh, remember little boots?

802
00:53:18,113 --> 00:53:21,032
Hello, my schmoopsie poo.
Whoa, hey!

803
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:24,327
He seems to think you're engaged.

804
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,663
What? We're
not engaged.

805
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:30,959
Look, Niko, you seem like a very
nice boy with a very nice pig.

806
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,420
Uh... But you're
not engaged.

807
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:36,256
Okay? It's not
happening.

808
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,341
I understand.

809
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:40,385
Who was I kidding?

810
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:43,388
A dumpling like me
with a goddess like you.

811
00:53:44,014 --> 00:53:47,684
But I promise, I will
never forget you, Margo.

812
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:49,603
Never.

813
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:53,815
Oh, I'm pretty sure I won't
forget you either.

814
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:55,400
Bye. Bye, Niko.

815
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:58,653
Wow! That was crazy.
Whoa!

816
00:53:58,737 --> 00:54:00,906
That was totally
humiliating.

817
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:03,992
Taking a bite of that cheese was the
stupidest thing I've ever done.

818
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:05,493
Why did I listen
to you?

819
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,495
Right. But it's over
now, so...

820
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:10,707
Oh! Here we go.
Niko...

821
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:15,003
You refuse my
son's engagement pig?

822
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,171
What?

823
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:18,840
May you and your
daughter die a slow death

824
00:54:18,924 --> 00:54:20,425
and be buried
with onions.

825
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:24,596
All right, lady,
that's it!

826
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:25,680
Nobody...

827
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:29,976
Nobody curses my daughter!
Ya got that?

828
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:33,438
Because if you mess with Margo,
you mess with me!

829
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:37,567
And I promise, you do
not wanna mess with me.

830
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,945
Do you understand me?

831
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:41,196
Yes. Yes.

832
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:43,615
Good.
Now get!

833
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:49,704
Look, Margo, I think
we just need to... Oh.

834
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:54,876
Yes!

835
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,212
I have to tell Gru!

836
00:55:12,936 --> 00:55:14,729
Can we go back now?

837
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:17,816
Already? Just
a couple more hours.

838
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:19,859
We have to be home
before it gets dark.

839
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:23,238
I don't understand.

840
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:25,573
I did exactly
what the man said.

841
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:28,952
You mean that one-eyed scar-faced
man that everybody laughed at?

842
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:31,371
Yeah, it makes
no sense.

843
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:32,747
Look, Agnes,
maybe we're not...

844
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:48,138
Ooh, my whole life has been
building to this moment.

845
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:55,854
Um... It's a...

846
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,647
Unicorn!

847
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:01,151
I can't believe it!

848
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:04,154
I'm gonna name
you Lucky!

849
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,115
Oh, Lucky, stop it!

850
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,953
Yeah, I'll let someone
else burst her bubble.

851
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:21,963
Look at us!
Two brothers pulling a heist!

852
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,841
And that diamond will
make us the richest,

853
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:27,552
most powerful
villains in the world!

854
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:28,887
Right, brother?

855
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:32,974
Oh, right. Yep, yeah.

856
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:38,313
Bravo! <i>Bravissimo!</i>

857
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,981
You're amazing!
I'm so sorry.

858
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:41,608
I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.

859
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,544
And you were always such a gentleman.
You did it!

860
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:45,820
You did it!
You got our jobs back!

861
00:56:51,743 --> 00:56:54,412
What?
Oh, yeah, right. Sure.

862
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,955
Oh, look.
We're here!

863
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:05,840
I'm going in.
Take the wheel.

864
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:07,967
I still don't see why
I can't go with you.

865
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:09,677
Hey, hey!
We discussed this.

866
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:12,180
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.

867
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:13,431
Fine.

868
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:26,986
Ha-ha!

869
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:28,822
Hey, brother!

870
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:31,741
What? I told you, you are
supposed to stay with the boat!

871
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:34,911
Oh, I didn't think you
meant that literally.

872
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:36,913
What other way
could I have meant it?

873
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:40,458
All right. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.

874
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:42,877
Got it.

875
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:44,420
Whoa!

876
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:46,631
Help me!

877
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:48,133
Ow, ow, ow!

878
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:50,218
Oh, no! The poison spikes!

879
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,011
I'm gonna be impaled!

880
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:56,599
I'm okay.

881
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:59,352
I miss the minions.

882
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:00,520
Come on!

883
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:07,902
Coming.

884
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,076
Coming.

885
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:20,623
Come on.

886
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:28,603
It's a scanning device.

887
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:30,133
Quick!
Camouflage mode.

888
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:32,510
Freeze!
And close your eyes!

889
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:34,512
And cover your mouth!

890
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:42,228
Okay, take my hand.

891
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:08,379
Ha-ha! Follow me.

892
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:26,606
Ha-ha!

893
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:33,571
Look out!

894
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:40,995
Oh, you were right. I should
have stayed in the boat.

895
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:43,873
My stomach feels all queasy.

896
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:46,751
I shouldn't have
eaten that pot pie.

897
00:59:48,336 --> 00:59:52,507
Hey, hey, relax.
You're gonna be just fine.

898
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,841
I got your back.

899
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,100
Come on. This way.

900
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:39,137
Huh?

901
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:43,808
Hmm?

902
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,526
Looks like
it's right above us.

903
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:38,237
Okay, what do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?

904
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:39,781
No, come with me.

905
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:54,629
Dru, get off the bed!

906
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:57,632
Yes, I'd like to
thank the Academy...

907
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:01,636
I can help.
No, no, no.

908
01:02:01,803 --> 01:02:03,238
What? I can do it.
Don't! Don't! Don't!

909
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:04,263
Why, yes.

910
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,100
Yes, Molly Ringwald, I will take
you to the prom.

911
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:10,436
What? Who? Where? What?
Who's there? Who is there?

912
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,780
<i>99 of red balloons</i>

913
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,323
Whoops! Almost forgot!

914
01:02:33,543 --> 01:02:35,503
Over here.

915
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:38,840
Stay close.

916
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:42,802
What?

917
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:44,595
Dolls.

918
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:46,597
Looks like Bratt
was the only one

919
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:48,599
stupid enough
to buy this junk.

920
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:51,519
Oh, I used to have
one of these!

921
01:02:56,983 --> 01:02:58,484
Ow!
Hey! Shh! Come on.

922
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:09,120
All right.
We're getting close.

923
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,539
From now on,
every move must be made

924
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:13,875
with total
precision and purpose.

925
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:17,128
Gum!

926
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:18,379
Focus!

927
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:21,591
We're after the diamond,
not the bubblegum.

928
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:22,884
Got it!

929
01:03:25,303 --> 01:03:26,679
Mmm. Yum.

930
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:29,849
This way!

931
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:33,478
And now, to put this
where it belongs.

932
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:35,730
What...

933
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:39,066
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!

934
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:47,450
Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us!

935
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:53,414
Spit it out! Spit it out!
I told you not to touch anything!

936
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:59,670
Intruders!
Intruders! Intruders!

937
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:04,300
Freeze, dipsticks!

938
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,677
Gru? There's two
of you now?

939
01:04:06,761 --> 01:04:09,514
Then this will be
twice as much fun.

940
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,098
Gru.

941
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:18,397
Give me back
my diamond!

942
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:19,941
Total lockdown!

943
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:22,276
Oh!
Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!

944
01:04:31,118 --> 01:04:33,246
They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!

945
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,208
Run!

946
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:49,178
Oh, no!

947
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,097
What does that mean?

948
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:53,683
Are we gonna die?
Are we gonna die?

949
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:55,768
We're gonna die!
Dru!

950
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:06,487
What?

951
01:05:07,238 --> 01:05:09,156
Hey, guys. Hold on!

952
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:10,950
Lucy!

953
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:20,793
Thank you for saving us.
Whoo!

954
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,170
Look! We got the diamond
and we're going to...

955
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:26,507
Take it to the AVL
and get our jobs back.

956
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:27,842
Wait!

957
01:05:28,009 --> 01:05:29,635
What? Oh,
that's amazing!

958
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:31,721
And the best part is,
you'll never...

959
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:33,806
...ever go behind
my back...

960
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:37,268
...ever again,
right, honey bear?

961
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:39,562
Yeah! Yeah, right.

962
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:41,105
Lesson learned.

963
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:55,933
I'll get the girls
and start packing.

964
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:57,075
And tell them
the good news!

965
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:59,124
Ah! We're getting
our jobs back. Yeah!

966
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,375
Yes! Yes!
Go tell the girls.

967
01:06:02,335 --> 01:06:03,336
Dru...

968
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:06,631
No! No way! We can't
give the diamond back!

969
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:07,965
I have to.

970
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:10,092
No, you don't!
Yes, I do.

971
01:06:10,176 --> 01:06:11,594
- Give it!
- No!

972
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:13,054
Give it!
Ow!

973
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:14,639
What is wrong with you?

974
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:15,848
What is wrong with you?

975
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:17,099
You kicked me!

976
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:18,351
You... You lied to me!

977
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:20,269
Hey, I would have
told you the truth.

978
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:23,147
But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.

979
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,523
That's it.
I'm out of here.

980
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:27,735
You have no right to take that.
We stole it together.

981
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:29,654
Together?

982
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:31,072
You got to be
kidding me.

983
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,366
You did nothing but screw up
the whole time.

984
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:34,700
I got this in spite of you.

985
01:06:35,076 --> 01:06:38,871
Oh, yeah? At least I didn't
get fired from my job

986
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,414
like a total loser.

987
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:42,249
At least I had a job.

988
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,335
What have you accomplished
that was so great?

989
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:47,046
I'll tell you what. Nothing!

990
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:50,591
No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.

991
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:55,012
We are no
longer brothers.

992
01:06:55,096 --> 01:06:56,889
That's fine with me.

993
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:42,518
Gru! I found
a unicorn!

994
01:07:44,979 --> 01:07:46,522
My life is complete!

995
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:51,026
Honey, that's...

996
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,738
That's not actually
a unicorn.

997
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,281
Huh?

998
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:59,452
But, but, he has one horn.

999
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:02,663
I'm...
I'm sorry, sweetie...

1000
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:05,166
but he's just a goat.

1001
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:08,711
Life is just
like that sometimes.

1002
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:12,715
We're hoping for a unicorn,
and we get a goat.

1003
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:17,303
Well, you know what?

1004
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:21,432
Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!

1005
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:25,144
Look at that face!
I just want to squeeze it.

1006
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:26,353
Mmm!

1007
01:08:27,438 --> 01:08:30,107
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

1008
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:31,776
I'll take this.

1009
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:34,695
You've been
a bad boy, Gru.

1010
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:36,509
Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?

1011
01:08:37,031 --> 01:08:38,657
Come on, girls.
Let's go!

1012
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:42,369
<i>Let's get physical, physical</i>

1013
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:51,420
Change of plans, girls.

1014
01:08:51,504 --> 01:08:53,839
Instead of going home...

1015
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:56,008
Eyebrows! Ow!

1016
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,636
We're going to Hollywood!

1017
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:03,098
Now, that's what
I call acting.

1018
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:06,769
Let's go, Clive!
We've got a giant robot waiting!

1019
01:09:10,523 --> 01:09:11,565
Huh?

1020
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,527
Lucy?

1021
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:16,362
But...

1022
01:09:16,445 --> 01:09:17,780
Bratt! He took the girls!

1023
01:09:18,072 --> 01:09:19,990
What? No!

1024
01:09:22,952 --> 01:09:24,495
Dru! Dru!

1025
01:09:24,954 --> 01:09:27,373
Go away!
I don't wanna talk to you.

1026
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:29,583
Bratt has the girls!

1027
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:39,343
Listen, brother.
About what I said...

1028
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:40,761
No, I'm the one...

1029
01:09:40,928 --> 01:09:42,263
But I shouldn't have...

1030
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:44,098
I'm... I'm sorry.

1031
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,768
I'm so sorry, Gru.

1032
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:49,270
Aw!

1033
01:09:50,521 --> 01:09:51,772
Ooh, look out!

1034
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:52,982
What is that?

1035
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,783
Mel?

1036
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:04,618
Gru?

1037
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:42,031
Hello, Hollywood!

1038
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:44,909
<i>I'm back and bigger than ever.</i>

1039
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,537
I'm scared!

1040
01:10:48,746 --> 01:10:51,123
Thank you.
Thank you so... Oh!

1041
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:56,253
No! No!

1042
01:10:56,587 --> 01:10:58,339
No, you can't
leave me here!

1043
01:10:58,505 --> 01:10:59,757
I'm famous!

1044
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:02,718
Clive,
arm the canons.

1045
01:11:05,846 --> 01:11:07,681
<i>Chew on this!</i>

1046
01:11:24,949 --> 01:11:27,201
Hey, mullet head!
Let us out!

1047
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:32,665
Oh, don't worry, girls.
I've prepared a front row seat for you.

1048
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:50,057
Agnes!

1049
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:55,562
<i>Once again,
I win and Gru loses!</i>

1050
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:57,564
<i>Enjoy the show, girls.</i>

1051
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:06,740
What in the heck?
Oh!

1052
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:08,951
I hope the girls
are okay.

1053
01:12:09,118 --> 01:12:12,246
Bratt! Bratt at nine o'clock...
No! Three o'clock!

1054
01:12:12,413 --> 01:12:13,580
He's on the left!

1055
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:18,252
No!
I've seen this episode!

1056
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:21,422
He's going to bubblegum the whole
city and send it up into space!

1057
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,465
Hurry!

1058
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:36,103
This is it! This is it!

1059
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:38,480
Lights! Camera!

1060
01:12:38,564 --> 01:12:39,606
Laser!

1061
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,493
Yeah!

1062
01:12:57,624 --> 01:12:58,625
Look!

1063
01:12:58,876 --> 01:13:01,045
I've got the girls.
You two, go take care of Bratt.

1064
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:02,963
Wait! What are
you doing?

1065
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:10,721
Look, you guys,
it's Lucy!

1066
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:12,973
Lucy, over here!
Help! Help us!

1067
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,683
Mama's comin', girls.

1068
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,643
- Lucy! Lucy!
- We're up here!

1069
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:18,812
<i>Look at that laser go.</i>

1070
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:21,190
I love it when
a plan comes together.

1071
01:13:21,315 --> 01:13:23,525
It's Gru!

1072
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,446
Get ready, Bratt.

1073
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:30,324
You're about to be
blasted back to the '80s!

1074
01:13:37,164 --> 01:13:38,665
Whoo-hoo!

1075
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:44,797
We got him!

1076
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:55,099
Oh, no!
Don't worry.

1077
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:56,850
There's more
where that came from.

1078
01:13:57,059 --> 01:13:59,770
It'll take more
than that to stop me.

1079
01:13:59,895 --> 01:14:02,397
Bratt Pack, go get that barf bag.

1080
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:12,032
Oh, incoming!

1081
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:16,245
You little...

1082
01:14:16,537 --> 01:14:18,956
Get away!
Get out of there!

1083
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:25,045
Quick, jump!

1084
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:29,133
Bonus!

1085
01:14:29,383 --> 01:14:31,969
Did you see that,
Clive? All gone.

1086
01:14:32,052 --> 01:14:33,637
Buh-bye,
Wonder Twins.

1087
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:03,750
Help!

1088
01:15:04,793 --> 01:15:05,919
Hang on!

1089
01:15:13,594 --> 01:15:15,971
Hang on, girls!
I've got you!

1090
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:19,516
I can't! I'm slipping!

1091
01:15:20,142 --> 01:15:21,435
No!

1092
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:23,979
Got ya!

1093
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,108
Thank you, Lucy!

1094
01:15:28,275 --> 01:15:30,694
Let's go!
We're not safe yet.

1095
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:35,449
Minions!

1096
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,520
Look at what we have here.

1097
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:05,771
Sorry, Gru. This is going to
be a total burn!

1098
01:16:11,193 --> 01:16:13,654
Oh, no! No, no, no!

1099
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,994
I've been a bad boy!

1100
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:32,506
Nobody messes
with my brother!

1101
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:46,061
What? What's happening? No!

1102
01:16:59,074 --> 01:17:00,075
Dru!

1103
01:17:01,535 --> 01:17:02,911
Hold on! I'm coming.

1104
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:10,127
You've ruined
everything!

1105
01:17:10,294 --> 01:17:12,462
And now,
it's time to die.

1106
01:17:12,796 --> 01:17:14,840
Any last words, Gru?

1107
01:17:15,716 --> 01:17:17,175
You know what?

1108
01:17:17,259 --> 01:17:19,469
I got two words for you.

1109
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,555
Dance fight.

1110
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:26,143
Oh, it is on like Donkey Kong.

1111
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,396
I am going to enjoy this.

1112
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:49,624
Enough!

1113
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:51,918
My turn!

1114
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:13,315
Uh-oh.

1115
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:18,779
Game over!

1116
01:18:21,031 --> 01:18:23,742
Is this what
you're looking for?

1117
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,160
No!

1118
01:18:35,212 --> 01:18:37,047
No!

1119
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:43,470
Curse you, Gru!

1120
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:45,222
Curse you!

1121
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:56,316
Dru? Dru?

1122
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:06,326
Hey! We did it!

1123
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,829
Yes, we did, brother.

1124
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:10,534
- Gru!
- Uncle Dru!

1125
01:19:11,081 --> 01:19:12,582
Gru!
Girls!

1126
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:27,222
Gru!

1127
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:29,558
Hey, Mel. Welcome back.

1128
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:01,047
Mmm.

1129
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:04,301
Love you, Mom.

1130
01:20:09,139 --> 01:20:10,474
I'm a mom.

1131
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:13,018
I'm a mom!

1132
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:30,494
Boys, time for bed!

1133
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,245
We're back at work
in the morning.

1134
01:20:32,913 --> 01:20:34,372
I'm coming, sweetie.

1135
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:35,832
Good night, Lucy.

1136
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:37,626
See you tomorrow,
brother.

1137
01:20:37,876 --> 01:20:39,336
Hey, I'm back on the job.

1138
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:41,922
So no villainy tonight,
huh? Got it?

1139
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:45,300
I make no promises.
Love you!

1140
01:20:45,592 --> 01:20:47,594
Uh-huh. Right.

1141
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:48,762
I love you, too.

1142
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:50,597
Aw!

1143
01:20:51,348 --> 01:20:54,768
"Aw!" All right, every...
Go! Go! Go to bed!

1144
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:01,691
Hey! Guys! Come on!

1145
01:21:19,251 --> 01:21:20,544
What...
What is happening?

1146
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:22,170
It's coming
from outside!

1147
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:28,134
Hey! I thought we
said no more villainy!

1148
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:29,386
Sorry, brother!

1149
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:33,390
Somebody's gotta keep the
family tradition alive, right?

1150
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:45,569
Let's get him.
Ugh.

1151
01:21:45,652 --> 01:21:47,946
Honey,
he's my brother.

1152
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:49,990
We'll give him a
five-minute head start.
