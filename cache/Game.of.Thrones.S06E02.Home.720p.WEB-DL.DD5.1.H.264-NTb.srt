1
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:44,238
Give him another go, Ned.

2
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:46,240
That's my father.

3
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,575
And my Uncle Benjen.

4
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:51,745
Keep your shield up or I'll
ring your head like a bell.

5
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:02,256
They were all so happy.

6
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,342
So were you once.

7
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:13,901
Stop showing off.

8
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,569
Lyanna!

9
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,354
My Aunt Lyanna.

10
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,857
<i>I've seen her statue in the crypt.</i>

11
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:23,360
My father never talked about her.

12
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,952
<i>Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.</i>

13
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:36,206
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

14
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,374
<i>I don't know.</i>

15
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,042
What about him?

16
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:42,679
Wylis, come here.

17
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,937
Hodor?

18
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,022
<i>But he's got giant's blood.</i>

19
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:55,642
And you've got training. Sounds
like a fair match to me.

20
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,362
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

21
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,231
And lowers it when he's
going to dodge, my lady.

22
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,400
Hodor talks?

23
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:11,625
You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

24
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,161
Come along, now.
It's no place for you.

25
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,797
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

26
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,166
If he ever learned to
fight, he'd be unstoppable.

27
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:22,252
Well, he's never going to learn to
fight because he's a stable boy.

28
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,171
So leave him be.

29
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,557
It is time to go.

30
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,675
Please, a little longer.

31
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,441
You finally show me
something I care about

32
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,026
and then you drag me away.

33
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,830
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

34
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,199
but if you stay too long,
you'll drown.

35
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:56,370
I wasn't drowning.
I was home.

36
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,718
Wylis.

37
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,470
Hodor.

38
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:15,272
I saw you as a boy.

39
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,225
You could talk.

40
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,894
What happened?

41
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,863
Hodor.

42
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,819
Where's Meera?

43
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:32,956
Hodor.

44
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,767
You shouldn't be here.

45
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,570
It's not safe outside the cave.

46
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:05,355
It's not safe anywhere.

47
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:11,078
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

48
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,280
- Hodor.
- <i>His real name is Wylis.</i>

49
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:17,501
And he could talk and
fight and.. and then..

50
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,836
What's wrong?

51
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,959
The Three Eyed Raven
says there's a war coming.

52
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,261
And we're going to fight it in there?

53
00:06:57,743 --> 00:06:59,826
Brandon Stark needs you.

54
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,881
For what?
I sit in there

55
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,300
and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

56
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:09,970
He isn't going to stay here forever.

57
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,507
And out there he needs you.

58
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,169
<i>It's time, Ser Davos.</i>

59
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,588
Open the door and the men inside

60
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:46,957
can rejoin their brothers in peace.

61
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:57,017
We'll even set the wolf free north
of the Wall where it belongs.

62
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,639
Nobody needs to die tonight.

63
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,695
I've never been much of a fighter.

64
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,038
Apologies for what
you're about to see.

65
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:27,047
Come on.

66
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:15,295
Attack!

67
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:25,355
Fight, you cowards!

68
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,673
You fucking traitor.

69
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,841
The only traitors here are the ones

70
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,928
who shoved their knives into
their Lord Commander's heart.

71
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:08,515
For thousands of years
the Night's Watch

72
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,234
has held Castle Black
against the wildlings.

73
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:13,353
Until you.

74
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:26,366
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

75
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,484
<i>Took a lot of knives.</i>

76
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,240
I'll have my men
get the wood for a fire.

77
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,043
Bodies to burn.

78
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:21,054
<i>Shh, hey.</i>

79
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,674
Right, so there she is,
high and mighty Queen Cersei,

80
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,926
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

81
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:30,013
All of a sudden she looks my way.

82
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:32,983
Gives me a little smile
like, "Well?"

83
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,518
So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

84
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:38,271
and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

85
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,274
She's never seen anything like it.

86
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,743
I mean, she's used to her
brother and from what I hear,

87
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,029
Jaime Lannister's half
an inch shy of an inch.

88
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:47,864
Ooh!

89
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:51,918
She sees it and I swear to
the gods she licks her lips.

90
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:54,621
Well, you all know me.

91
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:56,756
You know I wouldn't lie about this.

92
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:16,086
Get out of my way.

93
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:18,171
King's orders, Your Grace.

94
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,009
What are the king's orders?

95
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,879
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

96
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,263
for your own protection.

97
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:31,885
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

98
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,022
Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
command, I cannot let you pass.

99
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,692
I would like to speak to my son.

100
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,228
He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

101
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,677
She grew up.

102
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,763
<i>Almost.</i>

103
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,516
Have we caught Prince
Trystane's killers?

104
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,020
I expect it was Mother.

105
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,105
Your mother wouldn't do that.

106
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:27,524
Yes, she would.

107
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:32,695
Are you angry with her?

108
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:35,698
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

109
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:38,501
She has every right to be here.

110
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,122
They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the sept.

111
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,009
If she had tried..

112
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:47,209
They're not putting
your mother in a cell ever again.

113
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,512
Not while I'm here.

114
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,517
Why haven't you gone to see her?

115
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:00,557
Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

116
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:03,026
Don't you think I know that?

117
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:08,781
I'm sorry.

118
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,619
But I can't.

119
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,070
Why not?

120
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,075
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

121
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,044
what did I do?

122
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:26,332
When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,

123
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:28,218
what did I do?

124
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:31,671
We all fail sometimes.

125
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,174
The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

126
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,728
If I can't even protect my
own wife or my own mother,

127
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,513
what good am I?

128
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,683
Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

129
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,354
Your Grace.

130
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,156
Lord Commander.

131
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,992
I want to see my wife.

132
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,411
The gods wait for Queen Margaery

133
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,915
to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

134
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:01,951
The king must wait as well.

135
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,504
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

136
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:16,883
You're a bold man.

137
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:20,103
On the contrary.

138
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,805
I fear a great deal.

139
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:26,059
The Father, the Mother,

140
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,311
the Warrior.

141
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,457
Do you know why we use these stones?

142
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,045
To remind us not to fear death.

143
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,415
We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

144
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:51,751
You must long for the next life.

145
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:55,254
In truth, I fear that, too.

146
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,308
You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

147
00:16:58,426 --> 00:17:01,060
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

148
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,929
and atoned for her sin.

149
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:05,231
What about my sins?

150
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,020
I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

151
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,325
I killed my own cousin.

152
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,360
When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

153
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:19,779
I helped him escape their justice.

154
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,033
What atonement do I deserve?

155
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,671
You would spill blood
in this holy place?

156
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,207
Oh, the gods won't mind.

157
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:33,760
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

158
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:37,880
Go on, then.

159
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:41,601
I deserve it.
We all do.

160
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,303
We are weak, vain creatures.

161
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:47,273
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

162
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:05,575
They should be closer if you
mean for them to save you.

163
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,543
I don't.

164
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:10,546
They'd never reach me
before you struck.

165
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,331
I've fought against worse odds.

166
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:15,385
No doubt many of us would fall.

167
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:18,504
But who are we, hmm?

168
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,307
We have no names, no family.

169
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:25,311
Every one of us
is poor and powerless.

170
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,814
And yet together,

171
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,566
we can overthrow an empire.

172
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:02,465
<i>Mother.</i>

173
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:16,863
Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

174
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,066
Gold.

175
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,652
Good. It was always her colour.

176
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:28,207
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

177
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:32,962
<i>I shouldn't have,
but I was...</i>

178
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,801
I didn't want to lose you again.

179
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,720
I understand.

180
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,724
I'm glad to see you.

181
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,429
I know I should have come sooner.

182
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,900
I wanted to.
I was wrong.

183
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,186
It's all right.

184
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:02,191
No, it isn't.

185
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:06,612
I should have executed all of them.

186
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,531
I should have pulled down the sept

187
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:12,702
onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

188
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:15,121
as you would have for me.

189
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,791
You raised me to be strong...

190
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,545
and I wasn't.

191
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,015
But I want to be.

192
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,436
Help me.

193
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,475
Always.

194
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,390
If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

195
00:21:11,512 --> 00:21:13,846
Meaning no offence.

196
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,766
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

197
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:18,150
I do not make dwarf jokes.

198
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,353
You think them.

199
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:24,857
So, the fleet.
It's been burned.

200
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:28,778
We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

201
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:31,330
Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.

202
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,500
Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.

203
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,203
Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.

204
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,789
The Masters have retaken both cities.

205
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:44,543
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

206
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:50,600
What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.

207
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:52,435
They are not eating.

208
00:21:52,553 --> 00:21:55,304
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

209
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,107
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

210
00:21:58,226 --> 00:22:01,060
Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.

211
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:04,480
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

212
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,866
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

213
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,318
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

214
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:12,371
I drink and I know things.

215
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:17,576
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

216
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:20,162
ranged over hundreds of miles.

217
00:22:20,248 --> 00:22:22,048
Then Daenerys's ancestors

218
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,967
started chaining them up in pens.

219
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:27,053
A few generations later,

220
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:30,806
the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

221
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:33,843
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

222
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,396
Missandei,

223
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:41,017
how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?

224
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:44,770
- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

225
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,906
Never.

226
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,158
Dragons are intelligent.

227
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:52,111
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

228
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:54,530
They have affection for their friends

229
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:56,449
and fury for their enemies.

230
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,619
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

231
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,789
They will. It's time
they had their supper.

232
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,099
I'm friends with your mother.

233
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,559
I'm here to help.

234
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,727
Don't eat the help.

235
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,900
When I was a child,

236
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:58,654
an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.

237
00:24:58,739 --> 00:25:01,373
I begged him for one of you.

238
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,960
"It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon," I told him.

239
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:09,048
"It could be little
like me."

240
00:25:15,756 --> 00:25:19,892
Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.

241
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,429
Then my father told me

242
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:27,433
the last dragon had died
a century ago.

243
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,653
I cried myself to sleep that night.

244
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:41,664
But here you are.

245
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:51,817
Next time I have an idea like that,

246
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,686
punch me in the face.

247
00:27:07,702 --> 00:27:09,535
What's your name?

248
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,043
What's your name?

249
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,547
- No one.
- I don't believe that.

250
00:27:21,632 --> 00:27:24,383
You don't believe that.

251
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,800
Who are you?

252
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,420
No one.

253
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,921
If a girl says her name,

254
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:06,058
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

255
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:08,427
A girl has no name.

256
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,763
If a girl says her name,

257
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,931
a man will feed her tonight.

258
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,484
A girl has no name.

259
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:18,570
If a girl says her name,

260
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,990
a man will give her eyes back.

261
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,994
A girl has no name.

262
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,703
Come.

263
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:44,963
Leave it.

264
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:48,133
<i>A girl is not a beggar anymore.</i>

265
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,395
We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

266
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:03,982
Half a dozen men?
Your best hunters?

267
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,784
They obviously had help.

268
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,787
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

269
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,324
Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

270
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,827
We know where she's going.

271
00:29:14,912 --> 00:29:16,662
Her brother's at Castle Black.

272
00:29:16,747 --> 00:29:18,464
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

273
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,632
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

274
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,802
So was I, Father.

275
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,971
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

276
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:28,340
as long as a Stark
can walk through that door.

277
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:31,009
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

278
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:35,013
And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

279
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:39,017
With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow...

280
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:42,071
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

281
00:29:42,189 --> 00:29:44,857
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

282
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,610
We don't need
every house in the North.

283
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:51,330
<i>The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks</i>

284
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,284
command more soldiers than all
the other houses combined.

285
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:58,337
With their support,
none could challenge us.

286
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:02,424
The Starks lost my house the day
King Robb cut off my father's head.

287
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:05,511
It's time for new blood in the North.

288
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:17,306
If you acquire a
reputation as a mad dog,

289
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:19,224
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

290
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,194
Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

291
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:25,447
<i>My lords.</i>

292
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:27,900
<i>Lady Walda has given birth.</i>

293
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,985
A boy.

294
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,571
<i>Red-cheeked
and healthy.</i>

295
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,908
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

296
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,002
Congratulations, Father.

297
00:30:48,506 --> 00:30:51,256
I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

298
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,147
You'll always be my firstborn.

299
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,900
Thank you for saying that.

300
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:04,236
It means a great deal to me.

301
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,975
Maester Wolkan,

302
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,945
<i>send ravens to all the northern houses.
Roose Bolton is dead.</i>

303
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,782
Poisoned by our enemies.

304
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:59,157
How did he die?

305
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,497
Poisoned by his enemies.

306
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:08,500
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

307
00:32:10,004 --> 00:32:11,753
Forgive me, my lord.

308
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:16,975
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

309
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,562
She's resting, my lord.

310
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:25,984
At once, my lord.

311
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:52,844
There he is.

312
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,880
Isn't he wonderful?

313
00:32:58,552 --> 00:33:00,352
May I hold him?

314
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,772
Of... of course.

315
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,784
Little brother.

316
00:33:16,904 --> 00:33:18,820
Lord Bolton sent for us.

317
00:33:18,906 --> 00:33:20,572
Have you seen him?

318
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,334
Of course.
Follow me, Mother.

319
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,770
Where is Lord Bolton?

320
00:34:01,949 --> 00:34:03,782
Down!

321
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,785
<i>It's all right. Come on, shh.</i>

322
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,339
<i>It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.</i>

323
00:34:16,463 --> 00:34:19,598
Ramsay, where is your father?

324
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,601
Ramsay.

325
00:34:30,394 --> 00:34:32,611
Where is Lord Bolton?

326
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:41,203
I am Lord Bolton.

327
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:53,215
Ramsay.

328
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,000
Ramsay, please.

329
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,719
I'll leave Winterfell.
I'll go back to the Riverlands.

330
00:35:03,177 --> 00:35:05,093
Please.

331
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:07,179
Ramsay.

332
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,899
He's your brother.

333
00:35:13,854 --> 00:35:16,354
I prefer being an only child.

334
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:39,544
<i>I saw her with a man.</i>

335
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,513
I don't think he hurt her.

336
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,716
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

337
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,687
You don't know which way she went?

338
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,056
I spent three days looking for her.

339
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:52,607
She disappeared.

340
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:56,445
How'd she look?

341
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:58,730
She looked good.

342
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:01,783
She wasn't exactly
dressed like a lady.

343
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,820
No, she wouldn't be.

344
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,907
What happened at Winterfell?

345
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:24,172
I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

346
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:27,225
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

347
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:34,983
We've all had to make
difficult choices.

348
00:36:54,538 --> 00:36:56,755
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

349
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,923
It's not safe.

350
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,341
He won't stop hunting us.

351
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:01,126
We just have to make it
to Castle Black.

352
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,678
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
won't be able to touch us.

353
00:37:03,797 --> 00:37:06,631
Jon will have me killed the
moment I step through the gate.

354
00:37:06,717 --> 00:37:08,383
I won't let him.

355
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:10,468
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

356
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:15,473
And the truth about the farm
boys I killed in their place.

357
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:19,277
And the truth about
Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

358
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:24,282
And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

359
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:28,737
When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

360
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:30,655
I don't want to be forgiven.

361
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
I can never make
amends to your family

362
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,745
for the things I've done.

363
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,132
They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

364
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,473
You're not coming with us?

365
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:53,929
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

366
00:37:55,265 --> 00:37:57,015
I would have died to get you there.

367
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:16,251
May I take one of the horses?

368
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:22,007
Where will you go?

369
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:26,678
Home.

370
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:39,391
<i>The Glovers have
retaken Deepwood Motte.</i>

371
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,726
And the ironborn who held it?

372
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:45,063
They died fighting to a man.

373
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,867
What is dead may never die.

374
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,152
What is dead may never die.

375
00:38:51,238 --> 00:38:53,238
But they did

376
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:56,041
and our invasion died with them.

377
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,244
Deepwood Motte was our last
stronghold on the mainland.

378
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:00,996
Then we will take more.

379
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:04,332
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

380
00:39:06,503 --> 00:39:08,920
Because I order it.

381
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,056
We can defeat anyone at sea,

382
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:13,341
but we'll never hold
lands and castles

383
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:14,926
against mainland armies.

384
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:17,262
Not if our captains defy my orders,

385
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:21,816
abandon their posts, and sacrifice
our men on foolish missions.

386
00:39:21,935 --> 00:39:23,902
I won't apologize
for trying to rescue Theon.

387
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,103
Then where is he?

388
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:27,656
Where is your kingdom?

389
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:31,776
We took those castles because the
northerners marched off to war.

390
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:33,945
That war is over.

391
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:35,780
The last time
we provoked them too far,

392
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,583
I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

393
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:40,618
<i>and knocked down our towers.</i>

394
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:42,537
<i>I lost two brothers that day.</i>

395
00:39:42,622 --> 00:39:45,256
And I lost three sons.

396
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,543
The War of the Five
Kings, they call it.

397
00:39:48,628 --> 00:39:50,545
Well, the other four are dead.

398
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,882
When you rule the Iron Islands, you
can wage all the peace you want.

399
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:55,800
But for now, shut your mouth and obey

400
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,603
or I will make another heir who will.

401
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,227
Let me pass.

402
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:45,016
You fool, move aside for your king.

403
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,986
Haven't I always, brother?

404
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:02,200
I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

405
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:05,670
What is dead may never die.

406
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:10,842
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

407
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,178
Aren't you supposed
to repeat the words?

408
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:16,347
You can mock our god without my help.

409
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:19,217
I don't mock the Drowned God.

410
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:22,187
I am the Drowned God.

411
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,139
From Oldtown to Qarth,

412
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,809
when men see my sails, they pray.

413
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:40,121
You're old, brother.

414
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,073
<i>You've had your time.</i>

415
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:44,459
Now let another rule.

416
00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:47,745
I heard you lost your mind

417
00:41:47,831 --> 00:41:50,915
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

418
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:56,387
They tied you to the mast to
keep you from jumping overboard.

419
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,006
They did.

420
00:41:58,091 --> 00:42:02,677
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

421
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:04,679
I needed silence.

422
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,233
What kind of an ironborn

423
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,237
loses his senses during a storm?

424
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:16,191
I am the storm, brother.

425
00:42:16,276 --> 00:42:18,576
The first storm and the last.

426
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,113
And you're in my way.

427
00:43:00,153 --> 00:43:04,622
Lord, take your servant Balon
back beneath the waves.

428
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:08,042
Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

429
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:10,161
Pull his bones down to your depths

430
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:13,047
to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

431
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:15,466
What is dead may never die.

432
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:27,178
I'm going to find out who did this.

433
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:30,348
I'm going to feed them to
the sharks while they live.

434
00:43:32,018 --> 00:43:34,819
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

435
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:37,739
The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

436
00:43:37,857 --> 00:43:39,908
not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

437
00:43:40,026 --> 00:43:41,859
My father would have
wanted me to rule.

438
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:45,246
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

439
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:49,701
Perhaps you'll win.

440
00:43:49,786 --> 00:43:53,004
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

441
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,040
And perhaps not.

442
00:44:12,892 --> 00:44:14,642
Come in.

443
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:24,402
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

444
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,621
You interrupt nothing.

445
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:41,469
I assume you know why I'm here.

446
00:44:42,756 --> 00:44:44,255
I will after you tell me.

447
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:46,591
It's about the Lord Commander.

448
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:48,843
The former Lord Commander.

449
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,980
Does he have to be?

450
00:44:55,435 --> 00:44:57,685
What are you asking?

451
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:05,410
Do you know of any magic...

452
00:45:07,113 --> 00:45:08,746
that could help him?

453
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:10,198
Bring him back?

454
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:12,917
If you want to help him,
leave him be.

455
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:15,169
Can it be done?

456
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:17,839
There are some with this power.

457
00:45:17,957 --> 00:45:20,508
- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

458
00:45:20,627 --> 00:45:21,676
Have you seen it done?

459
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,382
I met a man who came
back from the dead,

460
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:30,601
but the priest
who did it...

461
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,603
it shouldn't have been possible.

462
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:35,857
But it was.
It could be now.

463
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:38,276
Not for me.

464
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,482
Not for you?

465
00:45:48,154 --> 00:45:51,823
I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

466
00:45:51,908 --> 00:45:54,992
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

467
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:57,712
Everything I believed,

468
00:45:57,831 --> 00:46:01,249
the great victory
I saw in the flames,

469
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:02,917
all of it was a lie.

470
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:09,257
You were right all along.

471
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:12,093
The Lord never spoke to me.

472
00:46:12,178 --> 00:46:14,145
Fuck him, then.

473
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,147
Fuck all of them.

474
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:21,569
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

475
00:46:21,688 --> 00:46:25,022
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

476
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:30,862
I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

477
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:35,500
I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

478
00:46:37,454 --> 00:46:39,670
I never had this gift.

479
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:41,706
Have you ever tried?

480
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:27,231
Please.
