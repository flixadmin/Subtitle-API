1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,136
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,391
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,394
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,356
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,818
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,990
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:36,703
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,830
That day is today.

9
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,920
What?

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,338
No Big Belly Burger?

11
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,840
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,928
We're out of cows where I come from. You
don't care about that. You have questions.

13
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,097
I'm not sure where to start.

14
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,390
Thawne.

15
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,183
That is your real name?

16
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,352
- Eobard Thawne?
- Since the day I was born.

17
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,272
- When was that?
- One hundred and thirty-six years from now.

18
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,732
This is not what you wanna know.

19
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,569
Go ahead, Barry.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,113
Ask it.

21
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,449
Why did you kill my mother?

22
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,410
Because I hate you.

23
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,078
Not you now.

24
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,538
You years from now.

25
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,291
- In the future.
- In a future, yes.

26
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,752
We're enemies, rivals, opposites.
Reverses of one another.

27
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,546
Why? Why were enemies?

28
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,298
It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,968
It doesn't matter anymore.

30
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:37,097
What matters is neither of us
was strong enough to defeat the other.

31
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,100
Until I learned your secret.

32
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,728
I learned your name.

33
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,397
Barry Allen.

34
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,484
And finally, I knew how to defeat you
once and for all.

35
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,321
Travel back in time, kill you as a child...

36
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,366
wipe you from the face of the earth.

37
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:02,331
But then you, future you, that is,
followed me back and we fought.

38
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,292
We both landed some pretty solid shots.

39
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,172
And then you, future you,
got your younger self out of there.

40
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,760
I was so mad.

41
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,596
But then I thought...

42
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,891
what if you were to suffer a tragedy?

43
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:27,189
What if you were to suffer something
so horrible, so traumatic...

44
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:31,109
that your child self could never recover?
Then you would not become the Flash.

45
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,028
So I stabbed your mother in the heart.

46
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,364
And I was free.

47
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:40,285
Finally able to return to a future
without the Flash.

48
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:45,499
Only to realize that in traveling back,
I lost my way home.

49
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,920
Lost my ability to harness the Speed Force.

50
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,050
And without it,
I was stuck here, stranded in this time...

51
00:02:55,217 --> 00:03:00,889
unable to return to my home,
and the only one way back was the Flash.

52
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,935
But the Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

53
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,900
Why train me?

54
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,986
Why help me save so many people?

55
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,073
Because I needed you to get fast.

56
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:24,996
Fast enough to rupture the space-time
barrier and create a stable wormhole...

57
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,082
through which I could return home.

58
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,584
Why would I ever do that?

59
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,879
Because, Barry Allen...

60
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,757
if you give me what I want...

61
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,677
I'm gonna give you what you want.

62
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,473
You can go back and save your mother.

63
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,102
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

64
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,605
You can reunite the Allen family.

65
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,402
No.

66
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,070
No, I don't believe you.

67
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,743
I wanna kill you right now.

68
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,119
I know that rage.

69
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,080
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

70
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,499
And now somehow...

71
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,755
I know what Joe and Henry feel...

72
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,883
when they look on you with pride.

73
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,427
With love.

74
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,473
No. No, don't you ever say that to me.

75
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,101
I know you're upset,
but I'm giving you a chance.

76
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,940
I'm giving you a chance
to undo all the evil I've done.

77
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,986
Don't you want that chance?

78
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,670
A rare opportunity to go back in time
and right a wrong...

79
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,256
and save your mother's life.

80
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,302
Quite the paradox
Harrison has presented you with, Mr. Allen.

81
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,013
The chance to be with someone you love?

82
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,848
Seems pretty cut-and-dry to me.

83
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:13,855
At first blush, Dr. Snow, it would appear
so, but this gift has unparalleled risk.

84
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,192
Barry, the night your mother died...

85
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,320
the night you saved yourself
from being killed...

86
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:25,700
that event altered the timeline you were
already on, and changed the course of history.

87
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,621
So, what you're saying is
we're living in a parallel universe?

88
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,334
- Just like when I time-traveled before.
- But he only changed one day that time.

89
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:39,714
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

90
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:44,511
One different decision, no matter how big
or small, impacts everything that follows.

91
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,849
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices, new relationships.

92
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,603
Nothing would be as it is today,
and you'd never know the difference...

93
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,731
because you'd never remember any of it.

94
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:05,115
So if I go back and save my mom,
my dad doesn't go to prison.

95
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,411
I never live with Joe and Iris.

96
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:15,834
You might never meet me
or Caitlin or Ronnie.

97
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,085
Truth is...

98
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,717
there's no real way of knowing
what your life will be.

99
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,349
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

100
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,768
You gotta change the past.

101
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,443
Joe.

102
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:46,281
So, what, that's it?

103
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,618
You think I should just do it?

104
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,705
Yeah, I do.

105
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,000
Which means
I will never come to live with you...

106
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,668
and you're okay with that?

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,381
Barry, you get the chance to grow up
with both parents.

108
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,552
- You don't have to grow up without a mother.
- What about growing up without a father?

109
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,430
You will have a father. Your real father.

110
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,977
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

111
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,272
This is why you became the Flash, Barry.

112
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,399
To put things right.

113
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,487
You saved a lot of people's lives
this past year.

114
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,323
Now it's time to save yours.

115
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,305
Dad, look, I know this sounds crazy.

116
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,849
I think we're way past crazy, slugger.

117
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,270
Look, you're fast, I get it,
but turning back time...

118
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,776
I wouldn't be turning time back.
I would be going back.

119
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,779
To that night, to save her.

120
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,031
What does Joe think about all this?

121
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,868
He thinks I should do it.

122
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,246
No.

123
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,040
You can't.

124
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,460
Dad...

125
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:29,175
I can make it so
that night will never have happened.

126
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,053
- We'll be a family again.
- We are a family.

127
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,473
Not like this, not without Mom.

128
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,769
Barry, there's a natural order to things.

129
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,272
Okay, things happen the way they do.

130
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,151
We may not know why at the time,
but there must always be a reason.

131
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,863
Now, I believe that.
I've had to believe it.

132
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,492
I... I can save Mom.

133
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,827
At what cost?

134
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,497
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

135
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,708
- Well, I don't care.
- I do.

136
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,255
I am in awe...

137
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,759
of the remarkable man
that you are becoming.

138
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,346
All the things you've achieved,
and not just as the Flash...

139
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,890
but you, Barry...

140
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,893
your honesty, your heart.

141
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,188
You were always a hero.

142
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,609
And your mom would be just as proud.

143
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,737
And if she had a say in this,
if she thought for one second...

144
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,741
you going back to save her would mean
you losing what makes you so special...

145
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,951
She would never want that.

146
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,372
Barry, what I hope for you...

147
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,586
maybe the greatest thing
that a father can hope for his son...

148
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:51,257
is that one day
you will become a father yourself.

149
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,052
And then you will know...

150
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:02,393
how much I truly love you.

151
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,109
Ninety-eight-point-six.

152
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,360
Normal.

153
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,113
- Don't know what that word means anymore.
- Me neither.

154
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,158
I know Barry really appreciates you
coming back to help him stop Wells.

155
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,786
That's not the only reason I'm back, Cait.

156
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,579
I'm here now, for good.

157
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,915
- But I thought...
- I thought too.

158
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:28,002
Okay, I thought too much about what might
happen if the government tracked us down.

159
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,799
If we couldn't control our powers
and we hurt someone, if we hurt you.

160
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:39,430
But I realized that, although
sometimes, I'm more than one man...

161
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,642
I'm not whole unless I'm with you.

162
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,935
I love you, Cait.

163
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,525
- Are you sure?
- I am.

164
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,193
Once upon a time...

165
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,363
and a particle accelerator or so ago...

166
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,781
you agreed to marry me.

167
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,951
- Yes, I did.
- What do you say we do that?

168
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,545
Thought I might find you here.

169
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,843
I needed to get out of the lab.

170
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,390
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

171
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,225
Oh, it is, trust me.

172
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,687
I've done a lot of thinking up here.

173
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,941
When I wasn't having clandestine meetings
with the mysterious Streak.

174
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,030
Yeah, not mad we lost that name.

175
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,241
Hey, I thought that had pizzazz.

176
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,244
No.

177
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,169
So are you gonna do it?

178
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,842
It's just so huge.

179
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:04,390
It's the biggest decision of my life,
and if I'm wrong, I can't undo it.

180
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,851
Why would you want to? I mean...

181
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,855
you'd get to see your mom again...

182
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,106
your dad.

183
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,192
Have a great career.

184
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,611
Even get married.

185
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,782
Iris West-Allen, huh?

186
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,953
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

187
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,623
Must be a 2024 thing.

188
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,293
We don't know that
that's gonna happen. I mean...

189
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:37,507
Do you think that
because you didn't live with us...

190
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,260
that's why things are different there?

191
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:47,058
Growing up together
and knowing so much about each other...

192
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:52,522
it made it hard for me
to admit how I felt about you.

193
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,652
And I waited too long,
and you fell in love with Eddie.

194
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,904
But...

195
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,451
But living with you and Joe...

196
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,331
I've had a great life, Iris.

197
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,668
Come here, Barry.

198
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,510
What do you think I should do?

199
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,055
I need someone to tell me.

200
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,978
I think...

201
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,274
that for once in
your life, Barry Allen...

202
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,860
you should stop thinking
about other people.

203
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,196
I think you should do what's in your heart.

204
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,366
Do what you need to do for yourself.

205
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,000
Ah.

206
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,879
Well, if it makes you feel any better...

207
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,299
it took you a whole hour longer
to decide than I thought it would.

208
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,302
So how does this work?

209
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,682
- Your grand plan.
- Well, it's really not that grand at all, Barry.

210
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,309
In fact, it's rather simple.

211
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,395
- We use the particle accelerator.
- The particle acce...

212
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,900
The last time that happened, you caused
an explosion that hurt a lot of people.

213
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:23,988
This time, the accelerator will operate
exactly the way it was designed to.

214
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:28,159
Except instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions...

215
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,870
colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring...

216
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,374
we're only gonna inject one particle
into the accelerator.

217
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,628
And I'm what it collides with.

218
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,922
And if you can go fast enough, Barry...

219
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,925
if you can hit that particle
with enough speed...

220
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,011
you will punch a hole
right through the fabric of reality.

221
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,846
And you will create a portal...

222
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,017
connecting this
time... to infinite times.

223
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,895
A wormhole.

224
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,731
Through which one might travel
back to the past...

225
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,737
say, to the night your mother died,
or forward to the future to, say, my time.

226
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:10,743
You said if I run fast enough.
What happens if I don't?

227
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,122
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity, Barry...

228
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,249
you'll die.

229
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,047
According to Wells' calculations...

230
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,967
Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

231
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,469
Once Barry reaches optimum speed...

232
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,140
we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

233
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,560
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms...

234
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,522
opening a gateway into time itself.

235
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,025
At that moment, I plan on shouting
something along the lines of:

236
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,153
"Eureka," or possibly, "Excelsior."

237
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,447
I'm uncommitted.

238
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,031
What do you think?

239
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:54,579
I mean, on the one hand,
it does make a kind of sense.

240
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,080
On the other hand...

241
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,540
why?

242
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,083
Why?

243
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,670
- Why would you ever consider doing this?
- You know why.

244
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,339
So for this to work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

245
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,176
By my estimates, Mach 2 at a minimum.

246
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,679
You've never gone that fast.

247
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,849
So, what happens
if Barry doesn't reach that speed?

248
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,269
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield. How far off am I?

249
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,730
Not very far, I'm afraid.

250
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,524
Let me worry about how fast I have to go.

251
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,903
- We're gonna need something else too.
- Really?

252
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,655
And what's that?
Because I don't know about you guys...

253
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,201
but I'm not at all interested in
helping you get yourself killed.

254
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,203
I need you to build a time machine.

255
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,872
Go on.

256
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,211
So if Wells is as fast as you,
what's he need a time machine for?

257
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,880
Apparently, he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

258
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,550
He gets it back sometimes, but
only in spurts. He can't fully control it.

259
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,386
I was right. He was using
the wheelchair to charge himself.

260
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:57,016
So after I open the wormhole, he's gonna
need the ship to travel back to the future.

261
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,895
- He's been squirreling away the parts.
- Now we just need to put it together.

262
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,065
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine...

263
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,775
not a bookcase from Ikea.

264
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,070
We got a problem.
These tiles, they're made of tungsten.

265
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,114
Tungsten has the highest
melting point of any other element.

266
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,742
Yeah, uh, but the dust it generates
is flammable.

267
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,411
- The pressure exerted from the wormhole...
- Yeah, yeah.

268
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,623
It could cause a hole
to be melted into the exterior.

269
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,083
It could explode.

270
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,584
Any ideas?

271
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,587
Let me ask Dr. Evil.

272
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,132
Heh. Which used to be a name
that made me smile.

273
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,433
- Something on your mind, Cisco?
- No.

274
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:45,439
Yes. How did you fit your
Reverse-Flash suit into that little ring?

275
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,858
Is it some sort of compressed microtech?

276
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,112
Or... Actually, forget it. I don't care.

277
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,448
Maybe a little.

278
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,160
Ronnie's right. I should've accounted
for temporal shearing.

279
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,496
Glad we're still good for something.

280
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,958
I've never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

281
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,338
Or Ronnie. As a matter of fact,
do you know how many times...

282
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,174
I wished you were with me
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

283
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,176
- Would've been a lot more fun.
- Yeah?

284
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:19,473
Well, it doesn't change the fact
that your nifty little Time Sphere...

285
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,685
- Oh, is that what you're calling it?
- Whatever. It's gonna blow.

286
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,104
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

287
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,357
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

288
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,693
Okay. Fine, we'll try that.

289
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,320
That's it? That's all?

290
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,113
Well, what do you want me to say?

291
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:38,159
I don't know. I thought of anyone, you'd be
more understanding of my predicament.

292
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,161
I don't belong here.

293
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,247
These barbaric times.

294
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,667
- It's like living among the dead.
- Is that what you told yourself...

295
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,252
when you killed me?

296
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,423
What?

297
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,842
What did you say?

298
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:02,016
It was an alternate timeline,
one that Barry reset.

299
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,434
But I never forgot it.

300
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,855
It just kept coming back to me.

301
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,902
And I can still picture
the way you looked at me...

302
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,570
when you called me a son.

303
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,741
And you crushed my heart...

304
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,159
with your fist.

305
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,703
Cisco...

306
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,206
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,919
- Yeah, it sucked.
- Not for killing you. I'm sure I had a reason.

308
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,673
I'm sorry for the fact that you're able
to retain traces of another timeline.

309
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,677
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe. It means...

310
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,182
- I wasn't sure until just now.
- Sure of what?

311
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,730
The night the particle
accelerator exploded...

312
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,818
you were affected too.

313
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,281
What are you talking about?

314
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,910
No.

315
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,080
I wasn't.

316
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,708
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

317
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:14,797
A great and honorable destiny
awaits you now.

318
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:19,427
I only hope that
as you're living your great adventure...

319
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,514
that you remember
who gave you that life.

320
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,477
And that it was given out of love.

321
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:48,289
I'm sorry, but I'm told this is the only station
with enough power to run these calculations.

322
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,708
If we make a slight error
creating the wormhole...

323
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,794
Say no more. Joe told me
to stick around in case I was needed...

324
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,965
- but it seems I'm only in the way.
- Well, everyone has a contribution to make.

325
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,801
Perhaps you just haven't
discovered yours yet.

326
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,139
No, Dr. Wells made it pretty clear when he
told me about the future, I don't matter.

327
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,810
As far as history's concerned,
I don't save the day, or get the girl.

328
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,562
And you believed him?

329
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,775
He had a newspaper from the year 2024.

330
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,487
And I have a mug that says
"World's Best Boss."

331
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,783
I doubt my teaching assistant
would testify to its authenticity.

332
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:31,040
We're dealing with a lot
of big scientific ideas today.

333
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,417
But you, Mr. Thawne, might be...

334
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,837
the most interesting thing here
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

335
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,006
Me?

336
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,092
What are the odds that
Dr. Wells would travel back in time...

337
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:47,848
and get stuck in the exact same city
as his great-great-great-great-grandfather?

338
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,935
Working in the same profession,
the same building.

339
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,188
And that part of his plan to get home
would mean...

340
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:58,359
that he'd have to preserve
and protect your life.

341
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:04,532
That makes you this rare thing
that no scientist can plan for.

342
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,409
- Which is?
- Coincidence.

343
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:13,624
There is no science to coincidence.

344
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,253
You, sir, are an anomaly.

345
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,548
A wildcard, as it were.

346
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:26,971
You are the only person in this whole story
who gets to choose his own future.

347
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,183
At least that's my opinion.

348
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,937
Wait, that can't be right. Oh, dear.

349
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,232
We have a problem.

350
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,109
- What?
- The calculations.

351
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,777
There is a danger.

352
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,865
- I know. I'm ready to take the risk.
- No, not just to you, but to everyone.

353
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,409
Wells didn't tell us everything.

354
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,745
Barry, even if you do
reach the right speed...

355
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,914
colliding with the hydrogen particle...

356
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:58,085
there is a chance that explosion
could create a singularity.

357
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,255
- What's a singularity?
- It's a black hole.

358
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:04,592
- We could destroy Central City.
- For starters.

359
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,679
If we create a singularity here
and then cannot control it...

360
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,600
we could be looking at
a global catastrophe.

361
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,979
So long, and thanks for all the fish.

362
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,027
Sure, there's a bit of a risk.

363
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:27,531
I would hardly refer to possibly causing an
extinction-level event as "a bit of a risk."

364
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,702
And your accelerator's been about as reliable
as the beater I drove in high school.

365
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,871
Ha, ha. Let me ask you a question.

366
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,584
How many metahumans,
how many dangers...

367
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,046
have we faced this year together?

368
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:46,508
Or did you forget that was me fighting
alongside each and every one of you?

369
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:50,763
I have been planning this
for almost two decades. It will work.

370
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,558
How do we make sure we don't open
a black hole in the middle of Central City?

371
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,810
So once the wormhole stabilizes...

372
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,480
Barry will have
one minute and 52 seconds...

373
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,858
lo alter the past
and return to this time.

374
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,986
If and when he does that,
you can close the wormhole...

375
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,197
and we can all live happily ever after.

376
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,657
Almost two minutes.

377
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,784
More than enough time to save Nora.

378
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,620
But not time enough to stop you
from going home?

379
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,996
Everything's a choice.

380
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,500
- And what if I'm late?
- You won't be.

381
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,920
I believe in you, Barry. Always have.

382
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,841
So I guess the question is, do your friends
and family believe in you as much as I do?

383
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:52,533
So if I don't run fast enough to
collide with the particle, then I'm dust.

384
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,119
If I run fast enough
but I'm not back here in time...

385
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,622
a black hole will form, swallow
up the city, and possibly the world.

386
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,794
Sure you still wanna look me in the eyes
and tell me that this is for the best?

387
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,131
I'd be lying if I told you I did.

388
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,137
Truth is I don't... I don't
know what to think.

389
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,597
I thought you were the sure one. I...

390
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:20,060
I was kind of banking on that
when I made my decision the first time.

391
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,729
I was faking it.

392
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,689
- Yeah.
- Sometimes parents do that.

393
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,568
Most of the time, parents do that.

394
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,697
Look, of course I'm scared.

395
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,870
But I didn't want you to not help your
mother because you were worried about me.

396
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,124
Well, I'll always worry about you, Joe,
just like you'll always worry about me.

397
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,377
Sorry, but you can't stop that.

398
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,010
Do you think I can do this?

399
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:58,891
Do you think I can save my mom?
I mean, do you think I'm fast enough?

400
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,350
Yes.

401
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,436
I know you are.

402
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,819
You know, I've dreamed my whole life...

403
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:15,032
about saving her, freeing my dad, and...

404
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,870
I never thought I'd have to lose
another parent to do that.

405
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:22,039
- Barry...
- Joe, it's true. It's...

406
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,665
It's true.

407
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,836
I've always been so focused
on everything that I lost that night.

408
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,465
But I gained so much too. I...

409
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,053
I was born with one father,
and that tragedy gave me...

410
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,722
another.

411
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,476
And I don't think I can lose you.

412
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,562
You will never lose me.

413
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,397
Ever. You hear me?

414
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,651
Ever.

415
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,993
Wow, slow news day?

416
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,790
If they only knew, right?

417
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,253
I thought you would be at S.T.A.R. Labs.

418
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,046
I was.

419
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,924
But I got hungry, so I went to Mama Chow's.

420
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,051
For dim sum? Your favorite?

421
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,680
- And to remind myself of something.
- What?

422
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,105
A coincidence.
A pretty big coincidence, actually.

423
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,234
About a year and a half ago,
I had a date with this girl.

424
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,194
Katie Rogers.

425
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,238
She was a dancer.

426
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,991
We had plans to meet at Mama Chow's...

427
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,286
but she texted me,
she pulled a hamstring and had to cancel.

428
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,454
Oh, those fragile dancers.

429
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:48,417
I was bummed
because I was looking forward to it.

430
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,712
So I had dinner by myself,
and I was walking home...

431
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,215
when I saw a mugger
running with a stolen backpack.

432
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,384
Your backpack.

433
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,386
And I arrested him.

434
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,055
That's how you and I met.

435
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,474
I remember.

436
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,729
Someone just told me
how powerful a coincidence could be.

437
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,564
And it made me realize...

438
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,318
how many coincidences had to happen
for you and I to get together.

439
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,155
In this time.

440
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:25,787
We've all been so focused on Barry's
destiny, I forgot that I have one too.

441
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,584
And it's you...

442
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,295
Iris West.

443
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,675
Every moment of my life led to meeting you.

444
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,513
Screw the future.

445
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,936
Screw the future.

446
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,610
Is this actually binding?

447
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,864
My father made me become a rabbi
before he would send me to MIT.

448
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,908
This will be legit, as the kids say.

449
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,785
No kids say that.

450
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,955
- Let's not fight on our wedding day.
- Okay.

451
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,046
If it's all right with everyone,
I'd like to skip all the Hebrew.

452
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:24,012
I've learned a lot about merging one's life
with another this past year.

453
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:29,309
And yet for all the incredible advancements
in science we've all been party to...

454
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,604
the mystery that brings two people
together through love...

455
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,941
is still the province of magic.

456
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,360
Mr. Ramon, the rings, please.

457
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,375
- I owe you a real ring.
- I don't need one.

458
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:59,881
I have everything and everyone
that I could ever need right here.

459
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:07,014
And if all the events of the past year
have led us to this moment...

460
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,516
it was worth it.

461
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,269
I love you, Ronnie.

462
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:16,481
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

463
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,359
Stop telling me what to do.

464
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,593
Okay, there are gonna be
three yous back there.

465
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,888
You from the future, who saved
younger you from the Reverse-Flash...

466
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,097
and now "you" you.

467
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,934
Remember, wait until future you
gets younger you out of there...

468
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:56,313
- and then you can go and save your mom.
- Piece of cake.

469
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,442
May the Speed Force be with you.

470
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,906
Goodbye, Dad.

471
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,746
Goodbye, son.

472
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,919
- Iris...
- You don't have to say anything.

473
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,462
I already know.

474
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,428
I hope whatever life you get,
it's enough for you...

475
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,264
that it makes you happy.

476
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,766
You too.

477
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,790
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

478
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,454
Remember, Mr. Allen...

479
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,791
assuming you achieve the proper velocity
and open the wormhole...

480
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:02,170
you will only have one minute and 52
seconds to save your mother and return.

481
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,673
- Or else...
- I know.

482
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,136
Well...

483
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,306
you hold both our futures
in your hands now, Mr. Allen.

484
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,976
And I know you can do it.

485
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,145
Now...

486
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,690
run, Barry.

487
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,818
Run.

488
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,829
The accelerator's structural integrity
is holding.

489
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,664
What was that?

490
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,833
- Is Barry okay?
- Yeah.

491
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,877
He just passed Mach 2.

492
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,514
I was waiting for you to bring Barry home.

493
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,350
Well, it looks like he's gonna
be staying with us a while.

494
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,271
Barry, what you're seeing
is the Speed Force.

495
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,734
Your past, your present, your future,
all at once.

496
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,529
So you need to focus
on where you want to go.

497
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,033
So think about that night.

498
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:17,204
Think about your mother.

499
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,374
It's time for bed. Good night, slugger.

500
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,376
Mom.

501
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,963
- Mom!
- Barry, no!

502
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,548
- Mom!
- It's working.

503
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,886
It's working.

504
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,557
Inject the hydrogen particle now.

505
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,439
- What's that? What happened?
- Barry, he's gone.

506
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,024
- Look.
- The wormhole.

507
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,318
And it's stable. Start the clock.

508
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,755
Mom!

509
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,925
- Mom!
- Barry! Barry!

510
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,510
Mom!

511
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,264
Barry, get back! No!

512
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,099
Nora, hold on!

513
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,276
Run!

514
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,987
Run!

515
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,614
Barry!

516
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,449
No!

517
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,785
No! No!

518
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,787
No!

519
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,248
No!

520
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,561
Hey.

521
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,272
- It's okay, it's okay. You're okay.
- Please.

522
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,065
My husband, my son, are they...?

523
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,317
They're okay.

524
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,819
They're both safe. I promise.

525
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,488
Who are you?

526
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,491
I'm...

527
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,288
I'm the Flash.

528
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,707
I don't understand.

529
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,388
You look just like my father.

530
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,521
This won't make any sense...

531
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,399
but it's me, Mom.

532
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:52,734
What?

533
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,569
It's Barry.

534
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,613
- Barry?
- Your Barry.

535
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,948
My beautiful boy.

536
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,122
I got a second chance...

537
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,750
to come back here and...

538
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,879
To tell you that I'm okay.

539
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,716
Dad and I are both okay.

540
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,929
And we love you, Mom.

541
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,391
I love you.

542
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,935
I love you.

543
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,896
Oh, my sweet boy.

544
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,942
Goodbye.

545
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,277
Goodbye, Barry.

546
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,281
Mom.

547
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,785
Mom.

548
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,419
Mom.

549
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,809
I believe it's time to say goodbye
to Harrison Wells.

550
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,942
It's beautiful.

551
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,569
Rip Hunter would be impressed.

552
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,947
He built the first one of these.

553
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,116
Interesting man.

554
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,496
Now what the hell is that?

555
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,290
That's my cue to leave.

556
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,087
Thank you, Cisco.

557
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,298
Don't ever come back.

558
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,365
Thirty seconds.

559
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,917
Home.

560
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,181
- Oh, my God.
- Barry.

561
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,892
We have to shut down the wormhole.
Quickly!

562
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,186
Caitlin.

563
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,402
You didn't save her?

564
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,571
Why?

565
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,866
Why? You could have had
the life you wanted.

566
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,411
You could have had everything
you ever wanted!

567
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,873
I already do.

568
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,213
Not for long.

569
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,760
Cut the internal generators.

570
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,389
Ten seconds. Hurry.

571
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,573
Three, two, one.

572
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,784
Ronnie, are you okay?

573
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,287
- Did you do it?
- Yes, I turned them all off.

574
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,292
They did it. They cut the generator.

575
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,840
Just so we're clear...

576
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,010
after I kill you,
I'm going to kill them.

577
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,596
And then I'm going to kill your father.

578
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,931
I always win, Flash.

579
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,317
Aah! Eddie! Oh, my...!

580
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,444
Eddie!

581
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,653
What did you do?

582
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,617
What did you do? What did you do?

583
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,329
No such thing as a coincidence.

584
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,376
- What's happening?
- Cisco, help me.

585
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,128
Eddie's his ancestor.

586
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,758
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born, and...

587
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,803
He's being erased from existence.

588
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,806
No!

589
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,975
No! Eddie.

590
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,310
Eddie? No, don't.

591
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,313
Ed, stay with me, okay? Stay...

592
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:46,027
He was wrong. Turns
out I'm a hero after all.

593
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,821
You are, Eddie. You are my hero.

594
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,157
That's all I ever wanted to be.

595
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,327
Your hero.

596
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,344
I've controlled your
life for so long, Barry.

597
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,430
How will you get along without me?

598
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,250
Guys, that's not good.

599
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,253
Professor, I shut down the wormhole.
What's happening?

600
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,424
I don't know. You did close it,
but it seems to be reopening.

601
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,218
- We gotta go.
- You okay?

602
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,930
- Iris, we have to go.
- I'm not leaving him.

603
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,059
- We have to go now, honey, I'm sorry.
- Come on.

604
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,244
So that's what we didn't want to happen.

605
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,163
- What's it doing?
- Feeding.

606
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:24,083
The singularity won't stop,
not even after the Earth is gone.

607
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,689
I'm afraid the accretion disc
has already assembled.

608
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,775
- What?
- Diffused material...

609
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,277
that's in orbital motion
around the singularity.

610
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,946
- What does that mean?
- We have to disrupt the motion.

611
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:58,618
Basically, it's just like the tornado,
only upside down and bigger.

612
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,787
- And scarier.
- Barry...

613
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,999
that event has an energy level
of at least 6.7 teraelectron-volts.

614
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,292
It cannot be stopped.

615
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,838
I have to try.

616
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:38,241
Oh, God. Barry.

617
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:46,265
