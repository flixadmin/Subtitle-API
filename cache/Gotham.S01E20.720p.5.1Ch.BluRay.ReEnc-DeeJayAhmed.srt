That's all I managed to save.

479
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,766
You've heard
"a face only a mother could love"?

480
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,570
Well, his mother couldn't.

481
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,728
She left us after he was born.

482
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,122
Oh, yes. My son...

483
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,243
the seducer.

484
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,445
It makes sense he scratched his
face out of those pictures.

485
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,648
But that means this can't be The Ogre.

486
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,410
We're chasing the wrong guy.

487
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,846
Jim had an idea.

488
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,202
Judge Harkness' warrant was very specific.

489
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,607
- I don't have to say anything.
- Then nod.

490
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,087
Did you operate on this man?

491
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,404
I need to know what he looks like now,
or the next woman he kills will be on you.

492
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,003
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]

493
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,128
Never, never would he play
with other children.

494
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,650
He knew even then he was too good for them.

495
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,249
And now he is a respectable
man of business...

496
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,721
my Oswald.

497
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,605
Well, this has been a delight.

498
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,320
But it's late.

499
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,324
One thing...

500
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,925
Gertrud, my love.

501
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,970
- Oh.
- A question that's been bothering me.

502
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,806
Oh, no. Oh, no.

503
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,450
Is this an act?

504
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,805
[GERTRUD AND MARONI CHUCKLE]

505
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,641
Are you pretending
that he's just a nightclub owner?

506
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,249
- Or are you really that stupid?
- Stop!

507
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,329
I don't understand.

508
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,847
- Your son...
- Don Maroni, I am warning you!

509
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,287
- Is a coldblooded psychopath.
- No, no, no.

510
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,006
I can't count how many men he's killed.

511
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,091
My own friend, Frankie Carbone,
he stabbed him a dozen times.

512
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,763
What kind of person plunges a knife
into someone over and over?

513
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,724
He's a filthy liar, Mother!

514
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,526
He's just angry because I
played him for a fool.

515
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,207
You know, don't you?

516
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,522
- I can see it.
- Let go of her!

517
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,525
Did you catch him one night
washing blood from his hands?

518
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,850
When did you realize
that you had given birth to a monster?

519
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,042
You're going to pay for this.

520
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,046
Maybe.

521
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,165
Or maybe this ends with me
dumping your lifeless body into the river.

522
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,126
Either way, you and Mama Gertrude
can stop pretending.

523
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,764
The place is looking good.

524
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,361
The other night, when you saw my invitation,
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

525
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,404
I wasn't. I didn't get invited.

526
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,086
Oh, so you're crashing.

527
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,806
No, I'm on the list.

528
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,890
It's amazing
what a $10,000 donation will do.

529
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,405
You donated $10,000 to this?
Why?

530
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,927
I was hoping that would be apparent.

531
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,082
And what if I decided not to come?

532
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,080
Well, then, I'd have been making
a generous donation to charity...

533
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,766
and I would have been very disappointed.

534
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,604
The way things ended last night,
it was my fault.

535
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,883
But I felt something.

536
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,650
I couldn't let it slip away.

537
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,883
Well, that's very sweet, but...

538
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,608
You said that when people see the real you,
they run screaming.

539
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,482
Someone said the same thing to me once,
that no one would ever love me.

540
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,650
- Who?
- The woman I thought was my mother.

541
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,123
Barbara, I know what it's like...

542
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,484
to be one person on the inside
and have the world see another.

543
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,129
I lived like that...

544
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,160
and it almost destroyed me.
I can see it destroying you.

545
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,810
I don't wanna dance anymore.

546
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,162
The person that I am now...

547
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,521
I created.

548
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,010
I brought him into being.

549
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,285
I can do the same for you.

550
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,001
Aren't you tired of playing games?

551
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,645
Of hiding?

552
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,124
Yes.

553
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,728
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.

554
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,009
- Hello. I'm Bruce Wayne.
- Sid Bunderslaw.

555
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,727
I'm going around trying to get to know
everybody who works for the company.

556
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,725
- You work for Wayne Enterprises, don't you?
- I do.

557
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,048
I'm the Director of Physical Operations...

558
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,448
which I'm afraid is a bit dull.

559
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,927
There are many
much more interesting people here.

560
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,166
Well, I'm sure I'll get to meet everyone
eventually.

561
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,446
Forgive me, Bruce,
I have an early flight tomorrow.

562
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,244
It's been a pleasure.

563
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,365
It was...

564
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,491
It was nice meeting you.

565
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,730
Sorry.

566
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,881
See? Nothing to it.

567
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,250
What is it?

568
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,084
Nothing.

569
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,004
Stop right there, buster.

570
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,805
Riddle Man? What the hell are you doing
creeping around here?

571
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,284
- You need to leave Miss Kringle alone.
- What?

572
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,802
I'm not gonna let you hurt her, ever again.

573
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,567
I think you need to leave Gotham tonight.

574
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,002
I get it now.

575
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,804
You got a thing for my girl.

576
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,523
That's too funny.

577
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,011
Don't take this personal.

578
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,927
You want some more?

579
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,326
UPSY-daisy!

580
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,970
Riddle Man...

581
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,807
Oh, dear.

582
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,444
Oh, dear.

583
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,210
Oh, no.

584
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,168
Oh, dear.

585
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,041
Oh, dear.

586
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,964
Oh, dear.

587
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,405
- Oswald.
- Feeling better?

588
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,563
I made tea.

589
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,602
I'm afraid you had, well,
a little too much to drink.

590
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,847
Mr. Maroni, he has a
strange sense of humor...

591
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,405
Oswald.

592
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,328
I am not some bumpkin from the country
with hay in my brains.

593
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,484
I am your mother...

594
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,241
and I will love you no matter what.

595
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
But lie to me now...

596
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,491
and you will break my heart.

597
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,887
Oswald...

598
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,444
have you done things...

599
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,170
you should not?

600
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,048
Mother...

601
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,521
I'm a nightclub owner.

602
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,760
That's all.

603
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,090
I'm tired now.

604
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,281
I am tired.

605
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,087
Yeah, I got a delivery for Gertrude
from Sal.

606
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,408
Tip's not included.

607
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,008
You tell Sal it's over.

608
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,006
The guns are bought.
The killing room is waiting.

609
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,164
He doesn't know it, but he's a dead man.

610
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,411
On second thought, I'll tell him myself.

611
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,968
Oswald?

612
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,730
Who was that?

613
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,841
It's Mr. Yatsko from next door.

614
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,122
He needs help taking out some trash.

615
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,051
You, you... Please, you help him, then.

616
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,011
Jason Van Groot?

617
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,841
His real name is Jason Skolimski.
He used the old woman's name at the clinic.

618
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,681
But there's no Jason Van Groot or Skolimski
in Gotham. The guy's a ghost.

619
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,360
So the old woman rejects him,
he goes to the doctor...

620
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,210
gets himself a pretty new face.

621
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,124
SThat's where he runs into the nurse.

622
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,810
And we're off to the races.

623
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,721
- I don't suppose you got a picture?
- Missing from the file. No surprise there.

624
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,850
But the good doctor was kind enough
to do a sketch.

625
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,805
It's been 1O years since he last saw him,
but it's a start.

626
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,685
So we have his real name,
but not what alias he's using...

627
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,043
or what he looks like
beyond a decade-old sketch.

628
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,402
Did he say anything else
on the phone today?

629
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,565
- Anything we might have missed?
- No, just wanted me to back off.

630
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,721
Told me not to believe my own press
as the rising star of the G.C.P.D.

631
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,483
What is it?

632
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,087
The paper that said that...

633
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,363
they ran an old photo of me
from a charity gala.

634
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,247
I wasn't alone.

635
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,844
Barbara?

636
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,441
Is Barbara here?

637
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,126
