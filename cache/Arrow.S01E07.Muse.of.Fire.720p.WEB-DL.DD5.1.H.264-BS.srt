1
00:00:00,843 --> 00:00:03,143
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,821
For 5 years I was
stranded on an island

3
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:07,973
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,124
survive.

5
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:11,626
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:14,846
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,514
to use the list
of names he left me

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,684
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,521
To do this, I must
become someone else.

10
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:28,393
I must become
something else.

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,028
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,346
The Oliver you lost might not be
the one they found.

13
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:33,848
When you were stuck
on that island,

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,650
plotting your grand plan
to save the city,

15
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:37,185
I don't think you stopped
to consider the effect

16
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:38,453
it would have on
the people in your life.

17
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,621
You're wrong.

18
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,040
Not being able
to tell my family the truth,

19
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,325
it doesn't hurt anyone worse
than it hurts me.

20
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:46,360
I made you a promise.
I couldn't keep it.

21
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:50,415
After being granted the miracle
of having my child returned to me,

22
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,835
that you seem to have
no interest in telling me the truth.

23
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:55,369
You got to let
me in, Ollie.

24
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:57,872
You got to let someone in.

25
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,694
Hello?

26
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,579
Hi. Mom said I'm
supposed to remind you

27
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,397
to pick her up for lunch.

28
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:25,233
Was I supposed to have
lunch with her today?

29
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,085
She said she left you
like 5 messages.

30
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,371
Just bite the bullet and have
a Cobb salad with the woman.

31
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,040
You know, Thea, sometimes
it's difficult to remember

32
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,791
which one of you
is my mother.

33
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,761
Mrs. Queen,
all I'm asking for

34
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,130
is a chance to sit down and
discuss our proposal. Hmm?

35
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,016
If that's all it is, then I can
save us both the time.

36
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:42,967
It's rejected.

37
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,085
I see.
May I ask why?

38
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:46,587
Do I really need
to answer that, Mr. Copani?

39
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,307
Now, if you'll excuse me,

40
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,392
I'm meeting my son
for lunch.

41
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:05,106
Get down!

42
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:13,131
Mom? Are you okay?

43
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,499
- I'm all right.
- Are you hurt?

44
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,967
- No, I'm--I'm--
- Are you sure?

45
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,051
- I'm fine.
- You're sure you're fine?

46
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,754
Call 9-1-1!

47
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:59,266
<font color=#00FF00>1x07</font>

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

49
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:10,588
Hi.

50
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,956
Are you okay?

51
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,708
I'm fine.

52
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,244
I'm fine.

53
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:17,962
Did you reach Walter?

54
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,298
No. I'm sorry.

55
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,133
As I was telling
your mother and sister,

56
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,353
the CAT-Scan showed a
grade two concussion.

57
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,105
She can go home so long
as someone stays with her

58
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,523
just to make sure
there are no after effects.

59
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,141
Thank you.

60
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,728
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have left you.

61
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,480
I thought you were fine.

62
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,865
What did you think you
were doing anyway?

63
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,984
Yeah, I wanted to get
the license plate

64
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,653
of the guy who took
a shot at you.

65
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,272
Well, that was foolish.
Yeah.

66
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:53,548
So did you get
the license plate?

67
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,667
No. He got away.

68
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,786
Maybe you should spend a little
less time trying to be a hero.

69
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:00,889
You're obviously
not very good at it.

70
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:02,140
That's cute.

71
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,341
I wasn't trying to be.

72
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,844
You left her on
the street, alone and hurt.

73
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,564
In the street.

74
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,849
To get a license plate?

75
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,972
You don't believe me?

76
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:23,027
I love you.
Mom loves you.

77
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,998
But it's getting hard when you
won't be truthful with us.

78
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:37,325
Detectives.

79
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:38,927
Do you have any leads
on the shooter?

80
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,962
Not yet.
Did you get a good look at him?

81
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:42,547
No. He was wearing
a helmet.

82
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,665
Don't worry.
We'll find him.

83
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,167
My head of security
is on his way.

84
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,936
I want to make sure there are
men outside my mother's door.

85
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:48,886
She needs to be protected.

86
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,888
Well, you know
your family's

87
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,673
at the tippy-toppy
of the my list of priorities,

88
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,359
but the guy that
she was with was connected,

89
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,361
mobbed up to
the eyeballs connected.

90
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,113
She wasn't the target.

91
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:04,202
And you're welcome.

92
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,789
♪ You are my only escape

93
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:13,711
♪ You are the reason
that I wake ♪

94
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:14,662
Technically I did get here

95
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:17,365
like 10 seconds
before this guy.

96
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:21,252
Keep the change.

97
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,207
So, Tommy, what brings
you by so late?

98
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,142
Well, I assumed, rightly,

99
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,644
that you would be at home
working tonight,

100
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,596
and I also assumed
that you might be hungry.

101
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,564
Also rightly.

102
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,316
I don't know.

103
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:38,386
This is a mushroom
and olive pizza from Mario's.

104
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:40,738
That is damn good pie.

105
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,108
All right, what do
you have to offer?

106
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,560
Spicy tuna on crispy rice
from Toro's.

107
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:49,781
Ohh.
Damn you, Merlyn.

108
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,916
I hope Sushi was
all you had in mind.

109
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,870
Uh, actually, there was something
that I wanted to ask you.

110
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:57,005
And what's that?

111
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,207
Will you go out with me?

112
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,592
Like on a date.

113
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,045
You brought me dinner
to ask me to dinner?

114
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:07,332
Well, I also did throw you
a really big charity gala.

115
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,576
See, I thought you threw it
for the hundreds

116
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,103
of people it would benefit.

117
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hundreds of people.

118
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,755
Plus one more.

119
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:17,591
Tommy.
Laurel, I get it.

120
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,694
Okay, this is all happening for us
in the wrong order.

121
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:22,563
You know, first we're friends
for many years,

122
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:26,117
and then briefly
we are friends with benefits,

123
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,768
extremely excellent
benefits.

124
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,372
And now I am just
hoping that we can be two people

125
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:34,208
sitting at the same restaurant
at the same table

126
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,643
at the same time.

127
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,944
See, when I see it
like that,

128
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:39,614
it doesn't sound
so scary, does it?

129
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:48,222
Oliver, your mom
was nearly killed.

130
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:50,925
I think you can take
a day off from training.

131
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,644
My mother wasn't
the target.

132
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,146
This man was.
Paul Copani.

133
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,066
He was trying to close a deal
with her when they were shot at.

134
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:00,651
Copani works for
Bertinelli Construction

135
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,453
and Frank Bertinelli.

136
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,821
The mob boss?

137
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,656
I did some digging.

138
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,826
Copani isn't the first member
of Bertinelli's crew who's been hit.

139
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,027
You did some digging?

140
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,330
Bertinelli
has a lot of enemies.

141
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:15,450
The best way to figure out who's
trying to target his organization

142
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,585
is to get inside of it.

143
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,320
So let me get
this right, Oliver.

144
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:21,289
Your mother's shot
at, nearly killed,

145
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,374
and the way you
process this emotionally

146
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,877
is by going undercover
with the mob.

147
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,096
I'm not trying to process
anything emotionally.

148
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:30,715
Yeah, well, maybe
that's your problem, man.

149
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,766
You ever thought about

150
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:35,353
just being there
for your family?

151
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,772
I tried that today
with Thea.

152
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:39,724
She told me I wasn't
being honest with her,

153
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,691
and she's right.

154
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,627
I can't very well
explain to her

155
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,013
that I left our mother alone and
bleeding on the pavement

156
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:49,867
because I'm fast enough to
almost run down the attacker.

157
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:56,690
But what I can do
is protect my family.

158
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:03,164
And, Diggle, when I found out
who this guy is,

159
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,966
he's a dead man.

160
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:49,860
Speedy.

161
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,995
Where you going?

162
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,529
Clubbing. Which is
difficult to do

163
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:54,415
when you're in a house and
not in an actual club.

164
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:57,034
I have to go out tonight.

165
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,203
I thought you'd be
watching mom.

166
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,088
I spent the whole day
with her.

167
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,873
I thought you were
taking the night shift.

168
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,542
I'm sorry, but this thing,
it's important.

169
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:09,430
You know, sometimes, Ollie,
I just don't get you.

170
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,998
And by sometimes,
I mean ever.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,752
You're actually not the first
person to say that to me today.

172
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,720
Why am I not surprised?

173
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,023
Oh, nice dress.
Where you headed?

174
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,942
Upstairs.
Apparently.

175
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:24,862
Long story.

176
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,280
Hey, I heard about your
mom. Is she all right?

177
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:29,533
Well she's resting upstairs.
More shaken up than anything.

178
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,368
I got to run to this
business thing,

179
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,820
but I do appreciate
you stopping by.

180
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,539
It's no problem. Just so long as
your mom's all right.

181
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,357
Yeah.

182
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:40,627
Hey, one more thing.

183
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:42,196
Mainly because I don't
want you to find this

184
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:44,221
out from someone else,

185
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:48,201
that someone else
especially being Laurel.

186
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:52,973
We're going to dinner.
As in a date.

187
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:55,542
That's... that's good.

188
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:57,678
Laurel deserves
someone special,

189
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,946
and so do you.

190
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,397
Thanks, man.

191
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,565
I gotta run to this thing.

192
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,567
All right. Absolutely.
I'll catch you later.

193
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,985
Oh, and, Tommy,

194
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:07,104
if you hurt her,
I'll snap your neck.

195
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:09,990
I'm just kidding.

196
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,086
Mr. Bertinelli.

197
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:23,954
Call me Frank.

198
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,123
Ahh. Call me Oliver.

199
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,743
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me at my home.

200
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,345
My father used
to say that living rooms

201
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:32,763
make the best
conference rooms.

202
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,765
Oh, I'm gonna steal that.

203
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,083
Nick Salvati,
my associate.

204
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,519
How do you do?

205
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,521
Let's have a drink.

206
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,949
So what are you
in the mood for?

207
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:56,603
We could watch
reality housewife cooking show

208
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,872
or cop docs.

209
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:01,542
It's where doctors
run around fighting crime

210
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:03,293
when they're not
all sleeping with each other.

211
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,413
Whatever you want,
sweetheart.

212
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,615
You're the one who's
given up your evening out.

213
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:10,717
Oh, it's not like
there's anybody else

214
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,302
who could be staying
with you.

215
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,621
Oh, wait, yes, there is.

216
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,807
Don't be too harsh
on your brother.

217
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:19,593
Why not?

218
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,346
I mean, aren't you
getting sick of his lies?

219
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:27,351
Thea, everyone has secrets.

220
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,972
We all have things that
we want to keep to ourselves.

221
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,360
I just don't get him
sometimes.

222
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:40,531
I know.

223
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:44,351
I know.

224
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:50,340
You know, being in that hospital
and seeing Dr. Lamb again,

225
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:54,261
it made me remember the day
that Oliver came home.

226
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:58,432
It was Dr. Lamb
that told me

227
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,983
that the Oliver we'd lost

228
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,386
might not be the Oliver
that they'd found.

229
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,972
I think it's easy
to forget,

230
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:09,276
but he lived apart
from civilization for 5 years.

231
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,030
So what, he gets like
a free pass?

232
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,015
No. No, no, no,
not at all.

233
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:16,984
I...

234
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,910
I just think we need
to stop judging him

235
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:21,188
for the Oliver he was

236
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:25,209
and start accepting him
for the Oliver that he is.

237
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:30,631
So, Oliver,
I'll be honest with you.

238
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,549
I was surprised
to hear from you.

239
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,551
It was my impression
from the local news

240
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,170
that you weren't going to be
involved with your family's business.

241
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:38,839
Well, apparently
there were a few catch phrases

242
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,724
that I missed
while I was away for 5 years.

243
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,476
One of them being
"mainstream media."

244
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,095
The press never gets
anything right.

245
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:49,215
Oh, I know a thing
or two about that.

246
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:51,068
So, Oliver, I'll be blunt.
Mm-hmm.

247
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,436
I want the contract

248
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,322
to build Queen Consolidated's
new Applied Sciences Division.

249
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:56,890
And I am inclined
to give it to you.

250
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:59,359
Your mother wasn't
quite so enthusiastic.

251
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,695
How is she, by the way?

252
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,081
She's recuperating
at home. Thank you.

253
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,732
What a terrible thing
that happened.

254
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,784
And, Frank, I was
very sorry to hear

255
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,254
about what happened
to Paul Copani.

256
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,205
Paul was a good friend.

257
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:15,241
He was a good man.

258
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:17,678
Yeah. The violence
in this city.

259
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,412
You know, sometimes
I wonder why I stay.

260
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:22,015
I've had the same thought.

261
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:24,518
So why did you come back?

262
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,354
After that island, you could have
settled anywhere in the world.

263
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:29,306
Because Starling
City is my home.

264
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,146
No matter which way
you go or turn,

265
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,316
you always end up at home.

266
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,152
Oliver, this is
my daughter Helena.

267
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,570
Hello.

268
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,205
Nice to meet you.

269
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:46,873
I'm heading out.

270
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,941
All right.

271
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:49,126
Take one of the guys
with you.

272
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,629
I can take care of myself.

273
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,614
I wasn't asking, sweetie.

274
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,884
Frank, that meeting
you requested.

275
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:59,136
They can do it.

276
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,971
Now.

277
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:05,008
I can come back
another time.

278
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,062
No, no, no.
Just, uh.

279
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:11,631
Just excuse us for
a moment, would you?

280
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,568
Thank you.

281
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:17,571
Oliver Queen.

282
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:20,991
The rich man's
Lindsay Lohan.

283
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,660
Look, um...

284
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,479
I've got to go
to this other meeting,

285
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,365
but I need someone
to take him to dinner.

286
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,117
So you pimp out
your daughter.

287
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,120
No. I ask her to help me
close a business deal.

288
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,373
A reminder that
the family business is dying

289
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,841
and that we need
this contract,

290
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,543
and Oliver Queen
can give it to us.

291
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,128
Please, Sweet Pea.

292
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,546
For us.

293
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,349
For me. Hmm?

294
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,933
That's my girl.

295
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:50,687
Oliver, I'm so sorry.
Something has come up.

296
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,023
But Helena would love
to take you to dinner

297
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,674
and discuss the deal
further.

298
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:57,677
Oh. I was hoping
to speak with you.

299
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,847
Well, as you speak
for your family,

300
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,532
my daughter also speaks
for ours.

301
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,703
It's... It's really
not necessary.

302
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:09,706
It would be my pleasure.

303
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,907
Sure.

304
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:14,578
I look forward
to working together.

305
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,266
Thank you for coming.

306
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,151
Anything for a friend.

307
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:47,527
We're not responsible
for the attacks on your people.

308
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,179
These attacks
on my business

309
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,782
are my family's
life blood.

310
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,584
They stop now,

311
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,086
or I'm coming for you.

312
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:07,380
What does the Triad
have to gain by provoking you now?

313
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:12,085
Well, no one ever credited
the Triad with rational thinking?

314
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:16,089
If not them, then who?

315
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:18,424
Whoever it is, when I
find out who's behind this,

316
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:20,861
there will be blood.

317
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,362
Sounds like Bertinelli's
ready to put the screws

318
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,397
to everyone who pays him
protection money.

319
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,017
Yeah, well, 3 of his best
earners have been murdered.

320
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,236
He's gotta make up the cash
somewhere.

321
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,822
Whoever is pruning
the family tree

322
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,824
is using bullets
instead of arrows.

323
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,659
So you do think
it's one of the other families.

324
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,626
No.

325
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,911
Then who?

326
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,579
Well, according to
the coroner's reports,

327
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,031
none of the vics
took a clean shot.

328
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,215
Half the bullets missed.

329
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,884
Our killer's not a pro.

330
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:46,002
That's not stopping him
from pulling that trigger.

331
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,338
That's up to us.

332
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:52,409
Or this is gonna blow up
into an all-out mob war.

333
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,525
You are an angel, Helena.

334
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:07,527
So beautiful.

335
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,930
Well, we are gonna take good
care of both of you tonight.

336
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:14,233
You'll tell your father
hello from us?

337
00:17:14,235 --> 00:17:15,651
Of course, Mr. Russo.

338
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,120
I'll give you a minute.

339
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:18,488
Thank you.

340
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,593
I heard about
your mother's accident.

341
00:17:23,595 --> 00:17:25,110
Is he gonna be okay?

342
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,662
She's gonna be fine.

343
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:27,997
Thanks.

344
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:30,550
I'm glad.

345
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:37,423
So, why would you want to go
into business with my father?

346
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:40,176
You know who he is
and how he made his money.

347
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:42,795
You don't approve of your
family's enterprises?

348
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:45,116
We share a name,
and that name defines us

349
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:47,017
whether we want it to or not.

350
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:49,352
You've already made judgments
about me,

351
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:51,821
just like I've already
made judgments about you.

352
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:54,790
Right. I'm the rich man's
Lindsay Lohan.

353
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:57,577
Sorry.

354
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,379
That's okay.

355
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,650
Hey, can I ask you something?

356
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:06,485
Yeah.

357
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:09,305
I know it must have been
hell for you,

358
00:18:09,307 --> 00:18:12,992
alone on that island
for 5 years, but I'm...

359
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,845
But what?

360
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:20,633
But was there ever a day
when you were just...

361
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,852
Happy to be away
from everything?

362
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:24,937
No pressure from your family,

363
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:27,857
no need to be the person
everyone else expects you to be.

364
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:29,842
Was there ever a day when--

365
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:34,614
When I didn't feel lost
and I felt... free?

366
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,085
More than one.

367
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:41,988
And, uh...

368
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,041
Those are the days
that I miss.

369
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,196
Whew!

370
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,748
Ohh...

371
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,667
What, is it too spicy
for you, Merlyn?

372
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:57,136
No. No, not really.
I'm just, um,

373
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:58,595
I'm just crying because

374
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,507
I was thinking of
a Hallmark commercial

375
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:03,559
I saw earlier today,
featuring a sick kitty.

376
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:04,894
It was very emotional.

377
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:08,547
Will there be anything else?

378
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,100
No. Thank you.

379
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:12,768
Yeah.

380
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,771
Thanks for letting me
take you to dinner.

381
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:18,691
Well, thank you for
letting me choose Indian.

382
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:23,228
You know, I read this article
by a film critic once,

383
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,899
who said if he could have
one wish,

384
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:31,287
it would be to watch his favorite
movie again for the first time.

385
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,790
I kind of wish
that was us.

386
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:37,426
So you want dinner
and a movie.

387
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:39,795
No.

388
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:42,598
I wish we had just met

389
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,101
and that all this
was just beginning

390
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:49,438
and there wasn't so much
of me I wish you'd forget.

391
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,757
Well, keep saying
nice things like that

392
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,011
and maybe next time
I'll let you choose the restaurant.

393
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,197
Mr. Merlyn...

394
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,615
Yeah?

395
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:02,151
I'm sorry, I'm afraid
you credit card has been declined.

396
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:03,619
Did you swipe it
a few times?

397
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:05,454
You know, sometimes
those things can be a little glitchy.

398
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:08,874
I did, and, um,
I'm afraid the credit card company

399
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,843
wants me to confiscate it.

400
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:14,146
<i>Sorry.</i>

401
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:19,552
People are always asking me,
what did I miss the most?

402
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,389
Air conditioning.

403
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:24,640
Satellite radio.

404
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,892
Tagliet--uh--ta--

405
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:27,994
Tagliatelle?

406
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:29,145
Mm.
Right.

407
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:30,796
But those are the answers
that I give people

408
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:32,665
because those are the answers
they're expecting.

409
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,700
Why can't you
just be truthful?

410
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:37,136
I don't know how truthful
I can be.

411
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:40,106
You've been through
a crucible,

412
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,625
and it changed you.
How can it not?

413
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,512
That's beautiful.

414
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:47,863
Your cross.

415
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,417
It's a gift.

416
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,002
From my fiance.

417
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:54,003
Fiance.

418
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:55,204
Mm.

419
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:56,756
I didn't know
you were engaged.

420
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:58,040
I'm not.

421
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,042
Anymore.

422
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:02,261
He died.

423
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:03,596
I'm sorry.

424
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:06,165
Me, too.

425
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:09,385
That was my crucible.

426
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:14,306
Boy, it's nice to...

427
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:18,010
It's really nice to be with someone
that I can be myself with.

428
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:21,697
It's nice to be with someone
who knows how hard it can be.

429
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,849
I'm really sorry.

430
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:24,850
It's okay. Take it.

431
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,869
Thank you.

432
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,520
Yeah.

433
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:30,022
It's Diggle.
Something came up.

434
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:33,592
You gotta get out of there
and call me back.

435
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:36,462
Helena, I have to go. There's
something that I have to do.

436
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:40,716
It's about my mother,
otherwise I would, uh,

437
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:41,884
I would stay.

438
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:43,419
And I would like that.

439
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:50,526
My father would kill me
if I let you pay.

440
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,402
I have a confession.

441
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,272
I didn't want to go out
with you tonight.

442
00:22:03,274 --> 00:22:04,490
That makes two of us.

443
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:06,075
I'm really glad that I did.

444
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:07,827
That makes two of us.

445
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,445
Hmm.

446
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,730
Oliver.

447
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:14,400
Be careful with my father.

448
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:25,444
Thea, you don't need
to knock, sweetheart.

449
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:27,079
What about me?

450
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:30,249
I hope you don't mind.

451
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:32,084
Thea let me in.

452
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:33,385
What are you doing here?

453
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,404
I wanted to see how
your recovery was going?

454
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:37,723
Well, surely someone
of your means has a telephone.

455
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:38,815
I like to see someone

456
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,751
when I have something
important to talk about.

457
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:47,566
We used to be friends,
Moira.

458
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:49,735
I still remember that time.

459
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:52,771
You, me, and Robert.

460
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:55,991
Which is why I came by.

461
00:22:55,993 --> 00:23:01,464
You are a vital part
of Starling City's future.

462
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:04,116
Robert feared that future.

463
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:07,837
He lost his conviction.

464
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,421
It's been my experience
that when someone

465
00:23:10,446 --> 00:23:11,925
has a brush with death

466
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:14,009
like you experienced today,

467
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:19,598
even their deepest held
convictions can change.

468
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,484
Have they?

469
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:23,402
No.

470
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:26,305
You didn't have to say it.

471
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:31,243
I can see that they haven't.

472
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,667
What happened?

473
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,336
Yeah, it's what's
about to happen.

474
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:42,121
Bertinelli's enforcer
Nick Salvati--

475
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:44,123
Yeah. We drank a scotch
together.

476
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,824
He seems like a real
stand-up mobster.

477
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:47,993
Yeah, well, he's been
paying visits to everyone

478
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:49,494
who owes the mob
protection money.

479
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:51,847
Diggle, I'm trying to figure out
who took a shot at my mother,

480
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,465
not take on all
of organized crime.

481
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:55,134
Well, listen, Oliver,
Salvati and his goons

482
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,102
have already put 4 people
in the hospital tonight,

483
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,104
and if somebody
doesn't stop them,

484
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:01,673
the poor bastard who owns
Russo's is gonna be next.

485
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,642
Wait, wait. Russo's?

486
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:04,977
It's at the corner
of Adams and--

487
00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:06,562
I know where it is, Diggle.
I'm here right now.

488
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:08,480
What?

489
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,649
I was having dinner
with Bertinelli's daughter.

490
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:13,202
Oliver, you're supposed to be
going undercover, not speed dating.

491
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:14,787
I didn't have a choice.

492
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:17,689
Yeah, well, uh,
I've seen her on the web.

493
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:20,209
You made quite the sacrifice.

494
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,049
Salvati's here.

495
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:34,706
I'm sorry, we're closed.

496
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:40,563
Oh, Mr. Salvati.

497
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:42,714
Buona sera.

498
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:46,435
I have some fresh-made
lasagna.

499
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:48,387
We're not here
for food, Mr. Russo.

500
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:50,439
Your payment's due.

501
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:52,608
I already made
my payment this month.

502
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,743
You need to pay again.

503
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:57,363
Please. I can't afford to make
another payment if I'm going to--

504
00:24:57,365 --> 00:25:01,233
Going to what?
Restock your bar?

505
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:04,736
Break his fingers.

506
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:06,422
Leave him alone!

507
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:07,456
Break hers, too.

508
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:08,841
No! Don't touch her!

509
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:52,546
I don't understand.
Why is she targeting her family?

510
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:54,965
I don't know. And here I thought
you had parental issues.

511
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:56,900
It's not a joke, Diggle.

512
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:58,335
Oliver, you're not falling
for this girl, are you?

513
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:02,155
Because I know you can't be
that crazy.

514
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:04,374
Helena Bertinelli
shot at your mother.

515
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,560
She also murdered 4 men
in cold blood.

516
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:10,781
She has to have reasons
for what she's doing.

517
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:13,650
Reasons?

518
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:16,719
Since when do you care
about the bad guys' reasons?

519
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:18,855
Oh, she is the bad guy,
Oliver.

520
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:21,558
She's the killer. And whatever's
going on in your head,

521
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,776
you better get it
straight, man.

522
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:25,061
Any attempt on his right hand

523
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:28,932
is gonna send your new friend's
father on the warpath.

524
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:33,620
I know what I'm doing.

525
00:26:37,408 --> 00:26:40,627
Now I know how your family feels
when you lie to them.

526
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:48,351
Is this the only angle
you got?

527
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:51,054
The Russos chintzed out a bit
on their security package.

528
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:54,090
Somebody is in the wings
with a gun shooting at these guys.

529
00:26:54,092 --> 00:26:55,225
What do you got
from earlier?

530
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:57,227
Yeah.
You mean before the shooting?

531
00:26:57,229 --> 00:27:00,096
A business dinner, a birthday dinner,
a couple of blind dates.

532
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:01,898
Any guests of the Chinese
persuasion?

533
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,151
Humor me.
Why?

534
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:12,742
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a second. What was that?

535
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:13,977
Help yourself.

536
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,945
Come on.

537
00:27:21,002 --> 00:27:23,453
Son of a bitch.

538
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,444
Detective.

539
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:33,096
Is everything okay?

540
00:27:34,732 --> 00:27:38,101
Your, um, your buddy
with the arrows

541
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:39,569
was at Russo's last night.

542
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:42,272
And I was there earlier
with a date.

543
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:44,407
So... what?

544
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,159
You think I'm
the hood guy again?

545
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:49,112
No.

546
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:50,780
Your date.

547
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:52,165
Helena Bertinelli.

548
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,501
If I were you,
I'd stay away from her.

549
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:56,820
Her family's bad news
on a good day.

550
00:27:56,822 --> 00:28:00,507
Why the sudden concern
for my well-being?

551
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:06,563
A few weeks ago
I made a mistake.

552
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:08,515
I almost got you killed.

553
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:12,302
And you felt like
you owed me one?

554
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:17,224
If I did, as far as I'm concerned,
this clears the books.

555
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:30,787
Can I talk to you?

556
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:31,738
Dad!

557
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,190
In case
you haven't noticed,

558
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:36,359
I'm a little occupied
at the moment.

559
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:37,878
I just talked
to the accountant.

560
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,329
He said my accounts
were frozen.

561
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,364
He said my credit cards
were all canceled.

562
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:45,669
I pay Sandy a king's ransom
each year in fees, Tommy.

563
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:51,091
When it comes to money,
if he says it's so, it's so.

564
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:53,093
Do you think this is a joke?

565
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:56,396
No.

566
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:58,881
You are.

567
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:03,886
Although I must say,
your chronic irresponsibility

568
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:06,889
and terminal laziness
has lost its humor.

569
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:07,890
Hmm.

570
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:10,994
You're wondering why now.

571
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:14,397
The better question is,
why not sooner?

572
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,734
It's... It's my trust fund.

573
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:21,171
Which is comprised
of my money.

574
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:24,090
Oh, excuse me.

575
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:28,244
Was comprised.

576
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,724
Helena.

577
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,669
How did you find me here?

578
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,971
I followed you
from your house.

579
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:15,940
Your fiance?

580
00:30:18,977 --> 00:30:20,478
Yeah.

581
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:29,336
You said that losing him
was your own crucible.

582
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:31,939
That it changed you.

583
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:33,674
You didn't say how.

584
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,816
When you love someone
as much as I loved him,

585
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:43,987
with all of your heart,

586
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:46,688
and you can't just
turn that emotion off

587
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:48,622
when they're taken from you.

588
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:51,325
You still feel things
as deeply.

589
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:57,364
And if it can't be love
that you feel, then...

590
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:59,083
then it becomes hate.

591
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:01,218
Hate for who?

592
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,004
Oliver...

593
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,512
you should stay away
from me.

594
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:15,382
Helena?

595
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:23,157
Get in.

596
00:31:33,285 --> 00:31:37,254
My father is going
to kill you for this.

597
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,181
I've been wanting
to do that for years.

598
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:50,017
Spoiled bitch.

599
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:52,436
I knew it was someone
from the inside

600
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:54,638
waging war against
your father and me.

601
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,108
I just never thought
it'd be this inside.

602
00:32:02,514 --> 00:32:05,783
You dropped this
at Russo's.

603
00:32:05,796 --> 00:32:08,747
You're smarter than I
gave you credit for, Nicky.

604
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,101
You're not.

605
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:12,738
Hey!

606
00:32:12,838 --> 00:32:14,873
You're a businessman, right?

607
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:15,990
So let's talk business.

608
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:19,177
I can offer you a lot
of money if you let us go.

609
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:21,346
This isn't about money,
Richie Rich.

610
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:22,997
This is about loyalty.

611
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:25,333
He's got nothing to do
with any of this.

612
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:27,519
Then what the hell
is it about?

613
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:30,972
My father had Michael murdered.

614
00:32:35,238 --> 00:32:36,887
Of course he did.

615
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:39,723
He didn't want you
to know the truth.

616
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:43,477
Your rat of a fiance
was gathering evidence.

617
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:46,430
He was talking
to the friggin' FBI.

618
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:47,532
The love of your life

619
00:32:47,534 --> 00:32:50,034
was going to destroy
your father.

620
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:51,402
You're wrong.

621
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,571
Uhh.

622
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:56,574
I found a laptop
in Michael's bag, Helena.

623
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,927
Everything that could
send your father and me to prison

624
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:02,346
for the rest of our lives
was on it.

625
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:03,581
That computer--

626
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,299
Was mine.

627
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:09,804
Michael wasn't the one
talking to the FBI.

628
00:33:09,806 --> 00:33:11,088
I was.

629
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,424
You?

630
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,943
My father is a monster.

631
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:19,230
He doesn't care who he hurts
to keep his money and power,

632
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:20,831
and I wanted it to stop.

633
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,200
Well, then it's your fault
Michael's dead.

634
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:25,703
Not your father
for ordering the hit

635
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:27,822
or me for carrying it out.

636
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,442
Yours.

637
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:34,629
You shot Michael.

638
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:41,435
In the chest,
so he knew it was me.

639
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:43,471
Just...

640
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:45,840
like...

641
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:47,675
this.

642
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,346
Uhh!

643
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,702
Uhh!

644
00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:20,124
You're gonna burn in hell
for what you've done.

645
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:22,326
It'll be worth it.

646
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:23,160
Uhh!

647
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,328
Get up!

648
00:34:26,682 --> 00:34:29,300
Helena...

649
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:35,056
I didn't have a choice,
Oliver.

650
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:38,776
No one can know my secret.

651
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:47,156
CSU didn't find
any usable prints

652
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:48,407
except for the 3 victims.

653
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:50,409
One of them had
a GSW to the chest.

654
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:53,663
So who broke the necks of Salvati
and his buddy?

655
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:57,333
Look, it's been a while
since the Hood broke anyone's neck.

656
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:59,335
And I didn't see
any arrows laying around.

657
00:34:59,337 --> 00:35:00,603
We better pray that

658
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:02,628
Frank Bertinelli blames
the Hood for this.

659
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,591
'Cause if he thinks
it's the Triad,

660
00:35:05,593 --> 00:35:08,494
Starling City is ground
zero to World War III.

661
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:17,386
You okay?

662
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:20,439
I spoke to my dad today.

663
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:22,058
I bet that was fun.

664
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,695
He explained to me what happened
with my credit card yesterday.

665
00:35:25,697 --> 00:35:28,781
And my checking account,
my savings account,

666
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:33,619
my brokerage account,
my stock portfolio.

667
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:38,040
He cut me off completely.

668
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:40,543
What?

669
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:42,995
My car got repossessed.
That was fun.

670
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:45,256
Oh, and I have to move out
of my apartment by

671
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:46,890
the end of the month.

672
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:52,655
You are gonna be fine,
Tommy.

673
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:57,426
In fact, you are
gonna be great.

674
00:35:57,428 --> 00:36:02,682
Merlyn money or not.

675
00:36:02,684 --> 00:36:06,152
And you know,

676
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:10,072
I have a mushroom
and olive Mario pizza

677
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:13,409
in my refrigerator
waiting to be eaten.

678
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:16,746
I suppose it's already
paid for, right?

679
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:18,397
Exactly.

680
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:23,002
♪ Oh, no, I've
said too much ♪

681
00:36:35,383 --> 00:36:36,799
When did you get back?

682
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:38,417
Just now.

683
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:48,377
I'm so happy to see you.

684
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:53,716
But did you come home only
because you heard I was hurt?

685
00:36:53,718 --> 00:36:58,070
No. I was already on my way
when Thea called.

686
00:36:58,072 --> 00:37:03,175
I actually came home
because I miss my wife.

687
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:05,127
Ohh.

688
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:11,784
It's okay.

689
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:14,620
Is she all right?

690
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:17,006
Walter's home.

691
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:18,090
She's gonna be fine.

692
00:37:18,092 --> 00:37:21,143
Look, I'm sorry
if I was a bitch

693
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:22,445
with you earlier.

694
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,296
There were a few times.

695
00:37:24,298 --> 00:37:25,631
Could you be more
specific?

696
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:27,132
Don't push it.
Don't worry.

697
00:37:27,134 --> 00:37:29,635
You weren't a bitch.

698
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:32,971
At the hospital you were a little...
A little bit.

699
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:38,361
Look, I'm just
worried about you.

700
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,396
You seem really lonely.

701
00:37:40,398 --> 00:37:43,366
And we all have
our secrets, Ollie.

702
00:37:43,368 --> 00:37:46,585
Clearly you have yours.

703
00:37:46,587 --> 00:37:50,840
And it's fine if you don't
want to share them with us,

704
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:53,636
but I just really think

705
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:55,664
you should share them
with someone.

706
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:15,180
I'd ask how you
got in here,

707
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:19,761
but the Starling City
vigilante comes and goes

708
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:21,765
as he pleases, doesn't he?

709
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:25,557
How'd you know?

710
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:30,896
I saw you fight.

711
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,784
And I saw your eyes.

712
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:38,621
That island changed you
in ways

713
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:40,539
that only someone like me
could understand.

714
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,174
No.

715
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,093
What you're doing
right now,

716
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:47,396
I know that if feels
like justice, but it's not.

717
00:38:47,398 --> 00:38:49,765
It's revenge.

718
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:53,919
Sometimes revenge
is justice.

719
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:58,190
Your father killed
your fiance.

720
00:38:58,192 --> 00:39:00,793
And what did your
father do to you?

721
00:39:02,395 --> 00:39:07,232
Isn't the man in the hood
fighting to set things right?

722
00:39:07,234 --> 00:39:09,935
Why is your vendetta
more valid than mine?

723
00:39:09,937 --> 00:39:12,988
We're the same, you and I.

724
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,323
No, we're not.

725
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:17,726
Hiding in plain sight.

726
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:23,515
Concealing our anger
with smiles and lies.

727
00:39:23,517 --> 00:39:27,469
Don't lie to me, Oliver.

728
00:39:27,471 --> 00:39:30,288
You feel the same
as I do, I know it.

729
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,807
Why are you crying?

730
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:38,630
I don't know.

731
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:41,704
Maybe it's because
I have been alone

732
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:43,729
in my hate for so long.

733
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:46,154
I feel--

734
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:48,164
It feels so good
to tell the truth.
