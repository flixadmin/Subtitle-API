1
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,780
What is this place?

2
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,383
<i>My life doesn't really make sense.</i>

3
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,676
Hey.

4
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,970
<i>I used to ask myself
a lot of questions about that.</i>

5
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,098
<i>"Scott, you're a divorced ex-con.</i>

6
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,891
<i>How are you an Avenger?</i>

7
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,036
<i>Why are you time traveling
with Captain America?</i>

8
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,312
<i>That doesn't make sense."</i>

9
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,940
<i>A lot has changed about my life.</i>

10
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,651
<i>But everywhere I go,
people ask me the same thing.</i>

11
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,178
Can you take a picture with my dog?

12
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,613
<i>"Scott, what about now?</i>

13
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,882
<i>What's next?</i>

14
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,146
<i>Where does the ride take you?"</i>

15
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,202
<i>If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.</i>

16
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,370
All right.

17
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,349
- <i>It's been a crazy few years.</i>
- Hey, guys.

18
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,958
- Hey, hi. How are you?
- <i>For everyone.</i>

19
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,543
Everything is ready for you.

20
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,711
You're too much.

21
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,254
No, no, no.

22
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,463
Your money's no good here.

23
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,006
Aw. Are we still talking about that?

24
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,091
Yes, of course.

25
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,552
Ruben, you are the best.

26
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,263
Thank you, Spider-Man.

27
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,976
<i>So, let's make time for the stuff
that really matters.</i>

28
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,352
<i>Like friends.</i>

29
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,147
<i>Friends you didn't even know you had.</i>

30
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,234
<i>Remember the people who got you here.</i>

31
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,921
<i>You couldn't have done it without them.</i>

32
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,656
<i>Hey, I'm just a guy
who got fired from Baskin-Robbins.</i>

33
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,242
<i>Sometimes you just get lucky.</i>

34
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,369
<i>I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.</i>

35
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,912
<i>I think you know who she is.</i>

36
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,166
<i>She's taken back her dad's company.</i>

37
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,085
<i>Now she's using the Pym Particle
for global change.</i>

38
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,505
<i>A lot of people say
they want to save the world,</i>

39
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,466
<i>but Hope, she saves it every day.</i>

40
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,259
Thank you.

41
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,428
Thank you so much.

42
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,306
<i>Reforestation. Affordable housing.</i>

43
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,515
<i>Food production.</i>

44
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,267
<i>She's not wasting a second.</i>

45
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,525
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

46
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,028
<i>None of this should have happened.</i>

47
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,196
<i>But it did.</i>

48
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,824
<i>It's a pretty good world.</i>

49
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,701
<i>I'm glad we saved it.</i>

50
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,537
<i>Do I miss the action?</i>

51
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,248
"Sometimes.

52
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,375
Will I be there when the Avengers need me?

53
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,502
Absolutely.

54
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,420
I'd never turn my back on them.

55
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,424
But right now, the only job I want
is being a dad.

56
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,010
I love you, Cassie.

57
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,679
Thanks for being my hero.

58
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,266
And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays.

59
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,270
And for the rest of you kids out there,

60
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,563
word of advice:

61
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,066
Look out for the little guy.

62
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,484
Make mistakes.

63
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,694
Take chances.

64
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,781
Because if there's one thing
life's taught me,

65
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,368
there's always room to grow."

66
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,251
Sorry, that's me.

67
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,420
Why is jail calling?

68
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:39,965
Lang!

69
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,843
- Lang!
- I'm here.

70
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,427
All right, come on. Let's go.

71
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,556
Come on.

72
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,979
Hey. Is she okay? Have you heard anything?

73
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,814
Not yet. No. Oh.

74
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,566
Hi, Hope. Hey, Dad.

75
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,526
Cassie. What happened?

76
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,694
Sign here.

77
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,697
Oh, you know, just jail stuff.

78
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,490
Give it back.

79
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,909
I know it was you.

80
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,077
Are you sure?

81
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,564
I mean, it was kind of hard to see

82
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,181
through all that tear gas
you fired into the park

83
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,498
full of peaceful protestors.

84
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,791
Where is it?

85
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,915
I'm sorry. This must be
really embarrassing for you.

86
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,171
Oh!

87
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,798
I did find this, though.

88
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,680
You shrank a cop car?

89
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,931
What were you thinking?

90
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,701
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

91
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,077
They were clearing out a homeless camp

92
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,912
- in the middle of the night.
- No, I'm not saying that...

93
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,997
And where do they expect them to go?

94
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,874
It's not their fault that
they lost their homes in the Blip.

95
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:38,899
I know that.

96
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,209
No one can even afford rent right now,

97
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,027
unless you're some trust-fund asshole.

98
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,421
I'm not telling you what to do.

99
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,881
- I'm just saying...
- Telling her what to do.

100
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,239
Telling me exactly what to do.

101
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,949
No, you do what you want.

102
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,659
I'm suggesting another way to do it.

103
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:50,994
Okay.

104
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,454
You know, I promised your mom

105
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,764
that you would only use this stuff

106
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,081
when one of us was around.

107
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,333
It's really dangerous tech.

108
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,751
I know it's dangerous.

109
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,186
What if the cops took it from you?

110
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,211
What if you lost it?

111
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,296
I didn't lose the suit.

112
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,715
You have a suit? Wait, you have a suit?

113
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,401
I know how to take care of myself, okay?

114
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,302
Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

115
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,512
Ouch.

116
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,071
- I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
- I know. That's okay. It's all right.

117
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,269
I get it.

118
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,980
I just think you should
get to have a normal life.

119
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,024
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee

120
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,984
tried to kill me in my room
when I was six.

121
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,612
I've never had a normal life.

122
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,406
How about some music?

123
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,159
<i>And in that moment, all I could think was,</i>

124
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,536
<i>"How did the Hulk turn me into a baby?</i>

125
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,538
<i>Will I be a baby forever?</i>

126
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,957
<i>Am I the Hulk's baby?"</i>

127
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,833
Dad, are you listening to your own book?

128
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:39,977
<i>But I was ready for anything.</i>

129
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,003
No, that's... It's just the radio.

130
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,230
<i>Steve and I grew close over that.</i>

131
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,899
- Dad, turn it off.
- It's so weird.

132
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,901
Something's wrong with this switch.
It won't turn off.

133
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:47,926
I said, turn it off.

134
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,278
What's that? Turn it up? All right.

135
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,488
<i>A little after that,</i>

136
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,097
<i>a raccoon from space showed up.</i>

137
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,890
<i>I don't think he knew my name.</i>

138
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,267
<i>I was just happy to meet
a raccoon who could talk.</i>

139
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,480
Excuse me.

140
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,856
- Oh.
- Thank you.

141
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,235
All right.

142
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,405
Your Nobel Prize is in the mail.

143
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,116
It better be. I just saved eight bucks.

144
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,243
God, I admire you.

145
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,619
Thank you.

146
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,414
I missed this.

147
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,249
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

148
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,419
No. No anything.

149
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,838
You know, Mom, you can talk about it.

150
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,381
If you want.

151
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,551
Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.

152
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,138
I wanna live right now.

153
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,015
Yeah?

154
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,395
So, Cassie, did you make any new friends
in the slammer this time?

155
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,646
Grandpa.

156
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,106
"This time"?

157
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,816
Was there a last time?

158
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,818
I mean, last time barely counts.

159
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,903
I didn't know that.

160
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,071
Why didn't you call me?

161
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,435
'Cause I knew you'd be like this.

162
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,408
I would've just broken you out with ants.

163
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,052
All right, you know what? Family meeting.

164
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,137
Can we have a family meeting?

165
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,281
Isn't that what we're doing?

166
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,371
Yeah, I mean about this.

167
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,415
About everybody being so fine with this.

168
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,419
Look, you wanna help. I get it.

169
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,171
I do, Cassie. I really do.

170
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,648
But I don't want you wasting your life.

171
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,799
At least I'm still trying
to do something with mine.

172
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,970
I literally saved the world.

173
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,096
Oh, did you?

174
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,900
Well, yeah, you never
mentioned that before.

175
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,683
Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world.

176
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,018
How was that for you, Scott?

177
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,478
You should write a book about it.

178
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,063
Ha-ha. Hilarious.

179
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,106
Yeah, you're welcome
for all not being dust.

180
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,733
And what do you do now?

181
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,903
Sign books?

182
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,916
Aren't you the guy
who broke into VistaCorp?

183
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,925
Aren't you the guy
who flew all the way to Germany

184
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,910
just to fight Captain America
at the airport?

185
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,245
Fight with Captain America at the airport.

186
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,998
Wouldn't fight captain america.

187
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,166
I'm not insane.

188
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,460
People still need help, Dad.

189
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,255
At least we're trying to do
something that matters.

190
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,802
Who's "we"?

191
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,930
What are you three up to?

192
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,015
Science.

193
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,393
With ants.

194
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,562
Ant science.

195
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,107
I don't believe you.

196
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,193
Let's just show him.

197
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,824
What are they building?

198
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,117
Are you doing this?

199
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,495
Actually, no, they built their own tech.

200
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,122
Pretty smart ants.

201
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,040
Okay, so when you were all,

202
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,210
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

203
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,671
And I started reading
Grandpa Hank's old journals,

204
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,881
and I got really into
the Quantum Realm and...

205
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,675
The Quantum Realm?

206
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,885
I know we all have a history there,

207
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,029
and I didn't want to freak anyone out,

208
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,333
but we've been talking about it.

209
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,931
She had some questions, okay?

210
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,184
I can't help if people are inspired by me.

211
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,356
So, you've been studying
the Quantum Realm?

212
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,390
Why didn't you ask me about it?

213
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,528
I tried, Mom.

214
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,821
A lot.

215
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,656
You never wanted to talk about it.

216
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,909
Cassie's just been curious
and we gave her some pointers.

217
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,705
This isn't exactly ant science,
is it, Henry?

218
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,875
You know how dangerous
the Quantum Realm is.

219
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,018
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

220
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,586
Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.

221
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,588
That's why we made this.

222
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,133
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

223
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,220
But Quantum.

224
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,849
We just need a map.

225
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,851
And then we can study and explore

226
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,436
the entire Quantum Realm.

227
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,355
Never even have to go.

228
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,109
Your daughter built
a subatomic Hubble Telescope

229
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,402
in a basement.

230
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,866
You know, if I had something like this
when you were gone,

231
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,204
then I could have found you.

232
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,708
It's amazing.

233
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm blown away.

234
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,672
How does it work?

235
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,800
It's kinda like that two-way radio
we used to have.

236
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,886
You send a signal down from here,

237
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,864
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

238
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,139
Wait. Wait a minute.

239
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,101
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

240
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,812
Yeah.

241
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,273
- Shut it down now.
- Janet.

242
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,197
- Why would we shut it...
- What's wrong?

243
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,401
You have to turn it off!

244
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,028
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

245
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,783
Janet.

246
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,599
There's something I should have told...

247
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,158
Dad?

248
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,577
No!

249
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,371
- No!
- Mom!

250
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,164
No!

251
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,542
Damn it!

252
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,337
Dad?

253
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,495
Dad!

254
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,710
Dad!

255
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:21,903
Cassie.

256
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,451
Dad!

257
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,534
Oh, Dad.

258
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,870
Come on.

259
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,538
Okay.

260
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,623
Are you okay?

261
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,832
Yeah. I'm okay.

262
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,308
Where are we?

263
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,411
Mom!

264
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,038
Dad!

265
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,915
Hope. Over here.

266
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,585
Are you okay?

267
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,004
We should be dead.

268
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,006
Why aren't we?

269
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,383
I don't know.

270
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,928
Hope: Are we where I think we are?

271
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,305
I would say yes,

272
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,975
but it wasn't like this.

273
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,184
Janet!

274
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,602
Mom!

275
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,729
Janet?

276
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,399
Mom!

277
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,621
Do not move.

278
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,683
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

279
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:17,894
Right now.

280
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,858
<i>Hope? Hope?</i>

281
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,943
<i>Hank? Can you hear me?</i>

282
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,530
- Can anyone hear me?
- Oh, my God.

283
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,217
- It's okay.
- What are we gonna do?

284
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,035
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

285
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,611
- We're okay. It's gonna be okay.
- You're saying "okay" too much.

286
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,831
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

287
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,958
We're okay. We are fine.

288
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,586
Hey, we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home.

289
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,981
In the meantime, look around.

290
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,215
It's beautiful.

291
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,633
All right? We're outside.

292
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,511
It's like we're camping. We love camping.

293
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,845
We've never been camping.

294
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,681
But we've always talked about it.

295
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,230
Is that sun moving?

296
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,200
Get back!

297
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,830
Oh, my God.

298
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,416
I don't think this is a sun!

299
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,460
It's fine.

300
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,462
- Dad!
- Honey, it's okay.

301
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,630
Still okay.

302
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,932
Dad. Oh, my God.

303
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,100
That was weird.

304
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,481
Run.

305
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,388
There's Quantum people
in the Quantum Realm?

306
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,556
Yeah.

307
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,808
I didn't know that either.

308
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,314
What was that back there, Mom?

309
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,107
What was that ship looking for?

310
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,984
Keep your voice down.

311
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,236
You said there was nothing down here.

312
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,797
Why didn't you tell us about all of this?

313
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,424
Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now,

314
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,648
- I just need you to trust me.
- Then make me trust you!

315
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,160
Let's just calm down, all right?

316
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,244
We can talk about this...

317
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,496
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

318
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,956
No, you need to tell us what's...

319
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,080
And why didn't you listen?

320
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,444
I told you to stay away from here.

321
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,337
Janet, I'm so sorry.

322
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,565
I should have told you what we were doing.

323
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,798
I had no idea...

324
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,966
I know. It's...

325
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,302
We'll talk later.

326
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,262
Right now, we stick together,

327
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,598
we find Scott and Cassie,

328
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,850
and we go home, okay?

329
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,352
Okay?

330
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,519
- Okay.
- Okay.

331
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,687
Stay close.

332
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,446
This is incredible.

333
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,449
I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.

334
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,994
Why didn't I see any of this?

335
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,538
You weren't able to look deep enough.

336
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,166
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

337
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,252
There are worlds here,

338
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,129
worlds within worlds.

339
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,884
It's a place outside time and space.

340
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,846
It's a secret universe

341
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,765
beneath ours.

342
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,871
Hey, get your hands off me!

343
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,838
Cassie?

344
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,633
Where's my daughter?

345
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,803
Where is she?

346
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,888
Cassie?

347
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:27,852
Where's my daughter?

348
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,481
Cassie!

349
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,152
Dad!

350
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:37,987
Cassie!

351
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,114
Drink the ooze.

352
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,533
What?

353
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,848
I'll handle this.

354
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,405
Mom?

355
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,127
Was that a good stab?

356
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,046
I got us a ride.

357
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,400
He's friendly.

358
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,402
Quite a ride.

359
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,488
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

360
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:45,573
I like ants.

361
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,033
And I love that you love them. Here.

362
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,078
These will help us blend in.

363
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,748
Where exactly are we going on this?

364
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,675
We're not too far
from an old friend of mine.

365
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,711
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are,

366
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,796
it'll be him.

367
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,673
After you.

368
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,801
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

369
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,267
Let me go! Let me go!

370
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,946
I don't know what you're saying!

371
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,907
I don't know what you...

372
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,843
No! No!

373
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,156
Drink the ooze!

374
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,564
Drink the ooze!

375
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,608
Drink the ooze!

376
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,109
Drink the ooze!

377
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,862
Hello.

378
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,030
Hi. Hi.

379
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,448
Did you drink the ooze?

380
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,326
Why can I understand you?

381
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,661
Oh. Great. That's the ooze.

382
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,663
Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!

383
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,834
We can finally be friends.

384
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,169
Hi. I am Veb.

385
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,295
You just drank me.

386
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,463
I did... What?

387
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,986
Oh. Do you need some more ooze? Here.

388
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,108
I can pour some ooze into your hole...

389
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,133
No, I'm okay.

390
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,760
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Oh, wow!

391
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,345
A big hole.

392
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,180
How many holes do you have?

393
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,325
I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?

394
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,077
I don't have any holes.

395
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,103
His name is Scott Lang.

396
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,522
He has seven holes.

397
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,569
Yeah, that's right.

398
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,488
How did you know that?

399
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,657
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

400
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,035
You can read minds?

401
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,288
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

402
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,417
Everyone is disgusting.

403
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,735
Could you please stop thinking that?

404
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,130
Sorry.

405
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,631
- Please, stop.
- Thinking?

406
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,134
- Thinking that.
- I'm trying.

407
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,885
Well, not very hard.

408
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,554
And I think you look weird, too.

409
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,365
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

410
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,598
I wish my head glowed.

411
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,809
No, no, you don't.

412
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,395
I know I don't. I just...
I'm nervous, okay? And it just came out.

413
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,479
What are you doing here?

414
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,440
- Are you a spy?
- What? No. No, no.

415
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,709
We should torture him.

416
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,734
Guys. No, it's okay.

417
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,486
We're not spies. He's my dad.

418
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,071
Oh!

419
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,435
Oh, thank you.

420
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,490
Welcome.

421
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:37,202
Then who is San Francisco?

422
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,929
- It's where we're from.
- It's a place.

423
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,040
- Then what's Earth?
- It's also where we're from.

424
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,267
We should torture them.

425
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,560
Why are you always
trying to torture people?

426
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,585
We have other options.

427
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,546
Do things come out of your holes,
like milk, juice...

428
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,090
Veb, stop asking about his holes.

429
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,300
Some of us have holes.

430
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,885
What are you doing here?

431
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,678
Where are you from?

432
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,764
- Okay.
- Up there. Up there.

433
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,033
- See, above this.
- The Earth.

434
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,725
- It's a different universe.
- Big Earth.

435
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,952
It's the same universe, but it's bigger.

436
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,245
This is Earth,
but it's a very small Earth.

437
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,788
- Sometimes, I guess.
- I get big. I shrink.

438
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,813
Yeah. Yeah. And it's like...

439
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,124
But I wrote a book about it, actually.

440
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,292
- I don't know.
- This is the Quantum Realm.

441
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,501
You have to shrink
to get in the Quantum Realm.

442
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,586
We shrunk. Right now, we're really small.

443
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,670
It's bigger where we're from.

444
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,404
- So we're small right now.
- It's bigger.

445
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,077
Okay, they're telling the truth.

446
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,286
It doesn't matter.

447
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,916
You come from above.

448
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,168
Like him.

449
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,297
So he is hunting you.

450
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,592
He will burn the world to find you.

451
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,511
Who?

452
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,430
The Conqueror.

453
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,913
There are beings down here.
Intelligent beings.

454
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,041
I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here,

455
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,295
a subatomic universe.

456
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,922
This changes everything
we know about life,

457
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,508
evolution, our place in the galaxy...

458
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,385
Holy shit!

459
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,429
That guy looks like broccoli.

460
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,148
Keep your head down.

461
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,284
Follow me.

462
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,715
Drink those.

463
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,759
I'll be right back.

464
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,400
I'm here for Krylar.

465
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,364
It's you.

466
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,865
Let's keep that between us.

467
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,493
And Krylar.

468
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,661
Hello.

469
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,622
I don't know your ways or customs,

470
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,334
but I assume that you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?

471
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,544
Absolutely, sir.

472
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,924
So, what's your story then?

473
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,385
God.

474
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,929
Move.

475
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,347
It's time.

476
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,890
Follow me.

477
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,857
Right this way.

478
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,527
Oh.

479
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,865
How exactly do you know this guy?

480
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,201
Old freedom fighter friend of mine.

481
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,370
Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?

482
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,580
Or terrorist.

483
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,790
Depends on who you ask.

484
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,294
But, trust me, he can help.

485
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,963
Janet Van Dyne?

486
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,509
I thought you were dead.

487
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,011
Been a long time, Krylar.

488
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,431
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

489
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,934
I fought like hell against that.

490
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,103
It sounds so elitist.

491
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,440
You have got to be Hank.

492
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,944
I've heard so much
about you and your ants.

493
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,279
What are ants anyway?

494
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:47,823
Do we have 'em down here?

495
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,616
I don't think so. No.

496
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,785
Oh. That's too bad.

497
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:53,995
Hope.

498
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,415
You have to be Hope.

499
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,209
She talked about you every day.

500
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,710
That's strange,

501
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,046
she never said anything about you.

502
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,634
I don't think
I would have told my kid, either.

503
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,178
- Wild stuff.
- Funny.

504
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,847
How wild?

505
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,434
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

506
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,105
Krylar, we need your help.

507
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:24,234
Janet, after all
we've been through together,

508
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,527
just ask me.

509
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,154
Tell me, how can I help?

510
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,825
But is anyone starving? I'm starving.

511
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,118
Boys.

512
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,328
Now.

513
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,254
They don't know anything.

514
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,507
About anything.

515
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,954
Then get them out of here.

516
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,636
Excuse me.

517
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,972
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

518
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,579
We're just trying to find our family.

519
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,808
Do you have a map?

520
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,977
All we wanna do is go...

521
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,272
Wait, wait, wait. Don't shoot.

522
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,565
They're with us.

523
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,860
Is that building alive?

524
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,612
Yours are dead?

525
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,200
Look. Excuse me.

526
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,784
We just wanna go home.

527
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,041
At least you still have a home.

528
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,342
What happened here?

529
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,637
The Conqueror burned our homes.

530
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,056
Our stories.

531
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,310
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

532
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,979
Some of us escaped,

533
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,898
found others on the run.

534
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,526
We gathered who we could to fight.

535
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,778
It was never enough.

536
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,280
I'm sorry.

537
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,157
We can help.

538
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,123
- Cassie...
- Dad, you're an Avenger.

539
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,247
They need help.

540
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,335
No. What I need to do is get you home.

541
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:06,962
Why don't you wanna help?

542
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,481
We don't know anything about this place.

543
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,358
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

544
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,662
Have we been gone for 10 seconds?

545
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,860
Or have we been gone for 10 years?

546
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,070
Think about your mom right now.

547
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,196
Can you imagine what she must be...

548
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,346
Don't use Mom as an excuse.

549
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,598
- You just don't care.
- No, I do care.

550
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,433
I know you wanna help. I do.

551
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,394
But this is not our fight.

552
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,467
Just 'cause it's not happening to you,
doesn't mean it's not happening.

553
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,941
Hey.

554
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,279
Would you look at me?

555
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,074
She's disappointed in you.

556
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,702
- I got that. Yeah. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

557
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,953
We'll talk about it later.

558
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,788
Right now, let's just find the others.

559
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,207
No one knows this place better than Janet.

560
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,502
What did you say?

561
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,087
What?

562
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,463
That name.

563
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,133
Janet Van Dyne?

564
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,217
Where is she?

565
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,301
That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?

566
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,887
I know her.

567
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,473
She shouldn't be here.

568
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,227
Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please.

569
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:05,937
Yes, thank you.

570
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,190
If you haven't had this, don't try it

571
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,776
unless you want to change your life.

572
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,583
Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.

573
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,835
Two of them.

574
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,295
Human, like us.

575
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,088
Human. That's the word.

576
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,342
Totally forgot what you
call yourselves up there.

577
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,509
Human.

578
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,179
Are you not human?

579
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,348
Not technically, but yes.

580
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,350
In the ways that matter.

581
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,860
Let us talk.

582
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,076
So, what is it that
brings you to us, Janet?

583
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,913
If I remember correctly, you left.

584
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,375
You left all of us.

585
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,251
With him.

586
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,755
Janet, what is he talking about?

587
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,551
You didn't tell them about him.

588
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,098
Did you say anything

589
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,225
about what you did here?

590
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,729
How many people died because of you?

591
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,153
Does your family even know who you are?

592
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:41,991
Your mommy

593
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,286
is full of secrets.

594
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,538
You're lying.

595
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,831
I lie.

596
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,166
A lot.

597
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,587
But not about this.

598
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,674
Let them go.

599
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,469
He just wants me.

600
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,012
But you want them.

601
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,974
So they're coming, too.

602
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,270
Along with those other friends of yours.

603
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,523
I heard about them.

604
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,900
But he did, too.

605
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,320
And he sent the Hunter.

606
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,489
What kind of hunter?

607
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,868
Not a man. Not a machine.

608
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:30,749
A mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

609
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,210
Where are they?

610
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,670
No clue.

611
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,922
Dead.

612
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,509
Probably dead.

613
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,026
Oh, this is so sad when all of this

614
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,736
could have been avoided, Janet.

615
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,031
Just give him what he wants.

616
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,702
What happened to you?

617
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,500
We fought against him.

618
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,462
He can be very persuasive.

619
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,049
Let's pay him a visit.

620
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,513
I think we're done here.

621
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,740
Can that ship get us out of here?

622
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,453
- Cover me?
- Always.

623
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,486
Henry, take the helm.

624
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,687
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

625
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,369
Where are the controls?

626
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,121
Those are the controls.

627
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,001
What the hell?

628
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,044
You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.

629
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,382
Is the bike alive?

630
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,981
Hands, all the way in!

631
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,733
Like stuffing a turkey.

632
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,659
- Really, him?
- He used to be charming.

633
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,744
That guy?

634
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,746
I was down here for 30 years, Henry.

635
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,623
- I had needs.
- Oh, my God.

636
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,583
Look, I get it. I've got needs, too.

637
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,751
Oh, my God!

638
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,003
I had dinner with someone a few times.

639
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,047
Her name was Linda.

640
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,007
It didn't work out.

641
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,425
What went wrong?

642
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,469
She wasn't you, baby.

643
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,766
Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving.

644
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,850
All right.

645
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,727
- And, Xolum.
- Right here.

646
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,104
Take them as far away
from here as you can.

647
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,314
- Why?
- What?

648
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:44,651
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

649
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,869
You led them straight to us.

650
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,746
Come on, come on.

651
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:58,831
Take as many as you can.

652
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,166
We'll hold them off.

653
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,485
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

654
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,612
We gotta go! We gotta go!

655
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:30,905
Get on. Get on now!

656
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,240
We have to go now. Now!

657
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,217
Oh, my God!

658
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,319
Cassie, let's go!

659
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,828
Get to the sanctuary.

660
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,663
Wait for my message.

661
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,082
- Veb, we're leaving.
- No. No, wait!

662
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,293
- Move! Move!
- All my friends.

663
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,834
Give up the travelers.

664
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,234
The Conqueror will show you mercy.

665
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,778
I know his mercy.

666
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,417
Stay here. I'm...

667
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,669
Cassie?

668
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,380
Oh, no.

669
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,030
Okay. I have a suit.

670
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,949
Yeah, I noticed.

671
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:39,992
- You okay?
- Yes.

672
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,079
Look, momentum, right?

673
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,164
Jump, tap, right? One move. Jump, tap.

674
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:46,332
I know how to do it, Dad.

675
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:47,643
- Oh, do you? Really?
- Yes.

676
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,977
'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.

677
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,401
I just... I messed up on the timing.

678
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,088
Jump...

679
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,885
Like that.

680
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,489
You see what I did? You see what I did?

681
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,597
No. You're, like, this small.

682
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,266
I jumped and tapped.

683
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,194
Jentorra, we have to go.

684
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,508
Get to the ship!

685
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:28,184
Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.

686
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,520
I've been waiting a long time for this.

687
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,314
What?

688
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,025
Is someone in there?

689
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,152
Oh, yes.

690
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,905
The destiny you cannot escape.

691
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:44,200
Our fates have always been forged together

692
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,204
<i>ever since that day we met.</i>

693
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,706
Wow.

694
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,208
Scott Lang.

695
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,459
Get away from us!

696
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,127
<i>The day you broke me.</i>

697
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,216
- <i>Banished me down here.</i>
- <i>Wait.</i>

698
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,552
Darren?

699
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,847
Surprised to see me?

700
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:09,850
Yeah.

701
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,519
It's the bee guy.

702
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,437
- It's the bee guy?
- Cassie?

703
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,189
I almost didn't recognize you.

704
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,733
How are you not dead?

705
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,819
I became the ultimate weapon.

706
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,114
That's what this is?

707
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,241
Look, Darren.

708
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,705
Darren is dead!

709
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,375
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

710
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,545
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

711
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:38,838
Not from me.

712
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,090
And not from him.

713
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,302
<i>He is the future.</i>

714
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,178
He's the past.

715
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,224
And now all he needs is you.

716
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,648
Mom?

717
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,817
What's after Scott and Cassie?

718
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,154
We have to find them.

719
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,948
There's something I have to do first.

720
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,533
They could be dead!

721
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,160
Hope, please.

722
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,953
And you're still hiding things from us.

723
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,414
I am trying to protect you.

724
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:14,999
From what?

725
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,503
Who are you so afraid of?

726
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,434
Third time in jail?

727
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,604
Four.

728
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,406
And here we are again.

729
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,034
Face to face.

730
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,038
That's a face.

731
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,665
It's a big face.

732
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,417
Why are you just a floating head?

733
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,669
Maybe you could
walk us through this, Darren.

734
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,756
You left Darren to die
in the Quantum Realm.

735
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,385
<i>But the Conqueror found me.</i>

736
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,095
<i>Rebuilt me.</i>

737
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,889
<i>Made me the ultimate weapon.</i>

738
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,850
<i>A mechanized organism
designed only for kill...</i>

739
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:15,935
Oh, M.O.D.O.K.?

740
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,356
Oh, I get it. It's an acronym.

741
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:21,690
It's an acronym.

742
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,860
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

743
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,905
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

744
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,074
I bet you thought
you'd seen the last of me.

745
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,492
Just now noticing the baby legs.

746
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,244
They're not baby legs.

747
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,787
A little bit like a Björn.

748
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,288
You think you're so smart.

749
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,583
Scott Lang, the man
who took everything from me.

750
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,168
Who stole my whole life.

751
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,420
But I did it.

752
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,589
I got you here.

753
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,758
I found your signal, Cassie.

754
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,135
Thanks for that, by the way.

755
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,538
Couldn't have done it without you.

756
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,766
You're looking at a man set free.

757
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,769
I've created so much more here

758
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,438
than you could possibly imagine.

759
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,233
All for him.

760
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:10,072
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

761
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,744
What is this place?

762
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,330
<i>He said he was a traveler.</i>

763
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,542
A scientist who crashed off course.

764
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:30,718
<i>He had a ship</i>

765
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,263
beyond anything I had ever seen.

766
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:37,975
<i>A ship that could travel the Multiverse.</i>

767
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,351
The Multiverse?

768
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,897
As in alternate dimensions?

769
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,899
Parallel realities?

770
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,692
I didn't believe it at first.

771
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:49,904
But it's real.

772
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,115
<i>Just like we theorized.</i>

773
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,369
Can this take us home?

774
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,748
It can take you anywhere.

775
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,810
<i>I'd never met anyone like him.</i>

776
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:27,816
<i>He felt so lost.</i>

777
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,736
<i>I guess we both were.</i>

778
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,072
<i>But we had a way out.</i>

779
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,451
<i>We tried everything</i>

780
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:40,412
<i>to recharge his ship's energy core.</i>

781
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,586
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

782
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:53,801
<i>But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.</i>

783
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,512
I lied to Hope.

784
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,726
I told her I was coming home.

785
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,732
I can see her by the door.

786
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,653
Waiting for me.

787
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,200
That's the last thing I did,

788
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,037
was lie to her.

789
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,876
I just thought I'd have more time.

790
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,174
I can give that to you.

791
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,177
Time.

792
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,433
It's not what you think it is.

793
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,147
It's a cage.

794
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:51,317
And it does everything it can

795
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,068
to break you.

796
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:02,119
It's not until you free yourself from it
that you see just how small

797
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,330
it always was.

798
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,004
We're going to get out of here.

799
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,217
She's gonna open the door

800
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:19,803
and you'll be there.

801
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,601
I promise.

802
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,024
Let's get to work.

803
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,321
<i>It took ages, but we did it.</i>

804
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:42,034
We brought it back to life.

805
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,663
Let's go home.

806
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,086
<i>His ship was neurokinetic.</i>

807
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,713
<i>Connected to his thoughts.</i>

808
00:52:58,634 --> 00:52:59,677
<i>When I touched it,</i>

809
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,305
I saw his mind.

810
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:05,683
<i>I felt</i>

811
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,852
<i>what he had done.</i>

812
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,483
<i>Entire worlds,</i>

813
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,361
<i>entire timelines.</i>

814
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:21,198
<i>Gone, like they never even existed.</i>

815
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,968
Janet?

816
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:46,974
We can leave.

817
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,185
Right now.

818
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,817
Who is Kang?

819
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,574
Who I need to be.

820
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,246
He didn't crash here.

821
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,457
He was exiled here.

822
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,711
Outside space and time.

823
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,547
The only place

824
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:21,091
that could hold him.

825
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,594
Exiled?

826
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,721
By who?

827
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,097
I don't know.

828
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,393
But they sabotaged his ship.

829
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,438
And trapped him here.

830
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,275
And because of me,

831
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,069
he was getting out.

832
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:42,362
Janet?

833
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,408
Stay away.

834
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,707
You saved my life.

835
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,380
I made a promise.

836
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,972
Just let me take you home.

837
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:11,809
And then?

838
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,729
What are you going to do?

839
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,367
Win.

840
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:50,180
I told you, time isn't what you think.

841
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,976
I can make it

842
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,854
so you never left her.

843
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,400
Hope is going to open the door

844
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,152
and you'll be there.

845
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,489
And how many worlds will die

846
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,576
if you get out?

847
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,161
Not yours.

848
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,540
She'll never know.

849
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,839
Don't you want to see your daughter again?

850
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,718
I can't let you leave.

851
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,180
Why do you think you can stop me?

852
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,533
Give it to me, Janet.

853
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,119
Give it to me!

854
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:57,539
I couldn't beat him. He was too powerful.

855
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,416
What did you do?

856
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,422
I'm sorry, Hope.

857
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,913
<i>I blew up his core.</i>

858
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,290
<i>Cut him off from time.</i>

859
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,627
<i>And trapped us both down here forever.</i>

860
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,589
But I gave him back enough.

861
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:49,383
Now that he had his suit back,

862
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,928
he became what he always was.

863
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,514
<i>A conqueror.</i>

864
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,266
<i>He's got weapons and technology</i>

865
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:02,104
<i>centuries beyond anything we can dream of.</i>

866
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:06,733
<i>He took his prison and made it his empire.</i>

867
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:11,029
I spent years fighting him,

868
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,782
running from him, hiding from him.

869
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,910
And then you saved me.

870
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,248
You brought me home.

871
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,209
But I didn't deserve it.

872
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,589
I unleashed a monster on this place

873
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,591
and ran away.

874
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,429
Janet, you couldn't have known.

875
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,558
I'm sorry I never told you.

876
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,519
I just wanted to forget.

877
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,356
I just wanted to be your mom again.

878
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,698
I'm so sorry you had to go
through all of that alone.

879
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,285
But you are not alone now.

880
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,373
We'll stop him together.

881
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,876
He's after the core.

882
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,379
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

883
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,423
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,

884
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,924
he's got Pym Particles.

885
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,926
- And a head start.
- Exactly.

886
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,733
We gotta get out of here.

887
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,889
Hope, he cannot get out.

888
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,912
You're an interesting man,

889
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,000
Scott Lang.

890
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,878
I don't know who you are,

891
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,839
but you've made a big mistake.

892
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:54,508
Okay?

893
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:56,968
I'm an Avenger.

894
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,179
I've called the other Avengers.

895
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:00,889
You're an Avenger?

896
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,060
Have I killed you before?

897
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,020
What?

898
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,773
They all blur together after a while.

899
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,652
You're not the one with the hammer?

900
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,153
No, that's Thor.

901
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,156
We get confused a lot.

902
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,492
Similar body types. Who are you?

903
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,037
Just a man

904
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,706
who's lost a lot of time.

905
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,041
Like you.

906
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,420
But we can help each other with that.

907
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,424
M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.

908
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,885
Yeah, he stole something from me.

909
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,848
Do not speak when I am in the room.

910
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,275
Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

911
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,277
You know Janet, too?

912
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,780
Does everyone down here know Janet?

913
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,700
She didn't tell you about me?

914
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,956
I guess that's not a surprise.

915
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,669
Janet stole something from me.

916
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:16,214
My ticket out of here.

917
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,845
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

918
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,763
And why would I do that?

919
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,433
Because you want to get out of here.

920
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:31,188
And I need to get out of here.

921
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,358
Because I know how it ends.

922
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,235
How what ends?

923
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,948
All of it.

924
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,496
I don't live in a straight line.

925
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,792
And with time,

926
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:54,878
it's hard

927
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:57,047
not to skip to the end.

928
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,009
So, if you want to stop what's coming,

929
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:05,472
and trust me, you do,

930
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:09,893
I am the only shot you have.

931
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,728
What's coming?

932
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,402
A lot of me.

933
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:27,410
They exiled me, down here.

934
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,332
They're afraid of me.

935
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,508
But I'm the man who can get you home.

936
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,395
So, do we have a deal?

937
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,692
No, I don't think we do.

938
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,994
Dad!

939
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:11,496
Let me make this easy for you.

940
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:13,373
You will bring me what I need

941
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,834
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you,

942
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,086
then make you relive that moment

943
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:21,548
over and over again in time, endlessly,

944
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:24,175
until you beg me to kill you.

945
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,845
Do we understand?

946
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:31,599
Don't do this.

947
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,605
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

948
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,901
Dad.

949
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,279
Don't listen to him.

950
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,699
No! No!

951
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,942
Look, we can talk about this.

952
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:50,452
Don't do it!

953
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,037
You really should do it.

954
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,204
Please.

955
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,125
That's my daughter. Please.

956
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,753
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

957
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:00,920
Please!

958
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,297
You think I'm lying?

959
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,175
Do I look like a liar to you?

960
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,927
Stop!

961
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,654
- Dad!
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

962
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:11,306
I'll do it. Just let her go.

963
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,016
Let her go. Let her go!

964
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,195
You're out of your league,

965
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,239
Ant-Man.

966
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,289
Just be glad I need you.

967
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,972
Don't touch her again.

968
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,016
Then give me what I need.

969
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,019
Where is it?

970
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:40,979
What is that?

971
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,523
It was a multiversal engine core.

972
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,609
A power source that can take you

973
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,653
anywhere in space and time.

974
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:51,990
Then Janet blew it up.

975
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,662
It's in that?

976
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,706
It is that.

977
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,875
And we have to get to the center.

978
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,169
That's good to know.

979
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:09,215
You'll have to shrink down
and pass through the eye of the storm.

980
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:12,010
Once you're inside, find the core

981
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,887
and size it back down.

982
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,513
What does it look like?

983
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,764
When I steal something,

984
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,033
I usually know what I'm stealing.

985
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,684
You'll know it when you see it.

986
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,145
Get in and out as fast as you can.

987
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:25,607
The longer you're in there,
the more your mind will come undone.

988
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:29,486
Better hurry.

989
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:31,946
Dad!

990
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,909
I'm sorry.

991
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,535
This is all my fault.

992
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,830
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

993
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,043
I messed up.

994
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:46,544
Cassie.

995
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,714
My whole life happened
because I messed up.

996
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,801
The only thing I didn't mess up is you.

997
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,181
Dad!

998
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,933
It's okay.

999
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,142
It's okay.

1000
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:05,355
I love you, Peanut.

1001
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,399
I love you, too.

1002
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,153
Okay. I'm in.

1003
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,450
Darren, can you hear me?

1004
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:00,618
Darren?

1005
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,537
Darren?

1006
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,000
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

1007
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,286
<i>What?</i>

1008
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,211
- I'm in.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1009
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:13,464
Okay, so what do I do? What's the plan?

1010
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,134
<i>Don't die?</i>

1011
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,762
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

1012
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,764
<i>Do you see it?</i>

1013
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:23,725
Yeah. I see it.

1014
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,356
I'm heading in.

1015
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,653
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1016
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:36,738
What the hell?

1017
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:37,923
<i>I told you, Scott.</i>

1018
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,574
<i>Getting in was just the beginning.</i>

1019
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:40,867
You never said that.

1020
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,285
Why am I looking at another me?

1021
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,995
I'm not another me. You're another me.

1022
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,163
You just came out...

1023
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,873
Why am I looking at another me?

1024
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,209
<i>You're looking at
the possibility of another you.</i>

1025
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,128
<i>You're in a Probability Storm.</i>

1026
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,422
What does any of that mean?

1027
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,257
- You don't know?
- Why would I know?

1028
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:57,484
Because you got me in here.

1029
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:58,748
Oh, so I am the real one, huh?

1030
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,802
No, I didn't say that.

1031
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:02,626
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1032
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:03,824
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1033
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,034
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- What the hell?

1034
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,100
What the hell?

1035
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,269
What is this place?

1036
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,438
<i>It's a Probability Storm.</i>

1037
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:13,441
<i>Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.</i>

1038
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,008
What is he saying? What's he saying?

1039
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,128
What's he saying?

1040
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,755
<i>You're inside Schrödinger's box.</i>

1041
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:18,780
<i>And you're the cat.</i>

1042
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,549
- That doesn't make sense.
- Oh, I get it.

1043
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,283
Nobody move! All right? Nobody move!

1044
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,637
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

1045
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:25,787
- What the hell?
- Am I real?

1046
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:26,913
- Am I real?
- Am I real?

1047
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,432
- I am the real one!
- What the hell?

1048
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:30,375
What the hell? I'm the real one.

1049
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,043
Guys. Hey, relax.

1050
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,878
Take it easy. Breathe.

1051
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:36,130
We'll figure this out. Together.

1052
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,298
Who are you?

1053
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:38,841
Why are you dressed like that?

1054
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,302
Because I work at Baskin-Robbins.

1055
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,221
This is my uniform.

1056
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:44,681
These are normal clothes.

1057
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,099
Why are you dressed like that?

1058
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:48,935
- Do you have ice cream?
- Enough! Let's do this!

1059
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,653
Oh, we're all gonna die.

1060
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,573
Wait.

1061
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:03,866
Wait. Wait!

1062
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,118
No! No!

1063
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,745
<i>No! Wait! No!</i>

1064
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,247
I've got a read on Scott.

1065
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,926
Out of the way!

1066
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,099
- Mom! What is this?
- What are you doing?

1067
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,426
<i>Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.</i>

1068
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,603
<i>They're not you.</i>

1069
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,897
Scott, where are you?

1070
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,070
Why am I here?

1071
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,989
Don't worry. It'll work this time.

1072
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,949
What are you... Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

1073
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,618
- Stop! No!
- I got this, guys.

1074
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,001
I got this! I got it!

1075
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:00,631
Scott, where are you?

1076
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,259
Scott!

1077
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,263
Where are you, Scott?

1078
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,638
- I can't breathe.
- Ow, that's my neck.

1079
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,853
Stop kicking me!

1080
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:15,730
Help!

1081
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,291
- Oh, my back!
- We're all gonna die!

1082
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,316
Get off me!

1083
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:19,567
Dad.

1084
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,654
<i>Come back.</i>

1085
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:27,784
<i>Dad, if you can hear me,</i>

1086
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,870
<i>come back. Just come back.</i>

1087
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,456
- <i>Don't give up.</i>
- Come on.

1088
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,334
- <i>Dad, just come back one more time.</i>
- Come on.

1089
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,137
- She needs us.
- <i>Please.</i>

1090
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,605
- Yes, come on.
- <i>Come back.</i>

1091
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,339
She needs us. Let's do it together.

1092
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,591
- Get him up! Get him up!
- Grab him! Grab him!

1093
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:44,967
Let's go.

1094
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,221
- Come on, lift him!
- Yes!

1095
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,598
- I got ya, I got ya! Go.
- Come on. That's it.

1096
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:51,742
- Come on!
- Give him a boost!

1097
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:52,809
Give him a boost!

1098
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,313
Come on, we're doing it for Cassie!
Fellas, let's go!

1099
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,190
Everyone, together!

1100
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,399
What are you doing?

1101
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,693
How are you able to do that?

1102
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:03,861
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

1103
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,114
We all want the same thing.

1104
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,743
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1105
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,753
Go get her, pal.

1106
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,677
Everyone, let's go!

1107
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,305
Come on!

1108
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:40,273
Come on, closer.

1109
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:41,399
Get him higher!

1110
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:43,150
Hang on, guys, hang on.

1111
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,987
Careful. Steady, steady.

1112
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,825
Steady. That's it.

1113
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:51,993
Lets go.

1114
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,375
What?

1115
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,560
- No.
- What happened? Did it work?

1116
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,507
Sorry, buddy!

1117
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,342
No, no, no.

1118
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,438
Hope, are you real?

1119
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,273
I'm real.

1120
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:23,900
Then lets do this.

1121
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,197
You ready?

1122
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,365
Ready.

1123
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,454
Come on.

1124
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,848
We gotta get that thing out of here.

1125
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,958
No, no, no. Wait. He's got Cassie.

1126
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,751
- What?
- Scott.

1127
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,337
- Janet.
- Give that to me.

1128
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,421
- We have to go now.
- No.

1129
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:28,798
He's got Cassie.

1130
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:31,634
We will save her.
I promise you we will save her,

1131
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,012
but you cannot give that to him.

1132
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,639
I wouldn't trust her.

1133
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,353
Janet has a way of

1134
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:46,857
changing her mind.

1135
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,200
Hello, Jellybean.

1136
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:08,879
So, what's it gonna be, Scott?

1137
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,719
Well, well.

1138
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:18,723
If it isn't my old mentor.

1139
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:24,103
Hi, Hank.

1140
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,691
Darren?

1141
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,777
Didn't expect to see
your protégé again after all...

1142
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,654
Holy shit, Darren.

1143
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:35,948
What happened to you?

1144
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,534
I am the ultimate weapon!

1145
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,838
Do I need to take it?

1146
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:52,465
Where is my daughter?

1147
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,551
Scott.

1148
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:57,887
Don't.

1149
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,015
We had a deal.

1150
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,017
She'll be fine without you.

1151
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,169
So long, Hank.

1152
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:38,719
Henry.

1153
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,187
You left me right here to die.

1154
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,818
Let's see how they do.

1155
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,088
What did you see?

1156
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:08,184
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1157
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,312
But I always wondered,

1158
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,026
when you touched my mind,

1159
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,206
what did you see?

1160
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,291
A monster

1161
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,211
who thinks he's a god.

1162
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,047
When you can see time the way I do,

1163
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,132
you don't get to close your eyes.

1164
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:43,010
And you're the only one who sees?

1165
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:47,890
I am the only one
that can see it's broken.

1166
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:49,350
And who broke it?

1167
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,020
I did.

1168
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,233
Every version of me.

1169
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,860
My variants.

1170
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,946
Throughout the Multiverse.

1171
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,451
Playing with time, like children.

1172
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,873
But I saw how it ends.

1173
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,168
I saw their chaos

1174
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,922
spreading across realities.

1175
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,342
Universes colliding.

1176
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,053
Endless incursions.

1177
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,348
I saw the Multiverse.

1178
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:31,934
And it was dying.

1179
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:34,979
All because of them.

1180
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,315
So I took control.

1181
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,859
You mean you started a war.

1182
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:44,947
And now you wanna wipe away
any universe that's a threat to you.

1183
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,658
That's what monsters do.

1184
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:50,703
That's what conquerors do.

1185
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,956
They burn the broken world.

1186
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,751
And they make a new one.

1187
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:00,796
You don't care about
saving anything or anyone.

1188
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,259
You only want revenge
because they beat you.

1189
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:07,136
Because you lost.

1190
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,346
I have lost.

1191
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:15,144
You have no idea what I have lost.

1192
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:20,566
And I will burn them out of time

1193
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,151
for what they've done to me.

1194
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:27,072
You'll be wiping out entire timelines.

1195
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:30,909
Murdering trillions of people.

1196
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,830
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1197
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,270
Oh, God. What am I doing?

1198
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,240
What?

1199
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:15,454
Hank!

1200
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,376
Are these your ants?

1201
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,127
From the ant farm?

1202
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,171
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1203
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,964
How did you find them down here?

1204
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:30,135
I've been picking up strange signals
ever since we crashed.

1205
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,932
<i>First I thought
maybe it was a malfunction.</i>

1206
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:36,683
Some kind of interference.

1207
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,727
What is that?

1208
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,020
But it wasn't.

1209
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,606
It was the ants.

1210
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,444
They were reaching out the whole time.

1211
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,489
<i>Apparently, they passed through</i>

1212
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,366
<i>some sort of time dilation.</i>

1213
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,744
<i>They've lived thousands of years
in a single day,</i>

1214
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:59,331
<i>expanding their knowledge, their science,</i>

1215
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,501
<i>becoming more advanced
than I could have ever thought.</i>

1216
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,253
<i>I didn't find them.</i>

1217
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,380
They found me.

1218
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,092
I told you they were smart.

1219
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:13,804
They've already built something

1220
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:17,558
of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.

1221
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,727
I mean, I know socialism
is a charged word,

1222
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,896
but we could learn a lot from these...

1223
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,064
Dad.

1224
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,150
Yeah, they're my ants.

1225
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,902
And ants don't give up.

1226
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:30,320
I don't care who this guy is.

1227
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:31,697
I don't care what he can do.

1228
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,906
I'm getting Cassie.

1229
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,451
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

1230
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,038
We've got some ideas.

1231
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,206
What are you thinking?

1232
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:44,376
Well, as a great writer once said,

1233
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,588
"There's always room to grow."

1234
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,049
You read my book?

1235
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:55,137
Every goddamn word.

1236
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,141
Come on. Let's go to work.

1237
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,989
Hey! I'm sorry.

1238
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,908
That was probably terrifying.

1239
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:17,367
What are you doing here?

1240
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,244
I'm rescuing you.

1241
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,621
How?

1242
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:23,832
That's a good question.

1243
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:27,127
Does this thing have, like, a key?

1244
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,296
Or a card? Like a room key?

1245
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:30,672
Do you know, like a...

1246
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:33,634
Shit!

1247
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,351
Jump and tap.

1248
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,402
Jentorra,

1249
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:55,614
I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

1250
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:58,325
How can I help?

1251
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:04,540
Wow.

1252
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:05,874
Let's hurt 'em back.

1253
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:08,293
Damn, you're cool.

1254
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,337
Do you have a plan?

1255
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,740
Freeing you was basically my plan.

1256
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:13,799
Do you have a plan?

1257
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,286
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1258
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,404
Then free our people
from the detention cells below

1259
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:19,781
and launch a counteroffensive from within.

1260
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,182
Yeah, you have a plan.
So, how do we get the message out?

1261
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,518
- Follow me.
- Okay. Great.

1262
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:32,150
I built an empire down here, Janet.

1263
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:36,154
And I'm taking it with me.

1264
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:55,048
You really should've let me out
when you had the chance.

1265
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:07,436
History is not written.

1266
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,689
<i>It is forged.</i>

1267
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,317
<i>Today, we ascend.</i>

1268
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:15,736
<i>From this fortress,</i>

1269
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:19,197
<i>I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.</i>

1270
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:24,036
<i>Today we conquer eternity.</i>

1271
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:26,997
<i>And the dynasty of Kang shall...</i>

1272
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,628
<i>Hello? Is this working?</i>

1273
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:34,212
Cassie?

1274
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,256
<i>I can't tell if this is working.</i>

1275
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:39,134
Okay. I think we're on.

1276
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,861
I'll hold them off. Get the message out.

1277
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,566
I thought you were
getting the message out.

1278
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:45,307
Now!

1279
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,727
We're inside. We breached the tower.

1280
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:49,895
<i>And I'm with Jentorra.</i>

1281
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,480
<i>He's not invincible.</i>

1282
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,655
I know it might feel like

1283
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,198
<i>it's too late,</i>

1284
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,910
<i>like all we do is just lose.</i>

1285
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:07,037
<i>But the family I've lost</i>

1286
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:09,289
<i>taught me to keep fighting.</i>

1287
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:11,333
<i>And if they were here, they would, too.</i>

1288
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,169
<i>We need to look out for the little guy.</i>

1289
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,129
My dad taught me that.

1290
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,340
<i>'Cause when people needed help,</i>

1291
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,176
<i>he didn't look the other way.</i>

1292
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,469
<i>And neither do we.</i>

1293
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:26,014
We need to move!

1294
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:28,266
Come to the tower! Fight back!

1295
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,811
<i>I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.</i>

1296
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:33,146
He knows he can't take all of us.

1297
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,439
<i>Come to the...</i>

1298
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:35,607
Cassie.

1299
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,835
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1300
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,403
- Let's go!
- I'll drive.

1301
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:46,993
Find Lang's daughter.

1302
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,373
Kill her.

1303
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,635
Let's go. Let's go!

1304
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:13,382
If you want to fight, follow me!

1305
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,401
Its over, Cassie.

1306
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,486
Free the others. Go!

1307
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:30,746
He's gonna see us coming.

1308
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,956
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

1309
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:35,041
Begin the launch.

1310
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:29,105
Your dad's not here, Cassie,

1311
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:31,097
but I guess that's not a big surprise.

1312
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,039
Kang!

1313
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:59,042
We had a deal.

1314
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,463
You took my daughter!

1315
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,843
Holy shit.

1316
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:09,094
That's big.

1317
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,479
You lied to me!

1318
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,899
Our word is our bond.

1319
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:26,444
Without that, we're nothing!

1320
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,698
- Bring him down.
- Yes, sir.

1321
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:37,831
Keep going. I've got them.

1322
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:41,084
Yeah, come on!

1323
01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:56,808
There's so many!

1324
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:59,227
Scott! I can't hold them!

1325
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:11,364
They came.

1326
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:15,118
Way to go, Cassie!

1327
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:18,622
Yes!

1328
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,374
Come on! Let's go!

1329
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:28,619
Revolution!

1330
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:43,396
Burn it all down!

1331
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,732
Fight!

1332
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:03,959
Cover! Get down!

1333
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,135
What is the bridge code?

1334
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:15,762
I'll die first.

1335
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:18,014
One, eight, one, four, seven.

1336
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,182
Damn!

1337
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:35,573
You'll need this.

1338
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:38,785
Hi.

1339
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:40,662
This is our home!

1340
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:43,039
Let's take it back!

1341
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:48,503
No!

1342
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,804
I have holes.

1343
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:02,225
I have holes!

1344
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:10,191
I didn't know he could do that.

1345
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:20,952
Kang!

1346
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:22,829
Where is she?

1347
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:24,706
Launch now!

1348
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:37,510
What is that?

1349
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,345
He's getting out.

1350
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:40,889
Oh, no, he's not.

1351
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,148
Keep him away from the rings.

1352
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:30,480
Dad!

1353
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,609
Dad, I'm coming!

1354
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:47,163
Dad!

1355
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:57,006
Nowhere left to run.

1356
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:07,254
Please let this work.

1357
01:34:25,535 --> 01:34:27,096
Hey, where do you think you're going?

1358
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,163
Let's go.

1359
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,373
You think this is over? Come on! Let's go.

1360
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:32,041
Darren, just stop

1361
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,836
trying to be whatever this is.

1362
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:37,130
I don't know what to be.

1363
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:40,717
Tell me what to be.

1364
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:43,178
I don't know. Just don't be a dick.

1365
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:45,346
It's too late.

1366
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:47,098
Look at me.

1367
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:50,226
I'm such a dick.

1368
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:53,062
It's never too late to stop being a dick.

1369
01:34:58,776 --> 01:34:59,944
We've gotta stop him.

1370
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:03,156
I have an idea.

1371
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:06,701
Ready?

1372
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:08,036
Probably not.

1373
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:13,291
One, two, three. Now!

1374
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:37,649
Dad!

1375
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:38,900
Dad!

1376
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:40,735
Cassie?

1377
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:43,696
You're huge.

1378
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,199
I'm huge.

1379
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:51,412
I love you, Peanut.

1380
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:52,914
I love you, too.

1381
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,874
I'm so proud of you.

1382
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,669
I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla.

1383
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,421
I know. It feels so cool.

1384
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:02,382
I know, right?

1385
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:04,259
I'm so hungry.

1386
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:05,426
Yeah, that happens.

1387
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,762
- I could eat everything.
- Everything. I know.

1388
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,723
- But I really want, like, a lime.
- Right?

1389
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:12,934
- Citrus. It's weird. I know.
- Citrus.

1390
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,018
It's...

1391
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:26,281
Take the tower!

1392
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,188
It's over.

1393
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:03,109
You still can't see it.

1394
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:07,989
It's never over.

1395
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:26,484
- We have to go, right now.
- No.

1396
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:27,568
- Come on.
- No!

1397
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,046
I know, I know, but we have to go.

1398
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,446
- No!
- Come on.

1399
01:39:20,496 --> 01:39:21,831
You son of a...

1400
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:26,502
- Oh, God.
- Scott.

1401
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:27,795
Come on.

1402
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:35,178
You think this is new to me?

1403
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:41,225
Do you know how many rebellions
I have put down?

1404
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:44,479
No, no, no.

1405
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:48,065
How many worlds I've conquered?

1406
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:51,152
How many Avengers I've killed?

1407
01:39:51,319 --> 01:39:53,863
And you think you can beat me?

1408
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:55,615
I am Kang!

1409
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:56,741
You.

1410
01:39:57,783 --> 01:40:00,036
You talk to ants.

1411
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:22,451
My name is Darren,

1412
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:27,123
and I am not a dick!

1413
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:49,895
Sorry I'm late.

1414
01:41:52,189 --> 01:41:53,441
Lotta ants.

1415
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:55,860
Oh, is this you?

1416
01:41:57,153 --> 01:41:59,447
Maybe you were right about me, Cassie.

1417
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:01,741
Darren.

1418
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:04,535
Are you okay?

1419
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:08,539
Probably not.

1420
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:11,542
- Darren?
- Hi, Hope.

1421
01:42:12,501 --> 01:42:13,961
You changed your hair.

1422
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,591
What the hell happened?

1423
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:22,278
Yeah. No, it's a whole thing.
I'll tell you later.

1424
01:42:24,513 --> 01:42:25,931
I don't know what to say.

1425
01:42:26,515 --> 01:42:27,808
Thanks, Scott.

1426
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:31,646
You always were a brother to me.

1427
01:42:33,773 --> 01:42:34,774
I was?

1428
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:43,741
I was.

1429
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,548
And at least I died

1430
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:02,635
an Avenger.

1431
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:06,931
Yeah.

1432
01:43:07,973 --> 01:43:11,268
- You did.
- Yeah. No, it's... You're in.

1433
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:28,953
A lot has happened today.

1434
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:30,913
- <i>Henry?</i>
- Janet?

1435
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:32,876
- Mom, where are you?
- <i>I'm in the tower.</i>

1436
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,042
I think I can give us one shot back.

1437
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:37,002
But we don't have much time.

1438
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:38,838
If we wanna go home,

1439
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:42,717
we have to go now.

1440
01:43:43,342 --> 01:43:44,343
We'll finish this.

1441
01:43:46,637 --> 01:43:47,680
Thank you.

1442
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,141
Thank you.

1443
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:51,642
Oh, wow!

1444
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:53,269
Come on! Let's go!

1445
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:54,645
All right. Good luck.

1446
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,063
Good luck. Come on.

1447
01:44:26,761 --> 01:44:27,801
Thanks, buddy.

1448
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:31,098
You did it.

1449
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:36,020
Let's go home.

1450
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:58,876
Where's Scott?

1451
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:00,586
He was right behind me.

1452
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:45,256
You should've looked the other way.

1453
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:48,092
Yeah, well, never been great at that.

1454
01:45:56,058 --> 01:45:57,518
And you're not getting out.

1455
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:09,530
I want you to remember.

1456
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,575
You could've gone home.

1457
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:29,758
You could've seen your daughter again.

1458
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:44,940
But you thought you could win.

1459
01:46:58,329 --> 01:46:59,830
I don't have to win.

1460
01:47:01,332 --> 01:47:03,250
We both just have to lose.

1461
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:55,636
Dad?

1462
01:48:04,144 --> 01:48:05,229
Where is she? Is she...

1463
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:06,689
- No, she's okay.
- Where is she?

1464
01:48:06,772 --> 01:48:08,524
She's okay. She's okay. She's okay.

1465
01:48:08,607 --> 01:48:10,085
- Scott, they're all okay.
- She's safe?

1466
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:11,485
They're all okay. You did it.

1467
01:48:11,652 --> 01:48:12,653
You did it.

1468
01:48:16,073 --> 01:48:17,992
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- No, no, no.

1469
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,576
No, don't let go. Don't let go.

1470
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:21,370
Don't let go.

1471
01:48:21,537 --> 01:48:22,788
Don't ever let go.

1472
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:25,749
I got you.

1473
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,712
You came back.

1474
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:41,390
I love you, Hope.

1475
01:48:44,059 --> 01:48:45,394
I love you, Scott.

1476
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:00,594
Let's go home.

1477
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:04,473
Home's good.

1478
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:14,566
<i>My life doesn't make sense.</i>

1479
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:17,027
<i>I used to ask myself
a lot of questions about that.</i>

1480
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:19,947
<i>"Scott, you just saved the Quantum Realm
with your family</i>

1481
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:21,990
<i>and drank a guy without holes.</i>

1482
01:50:22,157 --> 01:50:24,409
<i>Why does this kind of stuff
keep happening to you?</i>

1483
01:50:24,576 --> 01:50:26,078
<i>That doesn't make any sense."</i>

1484
01:50:26,245 --> 01:50:27,746
<i>But you know what?</i>

1485
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:29,748
<i>Who said life has to make sense?</i>

1486
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:35,087
Ruben!

1487
01:50:35,254 --> 01:50:37,631
You are the bug!

1488
01:50:37,714 --> 01:50:40,217
I was wrong. Yeah. You are the other bug.

1489
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,677
You're the bug man.

1490
01:50:41,844 --> 01:50:44,429
You get big and get small like a big bug!

1491
01:50:45,097 --> 01:50:47,724
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

1492
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:48,892
Twelve dollar.

1493
01:50:50,727 --> 01:50:51,770
Twelve!

1494
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:54,481
<i>I used to wonder
if this chapter in my life was over,</i>

1495
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:55,983
<i>but as Cassie reminded me,</i>

1496
01:50:56,066 --> 01:50:57,818
<i>"There's always someone you can help."</i>

1497
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:00,988
Came out of cake making retirement
for you.

1498
01:51:03,448 --> 01:51:04,449
Wow.

1499
01:51:05,075 --> 01:51:06,451
You made this yourself?

1500
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:08,036
Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes.

1501
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,121
I know.

1502
01:51:09,204 --> 01:51:10,998
This is the first one I've made
since 1997.

1503
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:12,374
You're a real artist.

1504
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:14,501
<i>It's been a pretty wild ride.</i>

1505
01:51:14,668 --> 01:51:17,087
<i>One day you're fired from Baskin-Robbins,</i>

1506
01:51:17,254 --> 01:51:20,048
<i>the next you're beating
a time-traveling space king.</i>

1507
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:23,093
<i>We did beat him, right?</i>

1508
01:51:24,553 --> 01:51:25,738
<i>I mean, yeah, that's what happened.</i>

1509
01:51:25,762 --> 01:51:28,098
<i>He was getting out and he didn't get out.</i>

1510
01:51:29,558 --> 01:51:30,642
<i>I think.</i>

1511
01:51:32,144 --> 01:51:34,730
<i>But he also said something bad was coming,</i>

1512
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:37,608
<i>and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.</i>

1513
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:41,028
<i>Wait. So did I just kill everyone?</i>

1514
01:51:41,737 --> 01:51:43,780
<i>Is everyone gonna die because of me?</i>

1515
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:46,116
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1516
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,659
<i>Oh, my... What did I do?</i>

1517
01:51:48,202 --> 01:51:51,246
<i>What did I do?</i>

1518
01:51:53,665 --> 01:51:55,375
<i>You know what?</i>

1519
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:57,294
<i>It's probably fine.</i>

1520
01:51:57,377 --> 01:51:59,463
<i>Like I said, life doesn't make any sense,</i>

1521
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,758
<i>so maybe stop asking
so many questions, Scott.</i>

1522
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,384
<i>Stop overthinking it.</i>

1523
01:52:06,887 --> 01:52:08,680
Surprise!

1524
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:12,976
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1525
01:52:14,186 --> 01:52:15,520
It's not my birthday.

1526
01:52:15,687 --> 01:52:18,190
I know. But I missed a few.

1527
01:52:20,609 --> 01:52:22,486
<i>This is good. We're all together.</i>

1528
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:24,279
<i>You're fine.</i>

1529
01:52:24,446 --> 01:52:27,366
<i>Everything's probably fine.</i>

1530
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:29,868
<i>Kang's gone. You did it.</i>

1531
01:52:30,994 --> 01:52:32,704
<i>Don't have to worry
about that guy anymore.</i>

1532
01:52:32,788 --> 01:52:33,914
Ah. Thanks.

1533
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:39,419
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1534
01:52:43,548 --> 01:52:44,925
Oh.

1535
01:55:17,285 --> 01:55:20,872
So, the exiled one is dead.

1536
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:25,085
You sure he's dead?

1537
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:28,588
If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you.

1538
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:30,549
Must really eat you up

1539
01:55:30,632 --> 01:55:32,342
that you're not the one who killed him.

1540
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:35,345
None of us

1541
01:55:36,179 --> 01:55:37,889
killed him.

1542
01:55:40,183 --> 01:55:41,560
They did.

1543
01:55:42,436 --> 01:55:46,982
They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.

1544
01:55:47,649 --> 01:55:49,109
And if we let them,

1545
01:55:49,568 --> 01:55:51,403
they will take

1546
01:55:52,821 --> 01:55:54,448
everything

1547
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:57,367
we've built.

1548
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:00,954
So, let's stop wasting time.

1549
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:05,792
We're late.

1550
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:10,130
How many did you call?

1551
01:56:10,464 --> 01:56:12,883
All of us.

1552
02:03:35,783 --> 02:03:40,788
Time is everything.

1553
02:03:46,044 --> 02:03:49,047
It shapes our lives.

1554
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:54,302
But, perhaps, we can shape

1555
02:03:56,095 --> 02:03:57,180
it.

1556
02:03:58,431 --> 02:03:59,557
It's him.

1557
02:03:59,974 --> 02:04:03,269
What? You made him sound
like this terrifying figure.

1558
02:04:04,938 --> 02:04:06,022
He is.
