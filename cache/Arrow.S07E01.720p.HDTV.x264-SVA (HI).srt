00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:39,325
of this unknown assailant, we
can tell you with 100% certainty

323
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:41,744
that he is not Oliver queen.

324
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:43,246
This is someone new.

325
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:45,039
You said, "assailant."

326
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:46,424
Does that mean city hall
considers this new green arrow

327
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:47,592
a threat?

328
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:49,544
To the rule of law? Absolutely.

329
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,089
Star city continues to employ
a zero-tolerance policy

330
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,050
against any and all acts of
vigilantism.

[Camera shutter clicks]

332
00:16:57,846 --> 00:17:01,597
Anyone found committing or
aiding and abetting these acts

333
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:06,018
will be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

334
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:08,187
Rene: Think she's full of crap?

335
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:09,948
You really have
to ask me that?

336
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:11,566
You done giving
your statement?

337
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:14,360
Green guy with
a bow and arrow

338
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:16,955
takes down a weapons deal
and saves my ass.

339
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:18,781
If you ask me, you should
be helping this guy,

340
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,366
not hunting him down,

341
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:22,201
especially with Diaz
still out there.

342
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:24,203
Diaz has been gone
for months,

343
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,538
and the FBI still has
its eye on us.

344
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:27,790
So as much as I doubt
Laurel's motives...

345
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,968
And, uh, believe me,
I do...

346
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:32,211
Taking a hard-line stance
was the right play,

347
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:34,380
because if agent Watson
even so much as suspects

348
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:35,807
we have something to
do with this...

349
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:37,550
Our immunity goes adios.

350
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,385
That's right. And that's
why we have got to find

351
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:41,387
this green arrow wannabe
and shut him down.

352
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:44,983
Rene, we all agreed,
for better or for worse,

353
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,642
we were not gonna go out
as vigilantes.

354
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:48,769
Otherwise, what was
Oliver's sacrifice for?

355
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:50,989
Ok, so we're supposed
to just ignore

356
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:53,733
the rising crime rate
and do nothing about it?

357
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,827
Actually, I think risking
my officers every day

358
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:57,495
fighting to maintain
law and order is

359
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:58,654
doing something
about it.

360
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,823
I... I get that, d.,

361
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:03,659
but Oliver asked us
to carry on.

362
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,870
So whoever's behind
that mask is doing

363
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:07,622
what we're supposed
to be doing.

364
00:18:07,698 --> 00:18:09,582
But he's not
helping the problem.

365
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:11,843
Actually, he's
making it worse.

366
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,670
Rene, I'm not saying

367
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:17,256
that we can't still be
heroes to this city.

368
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,309
We just have to do it in a
little bit of a different way.

369
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:24,430
So where you at
finding this wannabe?

370
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:27,308
Well, we retrieved a few
arrows from the scene,

371
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:29,268
but forensics still
turned up empty.

372
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:30,770
But what about the perp?

373
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:33,031
Any pattern as to how he's
selecting his targets?

374
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:35,033
This weapons dealer has a
rap sheet 12 feet long.

375
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:36,651
He was an obvious Mark.

376
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:38,369
But this first guy...
Stent...

377
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,363
I still haven't figured out
how he fits into the puzzle.

378
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:42,698
You don't think he's
innocent.

379
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,158
This guy? Hell, no.

380
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:45,660
But his rap sheet's
only clean

381
00:18:45,736 --> 00:18:47,161
because he paid
to make sure it was.

382
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:48,663
Well, it looks like you
might have to take

383
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,215
a deep dive through
his financials.

384
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,874
Yeah.
But I can't exactly

385
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:53,459
subpoena his records
based on a hunch.

386

a subpoena?

there are actually benefits.

more typing.

Right! Sorry. Uh, it should
only be a couple of minutes

393
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,475
before I'm in, which Felicity
could beat one-handed.

the assist here, you guys.

397

water here at a.R.G.U.S.,

resources going after Diaz.

at hq right now,

things over.

this green arrow imposter

402

off the streets
as bad as you.

403
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:26,492
I don't want Watson
thinking that Oliver

404
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,744
set this in motion
in some type of way.

405

trouble as it is.

Curtis: How stent's been
making his money.

410
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:41,924
And it's not from
defrauding pensions.

411

black-market arms.

What kind of dumbass leaves his
entire criminal enterprise online?

413
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,439
He was actually
pretty smart about it.

414
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,266
He kept himself clean,
off the radar,

415
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:53,227
activities washed through
a series of shell corporations.

I just happen
to be smarter. Boo-ya.

417
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:56,772
So this is how the
targets are connected.

418
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:58,783
Stent supplied the
weapons, Medina sold them.

419

The vigilante's trying to shut
down stent's whole network.

Yeah. And according to this
text exchange, he's panicked.

rest of his inventory off

Do we have
a location?

Not until an hour
before the buy.

on who this might be?

shows up?

00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:25,353
No, I'm not.

642
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,772
- Felicity...
- I'm done hiding, Oliver.

643
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:30,108
I'm done being a person
who doesn't fight back.

644
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,736
Diaz broke in, and all
I could think about was

645
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:34,362
protecting William.

646
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,365
I tried,
and I couldn't do it.

647
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,243
If a.R.G.U.S. Hadn't gotten
there when they did...

648
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,130
Do you know what it
feels like

649
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,415
not being able
to protect your family?

650
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:49,136
I have lived with that
feeling every second

651
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,962
since I stepped
in here, Felicity.

652
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:52,797
Don't...

653
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:54,924
Don't tempt that,

654
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:57,644
please.

655
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,605
Please.

656
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:04,559
I am begging you
to go back

657
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,810
to witness
protection.

658
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:09,606
No. I won't.

659
00:35:09,683 --> 00:35:13,535
You don't get to decide
this time, Oliver.

660
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:18,165
I love you,

661
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,909
and I will always...

662
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,838
Always wait for you.

663
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:28,625
But I can't
let what happened

664
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:30,460
to William and I
happen again.

665
00:35:30,537 --> 00:35:32,179
I can't.

666
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:36,257
I have to fight back.

667
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,927
You, of all people,
understand that.

668
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,011
[Yorke clears throat]

669

Yorke: Time's up, 4587.

670
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:44,641
I... I need a bit more time.

671
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:46,652
And I don't care.

672
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:53,108
I love you.

673
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:56,277
Ok. Ok.

674
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,455
I love you.

675
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,333
Hey, guys, listen up.
I got some news.

676
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,293
We need more
duct tape, dad.

677
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:13,878
Not anymore, peanut.

678
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:15,463
We got ourselves
some new equipment.

679
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,849
I'm talking about
bags, gloves.

680
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,851
You were talking about you
wanted some new shoes, right?

681
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,386
We got that, too.

682
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:23,188
Tony: Hey, you win
the lottery or something?

683
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,556
Nah. I just got some help
from somebody looking out.

684
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,892
But I thought you said
the old stuff builds character.

685
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:30,770
That... that was before I knew
we would get newer stuff.

686
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:31,771
[Laughs]

687
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:32,981
Dad?

688
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,732
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Ok.

689
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:36,493
Uh, keep practicing.

690
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,902
And when we get back,

691
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:39,621
we're gonna be ripping
these bags apart.

692
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:45,743
Rene: Hey.
What's up, d.?

693
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,121
What brings you
to these parts?

694
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:52,667
Well, uh, a couple of mom and
pop shops called the precinct.

695
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,794
They said they opened up
to find cash waiting.

696
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:57,681
It seems like 15 other
hard-up businesses

00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,133
from the glades also got the same
exact amount that went missing

698
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:01,968
from the weapons buy
the other night.

699
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:04,679
So, uh, you wouldn't happen
to know anything about that,

700
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,763
would you?

701
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,307
Uh, no. No. I can't...

702
00:37:08,384 --> 00:37:10,143
But it does sound like
the work of a hero, though.

703
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:12,770
That's what it
feels like.

704
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:14,364
I should be arresting you

705
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,366
for the crap you pulled
the other night.

706
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,943
Do you have any idea the position
you're putting me in, Rene?

707
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,695
Hey, look, I'm sorry,
d., all right?

708
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,363
But I couldn't let you
lock him up.

709
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,207
He's not a criminal,
and you know it.

710
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,908
No, I don't.

711
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:27,827
And it's not a leap of
faith I'm willing to take.

712
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:30,788
You know, I am working so hard
to restore the city's faith

713
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:33,958
in the men and women
who serve it.

714
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,377
Rene, if you go out there
as wild dog again,

715
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,796
I will not hesitate
to lock you up

Are you serious, d.?

I just want you to think
long and hard

719
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:46,179
about what that means, ok?

720
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:49,557
For these kids and for Zoe

721
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,027
