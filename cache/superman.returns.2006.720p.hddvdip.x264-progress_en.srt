1
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:16,497
<i>You will travel far, my little Kal-El.</i>

2
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:19,243
<i>But we will never leave you...</i>

3
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,339
<i>... even in the face of our deaths.</i>

4
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:26,129
<i>You will make my strength your own.</i>

5
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,755
<i>You will see my life through your eyes...</i>

6
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,476
<i>... as your life will be seen through mine.</i>

7
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:41,980
<i>The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.</i>

8
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,105
<i>In spite of your past...</i>

9
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:15,068
...I know you're a good man.

10
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,367
And all good men...

11
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:21,403
...deserve a second chance.

12
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:32,549
From the moment
I received your first letter...

13
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:35,552
...I knew you were not like the rest.

14
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:41,011
You came from nothing...

15
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:44,478
...and you worked so hard
to get where you are.

16
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,273
You might have made a few mistakes.

17
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,437
- Gertrude, for God's sake!
- Damn it, Gertrude, let us in now!

18
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:57,240
You said that if I helped you
get out of prison...

19
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:00,906
...you'd take care of me.

20
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,071
And you have.

21
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,670
You've shown me pleasures
that I've never known.

22
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,588
That's why you deserve...

23
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,668
...everything.

24
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,634
I love you...

25
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,222
...Lex Luthor.

26
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:41,942
Gertrude, let us in. He's a crook.

27
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:44,160
He doesn't love you, Gertrude!

28
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:45,706
He's a monster! Gertrude!

29
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,557
- You can keep that.
- Oh, God.

30
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,008
The rest is mine.

31
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:15,152
We're done.

32
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:46,842
Bye, Martha.

33
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:25,753
Oh, Clark.

34
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:31,518
Oh, my boy.

35
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:22,237
Will you get that thing out of my face!

36
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:30,903
Lex, your friends give me the creeps.

37
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,953
Prison is a creepy place, Kitty.

38
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:35,578
One needs to make creepy friends
in order to survive.

39
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,241
Even a man with my vast talents
is worth less inside...

40
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:42,287
...than a carton of cigarettes and
a sharp piece of metal in your pocket.

41
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:49,135
Do you know the story of Prometheus?
No, of course you don't.

42
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:53,350
Prometheus was a god who stole
the power of fire from the other gods...

43
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,261
...and gave control of it to mortals.

44
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:58,106
In essence, he gave us technology.
He gave us power.

45
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:01,807
So we're stealing fire? In the Arctic.

46
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:05,604
Actually, sort of. You see, whoever
controls technology controls the world.

47
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:08,449
The Roman Empire ruled the world
because they built roads.

48
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:11,571
The British Empire ruled the world
because they built ships.

49
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:15,244
America, the atom bomb,
and so on and so forth.

50
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:17,075
I just want what Prometheus wanted.

51
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,078
Sounds great, Lex, but you're not a god.

52
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:27,169
Gods are selfish beings
who fly around in little red capes...

53
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,633
...and don't share their power
with mankind.

54
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:31,429
Hey, boss.

55
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,682
We found something.

56
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:41,310
No, I don't wanna be a god.

57
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:44,568
I just wanna bring fire to the people.

58
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:49,320
And I want my cut.

59
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:34,359
Was this his house?

60
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:37,736
You might think so. Most would.

61
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:40,951
This is more of a monument
to a long dead...

62
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:43,700
...and extremely powerful civilization.

63
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,548
This is where he learned who he was.

64
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,719
This is where he came for guidance.

65
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:02,686
Possibilities.

66
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:06,937
Endless possibilities.

67
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:54,907
You act like you've been here before.

68
00:15:20,977 --> 00:15:22,804
<i>My son...</i>

69
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,723
<i>... you do not remember me.</i>

70
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,817
<i>I am Jor-El.</i>

71
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:33,314
<i>I'm your father.</i>

72
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:37,571
<i>By now, I will have been dead
many thousands of your years.</i>

73
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:41,244
<i>- He thinks I'm his son.
- You are the only survivor of Krypton.</i>

74
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:47,081
<i>Embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature...</i>

75
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:50,125
<i>... and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds...</i>

76
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:53,714
<i>... spanning the 28 known galaxies.</i>

77
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,675
<i>There are questions to be asked.</i>

78
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,966
<i>Here in this...</i>

79
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,632
<i>This Fortress of Solitude...</i>

80
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:05,685
<i>... we shall try to find
the answers together.</i>

81
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:07,350
Can he see us?

82
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,733
No, he's dead.

83
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,273
<i>So, my son...</i>

84
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,693
<i>... Kal-El...</i>

85
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:23,245
<i>... speak.</i>

86
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,874
Tell me everything...

87
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:29,666
...starting with crystals.

88
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:27,975
Hey, boy.

89
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:56,079
<i>- On Tuesday, between support...</i>

90
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:58,580
<i>- hindered the firefighting efforts
for all those...</i>

91
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:03,420
<i>Police have finally arrived and it's
still complete mayhem down here.</i>

92
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,177
<i>Fighting broke out in the
southernmost region...</i>

93
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,757
<i>... with border fire
and small-arms attacks prevalent.</i>

94
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,679
Don't worry, I buried it this morning.

95
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:14,939
<i>- It was futile trying to force him
to testify before a grand jury.</i>

96
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:16,602
Mom?

97
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:20,019
Five years.

98
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:25,317
If your father was alive,
he never would have let you go.

99
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:27,613
I almost gave up hope.

100
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:31,037
I just thought
I would never see you again.

101
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,365
Oh, Clark.

102
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:44,304
Did you find what you were looking for?

103
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:48,838
I thought, hoped...

104
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:51,476
...it might still be there.

105
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:53,978
Your home?

106
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:58,808
That place was a graveyard.

107
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:01,737
I'm all that's left.

108
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,526
Clark, the universe is a big place.

109
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:10,319
And you don't know who's out there.

110
00:21:12,123 --> 00:21:14,579
And even if you are the last...

111
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,997
...you're not alone.

112
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:25,421
I know.

113
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,196
- Sorry.
- Look out!

114
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:49,613
Watch out, will you?

115
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,281
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

116
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:54,201
Sorry.

117
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:58,710
Great. Would you be careful?

118
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:03,212
- Jimmy.
- Mr. Clark! I mean, Kent! Mr. Kent!

119
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,460
Welcome back! Oh, my God!

120
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:09,384
Hey, come... Wait right there.
I'll be right back.

121
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:22,309
Oh, hey, sorry, guys,
I'm still looking for a place to live...

122
00:22:22,486 --> 00:22:24,229
...if you know of anything reasonable.

123
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:28,070
Behind you, Mr. Kent.
I made it myself. It's a cake.

124
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,446
Oh, it looks...

125
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:33,694
...delicious.

126
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:38,202
Olsen! Where are the photos
of that birthday-clown-massacre thing?

127
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,951
I'm on it, chief. Hey, look who's back.

128
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:42,756
- Kent?
- Hey, chief.

129
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:45,415
- Thank you for giving me my job back.
- Don't thank me.

130
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:46,921
Thank Norm Palmer for dying.

131
00:22:48,804 --> 00:22:50,761
It was his time.

132
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:55,640
- Let's get you set up, huh?
- Olsen!

133
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:57,056
Okay, so I gotta run...

134
00:22:57,229 --> 00:23:00,515
...but I will be back to check on you
in a sec, Mr. Kent.

135
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:04,855
Oh, hey, do you know
where I can find Lois?

136
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:21,165
<i>The timing of this
automated-ignition countdown...</i>

137
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:23,495
<i>... is the most precarious part
of the launch.</i>

138
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:25,298
<i>Lois Lane, Daily Planet.</i>

139
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:28,717
<i>You also stated that the shuttle
will usher in a new era of travel...</i>

140
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:31,922
<i>... enabling the average person
to afford transcontinental flights.</i>

141
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:34,174
<i>But can you tell us the exact price...</i>

142
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,924
<i>... an "average person"
will be expected to pay?</i>

143
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:39,814
<i>The answer to that question
is in your press packet.</i>

144
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:42,732
<i>The Earth is surrounded
by a blanket of air...</i>

145
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,272
<i>... which we call the atmosphere.</i>

146
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:49,028
<i>It reaches over...</i>

147
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,865
Yeah. He looks just like his mom.

148
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,037
Already takes after her too, especially
when it comes to getting into trouble.

149
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,705
Mother?

150
00:24:45,547 --> 00:24:50,210
Oh, yeah, well, I guess you've been gone.
Fearless reporter Lois Lane is a mommy.

151
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:55,840
Oh, you know, I'll just...
I'll take that. That's good.

152
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,934
- Sorry.
- No. She's got plenty.

153
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:01,060
- Wait, she's married?
- Yes.

154
00:25:01,563 --> 00:25:05,608
No. Not really. It's more like
a prolonged engagement.

155
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:08,231
But don't ask Miss Lane
when they're tying the knot...

156
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:11,939
...because she hates that question.

157
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:16,577
<i>- Like this follow the same stringent
safety guidelines set by NASA?</i>

158
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:19,366
<i>Since this is a joint venture
with the Air Force...</i>

159
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,040
You all right? You look like
you could use a drink.

160
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:28,713
This place is so tacky.
Why are we back here?

161
00:25:28,883 --> 00:25:32,501
Kitty, while you were doing your nails
and ordering fur coats online...

162
00:25:32,678 --> 00:25:34,421
...I was busy unlocking the secrets...

163
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:37,467
...of one of the most advanced
civilizations in the universe.

164
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:38,886
Weren't there two of those?

165
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:43,306
You see, unlike our clunky
earthbound forms of construction...

166
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,936
...the technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...

167
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:48,516
...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.

168
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:50,069
Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.

169
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:53,986
Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...

170
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:56,281
...would be indistinguishable from magic.

171
00:25:56,452 --> 00:26:00,829
But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons...

172
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:03,040
...entire continents...

173
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:06,128
...all grown.

174
00:26:13,803 --> 00:26:17,137
To think that one could create
a new world...

175
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:20,307
...with such a simple little object.

176
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,308
It's like a seed.

177
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,722
And all it needs is water.

178
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,359
Like...

179
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,144
...Sea-Monkeys.

180
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:35,111
Exactly, Kitty.

181
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:37,319
Like Sea-Monkeys.

182
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:44,115
Clark has been doing a little
soul-searching for the last couple years.

183
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,284
- He saw Ilamas.
- Yeah?

184
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,500
- Yeah.
- Must be tough coming back.

185
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:52,373
- Coming back?
- To work.

186
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:54,760
Yeah.

187
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,751
Well, you know, things change.

188
00:26:57,931 --> 00:26:59,970
I mean, of course things change...

189
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:06,013
...but sometimes things that you didn't
think would change could change.

190
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:08,058
Take Lois.

191
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:12,183
A woman like her,
I never thought she'd settle down.

192
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:16,319
You know, if you ask me...
Because she'll never tell you this...

193
00:27:16,492 --> 00:27:21,366
...but if you ask me,
she's still in love with you-know-who.

194
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:33,580
The original space shuttle
generated 7.5 million pounds of thrust...

195
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,467
...just in the initial launch phase.

196
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:40,381
But, by piggybacking
on this Boeing 777... Yes?

197
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,597
If this launch is as pivotal as you claim...

198
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:45,057
...why is it being covered
by one news network?

199
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:48,432
Why don't we save those questions
for the post-launch briefing.

200
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:50,231
How about that, Miss Lane?

201
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,851
When we hit 40,000 feet,
the shuttle will detach, ascend...

202
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:57,730
...and then fire the first of two propellant
systems, the liquid fuel boosters.

203
00:27:57,908 --> 00:27:59,948
When the shuttle
reaches the stratosphere...

204
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,242
...the secondary
insertion booster will fire...

205
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:05,781
...propelling the craft
at 4gs into the mesosphere.

206
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:11,786
- Careful.
- I know.

207
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:15,633
- Careful. Careful.
- I know.

208
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,326
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

209
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:47,787
Wait for it.

210
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:53,963
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

211
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:59,131
<i>It's freaking Gone With the Wind.</i>

212
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:01,843
- Shut off the camera.
- But I'm getting it.

213
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:04,053
I said, shut off the damn camera.

214
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:12,148
I think I did something wrong.

215
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:16,646
No. That wasn't you.

216
00:29:44,224 --> 00:29:47,888
<i>Ignition is at T minus one minute
and we are prepping for separation.</i>

217
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,555
CDR, start the clock.

218
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,513
<i>Three minutes and counting.</i>

219
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,932
<i>Body signs normal. Crew is looking good.</i>

220
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,769
Shuttle readouts are holding steady.

221
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:59,186
<i>- We're still a go for launch.
- Roger.</i>

222
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:09,575
<i>- Houston, you copy?
- Houston, do you copy?</i>

223
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,576
Oh, God.

224
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,791
<i>Electrical variance.</i>

225
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:23,137
What the...?

226
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,059
Please, there's nothing to worry about.

227
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,477
It seems that we are experiencing
a slight power outage.

228
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:43,899
- What did you do?
- It wasn't me. It just cycled back up.

229
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:47,112
<i>Genesis, radio check from Houston.</i>

230
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,238
There we have it.
We were experiencing a power outage.

231
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:56,242
<i>- Climbing to 40,000 feet.
- Roger, 40,000 feet.</i>

232
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,435
<i>And it's gone! A blazing fastball...</i>

233
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,114
Is that it?

234
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:41,665
I don't think so.

235
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:33,597
<i>Dual engine failure,
but they're up and running again.</i>

236
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:37,638
<i>Genesis, I hate to say this, but it looks
like we're gonna have to scrub the launch.</i>

237
00:32:37,815 --> 00:32:41,350
- Aborting booster ignition.
- Roger. Aborting booster ignition.

238
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:46,321
Boosters are non-responsive.
We're still counting down for ignition.

239
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,199
<i>- Platform, we have a problem.
- Go.</i>

240
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:50,776
<i>Looks like something faulted
during the power outage.</i>

241
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:53,278
<i>Both boosters are
counting down for ignition.</i>

242
00:32:53,456 --> 00:32:55,413
Platform, you have 30 seconds.

243
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,829
<i>- What?
- Release couplings.</i>

244
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:58,377
<i>We can 't shut down boosters.</i>

245
00:32:58,545 --> 00:33:01,996
We should be able to manage the launch
and recover to the emergency field.

246
00:33:02,173 --> 00:33:03,716
<i>T minus 23 seconds to ignition.</i>

247

00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:15,726
Couplings are non-responsive.

251
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:17,805
<i>- We're still attached.
- Seventeen.</i>

252
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,935
<i>- Platform, couplings are jammed.
- Fifteen.</i>

253
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,901
<i>Fourteen.</i>

254
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:27,573
Don't be alarmed. It's absolutely normal.

255
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:32,399
<i>We're still attached.
Couplings are non-responsive.</i>

256
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,152
<i>- Nine, eight...

257
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:37,952

And if you're lucky, you may hear
the faint pop of the sonic boom.

261

<i>- Houston, we have ignition.

<i>... malfunctioned

Health, has he gained weight?
What's he been eating?

308
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:56,394
Business, how is this gonna affect

Gil, how many F's in "catastrophic"?

313
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,082
None. What's the usage?

314
00:43:20,255 --> 00:43:23,459
"This mysterious electromagnetic pulse
knocked out portable devices...

315
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,587
...and entire power grids,
causing a catastrophic event during..."

316
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:28,304
- Lois!
- Yes.

317
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,097
In my office.

318
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:33,351
This goes for everyone.

319
00:43:33,518 --> 00:43:37,137
The story isn't the blackout,
it's Superman!

320
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,142
The story is the EMP, chief.

321
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:43,816
Every electronic device
on the East Coast goes dark.

322
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:46,110
- First, are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

323
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:49,283
Lois, three things sell papers:
Tragedy, sex and Superman.

324
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:53,034
People are sick of tragedy, we know
you can't write worth a damn about sex.

325
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:56,788
<i>That means one thing. That one thing
is Superman. And you know it, Lois.</i>

326
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,829
Lois?

327
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:01,703
<i>- Are you all right? You sure?
- Yeah.</i>

328
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,550
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thank God.</i>

329
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:07,387
<i>- Where's Jason?
- I don 't know. Isn't he with you?</i>

330
00:44:07,553 --> 00:44:08,881
<i>- No.
- Well, where is he?</i>

331
00:44:09,055 --> 00:44:10,632
Hi.

332
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,602
Hello.

333
00:44:21,317 --> 00:44:22,977
Who are you?

334
00:44:23,152 --> 00:44:27,316
I'm Clark Kent, an old friend of
your mom's from before you were born.

335
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:30,403
Really? She never mentioned you.

336
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,826
Really? Never?

337
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:34,275
- No.
- Jason.

338
00:44:35,415 --> 00:44:38,120
- What are you doing here, honey?
- Daddy's office is boring.

339
00:44:38,293 --> 00:44:40,120
Daddy's office is boring?

340
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:42,963
Clark, hey! Welcome back.

341
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:49,508
- I see you've already met the munchkin.
- Yeah, we were just talking...

342
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:51,718
- Did you take vitamins? Eye drops?
- Yes. Yes.

343
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,096
- Albuterol? Poly-Vi-Flor?
- Yes. Yes, Mom.

344
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:57,268
Good boy. He's a little fragile,
but he's gonna grow up...

345
00:44:57,437 --> 00:44:59,762
...to be big and strong
like his dad, won't you?

346
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,184
- Yes?
- Yes.

347
00:45:01,357 --> 00:45:02,685
Oh, I saw you on the...

348
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:04,898
Oh, yeah. That was nothing.

349
00:45:05,695 --> 00:45:09,028
- Hey, can I borrow your stapler?
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:12,700
Thanks.

351
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:17,446
Congratulations on the Pulitzer.
That's incredible.

352
00:45:17,624 --> 00:45:19,783
Yeah. Can you believe it? It's...

353
00:45:21,712 --> 00:45:23,669
So I wanna hear all about your trip.

354
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,507
Where did you go? What did you see?
Meet anyone special?

355
00:45:26,674 --> 00:45:29,130
Well, there's so much. Where to begin?

356
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:31,793
Where's the little guy? Hey, kiddo.

357
00:45:32,973 --> 00:45:34,218
- How are you?
- Good.

358
00:45:34,391 --> 00:45:36,467
Can you work some magic
to get your uncle...

359
00:45:36,643 --> 00:45:39,265
...to stop giving me
such a hard time on this article?

360
00:45:39,854 --> 00:45:41,349
- Please?
- Again?

361
00:45:41,523 --> 00:45:43,646
- Again.
- You got it.

362
00:45:44,693 --> 00:45:46,899
- How are you, kiddo?
- Good.

363
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,861
Oh, this is Clark.

364
00:45:50,324 --> 00:45:52,530
- Clark, Richard. Richard, Clark.
- Richard White.

365
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,946
Hi.

366
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,496
Richard's an assistant editor here who's
basically saved our International section.

367
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:01,500
He's also a pilot
and he loves horror movies.

368
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:04,413
Clark is...

369
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:07,004
Well, he's Clark.

370
00:46:08,216 --> 00:46:11,052
Well, it's great to finally meet you.
I've heard so much.

371
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,174
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah, Jimmy won't shut up about you.

372
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:16,683
- Gotta run.
- Where?

373
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:21,097
You heard Perry. Superman's back, and
he thinks I'm the only one equipped to...

374
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:22,849
To what?

375
00:46:23,024 --> 00:46:25,396
- I don't know, you know.
- So don't listen to him.

376
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:28,354
I'm not. Going to the power plant
to check out the blackout.

377
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:29,904
Okay.

378
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:32,359
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

379
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:36,739
- Bye, Lois.
- And she's gone.

380
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:39,866
No matter how close we are,
that woman will always be a mystery.

381
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:43,541
If you need anything,
I'm right over there.

382
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,288
Nice to finally meet you.

383
00:46:45,462 --> 00:46:48,666
Where do you wanna go?
Wanna go to the park?

384
00:46:53,887 --> 00:46:57,755
<i>And he's got the whole world
In his hands</i>

385
00:46:57,934 --> 00:47:00,092
<i>He's got the whole world</i>

386
00:47:00,269 --> 00:47:02,842
<i>And he's got the whole world in his...</i>

387
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:06,687
Oh, he's cute.

388
00:47:25,795 --> 00:47:27,123
Run into trouble?

389
00:47:27,296 --> 00:47:29,538
- Should see the other guy.
- What are we gonna do?

390
00:47:29,715 --> 00:47:31,375
Modify it, attach it to the stern.

391
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,424
I don't care if the instructions
are Russian.

392
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:03,534
- Lois?
- Hey, Clark.

393
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:05,452
How does it feel to be back at work?

394
00:48:05,627 --> 00:48:09,874
Pretty good. You know,
kind of like riding a bike, I guess.

395
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:15,635
- A bike?
- Yeah, you know...

396
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:17,257
Never mind.

397
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,676
But I was wondering...

398
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:22,051
...since I've gotten back, we haven't
really had a chance to catch up.

399
00:48:22,227 --> 00:48:25,145
I thought maybe, if you'd like,
we could go grab some food...

400
00:48:25,314 --> 00:48:27,437
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

401
00:48:27,608 --> 00:48:30,976
Have you ever met someone and it's like
you're from different worlds...

402
00:48:31,152 --> 00:48:34,853
...but you shared such a connection you
knew you were destined to be together?

403
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:37,523
Then he just takes off
without explaining why...

404
00:48:37,701 --> 00:48:39,444
...or without even saying goodbye?

405
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:40,818
Sounds cheesy, I know.

406
00:48:43,414 --> 00:48:44,660
- Well, maybe...
- Taxi!

407
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,668
...it was hard to say goodbye
because he had to go...

408
00:48:47,836 --> 00:48:51,205
...and he wanted to say goodbye,
but maybe it was too difficult for him.

409
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:54,750
Difficult? What's so difficult about it?
"Goodbye." It's easy.

410
00:48:54,926 --> 00:48:57,596
What's so hard about saying goodbye?

411
00:48:57,763 --> 00:48:59,340
Who are we talking about?

412
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:02,350
Nobody, just forget I said anything.

413
00:49:02,518 --> 00:49:04,510
Taxi! Hey!

414
00:49:05,353 --> 00:49:06,979
Taxi!

415
00:49:11,776 --> 00:49:13,521
Wow, thanks.

416
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,567
312 Riverside Drive, please.

417
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:21,243
Good night, Clark.

418
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:36,132
Superman!

419
00:50:51,044 --> 00:50:52,288
<i>I want egg rolls.</i>

420
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:56,625
<i>Nice try, kiddo. Only steamed chicken
and snow peas for you.</i>

421
00:50:57,968 --> 00:50:59,877
<i>Why do we order Chinese if he's allergic?</i>

422
00:51:00,053 --> 00:51:01,844
<i>Because he loves the peas...</i>

423
00:51:02,013 --> 00:51:05,382
...and I think we all prefer egg rolls
over macrobiotic shakes.

424
00:51:06,184 --> 00:51:08,093
It's a good point.

425
00:51:21,115 --> 00:51:24,152
So I noticed you've been acting
a little different lately.

426
00:51:24,328 --> 00:51:25,952
Have I?

427
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:32,459
You know, Lois,
that article that you wrote.

428
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:34,536
"Why the World
Doesn't Need Superman"?

429
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:38,580
No, no, no. No, the other one,
from years ago, before we met.

430
00:51:38,758 --> 00:51:42,293
Which article? I wrote dozens about him.
I was practically his press agent.

431
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,379
"I Spent the Night With Superman."

432
00:51:48,685 --> 00:51:50,477
Richard, come on.

433
00:51:50,646 --> 00:51:52,603
It was the title of an interview.

434
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,767
Plus, it was your Uncle Perry's idea.

435
00:51:54,942 --> 00:51:57,978
- No, I know, I know. It's okay, it's okay.
- Richard.

436
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:00,610
It was a long time ago.

437
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:04,193
Were you in love with him?

438
00:52:06,453 --> 00:52:10,202
He was Superman.
Everyone was in love with him.

439
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,697
But were you?

440
00:52:21,635 --> 00:52:23,046
<i>No.</i>

441
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,379
<i>Lois, I shouldn't have brought it up.</i>

442
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:48,567
<i>Even though you've been
raised as a human being...</i>

443
00:52:48,746 --> 00:52:50,822
<i>... you are not one of them.</i>

444
00:52:55,002 --> 00:52:58,253
<i>They can be a great people, Kal-El.
They wish to be.</i>

445
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:02,584
<i>They only lack the light
to show the way.</i>

446
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,759
<i>For this reason above all,
their capacity for good...</i>

447
00:53:06,931 --> 00:53:08,924
<i>... I have sent them you...</i>

448
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,057
<i>... my only son.</i>

449
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:26,672
Load them up.

450
00:54:54,372 --> 00:54:55,404
Holy sh...

451
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,777
<i>Attention, the Metropolis
Museum of Natural History...</i>

452
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,654
<i>... will be closing in 10 minutes.
We hope that you've...</i>

453
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:56,701
Sir, we're closing in 10 minutes.

454
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,579
We only need five.

455
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:48,755
You're done, the museum's closed.
Thank you.

456
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,125
Are you all right, miss?

457
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:13,968
- My heart. L... I...
- I'm sorry?

458
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:19,420
I have a palpitation,
a heart palpitation. And a murmur.

459
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:22,967
Please, take me to the hospital.

460
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,184
Take me to the hospital.

461
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,820
Just hold on tight.

462
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:17,566
Bingo.

463
01:00:45,185 --> 01:00:46,643
- There you are, ma'am.
- My heart.

464
01:00:47,521 --> 01:00:50,687
My palpitations, they're gone.
What did you do?

465
01:00:50,857 --> 01:00:52,434
I didn't do anything.

466
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:54,850
Call me Katherine.

467
01:00:55,028 --> 01:00:58,195
Katherine. I'm glad you're feeling better.

468
01:00:58,365 --> 01:01:02,315
- You have places to go, people to save?
- Yes.

469
01:01:05,997 --> 01:01:08,120
Would you like to get
a cup of coffee sometime?

470
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:10,829
- I know that's forward. Or a drink?
- Good night.

471
01:01:11,002 --> 01:01:12,662
Good night.

472
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:33,148
It's like this on every channel.

473
01:01:33,317 --> 01:01:36,187
<i>He was in Manila at 10:55 p.m.
And then spotted...</i>

474
01:01:36,361 --> 01:01:40,110
- Hey, Kent, chief wants to see you.
- Oh, thanks.

475
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:44,232
<i>But as this security footage
from a simple deli robbery proves...</i>

476
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:47,531
<i>... there's really no feat too big
or too small for the Man of Steel.</i>

477
01:01:47,706 --> 01:01:50,957
<i>Reports are flooding in from Metropolis,
Houston, Gotham and as far...</i>

478
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:53,878
<i>Satellites have proven
most ineffective at tracking him.</i>

479
01:01:54,046 --> 01:01:57,581
<i>He might literally be moving
near the speed of light.</i>

480
01:02:10,813 --> 01:02:13,683
<i>- Our map is illuminated with sightings...
- Kent!</i>

481
01:02:13,857 --> 01:02:16,894
<i>- The chief is waiting.
- ... on every continent, giving citizens...</i>

482
01:02:20,781 --> 01:02:24,481
These are iconic, and they were taken
by a 12-year-old with a camera phone.

483
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,827
- What do you got, Olsen?
- I got those.

484
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,826
- Look, in the sky, chief.
- It's a bird.

485
01:02:32,001 --> 01:02:33,578
- It's a plane.
- No, look, it's...

486
01:02:34,337 --> 01:02:35,534
You wanted to see me?

487
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:38,172
Yeah, Kent, come on in. Sit down.

488
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:41,342
I wanna talk a little strategy. Okay.

489
01:02:41,844 --> 01:02:44,513
First off, Lois, I don't understand
what you're doing...

490
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,966
...sneaking around covering the blackout.
- It wasn't just a blackout.

491
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:50,135
Cell phones, pagers,
automobiles, airplane...

492
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:52,766
Every other paper in town
has got a female reporter...

493
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:56,355
...a good-looking female reporter,
stashed on the roof covering Superman.

494
01:02:56,526 --> 01:03:00,191
- And you two are the ones with history.
- Chief, I've done Superman.

495
01:03:01,864 --> 01:03:03,904
Covered him. You know what I mean.

496
01:03:04,075 --> 01:03:06,233
Yeah, that makes you an expert.
Do him again.

497
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:09,198
- There are a dozen other stories out there.
- Yeah? Name one.

498
01:03:09,372 --> 01:03:11,946
Well, there was a museum robbery
last night.

499
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:15,910
Even Superman missed that one.
He was too busy saving this hooker.

500
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:18,756
Why don't you guys
track down Lex Luthor?

501
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:21,707
Well, no one's seen him
since his fifth appeal.

502
01:03:21,884 --> 01:03:24,043
He's got more history
with Superman than anyone.

503
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,714
Maybe he's got something to say.

504
01:03:25,888 --> 01:03:29,638
- Luthor's yesterday's news.
- No, I like that idea.

505
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:35,145
Perry, Lex Luthor is a career criminal
who nearly killed him, for God's sakes.

506
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:37,557
Jimmy, how did Lex Luthor
get out of prison?

507
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:41,732
Well, the appeals court called Superman
as a witness and he wasn't around.

508
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:44,570
How much do you think
that pisses off Superman?

509
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:46,366
- Give him to someone else.
- A lot.

510
01:03:46,535 --> 01:03:48,444
- A lot.
- Polly. Give him to Polly.

511
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:55,126
Lois, Superman.

512
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:57,500
- What about the blackout?
- Kent, blackout.

513
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,416
Great. Thanks, chief.

514
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:10,382
Lois, I'm sorry. I'd hate if this
damaged our relationship.

515
01:04:11,726 --> 01:04:12,841
Relationship?

516
01:04:13,603 --> 01:04:15,014
- Yeah.
- Hi, Mommy.

517
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:17,062
- Hi, you.
- Hey, guys.

518
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:21,016
He got an A in science, but a D in gym,
so we're doing something right.

519
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:23,187
- Yeah, at least one of us is.
- What?

520
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:26,199
It's Perry. He just shoved Superman
back into my life.

521
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,320
Well, honey, I'm sure you can
find a way to interview Superman...

522
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:31,487
...without bringing him
back into your life.

523
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:35,957
<i>There's really no way around it, folks.
Superman is back in all of our lives.</i>

524
01:04:37,419 --> 01:04:39,211
<i>We're coming to you from Sydney...</i>

525
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:43,164
<i>... where people have gathered
on these rooftops to scour the sky...</i>

526
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:46,545
Okay, how about this?
We'll stay late. We'll get dinner.

527
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,339
I'll help with Superman, and you and
Clark can work on the blackout together.

528
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:53,470
- Is that all right with you, Clark?
- Swell.

529
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:21,420
I was gonna pretend
the brakes were out.

530
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:24,709
Pretend. Like we talked about.

531
01:05:24,884 --> 01:05:27,670
You didn't actually have to cut them!

532
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:29,126
Of course I did.

533
01:05:29,305 --> 01:05:34,133
A man can always tell when a woman
is pretending, especially Superman.

534
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:41,395
So did you get your rock?

535
01:05:42,777 --> 01:05:44,686
I did.

536
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:50,116
<i>U.S. Coast Guard issuing a small-craft
advisory for the Metropolis ocean area.</i>

537
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:52,111
<i>High-wind advisory is in effect...</i>

538
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:55,157
<i>... ocean currents and tides
becoming increasingly dangerous.</i>

539
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:58,534
<i>All warnings lasting
until later this evening.</i>

540
01:05:58,709 --> 01:05:59,955
<i>Security, security.</i>

541
01:06:00,128 --> 01:06:05,584
<i>This is U.S. Coast Guard issuing
a small-craft advisory for northeast seas.</i>

542
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:10,219
<i>Winds reaching 50 miles per hour,
high tides in the morning.</i>

543
01:06:10,388 --> 01:06:12,215
<i>Waves reaching 20 to 30 feet.</i>

544
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:16,388
<i>This warning is in effect for
all small crafts for the next four hours.</i>

545
01:06:40,502 --> 01:06:42,126
Weird. If these times are right...

546
01:06:42,295 --> 01:06:45,380
...the blackout spread
from a specific origin point.

547
01:06:45,549 --> 01:06:46,924
Where?

548
01:06:47,092 --> 01:06:48,883
I'm not sure yet.

549
01:06:49,594 --> 01:06:53,259
With the super-hearing, does he hear each
sound by itself or everything at once?

550
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,885
<i>Both.</i>

551
01:06:55,058 --> 01:06:57,264
<i>- He's certainly taller than I thought.
- 6'4".</i>

552
01:06:57,435 --> 01:07:01,184
I love that he can see through anything.
I'd have fun with that.

553
01:07:01,564 --> 01:07:03,273
<i>Anything but lead.</i>

554
01:07:06,528 --> 01:07:07,773
- I bet he's...
- 225 pounds...

555
01:07:07,946 --> 01:07:09,606
...faster than a speeding bullet...

556
01:07:09,782 --> 01:07:13,232
...draws his power from the sun,
invulnerable to anything but kryptonite...

557
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:15,449
...and he never lies.
- Kryptonite?

558
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:17,946
Radioactive pieces of his home world.

559
01:07:18,123 --> 01:07:20,329
It's deadly. To him.

560
01:07:24,922 --> 01:07:28,290
Lois, how tall would you say Clark is?

561
01:07:29,844 --> 01:07:31,836
<i>About 6'3", 6'4".</i>

562
01:07:32,012 --> 01:07:34,799
<i>About 200, 215 pounds?</i>

563
01:07:44,775 --> 01:07:48,773
Jimmy, Jason, let's go get these intrepid
reporters something to keep them going.

564
01:07:48,946 --> 01:07:50,820
- Burritos!
- Come here, canhead.

565
01:07:52,324 --> 01:07:56,274
We're going this way. Do they have
anything other than burritos?

566
01:07:57,162 --> 01:07:59,488
I think they have fries and burgers.

567
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:02,156
So have you found a place to live yet?

568
01:08:02,335 --> 01:08:03,912
No. I'm still looking.

569
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:07,161
You know, Lois, I wanted to ask you
about that artic...

570
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:10,839
Hey, I'm gonna run downstairs
for some fresh air. Great!

571
01:08:24,606 --> 01:08:26,315
Thanks.

572
01:08:34,116 --> 01:08:36,868
- Let's talk when I get back.
- Sure.

573
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:33,133
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke, Miss Lane.

574
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:38,920
- Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.
- I'm fine. Really.

575
01:09:41,058 --> 01:09:44,179
I just wasn't expecting you.

576
01:09:44,855 --> 01:09:46,432
With all the press on the plane...

577
01:09:46,606 --> 01:09:49,014
...I wasn't sure it was
the best time for us to talk.

578
01:09:49,192 --> 01:09:52,359
Well, there's no press around now.
Except for me, of course.

579
01:09:54,572 --> 01:09:57,028
I know people are asking questions
now that I'm back.

580
01:09:57,409 --> 01:10:00,943
I think it's only fair
that I answer those people.

581
01:10:02,623 --> 01:10:05,956
So you're here for an interview?

582
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:08,242
Okay, then.

583
01:10:12,132 --> 01:10:14,124
- Where did I put that thing?
- Right pocket.

584
01:10:20,265 --> 01:10:22,970
Let's start with the big question.

585
01:10:23,143 --> 01:10:25,634
- Where'd you go?
- To Krypton.

586
01:10:25,812 --> 01:10:28,185
But you told me it was destroyed.
Ages ago.

587
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,815
It was.

588
01:10:29,983 --> 01:10:32,355
But when astronomers
thought they found it...

589
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:36,192
...I had to see for myself.

590
01:10:39,827 --> 01:10:43,659
Well, you're back, and everyone
seems to be pretty happy about it.

591
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,334
Not everyone.

592
01:10:49,503 --> 01:10:51,911
- I read the article, Lois.
- So did a lot of people.

593
01:10:52,089 --> 01:10:55,043
- Tomorrow they're giving me the Pulitzer...
- Why did you write it?

594
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,758
How could you leave us like that?

595
01:11:00,264 --> 01:11:02,671
I moved on. So did the rest of us.

596
01:11:03,184 --> 01:11:04,677
That's why I wrote it.

597
01:11:04,852 --> 01:11:07,639
The world doesn't need a savior.

598
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,973
And neither do I.

599
01:11:25,122 --> 01:11:26,201
Lois.

600
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:30,372
Will you come with me?

601
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,707
Why?

602
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,213
There's something I wanna show you.

603
01:11:42,473 --> 01:11:44,264
Please.

604
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:57,436
I can't be gone long.

605
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,522
You won't be.

606
01:12:11,919 --> 01:12:14,671
Clark said the reason you left
without saying goodbye...

607
01:12:14,839 --> 01:12:17,128
...is because it was
too unbearable for you.

608
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,922
Personally, I think that's a load of crap.

609
01:12:20,511 --> 01:12:23,678
- Clark?
- He's just a guy I work with.

610
01:12:24,765 --> 01:12:26,889
Maybe Clark's right.

611
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:32,394
You know, my...

612
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:37,607
Richard, he's a pilot.
He takes me up all the time.

613
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:40,772
Not like this.

614
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:58,038
I forgot how warm you were.

615
01:13:28,663 --> 01:13:30,158
Listen.

616
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:32,950
What do you hear?

617
01:13:33,669 --> 01:13:34,913
Nothing.

618
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:40,584
I hear everything.

619
01:13:44,054 --> 01:13:46,675
You wrote that the world
doesn't need a savior...

620
01:13:48,016 --> 01:13:51,350
...but every day
I hear people crying for one.

621
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:06,869
I'm sorry I left you, Lois.

622
01:14:10,748 --> 01:14:12,787
I'll take you back now.

623
01:16:25,926 --> 01:16:27,550
Richard's a good man.

624
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:33,179
And you've been gone a long time.

625
01:16:35,853 --> 01:16:37,430
I know.

626
01:16:42,193 --> 01:16:43,521
L...

627
01:16:48,741 --> 01:16:50,733
So will I see you around?

628
01:16:51,743 --> 01:16:53,736
I'm always around.

629
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:56,746
Good night, Lois.

630
01:17:15,726 --> 01:17:19,593
We're having beef, honey. Do you want
the tofu wrap or the veggie wrap?

631
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:24,978
You all right?

632
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:28,232
Where have you been?

633
01:17:32,577 --> 01:17:38,247
I was up on the roof, getting some air.

634
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,874
Tell the truth now.

635
01:17:47,425 --> 01:17:48,587
Were you smoking?

636
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:52,963
No.

637
01:18:01,772 --> 01:18:02,971
Is this real?

638
01:18:04,025 --> 01:18:05,898
- Where'd you find him?
- He found me.

639
01:18:06,068 --> 01:18:08,856
Oh, this is great. I can't wait to read it.

640
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:11,438
So, Mr. White, about the blackout...

641
01:18:11,616 --> 01:18:14,107
Lois, this is the biggest night
of your life.

642
01:18:14,285 --> 01:18:16,443
Have you picked out a dress?
Something snazzy?

643
01:18:17,455 --> 01:18:20,160
It just feels a little weird
winning for that article.

644
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:23,369
- It just doesn't seem right.
- What doesn't seem right?

645
01:18:23,544 --> 01:18:27,128
Winning an award for an article called
"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."

646
01:18:27,298 --> 01:18:29,753
When, according
to this newspaper, they do.

647
01:18:29,926 --> 01:18:32,843
Lois, Pulitzer Prizes
are like Academy Awards.

648
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:36,132
Nobody remembers what you got one for.
It's just that you got one.

649
01:18:36,307 --> 01:18:39,427
- But...
- This is your night. You enjoy it.

650
01:18:39,602 --> 01:18:42,141
I'm sure Kent's on the blackout.

651
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:44,914
Department of Water and Power, please.

652
01:19:45,628 --> 01:19:46,908
7782, great.

653
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:49,875
Metropolis Public Works.

654
01:19:50,049 --> 01:19:52,539
<i>Hi, Stephen, Lois Lane
from the Daily Planet. Blackout?</i>

655
01:19:52,717 --> 01:19:55,422
I just need a little info
on a few outstanding power grids.

656
01:19:55,596 --> 01:19:57,220
<i>Yeah, I do have it here, actually.</i>

657
01:19:57,389 --> 01:20:01,387
<i>So the uptown grid went dark at 12:36
and midtown 10 seconds before.</i>

658
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,055
Which grid was hit first?

659
01:20:03,229 --> 01:20:04,557
<i>It just reads Vanderworth.</i>

660
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:07,102
<i>- Across the river?
- 6 Springwood Drive.</i>

661
01:20:07,274 --> 01:20:09,516
6 Springwood Drive.
A residence or a business?

662
01:20:09,694 --> 01:20:11,437
<i>- Residence.
- Sure? Nothing before that?</i>

663
01:20:11,612 --> 01:20:13,937
<i>- That's all it shows.
- Thank you very much.</i>

664
01:20:15,783 --> 01:20:17,063
Oh, Jason.

665
01:20:23,874 --> 01:20:27,078
- There's your mom, Jason.
- You're late, Mommy.

666
01:20:35,303 --> 01:20:38,138
Where are we? Is this the Pulitzer?

667
01:20:38,305 --> 01:20:42,600
Nope. I've just gotta ask these people
a few questions and then we can go.

668
01:20:56,908 --> 01:20:59,280
Can I stay in the car?

669
01:20:59,828 --> 01:21:01,405
No, honey.

670
01:21:08,086 --> 01:21:12,463
- Are we trespassing?
- No. Yes.

671
01:21:27,188 --> 01:21:29,015
Hello?

672
01:22:00,514 --> 01:22:02,055
Hello?

673
01:22:13,151 --> 01:22:15,725
I like the curly one.

674
01:22:23,037 --> 01:22:25,871
Let's go. This was a bad idea.

675
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:43,388
Lex Luthor.

676
01:22:45,392 --> 01:22:47,515
Lois Lane?

677
01:22:53,317 --> 01:22:54,645
You're bald.

678
01:23:14,755 --> 01:23:16,130
And what is your name?

679
01:23:16,298 --> 01:23:18,754
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

680
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,217
- Cute kid, and smart.
- Thanks.

681
01:23:21,387 --> 01:23:24,590
We're not really strangers, are we?
This is kind of a little reunion.

682
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:26,804
Heck, I'm a fan.

683
01:23:26,975 --> 01:23:28,470
I love your writing...

684
01:23:29,311 --> 01:23:31,138
...and your dress.
- I love your boat.

685
01:23:31,313 --> 01:23:33,935
How'd you get it?
Swindle some widow out of her money?

686
01:23:35,275 --> 01:23:37,517
That's funny. Didn't you win
the Pulitzer Prize...

687
01:23:37,694 --> 01:23:41,278
...for my favorite article of all time, " Why
the World Doesn't Need Superman"?

688
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:45,363
Didn't you have a few more years to go
on that double life sentence?

689
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:47,778
Yes, well, we can thank
the Man of Steel for that.

690
01:23:47,955 --> 01:23:51,241
I mean, he's really good at swooping in
and catching the bad guys...

691
01:23:51,417 --> 01:23:54,951
...but he's not so hot at the little things,
like Miranda rights...

692
01:23:55,129 --> 01:23:59,838
...due process, making your court date.

693
01:24:00,009 --> 01:24:02,465
Did you have anything to do
with the blackout?

694
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:07,680
Are you fishing for an interview,
Miss Lane?

695
01:24:07,851 --> 01:24:10,009
It's been a while
since you've been a headline.

696
01:24:10,185 --> 01:24:12,344
Maybe it's time
people knew your name again.

697
01:24:13,022 --> 01:24:16,972
How about we turn this boat around,
call a cab for my son...

698
01:24:17,527 --> 01:24:20,148
...and then you can do
whatever you want with me.

699
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:23,401
No, I don't think we'll be
turning around, Miss Lane...

700
01:24:23,574 --> 01:24:26,196
...which means that
we do have some time to kill.

701
01:24:28,371 --> 01:24:30,244
How about that interview?

702
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:34,499
Yeah, just call me if you hear anything.
Okay. Thank you.

703
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:36,376
So, what did the school say?

704
01:24:36,545 --> 01:24:38,040
She picked him up at 3: 15.

705
01:24:42,302 --> 01:24:45,587
- Hi, I heard about Lois.
- Yes, come in, Clark, come in.

706
01:24:45,763 --> 01:24:48,254
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah, you're a reporter.

707
01:24:48,433 --> 01:24:51,185
- Help Richard track her down.
- I'll check her computer.

708
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:52,597
Excuse me, Clark.

709
01:25:06,326 --> 01:25:09,410
What do you know about crystals?

710
01:25:09,579 --> 01:25:11,287
They make great chandeliers.

711
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:16,868
This crystal may seem unremarkable,
but so is the seed of a redwood tree.

712
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:20,461
It's how our mutual friend in tights
made his Arctic getaway spot.

713
01:25:20,632 --> 01:25:22,505
Cute. It's a little small for my taste.

714
01:25:22,675 --> 01:25:24,218
You're building an island?

715
01:25:25,428 --> 01:25:28,762
You're not seeing
the big picture here, Miss Lane.

716
01:25:28,932 --> 01:25:31,220
Let me enlarge it for you.

717
01:25:33,812 --> 01:25:37,228
Not just an island,
an entirely new continent.

718
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:40,649
An extinct world, reborn on our own.

719
01:25:40,819 --> 01:25:42,229
Why?

720
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,149
Land, Miss Lane.

721
01:25:47,326 --> 01:25:50,078
I mean... Kitty, what did my father
used to say to me?

722
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:51,656
"You're losing your hair"?

723
01:25:52,665 --> 01:25:54,574
- Before that.
- "Get out"?

724
01:25:56,126 --> 01:25:58,415
He said, " You can print money...

725
01:25:58,587 --> 01:26:01,209
...manufacture diamonds,
and people are a dime a dozen...

726
01:26:01,382 --> 01:26:04,466
...but they'll always need land."

727
01:26:04,635 --> 01:26:07,470
It's the one thing
they're not making any more of.

728
01:26:08,014 --> 01:26:10,385
But the United States...

729
01:26:12,101 --> 01:26:15,600
Will be underwater.

730
01:26:16,021 --> 01:26:17,599
It's simple physics, Miss Lane.

731
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:20,560
Two objects cannot occupy
the same space at the same time.

732
01:26:20,735 --> 01:26:23,273
And the rest of the world
will just let you keep it?

733
01:26:23,445 --> 01:26:25,651
- They'll...
- Theyll...

734
01:26:26,156 --> 01:26:27,616
...what?

735
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:30,654
I'll have advanced alien technology...

736
01:26:30,828 --> 01:26:33,865
...thousands of years beyond
what anyone could throw at me.

737
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,079
Bring it on!

738
01:26:37,084 --> 01:26:38,993
And eventually...

739
01:26:39,169 --> 01:26:41,495
...the rest of the world
will be begging me...

740
01:26:41,672 --> 01:26:44,294
...for a piece of high-tech
beachfront property.

741
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:46,792
In fact, they'll pay
through the nose for it.

742
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:48,963
But millions of people will die.

743
01:26:49,138 --> 01:26:51,759
Billions! Once again,
the press underestimates me.

744
01:26:51,932 --> 01:26:54,304
This is front-page news.

745
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:56,970
Come on, let me hear you say it
just once.

746
01:26:57,146 --> 01:27:01,642
- You're insane.
- No! Not that. No, the other thing.

747
01:27:01,818 --> 01:27:05,482
It's dangling off the tip of your tongue.
Let me hear it just once, please?

748
01:27:05,655 --> 01:27:08,656
- Superman will never...
- Wrong!

749
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,504
What is that?

750
01:27:24,715 --> 01:27:27,503
I think you know exactly what this is.

751
01:27:33,516 --> 01:27:36,387
Mind over muscle, Miss Lane.

752
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:39,312
Mind...

753
01:27:46,863 --> 01:27:48,855
Who is that boy's father?

754
01:27:50,367 --> 01:27:52,240
Richard.

755
01:27:52,703 --> 01:27:56,201
<i>Mr. Luthor, we're approaching
the coordinates.</i>

756
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:58,367
Are you sure?

757
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:03,880
<i>Yes, sir. Latitude 40 degrees north,
longitude 73 degrees west.</i>

758
01:28:25,402 --> 01:28:27,561
Don't let them leave this room.

759
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:30,477
Kitty, come with me.
You're not gonna want to miss this.

760
01:29:43,564 --> 01:29:44,939
- Damn it.
- What?

761
01:29:45,107 --> 01:29:46,306
She has a password.

762
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:49,896
"Jason."

763
01:29:51,989 --> 01:29:53,697
"Richard."

764
01:29:55,618 --> 01:29:57,196
Try "Superman."

765
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:04,740
"Superman." Great.

766
01:30:13,093 --> 01:30:15,169
Don't touch that, honey.

767
01:30:19,433 --> 01:30:21,889
Why don't you go play the piano.

768
01:32:19,138 --> 01:32:21,628
Come on, come on, come on.

769
01:34:08,706 --> 01:34:11,743
Lex, this isn't like the train set.

770
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:15,413
I know.

771
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:23,261
Come on, come on.

772
01:34:23,888 --> 01:34:25,087
Come on.

773
01:35:53,021 --> 01:35:54,894
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

774
01:35:55,064 --> 01:35:57,057
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

775
01:35:58,275 --> 01:36:01,027
Open this door! Open it!

776
01:36:16,377 --> 01:36:18,749
Could you help Mommy open the door?

777
01:36:21,633 --> 01:36:23,376
I'm sorry.

778
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:28,546
It's gonna be okay.

779
01:36:28,723 --> 01:36:31,048
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

780
01:36:50,745 --> 01:36:54,197
We had a little problem downstairs.

781
01:36:54,749 --> 01:36:56,907
Brutus is dead.

782
01:36:57,585 --> 01:37:00,836
He got hit with the piano.

783
01:37:05,426 --> 01:37:07,301
Where's the boy?

784
01:37:07,471 --> 01:37:11,599
With the mother,
locked up in the pantry.

785
01:37:13,769 --> 01:37:15,927
Oh, it's time for us to go.

786
01:37:21,943 --> 01:37:24,434
My camera's not working.

787
01:37:25,238 --> 01:37:27,361
And my phone's not working.

788
01:37:32,412 --> 01:37:35,164
- Okay, I'm good.
- That was weird.

789
01:37:50,138 --> 01:37:52,464
Hey, guys.
This just came through the fax.

790
01:37:52,641 --> 01:37:54,930
It's Lois' handwriting,
I'd recognize it anywhere.

791
01:37:55,102 --> 01:37:56,929
I just... No idea
what the numbers mean.

792
01:37:57,104 --> 01:37:58,847
- They're coordinates.
- Coordinates.

793
01:38:00,983 --> 01:38:02,180
That's just off the coast.

794
01:38:02,359 --> 01:38:05,479
Jimmy, tell Perry I'm taking the seaplane.
Keep trying her cell.

795
01:40:09,654 --> 01:40:11,112
What are these, lottery numbers?

796
01:40:11,656 --> 01:40:13,648
I think they're coordinates, chief.

797
01:40:52,364 --> 01:40:53,526
Chief...

798
01:41:20,434 --> 01:41:22,723
Come on! Move it!

799
01:43:46,415 --> 01:43:48,158
Chief!

800
01:43:59,303 --> 01:44:01,710
Great Caesar's ghost.

801
01:46:08,683 --> 01:46:10,806
- Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

802
01:46:24,408 --> 01:46:25,818
How did you get here?

803
01:46:25,992 --> 01:46:27,652
I flew.

804
01:46:31,331 --> 01:46:33,158
Look out!

805
01:46:46,013 --> 01:46:47,721
Mom!

806
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:50,012
Mom! Mom!

807
01:46:50,184 --> 01:46:51,559
Jason, come here! Jason!

808
01:46:54,438 --> 01:46:56,347
Come here! Watch your head!
Come here!

809
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:58,667
Mommy! Mom!

810
01:48:00,587 --> 01:48:01,833
Jason!

811
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:06,795
Jason, hold on!

812
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:12,600
- Have you got him?
- I got him! Go!

813
01:48:15,019 --> 01:48:16,596
Hold on! Hold on!

814
01:48:31,327 --> 01:48:32,656
- Mommy!
- Give him to me!

815
01:48:32,829 --> 01:48:34,406
Mommy!

816
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:36,948
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Come on, Jason! Come on!

817
01:48:40,795 --> 01:48:43,630
- Lois! Lois!
- Mommy!

818
01:49:48,113 --> 01:49:50,189
Jason, get on my back.

819
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:21,889
Give me your hand.

820
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:31,609
- Have you got them?
- Yeah.

821
01:50:50,718 --> 01:50:52,627
Get buckled in!

822
01:51:11,655 --> 01:51:13,529
She'll be fine.

823
01:51:16,285 --> 01:51:17,660
I can't take off in this.

824
01:51:17,828 --> 01:51:21,778
- I'll point you in the right direction.
- Thank you.

825
01:52:21,059 --> 01:52:22,850
See anything familiar?

826
01:52:28,859 --> 01:52:31,266
I see an old man's sick joke.

827
01:52:31,778 --> 01:52:35,194
Really? Because I see
my new apartment...

828
01:52:35,365 --> 01:52:38,401
...and a place for Kitty,
one for my friends...

829
01:52:38,576 --> 01:52:41,531
...and that place over there, I'll rent out.

830
01:52:46,043 --> 01:52:50,254
But, you know, maybe you're right.
You know, maybe it is a little cold.

831
01:52:50,422 --> 01:52:54,372
It's... What's the word I'm searching for?
It's a little...

832
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:56,718
...alien.

833
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:01,553
It lacks that human touch.

834
01:53:04,519 --> 01:53:07,224
You have something that belongs to me.

835
01:53:24,748 --> 01:53:28,034
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

836
01:53:28,209 --> 01:53:29,788
Do you copy?

837
01:53:30,629 --> 01:53:34,129
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

838
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:36,625
Do you copy? Damn it!

839
01:53:36,802 --> 01:53:40,420
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

840
01:53:40,598 --> 01:53:42,424
Do you copy?

841
01:53:44,309 --> 01:53:46,979
Lois! Are you all right?

842
01:53:47,396 --> 01:53:50,765
Yeah. What happened?

843
01:53:51,901 --> 01:53:54,521
- Superman.
- Where is he?

844
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:57,275
He went back.

845
01:53:59,909 --> 01:54:02,115
- Richard, we have to turn around.
- What? No.

846
01:54:02,286 --> 01:54:04,908
- We have to turn around!
- We barely made it out of there.

847
01:54:05,081 --> 01:54:07,653
- Now you want me to go back?
- Yes, please!

848
01:54:08,417 --> 01:54:10,244
He'll die.

849
01:54:13,256 --> 01:54:15,129
All right, hold on.

850
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:34,477
Kryptonite.

851
01:54:39,616 --> 01:54:41,573
You're asking yourself, "How?"

852
01:54:43,369 --> 01:54:48,327
Didn't your dad ever teach you
to look before you leap?

853
01:54:52,378 --> 01:54:55,333
Crystals. They're amazing, aren't they?

854
01:54:55,506 --> 01:54:58,757
They inherit the traits
of the minerals around them...

855
01:54:58,927 --> 01:55:03,719
...kind of like a son
inheriting the traits of his father!

856
01:55:06,517 --> 01:55:11,512
You took away five years of my life,
I'm just returning the favor!

857
01:55:15,027 --> 01:55:18,062
I'm still Superman!

858
01:55:26,704 --> 01:55:30,121
Get up! Come on!

859
01:57:02,175 --> 01:57:04,169
Now, fly.

860
01:58:05,282 --> 01:58:08,235
So long, Superman.

861
01:58:10,703 --> 01:58:13,788
<i>Your leadership can stir others...</i>

862
01:58:13,957 --> 01:58:16,115
<i>... to their own capacities
for moral betterment.</i>

863
01:58:16,293 --> 01:58:19,246
<i>The human heart is still subject
to monstrous deceits.</i>

864
01:58:22,883 --> 01:58:25,753
<i>Our destruction could have been avoided.
At this very moment...</i>

865
01:58:25,927 --> 01:58:27,551
<i>... I could embrace you in my arms.</i>

866
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:30,128
<i>Your help would be called for endlessly.
Remember me.</i>

867
01:58:30,306 --> 01:58:33,640
<i>Even for those tasks which human beings
could solve themselves.</i>

868
01:58:44,071 --> 01:58:46,906
<i>Remember me, Kal-El.</i>

869
01:58:47,073 --> 01:58:48,983
<i>Remember me.</i>

870
01:58:57,876 --> 01:58:59,620
Superman's down there.

871
01:59:00,628 --> 01:59:03,001
- You sure?
- Yeah.

872
01:59:13,475 --> 01:59:16,096
- Richard!
- Yeah, I saw him. Strap in.

873
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:46,631
Lois!

874
01:59:47,969 --> 01:59:49,760
Don't move.

875
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:37,890
Come on, come on, come on.

876
02:00:41,647 --> 02:00:43,355
Richard!

877
02:00:43,524 --> 02:00:44,899
I'm trying! It's too choppy!

878
02:00:54,034 --> 02:00:55,613
Oh, my God.

879
02:02:43,311 --> 02:02:45,304
How did you find me?

880
02:02:50,819 --> 02:02:52,444
Thank you.

881
02:03:07,419 --> 02:03:09,328
What are you doing?

882
02:03:12,508 --> 02:03:13,753
I have to go back.

883
02:03:16,470 --> 02:03:18,213
You're hurt!

884
02:03:28,690 --> 02:03:30,351
Goodbye, Lois.

885
02:04:40,763 --> 02:04:43,088
<i>The technology on Krypton,
Superman 's home world...</i>

886
02:04:43,266 --> 02:04:45,591
<i>... was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.</i>

887
02:04:45,768 --> 02:04:47,144
<i>Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.</i>

888
02:04:47,311 --> 02:04:51,144
<i>Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...</i>

889
02:04:51,316 --> 02:04:53,273
<i>... would be indistinguishable from magic.</i>

890
02:04:53,443 --> 02:04:56,859
<i>But imagine: Cities, vehicles, weapons...</i>

891
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:59,521
<i>... entire continents, all grown.</i>

892
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:01,443
Lex?

893
02:05:03,286 --> 02:05:06,406
Are billions of people really going to die?

894
02:05:12,921 --> 02:05:14,629
Yes.

895
02:05:41,992 --> 02:05:43,321
Lex, what's happening?

896
02:05:49,291 --> 02:05:50,915
Go, go, go. Get to the helicopter.

897
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:56,168
Go! Out, out! Now!

898
02:05:59,343 --> 02:06:02,510
No, no, no, take nothing!
Take nothing! Go, go!

899
02:06:04,431 --> 02:06:06,009
Got it.

900
02:06:50,144 --> 02:06:51,722
Here.

901
02:07:15,629 --> 02:07:17,586
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

902
02:07:17,756 --> 02:07:19,333
No!

903
02:07:38,902 --> 02:07:42,484
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

904
02:11:42,064 --> 02:11:43,558
Watch it.

905
02:11:44,941 --> 02:11:47,148
- Clear a path.
- Clear the way.

906
02:11:47,694 --> 02:11:49,319
- Move!
- Trauma One.

907
02:11:50,698 --> 02:11:53,023
- Where we going?
- Trauma One. Here it is.

908
02:11:58,872 --> 02:12:00,580
Watch it!

909
02:12:08,424 --> 02:12:09,799
Got him!

910
02:12:13,470 --> 02:12:14,846
Okay, I think I got it.

911
02:12:19,434 --> 02:12:22,270
Penetrating side wound
to right part of lower back.

912
02:12:23,606 --> 02:12:24,768
No hemorrhage.

913
02:12:29,445 --> 02:12:30,773
Shock at 200.

914
02:12:30,946 --> 02:12:32,773
Is that enough? He's not human.

915
02:12:32,948 --> 02:12:34,609
All right, charge to three, 360.

916
02:12:34,783 --> 02:12:36,362
Clear!

917
02:13:07,025 --> 02:13:08,305
It's kind of morbid, Perry.

918
02:13:09,152 --> 02:13:11,608
Always be prepared.

919
02:13:13,989 --> 02:13:15,698
How is she?

920
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:38,220
Thank you. Thanks, baby.

921
02:13:41,017 --> 02:13:42,263
- Lois?
- Yeah.

922
02:13:44,438 --> 02:13:46,347
We can leave whenever you're ready.

923
02:13:46,523 --> 02:13:48,100
I mean...

924
02:13:49,692 --> 02:13:51,685
...you don't have to be here.

925
02:13:52,904 --> 02:13:54,731
Where else would I be?

926
02:13:54,906 --> 02:13:58,441
<i>Police have surrounded the area in order
to control thousands of visitors...</i>

927

to show their support.</i>

928
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:02,495
<i>Many are carrying signs and banners...</i>

929
02:14:02,664 --> 02:14:04,075
I could drive.

930
02:14:04,248 --> 02:14:06,704
<i>- No official announcements
over the past few hours...</i>

931

<i>... but unconfirmed reports
from inside tell us...</i>

932
02:14:09,629 --> 02:14:11,421
<i>... the Man of Steel lies in a coma...</i>

933
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:16,133
<i>... his condition unchanged
since he was admitted late yesterday.</i>

934

<i>- Doctors have been vigilant in their...
- Foreign exchange markets...</i>

935
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:28,057
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

936
02:14:28,231 --> 02:14:31,102
I'd be careful down there, guys.
It's a madhouse.

937
02:14:40,828 --> 02:14:43,947
- So much for parking.
- Do you think I can get in?

938
02:14:44,706 --> 02:14:47,577
You're Lois Lane. They'll let you in.

939
02:14:48,543 --> 02:14:51,379
I wanna go with Mommy.

940
02:15:12,568 --> 02:15:14,227
Taxi.

941
02:15:14,403 --> 02:15:15,862
I'll be right here.

942
02:15:23,161 --> 02:15:25,284
Watch your head, okay? Here we go.

943
02:15:57,363 --> 02:15:59,320
This way, Miss Lane.

944
02:16:21,513 --> 02:16:24,513
Mommy? Is he gonna get better?

945
02:16:26,559 --> 02:16:29,180
- I don't know.
- I want him to.

946
02:16:30,646 --> 02:16:32,853
I like him.

947
02:16:35,568 --> 02:16:37,228
Me too.

948
02:17:08,393 --> 02:17:11,180
I don't know if you can hear me.

949
02:17:13,816 --> 02:17:17,314
They say sometimes
that when people are...

950
02:17:20,322 --> 02:17:23,073
That sometimes they can hear you.

951
02:17:29,373 --> 02:17:31,615
I don't know if you can hear me.

952
02:17:40,592 --> 02:17:43,165
I wanted to tell you...

953
02:18:38,484 --> 02:18:40,393
Come on, honey.

954
02:19:24,113 --> 02:19:26,189
Step back, please!

955
02:19:43,383 --> 02:19:47,131
Lex, we only have six of those!

956
02:19:49,014 --> 02:19:50,294
Six?

957
02:19:54,102 --> 02:19:58,431
I would trade 300,000 coconuts...

958
02:19:58,606 --> 02:20:00,932
...and every ounce of your blood...

959
02:20:01,109 --> 02:20:05,736
...for a quart of gasoline!

960
02:20:06,490 --> 02:20:09,158
But what will we have to eat?

961
02:22:45,316 --> 02:22:47,356
You will be different.

962
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:53,985
Sometimes, you will feel like an outcast.

963
02:22:55,159 --> 02:22:57,864
But you'll never be alone.

964
02:23:00,248 --> 02:23:02,918
You will make my strength your own.

965
02:23:05,878 --> 02:23:09,580
You will see my life through your eyes...

966
02:23:10,466 --> 02:23:15,841
...as your life will be seen through mine.

967
02:23:27,443 --> 02:23:31,487
The son becomes the father...

968
02:23:33,198 --> 02:23:37,944
...and the father becomes the son.

969
02:24:29,672 --> 02:24:31,498
Good night!

970
02:24:41,350 --> 02:24:42,761
L...

971
02:24:51,610 --> 02:24:53,567
Will we see you?

972
02:24:55,614 --> 02:24:57,274
Around?

973
02:24:59,785 --> 02:25:01,943
I'm always around.

974
02:25:07,001 --> 02:25:08,709
Good night, Lois.
