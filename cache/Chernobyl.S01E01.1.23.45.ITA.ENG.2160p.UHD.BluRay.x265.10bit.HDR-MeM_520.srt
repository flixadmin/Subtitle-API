1
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,719
<i>What</i> is the <i>cost</i> of <i>lies?</i>

2
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,639
<i>It's not that we'll mistake them
for the truth.</i>

3
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,199
<i>The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies,</i>

4
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>then we no longer recognize
the truth at all.</i>

5
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,639
<i>What can we do then?</i>

6
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:57,079
<i>What else is left but to abandon
even the hope of truth</i>

7
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:00,719
<i>and content ourselves instead
with stories?</i>

8
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:04,559
<i>In these stories,
it doesn't matter who the heroes are.</i>

9
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:07,479
<i>All we want to know is,
who is to blame?</i>

10
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:12,599
<i>In this story, it was Anatoly Dyatlov.
He was the best choice.</i>

11
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,239
<i>An arrogant, unpleasant man,
he ran the room that night.</i>

12
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,558
<i>He gave the orders.</i>

13
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:19,239
<i>And no friends.</i>

14
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,879
<i>Or, at least, not important ones.</i>

15
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:29,679
<i>And now, Dyatlov will spend the next
10 years in a prison labor camp.</i>

16
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,399
<i>Of course, that sentence
is doubly unfair.</i>

17
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,159
<i>There were far greater criminals
than him at work.</i>

18
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,839
<i>And as for what Dyatlov did do...</i>

19
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,319
<i>The man doesn't deserve prison.</i>

20
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,319
<i>He deserves death.</i>

21
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,399
But instead, ten years
for "criminal mismanagement."

22
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:07,799
What does that mean?

23
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,879
No one knows.

24
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:11,879
It doesn't matter.

25
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:16,118
What does matter is that, to them,

26
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,278
justice was done.

27
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,759
Because, you see, to them,

28
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,519
a just world is a sane world.

29
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,839
There was nothing sane
about Chernobyl.

30
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,878
What happened there,
what happened after,

31
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,239
even the good we did, all of it...

32
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,879
All of it...

33
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,599
Madness.

34
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,719
Well, I've given you
everything I know.

35
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,879
They'll deny it, of course.

36
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,719
They always do.

37
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,839
I know you'll try your best.

38
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,359
Lyudmilla?

39
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:45,998
Comrade Dyatlov!

40
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,759
Comrade Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

41
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,198
Comrade Dyatlov! Comrade Dyatlov!

42
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:03,199
What just happened?

43
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:04,959
I don't know.

44
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:07,999
There's a fire in the turbine hall.

45
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,758
The turbine hall?

46
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:15,038
The control system tank. Hydrogen.

47
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:17,798
You and Toptunov,
you morons blew the tank.

48
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,958
-No, that's not...
-This is an emergency.

49
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,999
Everyone stay calm.
Our first priority is...

50
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:23,079
- It's exploded!
- We know.

51
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:24,839
Akimov, are we cooling
the reactor core?

52
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,598
We shut it down,
but the control rods are still active.

53
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:28,518
They're not all the way in.
I disengaged...

54
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:31,078
All right. Try and disconnect
the servos from the standby console.

55
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,478
You two, get the backup pumps running.

56
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,278
We need water moving through the core.

57
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,278
-That is all that matters.
-There is no core.

58
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,198
It exploded! The core exploded.

59
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,599
He's in shock. Get him out of here.

60
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,038
The lid is off.

61
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,039
The stack is burning. I saw it.

62
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:50,799
You're confused.
RBMK reactor cores don't explode.

63
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,198
-Akimov...
-Sasha.

64
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,358
Don't worry, we did everything right.
Something strange has happened.

65
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:56,679
-Do you taste metal?
-Akimov!

66
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:00,359
Comrade Perevozchenko, what you're
saying is physically impossible.

67
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:03,038
The core can't explode.
It has to be the tank.

68
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,999
We're wasting time. Let's go.

69
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:08,639
Get the hydrogen out of the generators
and pump water into the core.

70
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,279
What about the fire?

71
00:09:11,158 --> 00:09:12,319
Call the fire brigade.

72
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,838
You're not on call tonight.

73
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:48,838
They're bringing everybody in,
military and civil.

74
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:52,279
Pripyat, Polesskoe, Kiev.

75
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,079
This is a big one.

76
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:58,319
But it doesn't look right, the color.

77
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,598
Pravik says he thinks they're shining
floodlights or something.

78
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:02,999
And what if there are chemicals?

79
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:05,118
"Chemicals"?

80
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:07,399
The problem's the roof.

81
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:08,879
It's covered in tar,

82
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,678
so it's gonna burn all night,
and it'll stink like hell.

83
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:14,438
That's it. That's the worst of it.

84
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:17,918
Go back to bed.

85
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,598
- Is it war?
- Where's the dosimeter?

86
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:57,599
Here. Here.

87
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,399
Are they bombing?

88
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,958
What the fuck is this?
It's 3.6 roentgen.

89
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,398
That's as high as it goes.
The good one's locked in a safe.

90
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,758
I don't have a key.

91
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,559
Valera... Your face.

92
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:21,638
Come on.

93
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,479
I'm going to find Khodemchuk
in the pump room.

94
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:25,998
You, here.

95
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:29,838
Get Shashenok. He's in 604. Go.

96
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,599
We need to get everyone out!

97
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:45,878
Shit.

98
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,158
Hey! We need to get
to the reactor hall.

99
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:51,038
-The lift's destroyed.
-Up two flights and across.

100
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,838
-Right.
-Why are you going there?

101
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,318
Have you seen Khodemchuk?

102
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:17,119
-No. Where's Viktor?
-Still in the pump room.

103
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,278
Stay here. I'll come back.

104
00:13:24,158 --> 00:13:25,478
Viktor!

105
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:44,238
Viktor.

106
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,718
Viktor.

107
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:48,438
Oh!

108
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,918
Viktor, I'm gonna get you out of here.

109
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,238
Can you stand?

110
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,278
Khodemchuk...

111
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:56,398
Where?

112
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,638
Get Khodemchuk.

113
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:44,718
I dropped the control rods
from the other panel.

114
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,518
- They're still up.
- What?

115
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:48,638
They're still only a third
of the way in. I don't know why.

116
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:50,078
I already sent the trainees down

117
00:14:50,158 --> 00:14:51,438
to the reactor hall
to lower them by hand.

118
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,358
-What about the pumps?
-I can't get through to Khodemchuk.

119
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,879
-The lines are down.
-Fuck the phones and fuck Khodemchuk.

120
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,478
-Are the pumps on or not?
-Stolyarchuk?

121
00:14:57,558 --> 00:15:00,238
My control panel's not working.
I tried calling for the electricians.

122
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:03,878
I don't give a shit about the panel!
I need water in my reactor core!

123
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:06,678
Get down there
and make sure those pumps are on.

124
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:08,918
Now!

125
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:17,798
What does the dosimeter say?

126
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:20,159
Uh, 3.6 roentgen, but that's as high
as the meter...

127
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:22,398
Three point six.
Not great, not terrible.

128
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,798
We did everything right.

129
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:16,638
You, connect those hooks!

130
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:23,478
Get the pumps going!

131
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:25,598
Yeah, over here!
I'm right with you!

132
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:32,078
We're working
bottom to top. Go in fast.

133
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:53,158
Vasily...

134
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:57,758
-Hey, Vasily, what's this?
-I don't know, Misha.

135
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:59,878
Don't fuck around with it.
Hook these up. Come on.

136
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:06,798
Do you taste metal?

137
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:09,878
-Yeah, what is that?
-I don't know.

138
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:13,198
The valves, Misha.
The valves! Let's go.

139
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:14,678
The valves! Come on!

140
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:46,798
What do you need?

141
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:49,398
We need to get into the reactor hall

142
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:51,318
to lower the control rods,
but the door's jammed.

143
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:54,798
I don't think there are control rods.

144
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:56,198
I don't think there's a core.

145
00:17:58,398 --> 00:17:59,958
No, you're... You're mistaken.

146
00:18:01,118 --> 00:18:02,078
Akimov said.

147
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:19,878
Let's go.

148
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:34,518
No!

149
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,078
Ignatenko, get on his hose!

150
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:39,958
It's all right. Breathe.

151
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:41,238
Misha.

152
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:43,398
All right, all right.
Easy, Misha.

153
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:20,078
Are you sure?

154
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:23,118
Akimov...

155
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:37,478
Move.

156
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:48,878
Come on! Go! Go!

157
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,798
Go! Go fast, go!

158
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:27,158
Let's go!

159
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:29,278
Let's go!

160
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,597
Hey!

161
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,918
Hey!

162
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,638
Lyudmilla! Do you want
to come with us?

163
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:03,118
Come where?

164
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:04,957
We're going to the railroad bridge
to get a better look.

165
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,638
It's not like anyone
can sleep with all the sirens.

166
00:21:07,878 --> 00:21:09,838
I don't think you should go.
It could be dangerous.

167
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:10,878
What do you mean,
"dangerous"?

168
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:12,757
It's a fire.
It's over there, we're over here.

169
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,358
-Mikhail.
-What?

170
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,798
Oh. Sorry.

171
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:23,998
-Is Vasily...
-Yeah.

172
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:26,118
Did he say it was bad?

173
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:27,997
No. No, he said it was just the roof.

174
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,358
Well, he's never gotten hurt before.
None of the boys have.

175
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,917
He'll be fine.

176
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:35,558
Get some rest.

177
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:49,237
The tank, it's big enough.

178
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:51,997
This kind of explosion,
the control tank on 71,

179
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,278
it's 100 cubic meters.

180
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:54,718
One hundred and ten.

181
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:58,157
Hundred and ten.
It could do this, definitely.

182
00:21:58,678 --> 00:21:59,677
It's gone.

183
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:01,958
I looked right into it.

184
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:04,278
I looked into the core.

185
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:07,278
Did you lower the control rods or not?

186
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:11,877
Take him to the infirmary.

187
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:15,877
Toptunov, take him!

188
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:20,638
Where's Kudryavstev?

189
00:22:21,518 --> 00:22:22,597
He fell.

190
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,438
- I need a medic! Anyone!
- He's delusional.

191
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:28,238
-His face...
-Ruptured condenser lines.

192
00:22:28,318 --> 00:22:31,318
The feedwater is mildly contaminated.
He'll be fine. I've seen worse.

193
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,078
Do we still have
a phone line to the outside?

194
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:37,517
Akimov?

195
00:22:38,878 --> 00:22:40,157
Call in the day shift.

196
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:42,518
But if the...

197
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:44,278
We have to keep water flowing
into the core.

198
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:47,078
We need electricians,
mechanics, we need bodies.

199
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:49,798
How many times do I have to say it?

200
00:22:58,198 --> 00:23:00,238
I'm going to
the Administration Building now

201
00:23:00,317 --> 00:23:02,118
to call Bryukhanov and Fomin.

202
00:23:02,838 --> 00:23:03,997
They're gonna want a full report.

203
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:08,598
Now, I don't know if I can
make things better for you...

204
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:11,397
But I can certainly make them worse.

205
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,637
Call in the day shift, Comrade Akimov.

206
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:21,557
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

207
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:54,798
You're doing fine.

208
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:57,118
Raise her up.

209
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:04,038
That one, maybe an hour.
This one, not until morning.

210
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,358
How's it downstairs, Doctor?

211
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:09,957
Quiet.

212
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:11,798
Always is.

213
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:14,398
Nothing at this hour but babies.

214
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,238
Do you know I once went
two days without sleep?

215
00:24:18,838 --> 00:24:21,077
Ten women went into labor
at the same time.

216
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:23,478
-Did I ever tell you that story?
-Yes.

217
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:27,517
Well, I won't need you
in here for a while.

218
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:29,918
If you want,
get some rest in the break room.

219
00:24:30,957 --> 00:24:32,717
They haven't brought
anyone in from the fire.

220
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:34,198
What fire?

221
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:35,718
The power plant.

222
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:39,477
Oh.
Well, then it mustn't be too bad.

223
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:41,917
Do we stock iodine?

224
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:44,277
-Hmm?
-Iodine.

225
00:24:45,678 --> 00:24:47,038
You mean disinfectant?

226
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:49,597
No, pills. Does the hospital
stock iodine pills?

227
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:52,237
Iodine pills?
Why would we have iodine pills?

228
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:05,758
Hello?

229
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:08,198
Hello?

230
00:25:15,438 --> 00:25:16,797
Who else knows this?

231
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:20,158
Have you called Fomin?

232
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:25,878
Of course, I want you to call him.
If I'm up, he's up.

233
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:05,958
Whatever the cause, the important
thing is that neither you nor I...

234
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:47,797
I take it the safety test
was a failure.

235
00:26:48,198 --> 00:26:50,717
- We have the situation under control.
- "Under control"?

236
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:52,477
It doesn't look
like it's under control.

237
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:53,518
Shut up, Fomin.

238
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:57,597
I have to tell the Central Committee
about this. Do you realize that?

239
00:26:58,038 --> 00:26:59,637
I have to get on the phone
and tell Mary in,

240
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,037
or, God forbid, Frolyshev,
that my power plant is on fire.

241
00:27:03,118 --> 00:27:05,438
No one can blame you for this,
Director Bryukhanov.

242
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:06,877
Of course no one can
blame me for this.

243
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,957
How can I be responsible?
I was sleeping.

244
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:12,797
Tell me what happened, quickly.

245
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:17,717
We ran the test exactly as
Chief Engineer Fomin approved.

246
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:20,838
Unit Shift Chief Akimov
and Engineer Toptunov

247
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:22,677
encountered technical difficulties,

248
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:25,878
leading to an accumulation of hydrogen
in the control system tank.

249
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:28,157
It regrettably ignited,

250
00:27:28,238 --> 00:27:30,278
damaging the plant,
setting the roof on fire.

251
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,037
The tank is quite large.

252
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:36,318
It's the only logical explanation.

253
00:27:36,878 --> 00:27:40,038
Of course,
Deputy Chief Engineer Dyatlov

254
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,878
was directly supervising the test,
so he would know best.

255
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:45,757
A hydrogen tank, fire...

256
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:50,237
-Reactor?
-We're taking measures to ensure

257
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:52,197
a steady flow of water
through the core.

258
00:27:53,077 --> 00:27:55,757
-What about radiation?
-Obviously, down here it's nothing,

259
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:59,758
but in the reactor building,
I'm being told, 3.6 roentgen per hour.

260
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,277
Well, that's not great,
but it's not horrifying.

261
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:03,318
Not at all.

262
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:05,678
From the feedwater, I assume.

263
00:28:05,757 --> 00:28:06,717
Mmm-hmm.

264
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,278
We'll have to limit shifts to
six hours at a time, but otherwise...

265
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:13,837
The dosimetrists
should be checking regularly.

266
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:17,837
Have them use
the good meter from the safe.

267
00:28:19,118 --> 00:28:20,078
Right.

268
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:22,437
I'll call Mary in.

269
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:25,917
Have them wake up the local
Executive Committee.

270
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,317
There'll be orders coming down.

271
00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:34,237
Here.

272
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:37,198
Sure? Okay.

273
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:41,797
What do you think makes the colors?

274
00:28:41,878 --> 00:28:42,838
Oh.

275
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:46,517
-It's the fuel, for sure.
-"It's the fuel, for sure."

276
00:28:46,877 --> 00:28:49,797
What do you know about it?
You clean floors at a train station.

277
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:51,797
My friend, Yuri,
works at the power plant.

278
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:52,957
He says it runs cold.

279
00:28:53,477 --> 00:28:55,117
No gas, no fire. Just atoms.

280
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:58,237
Yuri says the only thing is,
you can't walk right up to the fuel.

281
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:01,237
If you do, a glass of vodka
an hour for four hours.

282
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:03,558
Isn't Yuri a plumber?

283
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:06,237
At the nuclear power plant, yeah.

284
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,877
Well, it is beautiful.

285
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:16,158
Yeah.

286
00:31:03,517 --> 00:31:04,877
Do you have a cigarette?

287
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:30,957
Do you need help?

288
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:38,597
It's over.

289
00:32:41,277 --> 00:32:42,877
We've done all we can
from the perimeter.

290
00:32:42,957 --> 00:32:44,557
We need to start making
our way to the roof.

291
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:52,397
Vasily!

292
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,037
You've gotta put it out.

293
00:32:57,917 --> 00:33:00,597
That's enough, comrades.
We're pushing ahead.

294
00:33:06,237 --> 00:33:07,197
Come on, boys.

295
00:33:13,517 --> 00:33:15,037
Vasily,
it's just past, straight up.

296
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:16,997
All the way up, all the way in.

297
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,957
Come on!

298
00:33:32,197 --> 00:33:33,797
Yeah. Going in now.

299
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:20,957
What about the auxiliary?

300
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:24,597
The pumps are gone, electrical's gone.

301
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:26,557
The core?

302
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:28,877
I didn't go in there, and I won't.

303
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:31,957
I think it's time we faced...

304
00:34:32,077 --> 00:34:33,277
No, we have to get water into
the core.

305
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:34,397
Otherwise, there'll be a meltdown.

306
00:34:35,437 --> 00:34:36,797
We have to open the valves.

307
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:38,797
—Sasha...
—What do you want, Boris?

308
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,797
If it's true, then we're dead.
A million people are dead.

309
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,117
Is that what you need to hear?

310
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:45,997
We have to open the valves.

311
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:47,517
- By hand.
- By hand?

312
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:50,877
The number of valves,
the amount of time to turn them,

313
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:52,517
you're talking about hours in there!

314
00:34:52,596 --> 00:34:54,117
-Then help us.
-Help you do what?

315
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:56,837
Pump water into a ditch?
There's nothing there!

316
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:07,477
Leonid, I'm begging you.

317
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:21,957
Watch the panel while we're gone.

318
00:35:22,477 --> 00:35:23,557
It's not working.

319
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:25,757
Just watch it.

320
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:49,236
I guess we know why
they called us in early.

321
00:35:49,677 --> 00:35:51,156
Is anyone
saying what happened?

322
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:53,797
They were running
the safety test on the turbines,

323
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:55,837
blew the control system tank.

324
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,237
It doesn't make sense to me either.

325
00:36:00,197 --> 00:36:01,237
What about sabotage?

326
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:03,277
A bomb?

327
00:36:04,477 --> 00:36:05,477
Sitnikov!

328
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,157
Bryukhanov wants us to use
the good dosimeter,

329
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:10,837
but it's in the safe,
and we can't find the key.

330
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:12,797
It's in Building Two. Hasn't...

331
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:15,117
Follow me.

332
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,757
Gentlemen, welcome.

333
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:31,237
Please, uh, find a seat.
Plenty of room.

334
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:33,956
I apologize for the lateness
of the hour.

335
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:38,237
Rest assured,
we are all very safe down here.

336
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:41,397
We built this shelter
to withstand a nuclear attack

337
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:44,236
by the Americans,
so, I think we'll be fine.

338
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:48,477
Um, as you can see,
we have experienced an accident.

339
00:36:48,557 --> 00:36:51,077
A large control tank malfunctioned,

340
00:36:51,157 --> 00:36:54,917
damaging reactor Building Four
and starting a fire.

341
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:58,397
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Mary in.

342
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:00,517
Mary in spoke
to Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

343
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:03,517
Frolyshev to Central Committee
member Dolgikh,

344
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:06,957
and Dolgikh to
General Secretary Gorbachev.

345
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,477
Now...

346
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:14,157
Because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

347
00:37:14,237 --> 00:37:17,637
for the work of the Pripyat
Executive Committee,

348
00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:21,357
they have asked me to brief you
on matters as they stand, so...

349
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:24,757
First, the accident...

350
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:26,717
It's well under control.

351
00:37:27,397 --> 00:37:32,077
And second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

352
00:37:32,157 --> 00:37:35,396
are considered key State secrets,
it is important

353
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:40,797
that we ensure that this incident
has no adverse consequences.

354
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:42,717
Now, to prevent a panic,

355
00:37:43,437 --> 00:37:45,037
the Central Committee have ordered

356
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:47,596
a detachment of military police
to Pripyat.

357
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:49,197
How large of a detachment?

358
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:52,637
Between 2,000 and 4,000 men.

359
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:56,477
What's really going on here?

360
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,677
How dangerous is this?

361
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:02,556
There's mild radiation,
but it's limited to the plant itself.

362
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:04,637
- No, it isn't.
- Excuse me?

363
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:08,277
You saw men outside vomiting.

364
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:10,837
You saw men with burns.

365
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:13,957
There's more radiation
than they're saying.

366
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:16,676
We have wives here, we have children.

367
00:38:16,997 --> 00:38:19,276
I say we evacuate the town.

368
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,157
Gentlemen...

369
00:38:21,476 --> 00:38:24,717
Please... Please! My wife is here.

370
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:28,596
Do you think I would keep her
in Pripyat if it wasn't safe?

371
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:32,277
Bryukhanov, the air is glowing.

372
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:33,396
The Cherenkov effect.

373
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:37,236
Completely normal phenomenon.
It can happen with minimal radiation.

374
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:50,517
I wonder how many of you
know the name of this place.

375
00:38:53,357 --> 00:38:55,597
We all call it "Chernobyl," of course.

376
00:38:57,317 --> 00:38:58,877
What is its real name?

377
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:03,517
The Vladimir I. Lenin
Nuclear Power Station.

378
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:05,677
Exactly.

379
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:10,797
Vladimir I. Lenin.

380
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:21,197
And how proud he would be
of you all tonight.

381
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:24,677
Especially you, young man,

382
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:28,197
and the passion you have
for the people.

383
00:39:29,597 --> 00:39:32,997
For is that not the sole purpose
of the apparatus of the State?

384
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:36,636
Sometimes, we forget.

385
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,157
Sometimes, we fall prey to fear.

386
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:45,637
But our faith in Soviet socialism

387
00:39:46,597 --> 00:39:48,677
will always be rewarded.

388
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:55,197
Now, the State tells us
the situation here is not dangerous.

389
00:39:56,037 --> 00:39:57,797
Have faith, comrades.

390
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:02,757
The State tells us
it wants to prevent a panic.

391
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:04,157
Listen well.

392
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:11,076
It's true, when the people see
the police, they will be afraid.

393
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:14,437
But it is my experience

394
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:17,796
that when the people ask questions

395
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:19,956
that are not
in their own best interest...

396
00:40:21,037 --> 00:40:24,997
They should simply be told
to keep their minds on their labor,

397
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:28,117
and leave matters of the State

398
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:30,317
to the State.

399
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:33,917
We seal off the city.

400
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:36,556
No one leaves.

401
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:39,196
And cut the phone lines.

402
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:42,117
Contain the spread of misinformation.

403
00:40:45,196 --> 00:40:47,956
That is how we keep the people

404
00:40:48,037 --> 00:40:50,556
from undermining the fruits
of their own labor.

405
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:55,037
Yes, comrades.

406
00:40:56,637 --> 00:41:00,036
We will all be rewarded
for what we do here tonight.

407
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:06,036
This is our moment to shine.

408
00:41:18,597 --> 00:41:19,557
Thank you.

409
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,316
Comrade Sitnikov to see
the Chief Engineer.

410
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:47,997
Well?

411
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,516
I sent my dosimetrists
into the reactor building.

412
00:41:59,357 --> 00:42:00,557
The large dosimeter from the safe,

413
00:42:00,636 --> 00:42:02,316
the one with
the 1,000-roentgen capacity...

414
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:03,357
What was the number?

415
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:07,957
There was none.

416
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:10,356
The meter burned out
the second it was turned on.

417
00:42:11,516 --> 00:42:12,476
It's typical.

418
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:13,597
See, this is what Moscow does.

419
00:42:13,676 --> 00:42:16,477
Sends us shit equipment,
then wonders why things go wrong.

420
00:42:16,556 --> 00:42:19,956
We found another dosimeter,
from the military fire department.

421
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:23,237
It only goes to 200 roentgen,
but it's better than the small ones.

422
00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:24,276
And?

423
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:26,836
It maxed out.

424
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:28,837
Two-hundred roentgen.

425
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:33,036
What game are you playing?

426
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,636
No, I...

427
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:37,236
I asked him.
He took multiple measurements.

428
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:38,557
He's my best man.

429
00:42:38,877 --> 00:42:41,157
It's another faulty meter.
You're wasting our time.

430
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:43,196
I checked the meter
against the control.

431
00:42:43,276 --> 00:42:45,396
What's wrong with you?
How'd you get that number

432
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:47,316
from feedwater leaking
from a blown tank?

433
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:51,437
You don't.

434
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:53,756
Then what the fuck
are you talking about?

435
00:42:58,077 --> 00:42:59,037
I...

436
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:04,436
I walked around the exterior
of Building Four.

437
00:43:06,196 --> 00:43:08,836
I think there's graphite
on the ground in the rubble.

438
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:11,517
You didn't see graphite.

439
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:13,957
-I did.
-You didn't.

440
00:43:15,597 --> 00:43:18,716
You didn't! Because it's not there!

441
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:21,237
What?

442
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:23,876
Are you suggesting the core...

443
00:43:24,117 --> 00:43:26,236
What, exploded?

444
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:29,877
Yes.

445
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:39,477
Sitnikov.

446
00:43:40,596 --> 00:43:42,357
You're a nuclear engineer. So am I.

447
00:43:43,236 --> 00:43:48,237
So please tell me how
an RBMK reactor core explodes.

448
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:52,316
Not a meltdown, an explosion.

449
00:43:53,276 --> 00:43:54,437
I'd love to know.

450
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:56,396
I can't.

451
00:43:57,597 --> 00:43:58,557
Are you stupid?

452
00:44:00,236 --> 00:44:01,196
No.

453
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:02,596
Then why can't you?

454
00:44:04,356 --> 00:44:05,316
I...

455
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:09,836
I don't see how it could explode...

456
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:12,957
But it did.

457
00:44:13,036 --> 00:44:13,996
Enough!

458
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:16,156
I'll go up to the vent block roof.

459
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,796
From there, you can look right
down into reactor Building Four.

460
00:44:18,996 --> 00:44:20,077
I'll see it with my own...

461
00:44:21,997 --> 00:44:23,077
My own eyes.

462
00:44:28,596 --> 00:44:29,756
I apologize.

463
00:44:31,676 --> 00:44:32,996
Guards! Guards!

464
00:44:34,356 --> 00:44:37,197
Get him to a medic, or the hospital!
Whatever he needs!

465
00:44:53,156 --> 00:44:55,796
The feedwater.
Been around it all night.

466
00:44:58,396 --> 00:44:59,356
You go, then.

467
00:45:02,956 --> 00:45:03,916
What?

468
00:45:04,196 --> 00:45:06,796
Go to the vent block roof
and report back what you see.

469
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:07,836
No.

470
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:13,036
No, I won't do that.

471
00:45:13,996 --> 00:45:15,197
Of course you will.

472
00:45:20,157 --> 00:45:21,156
You'll be fine.

473
00:45:22,036 --> 00:45:22,996
You'll see.

474
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:25,116
Come on.

475
00:46:05,756 --> 00:46:06,716
Okay.

476
00:46:08,596 --> 00:46:09,596
Let's begin.

477
00:46:17,757 --> 00:46:18,717
Leonid.

478
00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:23,836
Leonid.

479
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:33,237
It's all the way, okay?

480
00:46:34,236 --> 00:46:35,596
All the way open.

481
00:46:44,796 --> 00:46:45,756
I'm sorry.

482
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:51,156
There's nothing to be sorry for.

483
00:46:51,836 --> 00:46:54,476
I told you. We did nothing wrong.

484
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:58,356
But we did.

485
00:49:53,036 --> 00:49:54,796
Get everyone
in the infirmary up there.

486
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:38,516
Hello?

487
00:50:38,596 --> 00:50:40,636
- <i>Valery Legasov?</i>
- Yes.

488
00:50:40,716 --> 00:50:43,116
<i>You are the Legasov who is
the First Deputy Director</i>

489
00:50:43,196 --> 00:50:45,596
<i>of the Kurchatov institute
of Atomic Energy?</i>

490
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,756
<i>-I am. Who am</i> I speaking...
<i>-This is Boris Shcherbina,</i>

491
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:50,076
<i>Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers</i>

492
00:50:50,156 --> 00:50:52,156
<i>and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.</i>

493
00:50:53,036 --> 00:50:56,196
<i>There's been an accident
at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</i>

494
00:50:57,156 --> 00:50:58,116
How bad is it?

495
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,716
<i>No, no need to panic.
There was a fire.</i>

496
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:03,476
<i>It's mostly put out.
The system control tank exploded.</i>

497
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:05,356
"Control system tank."

498
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:06,716
And the core?

499
00:51:07,116 --> 00:51:09,356
<i>We've ordered them
to continuously pump water.</i>

500
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:12,316
Yes, I see. Any contamination?

501
00:51:12,796 --> 00:51:15,356
<i>It's mild. The plant manager,
Bryukhanov, is reporting</i>

502
00:51:15,436 --> 00:51:17,036
<i>3.6 roentgen per hour.</i>

503
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,116
That's actually significant.
You should evacuate the...

504
00:51:19,196 --> 00:51:22,476
<i>You're an expert on
RBMK reactors, correct?</i>

505
00:51:23,796 --> 00:51:26,316
-Yes. I've studied...
<i>-General Secretary Gorbachev</i>

506
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:28,956
<i>has appointed a committee
to manage the accident.</i>

507
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:30,396
<i>You're on it.</i>

508
00:51:31,316 --> 00:51:32,996
<i>We'll convene at 2:00 this afternoon.</i>

509
00:51:33,476 --> 00:51:36,476
That late? Forgive me,
but don't you think,

510
00:51:36,556 --> 00:51:38,276
given the amount of radiation,
that it would be...

511
00:51:38,356 --> 00:51:41,356
<i>Legasov, you're on this committee
to answer direct questions</i>

512
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:43,556
<i>about the function of an RBMK reactor,</i>

513
00:51:43,716 --> 00:51:46,676
<i>if they should happen to arise.
Nothing else,</i>

514
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:48,876
<i>certainly not policy.
Do you understand?</i>

515
00:51:49,436 --> 00:51:51,435
Yes, of course. I didn't mean to...
