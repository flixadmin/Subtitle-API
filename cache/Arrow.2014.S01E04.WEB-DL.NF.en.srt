00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,115
I can't,
I have to go over transcripts

for the Fernands case.

You know, if you go somewhere
that's not work or your home

170
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,039
your odds of meeting someone
increase by

171
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,082
like a gazillion percent.

172
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,333
Oh, that's not true.

173
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,918
I could still get mugged
on the way home.

Don't move!

I'm not gonna hurt you.

Stay back. My father's a cop.

181
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,839
You are making a huge mistake.

Peter Declan is gonna
be executed in 48 hours.

I think he's innocent.

the whistle on Jason Brodeur.'

'Brodeur had her murdered.'

We're both trying to help.

What makes you so sure
I'm gonna help you?

'A jury has found you guilty,
Mr. Declan.'

197

The evidence
was stacked against me

198
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,683
but I didn't kill my wife.

I didn't take my daughter's
mother from her.

Your neighbors said they heard
an argument that night.

205
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,997
We had a knockdown fight
over Jason Brodeur.

206
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,500
Camille worked for him,
and his company had been

207
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,628
dumping toxic waste
into the Glades.

208
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,506
Camille told me that she'd gone
and told a supervisor about it.

209
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,008
I was afraid
for my family's safety.

210
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,678
And we argued.

211

Very loudly. Yes.

00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,307
Izzy started crying

213
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,685
so Camille went
and stayed in her room.

214
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,945
In the morning,
I went to apologize and uh..

215
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,698
And that's when I found her.

216
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,201
So I just grabbed Izzy

217
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,204
and I ran outside,
and I called 911.

else I'd be doing right now

what really happened?

went to her supervisor

with allegations that Brodeur
was dumping toxic waste.

...have you considered
my offer?

283
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,004
Offer? That's one hell
of a way to put it.

284
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,215
It is an offer.

285
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,593
It's a chance to do
the kind of good

286
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,095
that compelled you
to join the military.

287

Please.

288
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,182
You were born with a platinum
spoon in your mouth, Queen.

289
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,643
What, you spent five years on
an island with no room service

290
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,395
and suddenly you found religion?

291
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,442
This was my father's.

292
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,407
I found it when I buried him.

293
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,620
I thought you said your father
died when the boat went down.

294
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,037
We both made it to a life raft

295
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,623
but there wasn't enough
food and water

296
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,167
for both of us,
so he shot himself in the head.

297
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,461
And as much as he was doing it

298
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,129
to give me a chance to survive

299
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,925
I believe that he was also
atoning for his sins.

300
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,552
I need to right
the wrongs done by my family.

301
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,431
And I'm offering you the chance

302
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,558
to right the wrongs
done to yours.

303
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,310
Oliver, what are
you talkin' about?

304
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,853
The police never caught
your brother's shooter.

305
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,855
Hey, you leave Andy
out of this.

306
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,356
The bullets were laced
with curare.

307
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,817
That's Floyd Lawton's MO.

308
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,568
He is the sniper..

309
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,405
...that I stopped.

310
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,116
Are you trying to tell me that
you took down Andy's killer?

311
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,618
I'm..

312
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,369
I'm giving you the chance.

313
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:37,997
A chance

314
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,541
to help
other people's families.

315
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,293
Do you remember when the people

316
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,171
in this city helped each other?

317
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:49,592
They can't do that anymore
because a group of people..

318
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,512
...people like my father

319
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,473
they see nothing wrong
with raising themselves up

320
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:59,018
by stepping on
other people's throats.

321
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,854
It does need to stop

322
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,522
and if it's not
gonna be the courts

323
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,607
and it's not gonna
be the cops..

324
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,569

that makes you an accessory.

485
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,394
I am trying to save
an innocent man's life.

486
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,313
No.

487
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,065
You're breaking the law.

488
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,733
Well, I wouldn't have to,
if the police would have done

489
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,651
their job right in
the first place.

490
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,780
I asked you
how you got this case.

491
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,491
You lied to me,
straight to my face.

492
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,783
Eh?

493
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,871
I thought you and I
didn't do that.

494
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,333
Guess I was wrong.

495
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,173
Your Honor, the mere existence
of the file proves that

496
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,592
Mr. Istook perjured himself
for Jason Brodeur's benefit.

497
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,637
That's slander.
Jared Swanstrom, Your Honor.

498

I represent Jason Brodeur
and Brodeur Chemical.

499
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,227
The interest of justice
requires you to stay

pending exploration

501

'of the newly discovered
evidence.'

502
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,858
Ours isn't a court of justice,
Ms. Lance.

503
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,527
'It's a court of law.'

504
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,571
And under the law,
I don't think your evidence

505
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,865
is sufficient to warrant
a stay of execution.

506

'Your motion for
habeas corpus is denied.'

507
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,497
This isn't over.

508
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,165
I've got the loose end now

509
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,293
and no matter what happens,
I am going to pull on it

if not for murder, then
this-this this dumping thing.

514
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,597
That won't happen.
There are steps we can take.

515

You saw her.
She's going after me.

516
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,976
She's gonna want to meet
with her client

517

in court today.

What do you need
to free Peter Declan?

At this point

525
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,002
nothing short of a signed
confession from Brodeur.

526
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,131

- To get a confession.

Mrs. Queen-Steele.

She seems like a woman
who would hyphenate.

[clears throat]

Right, the company she invested
in doesn't exist.

532
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,607
- I don't understand.
- There was no investment.

533
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:14,901
The money was used to set up
an offshore LLC called Tempest.

534
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,278
I don't recall
that name being under

535
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,737
the Queen Consolidated banner.

You know,
when I was in Afghanistan

554
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,201
I had a job, and I did it.

555
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,787
And when I could, I would help
out the people there

556
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,998
so that, in some small way,
when I left

557
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,167
I could believe
I left it a better place.

558
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,004
But ever since I've been home

559
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,964
all I do is protect punks

560

Yeah.

I miss feeling like I'm making
a difference in the world.

563
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,138
Then get out
of personal security

564
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,599
and go do something
you believe in.

What, so I can take his place
