1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,054
This season, on The Flash...

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,757
- Who are you?
- My name is Jay Garrick.

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,052
Where I came from,
I was a speedster like you.

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,392
Before I arrived on your Earth,
I was in a fight with a man named Zoom.

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,524
He will do whatever it takes
to ensure he's the only speedster.

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,683
In any world.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,571
Never forget. I am the fastest man alive.

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,278
I get these feelings sometimes.
These vibes.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,441
Cisco? What did you see?

10
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,326
I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

11
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,737
Who's the man in the iron mask?

12
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,496
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

13
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,283
What do you say you and I
give this a shot?

14
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,621
Yeah, I would like that.

15
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,958
I've always measured my success by
counting the number of victims I've had.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,545
But now I think I'm gonna start counting
the number of Earths I conquer instead.

17
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,300
Earth-2 splitting in half.

18
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,712
Tell me I did notjust see
the end of the world.

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,221
Dad? No! No!

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,350
And this is what's gonna make you
just like me.

21
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,763
Jay! No!

22
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,350
No!

23
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,854
Dad.

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,647
Dad. Hey, hey, hey, look at me.

25
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,818
Look at me. Dad, don't leave.
Not again, not again.

26
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,533
Dad! Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, it's all right.

27
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,493
No. Dad...

28
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,139
No. Dad.

29
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,270
I told you family was a weakness.

30
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,485
You feel the anger, don't you, Flash?

31
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,990
But now, the two of us are the same.

32
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,201
No!

33
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,741
There you go, Flash!

34
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,367
Use your anger!

35
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,538
Just like I did.

36
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,917
I got you, Zolomon.

37
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,955
- I got...
- Barry, embrace your anger!

38
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,668
End me!

39
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,346
Let me do it for you.

40
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,263
So close, Barry.

41
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,109
Another Time Remnant.

42
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,021
See, Barry, there could be two of you.

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,610
You just have to be willing
to kill yourself.

44
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,824
Yeah. You're almost ready.

45
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,967
"And comfort us today
with the word of your promise"

46
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,427
"as we return our brother to the earth,"

47
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,346
"and leave us with the hope that one day,
we'll meet again."

48
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,402
Uh...

49
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,289
My father's...

50
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,714
I can't do this right now.

51
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,921
It's okay, Barry.

52
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,675
Henry Allen.

53
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,721
Henry suffered
two great losses in his life.

54
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,726
He lost his wife, Nora, and he lost Barry.

55
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:28,736
He suffered guilt,
embarrassment, ridicule, shame,

56
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,649
and everything that comes with
being blamed for a crime he didn't commit.

57
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,452
Henry Allen was proof

58
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,205
that love can get you through
the darkest of days.

59
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,867
And that love will keep him alive
in all of our hearts.

60
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,639
I'm gonna find him, Dad.

61
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,146
I promise you, I'm gonna take from him
what he took from you.

62
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,624
Hey.

63
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,344
- Hey.
- I thought maybe you should eat something.

64
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,590
- I'm not hungry, thank you, though.
- Here.

65
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,477
Barry, um...

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,973
I had no idea that you were The Flash.

67
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,234
What you did for me,

68
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,395
all the things that you've done
for everyone,

69
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,734
this whole city...

70
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,363
And now this with your dad and Zoom.

71
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,825
I'm so sorry.

72
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,573
Thanks, Wally.

73
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,955
If there's anything you need,
you just say the word.

74
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,707
All right.

75
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,376
Guys, Zo0m's still out there.

76
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,760
We need to come up with a plan.

77
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,172
The man can crack open
breaches to Earth-2.

78
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,510
Imean, if he can do that,

79
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,471
what else can he do
that we don't know about?

80
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,969
Right after he killed his Time Remnant,

81
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,396
he told me I was "almost ready."

82
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,149
- "Almost ready" for what?
- I don't know.

83
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,776
Yep, classic psychopath.

84
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,153
Why can't they ever just say
what they want to do?

85
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,479
We also have to figure out

86
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,149
why I keep vibing
Earth-2 being ripped to shreds.

87
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,317
Seriously.

88
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,077
It's like I'm watching Transformers,
in 4D,

89
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,035
but, like, 10 times more realistic.

90
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,870
And with much better acting.

91
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,581
Look, if you can vibe the future,

92
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,997
we need to stop Zoom before that happens.

93
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,957
I'm gonna get some air, all right?

94
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,507
I got it.

95
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:01,531
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

96
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,191
When I was in the Speed Force,

97
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,871
I felt like I'd finally come to grips
with her death.

98
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,122
With not saving her when lwent back.

99
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,751
And then, the moment

100
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,964
where I'm finally at the place
I could move on,

101
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,217
my father's taken from me.

102
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,306
How am I ever supposed to
find peace with that?

103
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,595
I don't know, Barry.

104
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,393
But you're gonna have to
find a way to do that

105
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,523
or it's gonna tear you apart.

106
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,611
I just miss him so much already.

107
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,408
Zoom.

108
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,575
Barry, no!

109
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,414
Bad time, Flash?

110
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,922
Thought I'd give you some time to mourn.

111
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,759
- This ends now.
- Not yet.

112
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,886
There's always more to take, Barry.

113
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,301
You're gonna stay away from them.

114
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,804
- That's completely up to you.
- What?

115
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,062
When we first met,

116
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,724
I told you that
Zoom needed to be the best.

117
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,736
You just didn't realize
I was talking about myself.

118
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,772
Is that what this is about?

119
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,533
A race, Barry, between you and me,

120
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,032
to see who's the fastest.

121
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,663
You win, this is over,
and you get to be the hero.

122
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,244
I'm not racing you.

123
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,830
Then your father
won't be the only person you love

124
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,461
that I'll take from you.

125
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,709
Think about it, Flash,

126
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,876
all lwant to know is
who's the fastest man alive,

127
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,960
on either world.

128
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,970
I'll be waiting.

129
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,556
So, Zoom wants to race you?

130
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,649
He's obsessed with being the best.

131
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,899
Why would we trust him?

132
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,811
He just wants to race.

133
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,604
You know, it actually makes sense

134
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,149
in a completely off-your-rocker
sort of way.

135
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,658
That can't be everything he wants.

136
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,151
It isn't.

137
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,743
This Magnetar that's being developed
by Mercury Labs,

138
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,157
turns out it can act as a pulsar.

139
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,325
Whoa.

140
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,369
What is a pulsar?

141
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,287
It's a power amplifier

142
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,003
with a highly magnetized,
dense rotating core

143
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,380
that could be easily weaponized.

144
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,799
Nah, that's not dangerous at all.

145
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,968
That's what happens to Earth-2.

146
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,429
What happens in my vibes
is because of this machine.

147
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,720
That thing is powerful enough
to destroy a planet?

148
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,639
Well, more than just a planet
if it has the right power source.

149
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,525
- Like what?
- Like me.

150
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,193
That's why he wants to race.

151
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,526
He wants to siphon the energy
I create when I run.

152
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,531
He wants to siphon the energy
off both of you.

153
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,067
When Jay captured me,

154
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,952
he said that
he used to measure his success

155
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,113
by counting the number of victims he had.

156
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,747
But now, he was gonna measure it

157
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,625
by counting the number of Earths
he conquered instead.

158
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,874
He doesn't want to just destroy Earth-2,

159
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,790
he wants to take out
every other planet in the multi-verse.

160
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,300
- How many are there?
- Lnfinite.

161
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,169
Well, can he do that?

162
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,838
If he can create a breach to Earth-2
all on his own...

163
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,263
He can get to all of 'em.

164
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,595
One pulse to destroy them all.

165
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,802
I guess I don't have a choice.

166
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,389
I have to race him.

167
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,396
I have to win.

168
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,991
Barr.

169
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,494
Don't race him.

170
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,914
- It's not that easy.
- Yes, it is, you just say "no."

171
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,916
We find another way to stop him, together,
like we always do.

172
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,793
And do what, Joe?

173
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,747
Just sit around,
and wait for him to kill somebody else?

174
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,338
Wally? Iris? You?

175
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,419
- No. No way.
- He needs you, Barr.

176
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,588
He needs your speed again,
to get what he wants.

177
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,427
We have the advantage here.

178
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,102
All I have to do is beat him, Joe.

179
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,058
That saves the multi-verse.

180
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,268
This whole city, all of you.

181
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,690
I won't let another person I love die
when I can prevent it.

182
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,149
This isn'tjust about racing Zoom, is it?

183
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,865
You want to kill this guy.

184
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,781
Of course, lwanna kill him, Joe!

185
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,620
I wanna do a hell of a lot more
than just kill him,

186
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,535
lwant him to suffer
for everything that he's done.

187
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,625
- And he's going to.
- Come on, Barr.

188
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,089
Think about what you're saying.

189
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,255
I have to be willing
to do whatever it takes.

190
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,380
I'm sorry, but I'm racing him,
whether you want me to or not.

191
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,298
And I can't talk you out of it?

192
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:57,967
Not this time.

193
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,803
Then I'm sorry, too.

194
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,581
What?

195
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,329
What are you doing?

196
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,422
Why did you put me in here?

197
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,511
Because you're too angry right now.

198
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,392
You can't race him like that.

199
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,973
Without a plan you... You'll lose.

200
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,227
Keeping me in here
is gonna get everyone killed.

201
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,318
I'm the only one that can stop him,
you know that.

202
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,774
You race Zoom on his terms,

203
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,152
you'll lose.

204
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,282
This is not your decision to make!

205
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,742
It is, this time.

206
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,029
We all made it together.

207
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,206
What?

208
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,200
All of you?

209
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,338
Bro, I went back and forth.
I was, like, a good 60-40 at first...

210
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,580
Ramon...

211
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,296
Yeah, yeah, we all made the decision.

212
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,047
Come on.

213
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,591
Allen.

214
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,220
Allen. This is for your own good.

215
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,805
Don't do this.

216
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,720
Guys, come on. Iris?

217
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,514
Cisco, come on, man.

218
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,933
You have to let me...
You have to let me stop him!

219
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,897
You have to let me...

220
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,023
Did we make the right call here?

221
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,235
Yeah, we did.

222
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,702
You okay, Joe?

223
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,213
Yeah, that wasjust a little harder
than I anticipated.

224
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,339
Yeah, and locking up Barry,

225
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,134
that was the easy part.

226
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,923
Using our plan
to take down Zoom without Barry,

227
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,465
that's gonna be the hard part.

228
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,975
But it's gonna be a lot easier
once we know where he is, Ramon.

229
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,807
Chill man, I'm working on it.

230
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,225
Work harder.

231
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,186
Got it.
He's at the industrial park on Leawood.

232
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,851
- Give me that. Mmm.
- Yep.

233
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,687
That is some serious
nerd love right there.

234
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,447
Snow, look,

235
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,072
everybody here would understand
if you don't wanna go through with this.

236
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,368
Jay may be a monster but there's a human
inside of him somewhere.

237
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,450
I've gotten to that part of him before,
I know I can do it again.

238
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,291
I want to stop him, Harry. For good.

239
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,957
Ramon.

240
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,091
So, let's go over the plan again.

241
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,007
Okay. Caitlin will distract Jay

242
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,047
so that you and Harry
can hit him with the boot.

243
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,138
Cisco's gonna open the breach
and we're gonna put him through it.

244
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,597
I'll disarm the Magnetar.

245
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,886
Destroy the Magnetar,

246
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,188
- save the multi-verse.
- Save the multi-verse.

247
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,894
One more thing, we need to agree.

248
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,809
We all made this decision together,

249
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,650
so, if anything goes wrong,
we stick with it.

250
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,071
Let's load up.

251
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,921
- Hey.
- Hey.

252
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,170
What's the matter?

253
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,343
You know, I've just been thinking.
You know, what's next?

254
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,470
What's next? We stop Zoom.

255
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,384
Right. Right, I guess...

256
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,678
- I don't know, I mean after that.
- I don't know.

257
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,853
I haven't really given it
much thought.

258
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,355
Yeah, I know, no, I know you haven't.

259
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,101
Guess I Just,
I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

260
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,187
You know, I see the way you are
with everyone here.

261
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,865
Caitlin and Cisco, Iris and Joe.

262
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,362
Barry.

263
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,368
Especially Barry.

264
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,121
You care about these people. A lot.

265
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:52,999
You know, but my friends,
they're all back home on our Earth.

266
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,832
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
you know, when this is all over,

267
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,135
I'm gonna go back home to live my life.

268
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,594
But if you need to stay here,
so that you can live yours again,

269
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,847
I get that.

270
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,592
- I understand, it's okay because...
- I...

271
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,682
No, Dad, seeing you happy...

272
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,561
That is all I've ever wanted for you.

273
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,833
Okay. In position.

274
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,710
Copy that. We got you.

275
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,042
Okay, Snow, you ready?

276
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,215
As ready as I can be.

277
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,180
Cisco? Cisco, you good?

278
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,508
Define "good."

279
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,934
Ramon, you're gonna be great.

280
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:55,223
- Snow, when you're ready.
- O kay.

281
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,776
You got this.

282
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,854
Here we go.

283
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,444
Jay?

284
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,578
Caitlin.

285
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,832
Jay!

286
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,756
How did you find me?

287
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,964
Doctor McGee said
the Magnetar was stolen from her labs.

288
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,298
I knew that it had to be you,

289
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,930
so, I tracked you here.

290
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,310
I tracked you here, Jay,
no one else knows.

291
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,974
Itold you, if you left me...

292
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,393
That if I betrayed you,
you'd show me no mercy. I know.

293
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,728
But I just wanna explain why I did that.

294
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,522
Please, Jay.

295
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,820
Talk.

296
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,200
Good job, girl.

297
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,819
Now draw him towards you.

298
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,821
I made a mistake.

299
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,162
I am so sorry that I abandoned you.

300
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,201
But you have to understand,

301
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,836
what you said to me,

302
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,214
that there was
a dark side of me, that I was...

303
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,297
I was more like Killer Frost than I knew.

304
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,754
I didn't wanna accept that.

305
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,424
I tried to lock the darkness inside of me.

306
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,269
But you knew that
that was already a part of me now.

307
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,268
And you're the only one who did.

308
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:24,363
And now,
I'm ready to accept who I really am.

309
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,817
Cisco, get ready.

310
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,489
I am so sorry that I hurt you.

311
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,907
But now I want to be the one
that only you know.

312
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,998
Please, Jay, let me try.

313
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,592
One more step.

314
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,213
I knew you'd eventually
come around, Caitlin.

315
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,218
But it's too late.

316
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,226
Now! Ramon!

317
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,272
Damn it!

318
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,775
Tranq him! Tranq him!

319
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,367
Gun is jammed!

320
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,699
It's working.

321
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,121
Ah!

322
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,876
Dad!

323
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,900
Did you see my dad?

324
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,280
No, the vibe keeps changing.

325
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,033
It's like my brain is
channel surfing or something.

326
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,944
They must be on the move,
that's why the vibe's in flux.

327
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,950
Keep trying?

328
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,077
Hey, did you turn off the Magnetar?

329
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,366
No, there's no messing with that thing.

330
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,377
Whatever he did to it,
we try and touch it, we try and move it,

331
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,004
this planet's done for.

332
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,419
Iris.

333
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,343
What's wrong?

334
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,970
Zoom took Dad.

335
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,142
What? How?

336
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,144
We tried to stop Zoom
by pushing him through the breach,

337
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,476
but he took Joe with him.

338
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,108
Well, where's Barry? Did he go after him?

339
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,314
He's not with us.

340
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,149
He's in a cell in the intake...

341
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,365
Wait, you... You tried to stop Zoom alone?

342
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,944
Long story.

343
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,916
Well, we have to get him back.

344
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,002
Wally, before Zoom took Dad,

345
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,664
we all agreed
that if we got him off this Earth,

346
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,047
we would close the breaches for good

347
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,506
and we would never open them again,

348
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,009
under any circumstances.

349
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,968
Why would you do that?

350
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,976
No. No way, that's not gonna happen.

351
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,352
He made us all agree to it.

352
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,562
- Well, guess what? I didn't agree to that!
- Wally.

353
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:12,105
Iris, I already lost my mom.
If Dad...

354
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,532
I...

355
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:36,505
I will say, if anything, Barry sure has
an ample number of fathers to kill.

356
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,558
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

357
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,641
It doesn't matter,
you're not racing anybody.

358
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,728
Come on, Joe, you know Barry
better than that, you raised him.

359
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,892
He'll say yes
if he thinks he can save you.

360
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,402
Not this time.

361
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,403
I made sure of it.

362
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,320
Who is that?

363
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,242
It would just confuse you.

364
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:00,903
Try me.

365
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,458
I got my speed the same way Barry did.

366
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,703
When I got struck
by the dark matter and electricity,

367
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,167
I became Zoom, the fastest man alive.

368
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,258
It wasn't long
before I had this Earth on its knees.

369
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,880
But it wasn't enough.

370
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,419
Iwanted more.

371
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,051
I wanted to be faster.

372
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,762
So I created a speed drug.

373
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,184
Velocity Nine.

374
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,641
It made me faster
than I ever thought possible.

375
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,272
Fast enough
to break the dimensional barrier,

376
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,400
fast enough to run to other universes,
other Earths.

377
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,230
And then one day,
on one of those other Earths,

378
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,648
I discovered him.

379
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,407
He's another speedster?

380
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,443
Yeah, you could say that.

381
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,112
That was right about the time
I discovered something else, too.

382
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,785
All that V-Nine
I'd been injecting into my system

383
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,871
had a little side effect.

384
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,455
It was killing you.

385
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,547
I searched for a cure. I tried everything.

386
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,958
I even tried
to manipulate the Speed Force.

387
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,923
But let me tell you, the Speed Force...

388
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,133
The Speed Force does not like
its rules being broken.

389
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:04,096
Now it's been sending
its enforcers after me ever since.

390
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,436
So, you brought him here
to steal his speed.

391
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,431
I tried, but it wouldn't take.

392
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,647
But then the skies parted and I saw Barry.

393
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,811
And then I stole his speed.

394
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,192
I won.

395
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,447
I beat the rules of the Speed Force.

396
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,738
Then why keep him here?

397
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,366
A trophy-

398
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,074
And a little idea I had for fun.

399
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:32,837
You see,
I got so tired of being the villain.

400
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,165
So, I decided to be the hero, too.

401
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,259
I even borrowed his name.

402
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,629
Jay Garrick.

403
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,267
You know what's gonna be great, Detective?

404
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,848
After I beat Barry in the race

405
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,434
and prove that
I'm the fastest man alive on any Earth,

406
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:55,352
he's gonna rot in a cage
just like the one Jay's in now.

407
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:00,610
And then I'll have a Flash from two worlds
to keep me company.

408
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,626
Look, everyone's gonna freak
when they find out I did this,

409
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,498
but I don't care.

410
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,337
We need your help, Barry.

411
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,934
Uh... Hey, guys, Barry's n0t...

412
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,766
- In his cell anymore.
- Wally!

413
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,896
Well, I wasn'tjust gonna stand here
and let this happen.

414
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,774
You let him take Joe?
What the hell were you thinking?

415
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,651
Allen, Allen,
there was nothing we could do.

416
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,902
You could have let me race him!

417
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,063
Allen, you're not racing Zoom!

418
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,990
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna tranq me again?

419
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,570
Don't tempt me.

420
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,861
Look, I know you guys made a pact
to keep Zoom on Earth-2,

421
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,075
but you did that without me and Wally.

422
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,740
All right? You don't get to do that!

423
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,783
Barry, look at yourself right now.
You're not okay.

424
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,918
Cisco, my dad was just killed
in front of me!

425
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,249
Do you have any idea how that feels?

426
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,006
Watching someone you love die? Yes, I do.

427
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,337
- Cait...
- Look, Barry,

428
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,097
I know how cold and angry
and distant that can make you.

429
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,555
But when this happened to me,
you were the one who kept me in check.

430
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,139
You told me to stop and take a breath.

431
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,474
And that's all
we're telling you to do now.

432
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,934
I'm telling you, I'm good.

433
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,690
Really? You're good?

434
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,684
Because it seems to me
you wanna do more than stop Zoom.

435
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,569
It seems to me you want revenge.

436
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:24,358
If that's why you're doing this, Allen,
you will lose.

437
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,777
Look, you guys, I...

438
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,454
You may not think I can do this.

439
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,500
You may think I'm too angry,
but we're running out of time.

440
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,870
I have to beat him, and I'm going to,

441
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,880
whether I have your help or not.

442
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,957
So, which one is it?

443
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,085
So, how does this work?

444
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,505
It's the same way we took Iris
into the Speed Force.

445
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,642
Harry does his best Frankenstein,
you hold my hand, and I vibe you there.

446
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,553
All right, let's do it.

447
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,946
I'll do it.

448
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,316
Say when and where, I'll be there.

449
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,077
Cisco's learned
how to bring people into his vibes.

450
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,448
There's one condition. You bring Joe back.

451
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:17,289
But if he's harmed in any way, it's off.

452
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:18,452
I'll bring him.

453
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,496
But I won't release him
until after we race.

454
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,039
Deal?

455
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,458
Deal.

456
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:40,308
I tell you, Jay might be crazy pants,
but he can pick a venue.

457
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,397
Brought the whole crew with you, huh?

458
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,533
Can't say I blame you.

459
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,034
- Dad!
- LRIS: Wally.

460
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,786
It's gonna be one hell of a show.

461
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,071
Let him go.

462
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,532
After we race.

463
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,451
Cut the crap.
We know you plan to power up the Magnetar

464
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,837
so you can destroy the multi-verse.

465
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,418
Bravo, you've figured it out.

466
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,965
Almost.

467
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,843
I don't want to destroy all of it.

468
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,421
This Earth is at the center
of the multi-verse.

469
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,761
It's the access point
to every other Earth in existence.

470
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,682
One trans-dimensional shockwave and...

471
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:17,928
Poof.

472
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,273
Leaving just our Earth.
How generous of you.

473
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,522
Need to have some place to hang my cowl.

474
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,363
You might wanna say your goodbyes.

475
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,999
Don't worry, I'm gonna save your dad.

476
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,294
No, you're gonna save our dad.

477
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,088
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs, it's safer.

478
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,544
We're not going anywhere.

479
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,462
You got eyes and ears right here.

480
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,674
Either he goes, or we all die together.

481
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,300
We believe in you.

482
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,854
Wait.

483
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,436
Barry,

484
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,476
kick his ass.

485
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,321
What are the rules?

486
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,235
One lap around the inside of this loop

487
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,530
will produce about one gigawatt of energy.

488
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,454
And I need 500-plus to
power the Magnetar enough to do the job.

489
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,710
Once it's full, I win.

490
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,046
Because there is no stopping it.

491
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:30,085
So, all I have to do to beat you
is stop you before that happens.

492
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,469
Yep, it's that simple.

493
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,882
But if at any point you decide
you don't want to race anymore,

494
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,559
dear old Dad number two is a dead man.

495
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,765
As well as your little fan club.

496
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,563
They're not my fan club,

497
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,316
they're the reason that I'm running.

498
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,977
Why I'm gonna beat you.

499
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,991
Let's see what you're made of, "Flash."

500
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,954
Just say when, Zoom.

501
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,498
Run, Barry. Run!

502
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,477
He's powering up the Magnetar.

503
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,315
Come on, Barry, catch up.

504
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,704
- Which one's Barry?
- Both ofthem.

505
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,706
- He made a Time Remnant.
- Time Remnant!

506
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:57,713
- Go, all right? Go!
- How are you...

507
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,926
I'll explain later, go!

508
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:04,974
A Remnant.

509
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,981
Stole my trick, Flash.

510
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,772
But you're too late.

511
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,649
Bye-bye multi-verse.

512
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,712
What's the Time Remnant doing?

513
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,581
He's creating his own pulse.

514
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:33,915
Why would he do that?

515
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:39,134
Because if that's out of phase,
it'll counteract that one.

516
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,264
Wait, his body can't handle that!

517
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,762
Then what's gonna happen?

518
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,598
He'll die.

519
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,535
No!

520
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,466
Do it.

521
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,892
You're a hero, Barry.
You couldn't kill me before.

522
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,761
You won't kill me now.

523
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,602
I don't have to.

524
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:11,268
Okay, so you ran back in time
and made a copy of yourself?

525
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,355
Well, uh... Basically, yeah.

526
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,645
It's called a Time Remnant.

527
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,532
It's not something
that I can do every day,

528
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,285
but I needed a way to draw
the Time Wraiths out of the Speed Force,

529
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,866
hoping they'd be more upset

530
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,701
at what Zoom had done
than they'd be at me.

531
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,000
Is that what I look like
when they start talking about science?

532
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,206
Pretty much.

533
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,871
Don't worry, Wally,
it'll get easier to understand.

534
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,005
Well, how does that even work?

535
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,750
Same way Zoom did it.

536
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,715
I ran back in time moments before I left.

537
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,547
It's the only way
I can be in two places at once.

538
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,467
Okay, so, the Time Remnant,
it's still you.

539
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,225
- Yeah.
- But he died.

540
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,513
I...

541
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,230
He was willing
to sacrifice himself for all of us.

542
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,069
That's how much he loved us.

543
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,901
You know what, we'll just...
We'll forget about it.

544
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,566
Uh, Barry, I'm glad you're okay.

545
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,201
You know what? In battle...

546
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,531
- Here.
- Choose your weapon wisely.

547
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,243
All right, some people choose a gun,
I choose a Phillips head.

548
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,032
- Screwdriver.
- Oh, I'm sorry, you're so particular...

549
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,918
Ramon, can you just, please!
Have you ever worked with a tool before?

550
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,544
- I'm working with one now.
- Are you ready?

551
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,798
One, two, and...

552
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,803
I don't know what's more annoying,

553
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,762
being in that thing
or listening to you two arguing about it.

554
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,105
Um...

555
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,113
You're...

556
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,111
I'm Jay Garrick.

557
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,030
The real Jay Garrick.

558
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,452
What?

559
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,579
I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry.

560
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,968
Barr.

561
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,138
He looks just like him.
He looks just like my dad, Joe.

562
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,398
I can't believe this. My dad told me...

563
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,652
He told me this, he said his,
his mom's maiden name was Garrick!

564
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,483
I just never thought that that meant...

565
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,488
- I never thought that meant...
- Hey, Barr. Barr.

566
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,648
He doesn't know that.

567
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,445
He doesn't know that
he's your dad's doppelganger, okay?

568
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,954
Do you want me to tell him
that you had to leave?

569
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,035
No. No.

570
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,324
Sure?

571
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,370
Yeah, I Just need a minute.

572
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,004
I'll be all right.

573
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,044
- That's why he wouldn't.
- Yeah.

574
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,178
- It's so smart because of...
- Yeah, there it is.

575
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,090
So, the reason you didn't have your powers

576
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,010
is because there was a dampener
in the mask. You see?

577
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,189
I don't wanna see this thing ever again.

578
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,273
So, your powers are back.

579
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:09,404
I see, Jay, excuse me, Hunter,
stole your color scheme, too.

580
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,534
He took a lot of things that were mine.

581
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,697
Except for that. That's, um...
That's all him.

582
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,831
He said it was his father's, from the war.

583
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,668
Ironically, on my... On our Earth,

584
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,291
this helmet stood for hope.

585
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,539
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

586
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,877
Maybe I can continue that sentiment.

587
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:33,382
Take something from him for a change,
make it my own.

588
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,101
It suits you.

589
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,939
Thank you, all of you,
for saving me from Zoom.

590
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,025
Especially you, Flash.

591
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,568
You're welcome, Flash.

592
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,706
Now all I have to do is find my way home.

593
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,866
And where's that?

594
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,411
I think you would call it Earth-3.

595
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,380
Uh-huh. Well, I can get you to Earth-2.

596
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,757
My daughter and I
can help you with the rest.

597
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,084
We can?

598
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,252
Yes, we can.

599
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,222
We're going home.

600
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,141
Okay.

601
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,570
Snow, you're a tremendous scientist,

602
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,278
but you're an even better person.

603
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,442
Don't make me cry, Harry.

604
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,452
I've done enough of that already.

605
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,746
- Detective Joe West.
- Harry.

606
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,085
You have great kids,
you take care of them.

607
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,876
Same to you.
You take care of that beautiful girl.

608
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,290
Yes, sir.

609
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,295
Bye.

610
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,676
I'm a better man
than I was when I got here,

611
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:01,849
and it's 'cause of you.

612
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,555
I'm not the same, either.

613
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,436
Hey, uh, don't be surprised
if I project myself over to Earth-2

614
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,605
every once in a while, you know, just to
throw your stuff across the office.

615
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,864
I'll miss you, too, Cisco.

616
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:25,119
So, I guess I can't text you
from another Earth, huh?

617
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,291
Yeah, I guess not.

618
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,418
It's too bad.

619
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,342
Thank you, guys, seriously,

620
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,222
- for saving our home.
- Mmm-hmm.

621
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,765
Ready?

622
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,176
Yeah.

623
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,071
Can't stop thinking
about my dad's doppelganger,

624
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,703
seeing him, knowing that he's out there,

625
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,458
that should've made it easier.

626
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,081
Doesn't.

627
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,583
Just made me miss him even more.

628
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,003
I can't even imagine
how hard that must've been.

629
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:59,388
We just won. We just beat Zoom.

630
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,765
Why does it feel like I Just lost?

631
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:09,389
Because you've lost a lot in your life,
Barry, more than most.

632
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,184
But...

633
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:20,777
Maybe you and me,
seeing where this thing goes,

634
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,447
maybe that can give you something
for a change.

635
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,202
That's all I ever wanted to hear you say.

636
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,416
And lwish that I was in a place
where I could try that with you,

637
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,628
but I feel so hollowed out inside
right now.

638
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,807
I feel more broken
than I've ever felt in my life.

639
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,347
If I'm ever gonna be
worth anything to you,

640
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,104
I need to fix what's wrong with me.

641
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,143
I need to find some... Some peace.

642
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,281
Barry, listen to me,

643
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,902
you waited for me for years.

644
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,412
You let me get to a place
where this was possible.

645
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:12,035
So, I am telling you,
I am gonna do the same thing for you.

646
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,371
Wherever you need to go,

647
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,917
whatever you need to do, do it.

648
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,050
And when you get back, I'll be here.

649
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,261
Okay.

650
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,426
I love you, Barry.

651
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,865
I love you, too.

652
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,579
And I always will.

653
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,059
That's why I'm so sorry.

654
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,558
But I have to do this.

655
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,571
No! Mom!

656
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:35,918
Run!

657
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:40,757
Barry! No!

658
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,935
You're not gonna kill her this time.

659
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,263
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

660
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,459
No.

661
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,707
I'm not gonna hurt you.

662
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,551
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

663
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,469
I'm not gonna hurt you. You're safe.

664
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,932
You're safe now.

665
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:43,956
