1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,941
Jackie: Ahem. Uh...

2
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:11,043
I am here
to see Mr. jambah.

3
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,478
The curator?

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,613
He asked if I would
pick up some photos

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,882
to deliver
to a colleague of his

6
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,685
at the archeology
conference in Calcutta.

7
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,523
Eh...Which I will
be flying to in 2 hours.

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,060
If you could call him,
please, for--

9
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,361
(snores)

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,732
The museum directors
must feel very secure

11
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,834
knowing
you are on the job.

12
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,039
Mr. jambah?

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,673
Hello?

14
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,542
Man: You know why
we have come.

15
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,578
Where are the sutras
of rachtajhiba?

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,715
Man: Tell your master
I know nothing
about them.

17
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,685
You speak lies!

18
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,890
Jackie, help! Thieves!

19
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,859
Stop! Stay
where you are,

20
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,561
nobody gets hurt.

21
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,564
This does not concern you.
Leave here!

22
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,300
Mr. jambah
is a respected colleague.

23
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,701
You leave!

24
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,039
Oh, you are yoga masters.

25
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,474
Nonviolent.

26
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,213
But I thought yoga
was to promote peace within.

27
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:26,812
Ooh...

28
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,215
I am still standing.

29
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,684
Oh...Oh!

30
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,023
Ahh.

31
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,424
Jackie!
- Oh!

32
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,972
Jackie,
a thousand apologies.

33
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,774
It's ok. I am fine.

34
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,330
Ow...Ooh.

35
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,432
Oh, I've done you
a terrible wrong.

36
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,934
You are hurt.

37
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:24,169
Those men.
Who were they?

38
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:26,004
Thieves.
Very bad men.

39
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,674
They mentioned
the sutras of rachta...

40
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,809
Rachtajhiba,

41
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,477
an ancient evil text

42
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,614
said to possess
great destructive power.

43
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:39,151
To think I would even permit
such an unpleasant artifact

44
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:42,521
to be included
in my collection
is beyond ridiculous.

45
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:45,157
And impossible,
because you see,

46
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,026
the sutras of rachtajhiba
are mere legend.

47
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,465
Oh. Perhaps
we should get you
some medical attention.

48
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,601
No. I'm fine. Really.

49
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,336
(Moans) Oh...Oh...

50
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,205
The photos
you wanted me
to bring to India?

51
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,175
Oh, yes!
My colleague
from the British museum

52
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,143
will be meeting you
at the conference.

53
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,212
You are very kind
to do this for me.

54
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,848
It is my--ah! Pain.

55
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,352
Oh, you are
coming with me to see
my dentist Dr. Webber.

56
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,686
He is very gentle.

57
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,854
Thank you.

58
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,456
Flying is
disagreeable enough,

59
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,459
even without
having to suffer
a painful mouth.

60
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,830
Man: Where
are the sutras?

61
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,298
Mohajah, I--

62
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,637
(man thinking)
We have disappointed
our master.

63
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,438
We are not worthy.

64
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,474
You return empty-handed?

65
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,977
But, mohajah,
we were outnumbered.

66
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,914
Concentrate.
Mustn't allow mohajah
to read my mind

67
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,850
or he will know
we were defeated by--

68
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,252
tell me of this one man

69
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,122
who bested 3 disciples.

70
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,457
Well, I'm afraid
you're going to need

71
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,660
a complete
jaw transplant,
Mr. chan.

72
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:55,794
Huh?!

73
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,262
Ha ha ha!
Just kidding!

74
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,231
You simply have
a displaced filling.

75
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,133
We'll have you
fixed up in no time.

76
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,969
Elisa, prepare a shot
of novocaine, please.

77
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,038
Uh...I don't
like needles.

78
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,807
Oh...Well...

79
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,777
I could drill
without numbing you.

80
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,945
(Gulps) Ok.
Numbing, please.

81
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,149
Ha ha ha.

82
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,518
One new filling
coming right up.

83
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,059
If jambah or
one of his accomplices

84
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,728
is to return to India
with the sutras,

85
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,564
he must pass through here.

86
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,566
(Muffled speech)
Good-bye, uncle.

87
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,268
We'll be back
on thurday.

88
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,271
I cannot
understand a word
you are saying.

89
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,340
His mouth's still
numb from the dentist.

90
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,176
He said if the school
sends over any homework,
it's a mistake.

91
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,277
Just toss it.

92
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,179
No! I did-ent.
I thaid--

93
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,181
no, no, don't talk!
Listen!

94
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,683
Make sure
not to forget
to pick up spices

95
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,485
for uncle
in Calcutta.

96
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,053
Yeth, uncle.

97
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,755
Curry powder.

98
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,623
I wrote ID down.
Thee?

99
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,427
That is the man
from the museum--

100
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,229
jambah's colleague.

101
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,698
(Beeping)

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,700
(Beep beep beep)

103
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,002
Oh, ah got a new
fillin' today.

104
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,038
Shee?

105
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,708
I must move closer,

106
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,276
read his mind.

107
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,246
Here's your ticket,
Jade.

108
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,081
It's so cool
you're taking me along

109
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,084
on this once-in-a-lifetime
educational experience,
uncle Jackie.

110
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:29,054
(Thinking)
Three whole days--
no school! Yes!

111
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,591
Ah mith you, uncle.

112
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,393
(Thinking)
I'll miss you,
uncle.

113
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,529
An' don' worry...
I won' forget da
curry powder.

114
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,365
You are
a good nephew.

115
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,434
(Thinking)
Ah! Jackie will forget!

116
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,169
He always forgets!

117
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,839
There are too many
minds here.

118
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,284
(Gasps)

119
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,420
The sutras
of rachtajhiba--

120
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,155
I know you have them.

121
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,757
Well, actually, <i> had.</i>

122
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,494
Jackie chan?!

123
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,329
Stop him!

124
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,178
Ah, I can
- speak clearly again.

125
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,281
Great. Now you can chitchat
with the eggheads.

126
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,216
Oh, first things first.

127
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,884
I am starving.

128
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:36,788
No, duh. You dribbled
everything you tried
to eat on the plane.

129
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,396
Ow!

130
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,966
Oh, sorry.

131
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,303
I just had
some dental work done.

132
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,138
I am
- so not with him.

133
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,640
Pardon me.

134
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,843
Would you be
Mr. Jackie chan?

135
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,982
Oh, I would...Anytime.

136
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,152
I mean, yes.

137
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,155
Hmm. Portia martindale,
British museum.

138
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,424
And you have
something I want.

139
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,292
I do?

140
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,528
The photographs
from Mr. jambah.

141
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,331
Oh. Oh! Yes.

142
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,104
The light is so much better
out on the balcony.

143
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,039
Care to join me?

144
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,140
Ok.

145
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,311
Go, Jackie!

146
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,849
Mr. chan,
may I just say--

147
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,186
oh, please.
Call me Jackie.

148
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,190
Jackie,
I was so impressed

149
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,458
when I read
how you discovered

150
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,426
that lost city
in patagonia.

151
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,228
Oh, thank you.

152
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,998
I was very lucky.
I had a very good map.

153
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,435
Mmm, and
he's humble, too.

154
00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:00,038
Oh, so clumsy!

155
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,907
Oh, please. Allow me.

156
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,277
There is the signal.

157
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,678
Thank you, Jackie.

158
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,780
You know,
it's so very nice out,

159
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,182
I feel like a walk.
How about you?

160
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,417
Oh, that would be--

161
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,351
(woman screaming)

162
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,025
Nice to meet you.
Good-bye. Thank you.

163
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,493
Excuse me. Oh, sorry.

164
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,261
Pardon me.

165
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,564
Jade, return
to the hotel room!

166
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,335
Didn't say "please."

167
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,498
Sorry! I'll bring it back!
Thank you!

168
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,306
Got him
- in my sights, gentlemen.

169
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,594
Why do you
keep chasing me?

170
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:30,695
Oh!

171
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,098
Aah! Oof!

172
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,636
Hey, you! Pay first!

173
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,538
Whoa!
Dumbo, heel! Please!

174
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,378
He's traveling
by elephant,

175
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,146
the bazaar
in the medan.

176
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,581
(Screaming)

177
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,484
Oh! Ow!

178
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,888
My tooth!
No shock absorbers!

179
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,924
Yeow! Oof!

180
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,030
(Cell phone rings)

181
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,531
Hello?

182
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,868
Ah, Jackie,
do not forget
curry powder.

183
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,370
Ok, uncle.
I took care of it.

184
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,273
Have to go. Bye.

185
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,076
Sorry about your shop.
Send me your bill. Thank you!

186
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,486
(Groans)

187
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,866
(Grunts)

188
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,868
Huh?

189
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,103
Jambah?

190
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,638
Miss martindale!

191
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,541
Dr. weber?
I don't understand.

192
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,309
Oh, you will
in a moment.

193
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,912
A little novocaine
to ease the pain?

194
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,547
Oh, don't bother, portia.

195
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,949
Mr. chan hates needles.
Ha ha ha.

196
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,585
No. Please!

197
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,220
Don't!

198
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,292
There now.
That wasn't so bad,
was it?

199
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,594
Yes, it was.

200
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,866
I suppose we owe you
an explanation, Jackie.

201
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,369
You heard of the sutras
of rachtajhiba, yes?

202
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,171
Only at your museum.

203
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,040
You said they were
just a legend.

204
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,541
I lied.

205
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:27,445
You see, the sutras
do very much exist.

206
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,782
In my filling!

207
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,617
Magnificent,
are they not?

208
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,855
A 3,000-word incantation
painstakingly inscribed

209
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:40,558
by skilled sorcerers
onto a piece of silver

210
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,261
no larger than a grain
of basmati rice.

211
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,767
Legend foretells
that when the sutras
are returned to the Ganges,

212
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,969
the river will dry up.

213
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,371
Oh, that would be--

214
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,640
so those thieves
who have been
after me--

215
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,842
you have been
trying to stop them!

216
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,778
Well...No.

217
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,347
Actually,
they've been
trying to stop us.

218
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,849
They are not truly
thieves, you see.

219
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,519
They are disciples
of mohajah.

220
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,587
Who?
Oh, a do-gooder
mystic--

221
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,989
a psychic.

222
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,859
Claims his mission
is to protect India
from evil magic.

223
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,229
Mohajah suspected
I was in possession
of the sutras

224
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:21,666
and was planning
to transport them
here to India.

225
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:25,436
But none of us could carry
the sutras without the mohajah
knowing it.

226
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,106
That mind-reading power
of his--oh!

227
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,507
Real nuisance.

228
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,576
So you
had to find a courier

229
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:34,546
who did not know
he was carrying the sutras.

230
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,714
Me.

231
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,384
We do so appreciate
your help, Jackie.

232
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:44,856
But that means
you want to dry up
the Ganges river. Why?!

233
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,724
Have you
no sense of vision, man?

234
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:51,029
Do you not realize
what treasures lie
on the riverbed?

235
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,799
Centuries worth
of artifacts,
silver, gold,

236
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,602
riches beyond measure
there for the taking!

237
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,939
But millions of people
depend upon the river

238
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,974
for farming
and travel and--

239
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:06,211
(gasps)
Lives will be destroyed!

240
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,713
Oh, Jackie's a bit
of a sentimentalist.

241
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:12,383
So sweet, but, really,

242
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,018
one must have priorities.

243
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,088
We're talking about
the archeological event
of the millennium.

244
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,257
If a few people
must be inconvenienced,

245
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,825
(hums)

246
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,362
You are bad people--
all of you!

247
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,866
Ah, yes. Soon to be
very rich people.

248
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,167
(Grunts)

249
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,539
Nobody moves,
nobody gets hurt.

250
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,843
Jade?!
I told you to go back
to the hotel room.

251
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,713
Lost my key. Ok, now,
let the chan man go.

252
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,683
Dr. weber,
give the child a lollipop.

253
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,952
Don't sucker me,
sucker! Hyah!

254
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,826
Stand back, or I'll...

255
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,162
Dribble?

256
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,998
Jade, the other one!

257
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,167
Ha! Your plan to destroy
a million lives

258
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,569
has gone down the drain.

259
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,405
Yes! The drain...

260
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,573
Which leads to the sewers--

261
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:46,511
which flow directly
into the Ganges river.

262
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,579
Aah! Jade!
We have to--

263
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,082
as you were.

264
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:54,252
Care to tell them
what a full-on blast
of X-ray radiation

265
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,055
will do to one's
internal organs, Dr. weber?

266
00:15:57,057 --> 00:16:00,425
Ha ha ha.
Well, those lead aprons
we provide our patients

267
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,694
are not frivolous
accessories.

268
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,262
So let's all just sit tight

269
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,364
and let the sewer
do its work, shall we?

270
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:10,335
Uh, Jackie, did you remember
to get uncle's curry powder?

271
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,037
Yes, Jade, but now
is not the time to--

272
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,544
uncle's curry powder--
yes.

273
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,679
Right...Here!

274
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,648
(Sneezing and coughing)

275
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,486
We must find a way
into--there!

276
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,862
Ugh!

277
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:41,032
Finding
a tiny piece of silver
in all of this--

278
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,700
this--
- this yuck!

279
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,137
Oh! Follow the current!

280
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,241
What if we
stop the current?

281
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,743
(Groans)

282
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,077
Jade, no!

283
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,321
Whoa!

284
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,823
Aaah!
- Aaah!

285
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,258
(Screaming)

286
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,010
Jade: Look!

287
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,346
(Gasps) The opening
to the river!

288
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,715
I only hope
we are not too late.

289
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,753
I see it!

290
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,489
Ugh!

291
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,227
Bottle cap. Heh.

292
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,499
Hmm? That chanting...

293
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,405
It's coming
from the sutras,

294
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,240
as if they sense
the river is--

295
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,508
(gasps)

296
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,479
Oh!

297
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,482
Aaah!

298
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,925
Yes!

299
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,194
Jade!

300
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,497
I know. I am good.

301
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,666
Behind you!

302
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,572
The sutras--I will
be taking them now.

303
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:31,209
You'll have to pry 'em
out of my wet, cold,
yucky fingers.

304
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,949
Whoa. I <i> am</i> good.

305
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,452
They cannot move.

306
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,987
Mind control.

307
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,456
The sutras, please.

308
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,991
Oh, no, you don't!

309
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,926
(Grunting)
It is all right, Jade.

310
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,361
They are the good guys.

311
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,629
(Whispering)
You sure?

312
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,898
He's got this whole
Spock mind-meld

313
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,867
scanner thing
happening.

314
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,171
Thank you, Jackie chan.

315
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,906
My disciples and I
shall ensure

316
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,041
that the sutras
remain safe from those

317
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:07,178
who would use them
for evil.

318
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,579
You are welcome.

319
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:12,350
Aah! Very bad toothache.

320
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,627
Huh? My toothache--
it's gone.

321
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,697
Power of the mind.

322
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:30,001
Hey, uh, think you could
do some power of the mind

323
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,403
to remove the yuck
from my shoes?

324
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,376
(Cell phone rings)

325
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,944
My cell phone!

326
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,081
It is your uncle

327
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,285
reminding you
to bring home
curry powder.

328
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,054
That is...Amazing.

329
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,891
There is one more thing
that he desires.

330
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:59,397
Though
I am not quite sure
I understand.

331
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,532
Ow!

332
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,676
Hey, Jackie!

333
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,843
Yes?

334
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,413
Where do you get the ideas
for your stunts?

335
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,449
So many years
I've been doing
action films

336
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,718
I really, like,
school myself.

337
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,790
Study every movie,
every Bruce Lee film,

338
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,593
Stallone film,
everybody.

339
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,596
I've been thinking,
punch or kicking
all same.

340
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,364
Sometimes just boring.

341
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,499
The props
really help me a lot.

342
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:39,036
Situation, props,
and different country,

343
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,372
different culture,
different background--

344
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,873
they all help me.

345
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,576
They all help me
to doing a stunt. Yeah.
