00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
JONAH HEX (2010)

2
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:14,907
<i>War and me took to each other real well.</i>

3
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,155
<i>It felt like it had meaning.</i>

4
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,974
<i>The feeling of doing
what you thought was right.</i>

5
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,012
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

6
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:53,315
<i>Folks can believe what they like...</i>

7
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,859
<i>...but eventually a man's gotta decide
if he's gonna do what's right.</i>

8
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:23,719
<i>That choice cost me
more than I bargained for.</i>

9
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:33,291
Daddy!

10
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:39,527
Daddy!

11
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,733
- Daddy!
- Son!

12
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:44,565
Brave boy.

13
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:47,733
My son Jeb was brave. Loyal too.

14
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:51,176
And then he was murdered
by his best friend in cold blood.

15
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:52,713
Isn't that right, Hex?

16
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:54,180
Turnbull, let them go.

17
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:58,078
Son, you are not fit to wear this uniform.

18
00:02:58,255 --> 00:03:00,120
You're a coward and a traitor.

19
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:03,584
Fine. I am.

20
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,284
It's got nothing to do with them.

21
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:06,929
- Of course it does.
No.

22
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,860
You killed the only family I had.

23
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:11,000
No. General, please, don't do this.

24
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:14,569
Betrayed your own men
and you murdered my son.

25
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:17,002
I'm begging you, sir. I'm begging you.

26
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:21,235
You took everything that I love,
Jonah Hex.

27
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:22,878
You know what that feels like?

28
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:24,604
Don't do this.

29
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,874
It feels like this.

30
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:29,112
I want you to watch.

31
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:30,753
No! No!

32
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:33,412
- No!
No!

33
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:59,716
You're gonna go free.

34
00:03:59,883 --> 00:04:02,852
Free to walk this earth
with a mark on your flesh.

35
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,284
And every day,
that mark will remind you...

36
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:10,517
...of the man
who took everything you had.

37
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:23,963
<i>I hung on that cross for days.</i>

38
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:30,308
<i>By the time the Crow Indians found me
and cut me down...</i>

39
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:33,210
<i>...I was nearly dead.</i>

40
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:36,819
<i>Those medicine men did
what they could to bring me back...</i>

41
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:39,615
<i>...but somehow they just couldn't
get me all the way out.</i>

42
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,884
<i>And crows seemed to stay with me.</i>

43
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:45,427
<i>Didn't make me immortal.</i>

44
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:49,463
<i>Just left me with the curse
of knowing the other side.</i>

45
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:55,935
<i>See, talking to dead folks ain't natural.</i>

46
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:58,870
<i>But sometimes they're the only ones
who will point the way.</i>

47
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:07,243
<i>I searched this land high and low,
hunting old Turnbull down.</i>

48
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:14,423
<i>But then that old bastard played one
final trick on me and died in a hotel fire.</i>

49
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,983
<i>The man that took my family was dead.</i>

50
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,855
<i>I had nowhere to go
and a heart full of vengeance.</i>

51
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:27,800
<i>I did what come natural
and turned to bounty hunting.</i>

52
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:32,735
<i>Punishing the guilty
wherever there was profit.</i>

53
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,951
<i>This here's my story.</i>

54
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:43,904
Jonah Hex.

55
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,078
Jonah Hex.

56
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,723
These are the boys you wanted.

57
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:58,258
The Clayton boys.

58
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,588
That's right.

59
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:01,924
Appear we have a little problem, Mr. Hex.

60
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:05,261
There's four Clayton boys.
This only three boys.

61
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,499
I don't see my way we could
possibly recompense you...

62
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,833
...the agreed upon "recomseption. "

63
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:19,714
The rest of him was too fat for my horse.

64
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,680
Well, now, Mr. Hex...

65
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:26,311
...these boys were no end of trouble
to us simple folk.

66
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:31,460
You showed me proof they was
guilty. I brought them in, simple as that.

67
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:34,529
You surely have done us quite a favor.

68
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:37,627
Transaction's all it was.

69
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:40,868
I'll collect my $100 bounty on them
and be on my way.

70
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:45,531
That there, Mr. Hex,
was more of a limited-time offer.

71
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,472
But you'll pay it all the same.

72
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:50,511
Oh, hell, Mr. Hex.

73
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,313
There's an unscrupulous man or two would
pay double that for your stinking hide.

74
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,687
Five coffins.

75
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:07,996
Sure you don't need eight?

76
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:09,324
Cut him down!

77
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:46,288
Congratulations.

78
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:47,922
Hang it up.
All right. I'm in.

79
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:42,435
Mom?

80
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:45,503
What do you suppose
those men are doing?

81
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,316
Get down!

82
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:08,566
Stay calm.
We've got them 20 to one.

83
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:25,186
Prepare to engage!

84
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:39,401
Look out!

85
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:46,837
I'll take out the conductor!

86
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,136
Secure the weapon!

87
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:53,612
Nobody move.

88
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,574
Everybody, get back.

89
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:20,702
We're slowing down.

90
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,693
You're sure, absolutely sure,
it was Turnbull?

91
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,337
Positive, President Grant.

92
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:51,871
Bastard must've faked his own death.

93
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,066
- Why now?
I can hazard a guess.

94
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:58,274
There are centennial celebrations
being prepared in more than 20 states.

95
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:00,942
Whatever he's preparing...

96
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:04,746
<i>...we've probably got 10 days
to find him.</i>

97
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:05,910
<i>Beg your pardon...</i>

98
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:09,217
<i>...but why does the president care
if one old Confederate general is alive?</i>

99
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:12,327
<i>After Gettysburg, Turnbull changed.</i>

100
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:15,293
<i>He targeted hospitals, schools, churches.</i>

101
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:17,733
<i>Strike enough fear into people's hearts...</i>

102
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,927
<i>...and eventually they'll tear down
the government that failed to protect them.</i>

103
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:24,938
<i>His Mexican slaves
had a nickname for him.</i>

104
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:26,808
<i>- What was it?
- Terorrista.</i>

105
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:28,967
<i>Terorrista.</i>

106
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:36,249
Load all that cannon onto our wagon.

107
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:40,645
Find what's left of our two boys
and give them an honorable burial.

108
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:42,085
Burn the rest.

109
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:45,118
<i>Tell me what you know, lieutenant.</i>

110
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:48,422
All we can confirm is that Turnbull
took something off that train.

111
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,029
And that he broke into the U.S. Armory
in Virginia a week before that.

112
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,733
- Summerland, Virginia?
- Yes, sir.

113
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:57,464
He's building it.

114
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,609
- The plans were never completed.
- He's building the weapon.

115
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:04,269
Sir, as you know,
my unit is the very best.

116
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,215
Yes, lieutenant, which is why
I need you to locate this man.

117
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,479
<i>Jonah Hex?
Mm.</i>

118
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:17,387
<i>Hex is a lawless bounty hunter.
The man was a hero once.</i>

119
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,827
<i>Sir, we've all heard the stories, but...
Hex turned in Turnbull and his men.</i>

120
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,967
<i>And he paid a terrible price for it.</i>

121
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:28,160
- Sir, Turn...
- Mark my words, gentlemen.

122
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:33,468
The very fate of our nation may rest
on the shoulders of Jonah Hex.

123
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:47,682
He don't look so tough.

124
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:51,818
Looks tough to me.

125
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,491
Not to me.

126
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:01,631
Watch this.

127
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,304
Hey, Hex. What happened to your face?

128
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:15,349
Cut myself shaving.

129
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:17,509
What happened to yours?

130
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:24,256
For the broken window.

131
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:43,943
It's about time for you to move on,
Mr. Nash.

132
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:46,308
Grayden, please.

133
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:48,382
Door's right there.

134
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:51,647
Will you at least consider it?

135
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:54,790
I'll leave her, the store.

136
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:56,891
Hell, my kids.

137
00:16:57,727 --> 00:16:58,751
Let's go to the city.

138
00:16:58,995 --> 00:17:02,123
I don't play house.
Our transaction is done here.

139
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:04,528
You wanna see me,
pay fair like everyone else.

140
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,998
I don't want anybody else's hands
on you, Lilah.

141
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,272
- Mr. Nash.
- All right.

142
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:16,206
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

143
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,791
Look, buzzard...

144
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,562
Jonah Hex.

145
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:39,959
Lilah.

146
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:43,303
Get inside.

147
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,850
It's been a while, Hex.

148
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:00,219
Yeah, that it has.

149
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:09,289
You worry about me, don't you?

150
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:15,866
No.

151
00:18:21,243 --> 00:18:25,179
Well, I worry about you.

152
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:28,812
Look how many times you've been shot.

153
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:31,348
It's just one more that's gonna do it.

154
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:37,053
Well, it seems like I've been
luckier than most in that respect.

155
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,332
Which one was the first one?

156
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,828
I don't recall a first or last.

157
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:57,107
Why don't we call this one number one?

158
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,042
This can be number two.

159
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:06,078
Three.

160
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,023
Four.

161
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:31,511
It ain't safe here, Jonah.

162
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:33,614
They'll be coming for you.

163
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:36,251
Yeah, well, they always do.

164
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:38,916
I saw them notices.

165
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:40,715
It's different this time.

166
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,955
You killed them lawmen.

167
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,219
They was wearing badges,
but not one of them was no lawman.

168
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,329
You'll hang for it...

169
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:51,330
...if the Army don't gun you down first.

170
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,331
Well...

171
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,434
...then I'll be moving on.

172
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,906
Maybe southways.

173
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,676
Of course you are.

174
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:09,316
It's paradise, you know...

175
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:12,313
...waiting around here on you.

176
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:18,091
We can go somewhere.

177
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:22,125
Everyone who gets close to me dies.

178
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:25,666
There's no future for you and me, Lilah.

179
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:29,164
Look at you, setting the rules.

180
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:42,747
You know, you shouldn't be
so sure of me, Jonah Hex.

181
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:46,519
Next time you come around
I may not be here.

182
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:49,654
It's the best I can do, Lilah.

183
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:53,588
Christ, woman,
how many men you seeing a day?

184
00:20:53,763 --> 00:20:55,560
Jonah Hex?

185
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:59,895
By Presidential Act you are hereby
inducted into military service.

186
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:03,596
A reward will be offered
for the administration of your duties.

187
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,939
Your country needs you.

188
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,667
Ain't my country.

189
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:11,335
You get lost or get dead.

190
00:21:11,514 --> 00:21:13,982
- Hex, you've got to come with us.
- No.

191
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,744
You can't outshoot a dozen men.

192
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:19,645
I might like them odds.

193
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:21,717
Quentin Turnbull...

194
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,652
You dare say that name to me?

195
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:29,529
Quentin Turnbull is alive.

196
00:21:52,221 --> 00:21:53,745
<i>Turnbull.</i>

197
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:55,447
<i>He's alive.</i>

198
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:58,024
<i>I thought I'd never hear that name again.</i>

199
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:07,901
Thank you so much for joining us,
Mr. Hex.

200
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:12,237
The boy told me to talk to you.
Where's Turnbull?

201
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:15,809
The president seems to think
that you're special.

202
00:22:15,978 --> 00:22:18,538
Magic, even. We'll just see about that.

203
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,512
- You don't know, do you?
- Oh, we know.

204
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:26,346
Frankly, what I don't know
is why we're even bothering with you.

205
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,421
Let me show you something.

206
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:35,153
This is the future, Hex.

207
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:37,959
Intelligence. Information.

208
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:41,534
With our sophisticated network,
men like you will be a thing of the past.

209
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:44,469
When we get this strung up...

210
00:22:48,377 --> 00:22:49,742
Future's bright.

211
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,005
Now, you listen to me, bounty hunter.

212
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:55,617
I have quality intelligence that says
Turnbull and his band of bastards...

213
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:57,547
...are headed to Springfield, Georgia.

214
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,814
And how'd you come by this quality...

215
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,719
What'd you call it?

216
00:23:02,892 --> 00:23:05,588
- Intelligence.
- Right.

217
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:09,720
Turnbull's men assaulted
one of our trains.

218
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:13,665
Yet we did manage to overcome
this one deadly outlaw.

219
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,097
Told us everything we needed to know.

220
00:23:16,272 --> 00:23:19,105
Unfortunately he died
during our interrogation.

221
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:22,540
I wanna talk to him.

222
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:24,703
He's dead, Hex.

223
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,906
Yeah, I'll have a word with him
all the same.

224
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:43,865
How you doing there?

225
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,995
- What's happening to me?
- Afraid you're dead, friend.

226
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:48,534
How can you speak to me?

227
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:51,832
Well, it's kind of a knack I picked up
when I near died myself.

228
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:58,844
I can make it stop.

229
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:01,950
Just need to get some information first.

230
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:05,177
You see, what I done to you is unnatural.

231
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:09,484
I keep you out of the ground too long,
you're likely to just burn right on up.

232
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:13,861
And it seems like the fresher dead you are,
the quicker it happens.

233
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:17,029
Being dead, you can see
the comings and goings...

234
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:19,394
...of anyone you knew
when you was alive.

235
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:20,660
What do you want?

236
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,533
I'm looking for Quentin Turnbull.

237
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:25,506
Never knew Turnbull.

238
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,472
- Who recruited you?
- Make the pain stop.

239
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:31,010
- Who?
- Make the pain stop.

240
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:34,173
Who?

241
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:38,719
- Slocum.
- What?

242
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:41,355
<i>Royal Slocum.</i>

243
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,721
- Where?
- Runs a fight tent.

244
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:48,226
Down in South Carolina.

245
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:04,870
Dirt likes dead, dead likes dirt.

246
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,912
Simple as that.

247
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,843
Hey, wait.

248
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:13,989
What is that sound?

249
00:25:14,156 --> 00:25:16,317
Oh, them?

250
00:25:16,492 --> 00:25:19,518
Them's likely hellhounds.

251
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:22,823
Reckon they smell fresh meat.

252
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:25,466
Waiting for you for when I let you go,
no doubt.

253
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:27,795
No. No.

254
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,200
I wouldn't try to pet them if I was you.

255
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:37,076
I'm headed southeast.

256
00:25:37,513 --> 00:25:40,414
- Thirty seconds with a dead man and...
- Ask him yourself.

257
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:43,000
Mr. Turnbull, sir.

258
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:45,572
I'm not sure I can deliver
what you're asking.

259
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:51,185
The reason I'm sure you'll provide what
I'm requesting is because it profits you.

260
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:54,117
And, son, you're no more capable
of turning down a profit...

261
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:56,587
...than a maggot is
of turning down a carcass.

262
00:26:56,758 --> 00:27:02,287
Don't worry. You're free to continue your
double-dealing in the Capitol backrooms...

263
00:27:02,464 --> 00:27:05,991
...over fine cigars and 200-year-old malt.

264
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,971
But you'll continue to do
what I ask of you.

265
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:11,902
Mr. Turnbull...

266
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:15,899
...I've given you the routes
for every top-secret shipment...

267
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:17,545
...location of the plans...

268
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:19,977
...but this, sir, I really...

269
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:25,019
The hour is approaching.

270
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:28,884
Make no mistake, this country
will not see its second century.

271
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:32,091
And when America is in flames...

272
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:34,923
...you will be glad that you chose wisely.

273
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:43,231
<i>You will tell me where the trigger devices
for that weapon are hidden.</i>

274
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,086
Pretty orange balls.

275
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,121
Don't seem like much.

276
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:11,624
Aye, but they'll turn the world
to dust all the same.

277
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,028
Marvelous.

278
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:15,568
Take them, boys. But be careful.

279
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,929
Wouldn't want to drop them.

280
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:27,540
Grab that fella.

281
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:35,221
- Casualties?
- The soldiers are all dead.

282
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,290
- What is this?
- Oh, we found this one...

283
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:39,620
...with shoulder boards on his coat.

284
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,861
Please. Let the innocents go.

285
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,833
There are no innocents.

286
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:10,318
You're gonna need to
check that iron, mister.

287
00:29:16,431 --> 00:29:17,625
All right!

288
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,702
This is what y'all been waiting for,
you degenerate bastards!

289
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:27,266
In this corner, the Barbarian.

290
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:31,173
And in this corner,
from halfway across the world:

291
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:32,745
The Snake-Man.

292
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:36,448
- Feed him the rattlesnake venom.
That one! That's the one!

293
00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:48,528
- Nice pastime you got here, colonel.
- Hex.

294
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:51,961
Come on, come on, come on.

295
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:55,365
- Yeah!
- Go on.

296
00:29:56,238 --> 00:29:58,035
Get it done already.

297
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:02,570
You don't mean to kill me.

298
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:06,077
I haven't made up my mind.
Let's see how this little visit goes.

299
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:14,853
I'm looking for Turnbull.

300
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,857
Shit, Turnbull's dead.
You know that good as anyone.

301
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,359
The government said
he didn't burn in no fire.

302
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:26,063
You're chasing ghosts.
You should let this go.

303
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,463
You put your best friend in the grave.

304
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,072
You betrayed your regiment.

305
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:36,036
For what? Honor?

306
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:39,874
There's no honor in war.
War is killing, simple as that.

307
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:45,078
This country could've been ours.

308
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:46,686
Those days are long passed.

309
00:30:51,493 --> 00:30:53,324
What if I told you it's not too late?

310
00:30:53,495 --> 00:30:56,953
That we could still bring
this unholy union of states to its knees.

311
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:01,931
Don't you want a second chance?

312
00:31:03,872 --> 00:31:05,635
All right.

313
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:08,371
I've decided I am gonna kill you.

314
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:12,778
I kind of thought that might be
your sentiments on the matter.

315
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,645
Boys.

316
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:19,085
Toss him in.

317
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,121
Slocum...

318
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:28,753
...where's Turnbull?

319
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,296
Why don't you ask your dead friend Jeb?

320
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:35,095
- I reckon you can catch up
with him in hell. - You know, colonel...

321
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:39,405
What a mighty good idea.

322
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:55,856
Get him in there!
Get in there, you mutt!

323
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,987
- Get him in the cage!
You boys want a fair fight?

324
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:06,057
They're just jealous
of your good looks, boy.

325
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,439
Suit yourself.

326
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:47,541
Can't say I blame you.

327
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,424
Son of a...

328
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,807
God, you are such an asshole.

329
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,948
Good to see you again too, Jeb.

330
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,675
If I let you up, you promise
you won't punch me again?

331
00:34:37,152 --> 00:34:39,916
Well, seems like a losing proposition
if I don't.

332
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:41,316
I want your word, Jeb.

333
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:44,947
- What makes you think that's any good?
- It was always good enough for me.

334
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,754
Go on, then.

335
00:34:47,495 --> 00:34:49,156
All right.

336
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,627
I need your help, Jeb.

337
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:01,003
- You're kidding me, right? This is a joke.
- No.

338
00:35:01,176 --> 00:35:03,838
- You killed me, Jonah.
- You drew on me, Jeb.

339
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:05,946
Yeah, well, that was a mistake.

340
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:09,311
Well, obviously.

341
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:14,551
- You disobeyed a direct order.
- To burn down a hospital.

342
00:35:14,923 --> 00:35:18,689
Your father was gonna murder
them people just to make a point.

343
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,720
I couldn't stand for that.
I'm surprised that you could.

344
00:35:21,896 --> 00:35:24,228
He was our commanding officer.
He was my father.

345
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,066
I didn't have a choice.

346
00:35:26,468 --> 00:35:28,459
Neither did I.

347
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:34,768
I'm sorry about it.

348
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:38,201
Killing you, I mean.

349
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:42,276
I never did expect things
would turn out that way.

350
00:35:43,385 --> 00:35:46,582
He took my family in your name, Jeb.

351
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:51,359
He made me watch them die.

352
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:56,261
I gotta find him, Jeb.

353
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:59,533
I been watching you...

354
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,135
...and I been watching him.

355
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:05,638
It's getting real hard to tell
the difference between you two.

356
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:08,799
- Your father is a monster, you hear me?
- And you ain't?

357
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:13,113
From where I sit...

358
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:18,309
...you're just two men bent on murdering
folks to make your own pain go away.

359
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:22,787
Living life like that, that sounds
a hell of a lot like being damned.

360
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:27,023
You know what he's capable of.

361
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:31,792
Oh, Jonah.

362
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:34,665
- He's at Fort Resurrection.
- Yeah?

363
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:35,996
He's holed up there.

364
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:40,429
I guess you two can probably
have it out once and for all.

365
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:43,702
I gotta be honest with you,
I don't even know who I'm pulling for.

366
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:46,813
Either way, you'll have company soon.

367
00:36:47,348 --> 00:36:49,976
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

368
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:54,844
Hell. I'm starting to burn.

369
00:36:55,223 --> 00:36:58,192
I best be getting back underground.

370
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:03,587
Now, you listen to me.

371
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:07,899
They talk about you down here.
You do yourself a favor.

372
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:11,300
You stay ahead of death
as long as you can, you hear?

373
00:37:11,473 --> 00:37:14,135
Because they got plans for you.

374
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:15,333
Take care, Jeb.

375
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:21,205
See you soon.

376
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,798
He's never coming back for you.

377
00:37:42,504 --> 00:37:43,835
You don't know that.

378
00:37:44,005 --> 00:37:46,633
Who do you think told the government
he was in here?

379
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:49,040
You're gonna have to get out of my room.

380
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,646
You know, I bought you off
of old Jack Straw fair and legal.

381
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:55,348
I'm gonna do what I please.

382
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:00,547
I own you now.

383
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,687
Fool me once, dear.

384
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:24,569
Single-shot pistol, asshole.

385
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,877
And I ain't much for being owned.

386
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:33,615
Thank you, sir.

387
00:38:37,392 --> 00:38:39,087
How do you do?

388
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:47,259
You get uglier every time I see you.

389
00:38:50,405 --> 00:38:54,239
Lord, don't do that. You'll break
every mirror we got in stock. Come on.

390
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,843
Now, these work good.

391
00:39:01,516 --> 00:39:03,279
You got anything new, Smith?

392
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:05,118
Thought you'd never ask.

393
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:10,751
Wow.

394
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:13,857
I take it that means you approve.

395
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:19,164
Big plans for the Fourth?

396
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,866
Just another day of the week is all it is.

397
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:27,368
Jonah, you and I both know the only
reason you fought for the South...

398
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:30,739
...is you ain't like being told
what to do by the government.

399
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:33,112
You ain't never believed in secessionism.

400
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:36,413
And you ain't never believed
in slavery neither.

401
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:40,577
So, what's the point
in hating the Union so much?

402
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:45,726
All of them on both sides is just a bunch
of hypocrites as far as I'm concerned.

403
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:48,725
America gonna be 100 years, Jonah.

404
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,894
A new nation.

405
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,190
And what's good in it?

406
00:39:53,368 --> 00:39:55,836
- The future, that's what.
- No.

407
00:39:56,204 --> 00:40:00,163
Me and my boys,
we gonna go on up there to Washington...

408
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:02,275
...and stand in a crowd of free men...

409
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:05,344
...men your color skin and mine,
and listen to the president.

410
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:08,971
The country can keep to its own business
and I'll keep to mine.

411
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:12,877
I'll take them both.

412
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:32,994
<i>Magnificent, isn't it?</i>

413
00:41:33,468 --> 00:41:36,028
It's bigger than a breadbox,
that's for sure.

414
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:38,069
Do you know who Eli Whitney was?

415
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:42,569
I'm a very undereducated man,
Mr. Turnbull.

416
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:44,837
Are we talking about
Whitney Senior or Junior?

417
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,345
Senior.

418
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:52,312
After he invented the cotton gin
and started the Industrial Revolution...

419
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:55,320
...he went to work for the U.S. Military,
special projects.

420
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,186
He pioneered the use
of component parts...

421
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:01,487
<i>...and firearms,
new combustibles for munitions...</i>

422
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:05,189
<i>...and more or less, he single-handedly
invented modern warfare.</i>

423
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:07,095
<i>So as an exercise...</i>

424
00:42:07,268 --> 00:42:11,398
<i>...they ask him to design
a super-weapon, a nation killer.</i>

425
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:15,132
<i>And this is what he envisaged,
but they never made it...</i>

426
00:42:15,309 --> 00:42:17,709
<i>...because once they
realized its potential...</i>

427
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:21,713
...they decided that they could not
fathom willfully visiting...

428
00:42:21,883 --> 00:42:25,580
<i>...that kind of devastation
on their fellow man.</i>

429
00:42:27,388 --> 00:42:28,412
But I can.

430
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,149
<i>And one week from now,
we will have succeeded where they failed.</i>

431
00:42:35,363 --> 00:42:36,694
<i>On the Fourth of July...</i>

432
00:42:37,899 --> 00:42:40,493
<i>...the United States of America...</i>

433
00:42:41,536 --> 00:42:43,868
...will know hell.

434
00:42:45,273 --> 00:42:46,570
Cheers.

435
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:17,098
Kill him.

436
00:43:55,276 --> 00:43:57,369
Thanks, Smith.

437
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:12,051
Open the gates for General Turnbull!

438
00:44:15,196 --> 00:44:16,220
Sorry, Jeb.

439
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:18,058
Hex.

440
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:23,101
Jonah-bloody-Hex.

441
00:44:23,638 --> 00:44:26,232
I'd know that
half-cooked pie-hole anywhere.

442
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:33,739
Looks like we got ourselves
some target practice, lads.

443
00:44:33,915 --> 00:44:35,849
Spread out.

444
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:10,407
Hey.

445
00:45:16,357 --> 00:45:19,326
Hold your fire! You'll blow us all to hell!

446
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:25,758
I'm gonna hand Turnbull
your balls in a snuffbox.

447
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:29,493
Look at you. Beautiful.

448
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:32,403
Come on, up you get. Come on, flower.

449
00:45:32,573 --> 00:45:34,006
Up.

450
00:45:34,175 --> 00:45:35,301
That's it. Good man.

451
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:50,083
Is that all you got?

452
00:45:50,258 --> 00:45:52,317
Really? Jonah Hex.

453
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,128
Jesus Christ, look at the state of you.

454
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:59,432
You ain't going anywhere, boy.

455
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:02,759
Don't worry, sweetheart, I'll be back.

456
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:11,502
Hex?

457
00:46:11,946 --> 00:46:13,937
Jonah Hex?

458
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:16,680
Oh, Hex!

459
00:46:17,952 --> 00:46:20,113
I'm coming for you!

460
00:46:21,255 --> 00:46:24,281
Hex!
Where are you, you bloody hooligan?

461
00:46:28,729 --> 00:46:30,356
Yeah.

462
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:34,400
Don't fuss.

463
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:35,694
Go on, step over.

464
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,201
Take me home. Get.

465
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,885
Explain this to me again, Burke.

466
00:46:55,056 --> 00:46:58,822
There is no explanation. I gave the bastard
two barrels straight in the chest.

467
00:46:58,993 --> 00:47:01,689
By all rights, he should be
as dead as Billy here.

468
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:05,559
Well, Hex doesn't know how to die.
He'll have to be educated.

469
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:07,394
I have no problem educating the man.

470
00:47:07,568 --> 00:47:10,765
So Jonah Hex is still alive.

471
00:47:10,938 --> 00:47:14,897
And somehow,
that son of a whore knows I am too.

472
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:18,477
Find me something he loves
and bring it to me.

473
00:47:18,646 --> 00:47:20,170
Well, then.

474
00:47:20,648 --> 00:47:26,211
I'll lure him to us and we'll lay his pretty
face to rot in some trench somewhere.

475
00:47:26,387 --> 00:47:28,014
Stuck as a white pig.

476
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:30,180
That would be desirable.

477
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:33,089
Gentlemen, this location's compromised.

478
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,626
Load the cream of it onto the train...

479
00:47:35,796 --> 00:47:37,058
...dynamite the rest.

480
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:40,792
I'll get the bastard. Either way.

481
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:27,206
<i>Some say when you're just about to die...</i>

482
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:30,709
<i>...you play out your unfinished business.</i>

483
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:40,517
<i>Even in death, vengeance is
the one thing you can't let go.</i>

484
00:48:53,707 --> 00:48:55,504
Hex.

485
00:48:55,676 --> 00:48:58,543
Guess there's not much left
to say between us.

486
00:49:48,295 --> 00:49:49,922
Fire.

487
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:14,181
See, one day with weapons like this,
you'll be able to flatten continents.

488
00:50:14,355 --> 00:50:18,382
But we gonna have to content
ourselves with starting small.

489
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:20,284
Ready, sir.

490
00:50:21,695 --> 00:50:23,595
Wait for it.

491
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:31,296
- Where?
- Just outside of Wayne County, Georgia.

492
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:34,270
- Casualties?
- Three hundred and twenty-four souls.

493
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,007
<i>Military targets?</i>

494
00:50:41,181 --> 00:50:43,274
<i>None, sir. All civilian.</i>

495
00:50:46,921 --> 00:50:48,115
Boys, get away from that.

496
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:49,483
- Look at that.
- What is it?

497
00:50:52,192 --> 00:50:54,456
What's your assessment of the situation?

498
00:50:54,628 --> 00:50:56,619
There are over 20
major centennial events.

499
00:50:57,898 --> 00:50:59,729
<i>The World's Fair in Philadelphia.</i>

500
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:02,627
The parade in New York.
Your speech here.

501
00:51:02,803 --> 00:51:03,997
Detonate the ordnance.

502
00:51:04,338 --> 00:51:07,466
We've increased military
presence, but due to his willingness...

503
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:12,010
...to strike civilian targets, it is impossible
to predict where he's going to attack.

504
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:28,019
I don't know
how we're gonna stop him, sir.

505
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:30,753
Lovely.

506
00:51:33,901 --> 00:51:35,892
<i>If I stepped in
Then she stepped out again</i>

507
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,662
<i>Learning to dance for Lanigan's ball</i>

508
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:41,365
<i>Six long years I spent in Dublin
Six long years doin' nothin' at all</i>

509
00:51:41,542 --> 00:51:45,342
<i>Six long years I spent in Dublin
Learning to dance for Lanigan's ball</i>

510
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:53,715
Hello there, little lamb.

511
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:00,387
Have you lost your flock?

512
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:03,191
I'm done working for the night.

513
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:14,330
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Just for a little fun, like.

514
00:52:18,045 --> 00:52:19,239
Nobody has to get hurt.

515
00:52:30,658 --> 00:52:32,888
Little flower, huh?

516
00:52:35,396 --> 00:52:36,624
Come on.

517
00:52:36,797 --> 00:52:38,355
Come on.

518
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:42,799
You're coming with me, girl.

519
00:54:06,172 --> 00:54:07,537
<i>This one's about a war hero.</i>

520
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:11,109
This one's about a war hero,
like you were.

521
00:54:11,277 --> 00:54:13,871
This man ain't near
as handsome as me.

522
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:16,173
And where's the brave little son, Travis?

523
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:20,341
As literary form, these things is useless.

524
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,889
Now, I can feel your brain rotting
right below my hand right as we speak.

525
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,960
Help! Jonah!

526
00:54:37,703 --> 00:54:40,604
You took everything I love, Jonah Hex.

527
00:54:40,773 --> 00:54:42,707
Do you know what that feels like?

528
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,910
It feels like this.

529
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,074
I want you to watch.

530
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:54,048
Help! Jonah!

531
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,815
No! No! No!

532
00:55:19,478 --> 00:55:20,502
Turnbull!

533
00:55:26,485 --> 00:55:29,147
Send a message to Grass, lieutenant,
U.S. Army.

534
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:32,855
<i>Located Turnbull. Stop.</i>

535
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:35,152
<i>Sailing out of Independence Harbor. Stop.</i>

536
00:55:35,328 --> 00:55:37,592
<i>Destination unknown. Stop.</i>

537
00:55:37,763 --> 00:55:40,698
Turnbull has constructed
nation-killer weapon. Stop.

538
00:55:45,471 --> 00:55:46,768
Going in alone.

539
00:55:46,939 --> 00:55:50,272
Send everything you got
or thousands will die. Stop.

540
00:56:44,563 --> 00:56:45,860
Whoa.

541
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:54,733
Keep him fed and watered.
Don't you tie him up.

542
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:57,205
If I don't come back for a spell,
he'll know it.

543
00:56:57,376 --> 00:56:58,843
He'll head out on his own way.

544
00:56:59,412 --> 00:57:01,175
He got a name?

545
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:03,443
Yeah.

546
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:05,780
Horse.

547
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:07,676
You.

548
00:57:10,923 --> 00:57:12,823
Yeah, I...

549
00:57:15,695 --> 00:57:17,856
I don't know what to say to you.

550
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:38,483
The hell you think you're going, mister?

551
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:42,884
What happened to your fa...?

552
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:48,715
I'm about all out
of wiseass answers, friend.

553
00:58:05,077 --> 00:58:10,014
Well, Mr. Turnbull, it appears the bells
are finally ready to toll on Washington.

554
00:58:10,182 --> 00:58:14,642
And I hear them, Mr. Lusk,
as I've heard them for six long years.

555
00:58:15,187 --> 00:58:19,453
We appreciate the services
that you have rendered to us.

556
00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:21,920
I can only hope you succeed.

557
00:58:22,094 --> 00:58:24,187
I'll most certainly hang if you don't...

558
00:58:24,363 --> 00:58:27,594
...an outcome I sincerely hope to avoid.

559
00:58:31,904 --> 00:58:34,031
Consider it avoided.

560
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:35,673
- Fire it up.
- Let's go!

561
00:58:36,142 --> 00:58:37,734
Fire up the engine!

562
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,378
Get ready to put her in the water!

563
00:58:46,852 --> 00:58:50,151
Looks good. Come on, let's go.
Check the engine room.

564
01:00:22,548 --> 01:00:25,073
You know you look like a right freak,
don't you?

565
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:29,813
Tell me, what's it like to go through life
with a face like that?

566
01:00:32,057 --> 01:00:33,217
Let me show you.

567
01:00:48,073 --> 01:00:49,870
This is for...

568
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:53,502
...my wife.

569
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:16,331
This is for my son!

570
01:01:25,544 --> 01:01:28,240
Turnbull! Turnbull! Turnbull!

571
01:01:28,547 --> 01:01:31,607
Turnbull! Turnbull! Turnbull!

572
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:37,478
Gentlemen...

573
01:01:38,324 --> 01:01:40,485
...tonight we put this ship in the water.

574
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:41,683
Yeah!

575
01:01:42,094 --> 01:01:46,690
And as we navigate the shoreline
of this precious and ruined land...

576
01:01:46,865 --> 01:01:49,891
...let us not forget that we sail...

577
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:51,866
...on an ocean of tears.

578
01:01:52,037 --> 01:01:53,504
And when we reach the Potomac...

579
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:57,665
...our enemy will learn that
we have arrived to do that thing...

580
01:01:57,843 --> 01:02:02,371
...which we most assuredly
were convened to do.

581
01:02:02,548 --> 01:02:05,142
- Yeah!
- To make war!

582
01:02:05,317 --> 01:02:06,682
Yeah!

583
01:02:07,753 --> 01:02:10,244
- The Capitol will burn!
- Yeah!

584
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,321
The battle is joined!

585
01:02:27,106 --> 01:02:30,234
Turnbull! Turnbull! Turnbull!

586
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:33,035
Hex.

587
01:02:37,516 --> 01:02:39,575
You know, Hex,
they say you have no heart.

588
01:02:39,752 --> 01:02:43,051
I think your problem may be
just the contrary, son.

589
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:44,913
You are soft.

590
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:47,689
You're incapable of sacrifice.

591
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:51,192
You wanna surrender or
you wanna watch another one die?

592
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:58,927
That's a good boy.

593
01:03:03,709 --> 01:03:05,734
Once a coward, always a coward.

594
01:03:07,413 --> 01:03:09,074
Jeb says hi.

595
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:11,273
No. I want him to watch.

596
01:03:29,034 --> 01:03:30,865
Three minutes till we're in range, sir.

597
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:46,183
Our country was new...

598
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,150
Four thousand yards to target.

599
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,335
- You still got that Derringer
in your bustle? - No, he took it.

600
01:04:04,503 --> 01:04:06,767
- What about that knife in your garter?
- Took it.

601
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:09,403
- What about that...?
- Took it all, Jonah.

602
01:04:09,575 --> 01:04:12,510
Well, searched you pretty darn good,
didn't they?

603
01:04:12,678 --> 01:04:14,976
- Wouldn't you?
- Yeah.

604
01:04:15,147 --> 01:04:17,047
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

605
01:04:17,216 --> 01:04:19,514
You shout for the guard,
get him over here...

606
01:04:19,685 --> 01:04:22,518
...and use your feminine wiles
and whatnot.

607
01:04:22,688 --> 01:04:24,781
When he gets close...

608
01:04:25,824 --> 01:04:29,521
- What the hell?
- Tallula Black's mama didn't raise no fool.

609
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,721
- Tallula?
- Lilah's a nickname.

610
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:35,526
Tallula.

611
01:04:36,702 --> 01:04:37,726
Tallula.

612
01:04:37,903 --> 01:04:41,100
Two thousand yards to target, sir.

613
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,834
Yankee cutter, downriver.

614
01:04:45,377 --> 01:04:47,641
You are now all in the custody
of the military...

615
01:04:47,813 --> 01:04:49,974
...of the United States of America.

616
01:04:50,149 --> 01:04:51,980
You will all be charged with treason.

617
01:04:52,317 --> 01:04:54,046
Quentin Turnbull...

618
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:55,982
...you can show your face first.

619
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,382
Arm the weapon.

620
01:05:20,746 --> 01:05:22,611
Fire at will.

621
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:27,378
Lieutenant.

622
01:05:32,824 --> 01:05:34,086
Detonate.

623
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,766
Full steam ahead.

624
01:05:56,848 --> 01:05:58,816
Can you shoot?

625
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:00,548
Can you?

626
01:06:18,036 --> 01:06:19,970
Get to that gunner. I got you covered.

627
01:07:24,603 --> 01:07:26,230
Target is in range!

628
01:07:35,914 --> 01:07:37,176
Fire 50 rounds!

629
01:08:31,036 --> 01:08:32,401
Detonate the ordnance!

630
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:40,874
<i>You're gonna go free.</i>

631
01:08:41,213 --> 01:08:44,182
<i>Free to walk this earth
with a mark on your flesh.</i>

632
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:47,750
<i>And every day,
that mark will remind you...</i>

633
01:08:47,919 --> 01:08:51,446
<i>...of the man
who took everything you had.</i>

634
01:08:55,961 --> 01:08:57,326
Help! Jonah!

635
01:09:10,909 --> 01:09:13,639
No! No!

636
01:10:02,894 --> 01:10:03,986
I want you to watch.

637
01:10:04,563 --> 01:10:06,690
Watch this.

638
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:53,834
Happy Fourth of July.

639
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,227
Your reward.

640
01:11:20,138 --> 01:11:21,469
And full pardon.

641
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:25,972
And I'd also like you to consider this.

642
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:32,474
America needs a sheriff.

643
01:11:37,622 --> 01:11:41,820
I don't think countries
have sheriffs, exactly.

644
01:11:42,928 --> 01:11:44,555
Sir.

645
01:11:49,267 --> 01:11:52,031
Though if you get yourself into a jam...

646
01:11:52,203 --> 01:11:54,103
...I imagine you can find me.

647
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:06,681
He offer you a job?

648
01:12:07,752 --> 01:12:09,652
- Yep.
- You take it?

649
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:14,020
No. I'm not big on having a boss.

650
01:12:28,406 --> 01:12:30,340
Sorry about it, Jeb.

651
01:12:58,136 --> 01:13:02,436
<i>They say a man with vengeance
in his heart is supposed to dig two graves:</i>

652
01:13:02,607 --> 01:13:06,441
<i>One for his enemy and one for himself.</i>

653
01:13:06,611 --> 01:13:09,910
<i>Well, I guess mine will just have to wait.</i>
