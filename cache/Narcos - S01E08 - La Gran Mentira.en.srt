[Gustavo] There's no respect.
I couldn't even grab the cigarettes.

4
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:28,180
I'm gonna shoot every fucking hostage
in the head. That's right.

5
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:29,472
Who's doing this?

6
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:32,267
Carrillo and Search Bloc,
I'm sure of it.

7
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:36,021
- In the middle of our negotiations?
- Either Gaviria is trying to catch me...

...or Carrillo doesn't give a shit
about the negotiations.

11
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:49,284
You know what we have to do, Pablo.
We have to close the deal fast...

12
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,619
before they find us and kill us.

13
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:57,042
Not before we build our own jail.

14
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:02,672
And that fucking pussy president
will have to agree to that,

15
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:05,633
even if I have to stick a bomb up his ass.

16
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:09,637
It's so fucking cold.
Is there a jacket there for me?

17
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:12,140
- Check it out, fag.
- What's up?

18
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:17,770
It's a miniskirt with your name on it.

19
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:20,148
- "Gustavo Gaviria."
- Give me that.

[dialing satellite phone]

All right, let's call the boys.

22
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:33,203
And what about you?
Are you all right?

23
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:36,081
If Gaviria'd let us put US boots
on the ground,

24
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,291
we would've caught the son of a bitch
in five minutes.

25
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,502
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Escobar is a lot smarter than he looks.

26
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:43,671
- Oh, shit.
- [man on radio] Hold on, hold on!

27
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:46,549
We picked up a signal in the woods
surrounding the target area.

[Pablo in Spanish]
OK, boys, we're in the clear.

29
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,430
Pick us up at El Mariano pass.

30
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:55,141
- [man] We got new Escobar coordinates.
- Smarter than he looks, huh?

31
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:56,851
Yeah, don't count your chickens just yet.

Again.

47
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,654
- Shh.
- You hear what I said?

48
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:17,950
[Connie whispers] Come on.

49
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:22,914
Yeah, I'm a little preoccupied, Steve.

50
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:25,333
- I think she's got colic.
- [sighs]

51
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:27,460
What is that?

52
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:30,796
Well, it means she can't sleep,
which means neither can I.

53
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:35,051
Did you call the orphanages?

54
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:38,679
You think I could explain the situation
in English, let alone Spanish?

55
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:41,766
I still don't understand
why you brought her back here.

56
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,476
Well, let's take her to a hospital.

57
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:47,647
No, Steve, we can't just take her to
a hospital. It's not like a puppy shelter.

58
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,067
Look, I know you're busy, but we've gotta
figure out what we're gonna do with her.

59
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:52,611
There's a war going on, Connie.

You said it was only
gonna be for a couple of days.

61
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:58,157
It's already been a week.
What are we doing here?

62
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:02,912
- Is that my t-shirt?
- We're out of diapers.

63
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:06,416
Why don't you go get some more before

00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,307
[in Spanish] How nice to see
that you have made friends.

66
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:26,311
Careful, son.
This woman is very clever.

67
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:29,355
She can grab your gun
and shoot you in the head.

68

71
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:49,709
As well as one might expect.

72
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:53,505
I need you to record another tape for me.

73
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:56,675
No.

74
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,303
No, not until you free more hostages.

00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:05,475
Maruja is very ill.
Ricardo has an ulcer.

76

I'm the only one you need to negotiate.

77
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:11,981
Then why does the Colombian government
keep trying to capture me?

78
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,485
Look...

79
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,156
I admire your bravery very much.

80
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:26,120
But Gaviria is a piece of shit, and,
with all due respect, so is your father.

81
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:28,080
And what did you expect?

82
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:31,167
To get into Congress
like it was nothing?

83
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:35,421
Without it mattering that you,
in fact, traffic drugs?

84
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:39,342
I expected respect.

85
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:45,014
You had respect
when you built homes for the poor.

86
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:50,895
But when you didn't get that respect
from a herd of egocentric bureaucrats,

87
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,731
you threw a tantrum.

88
00:06:55,983 --> 00:07:00,613
I was going to do marvelous things
for this country.

89
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,579
If I have made myself into a monster,
like all of you say,

90
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:11,416
that is the fault of people
like your father...

91
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,377
and those politicians "of always."

92
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,714
Those oligarchs and those people

93
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:21,801
were never going to tolerate
that little paisa from Medellín

94
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:27,724
who had more money
and was more intelligent than all of them.

95
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,685
Yes.

96
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:34,397
You would have done marvelous things.

97
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:37,776
And that is the saddest part.

98
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:44,449
Mr. Escobar has promised
to free two more hostages.

99
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:49,829
But in exchange, he has asked that you
continue negotiations with transparency.

100
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:54,709
President Gaviria...
he knows what you are doing.

101
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:57,128
He knows.

102
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:01,549
If you insist on trying to capture him
with the help of the Americans...

103
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:05,804
they're going to kill us all.

104
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:13,352
You are risking my daughter's life!

105
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:16,897
No, Nydia, with all due respect,
we are not risking anyone's life.

106
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:20,777
Our priority is the life of your daughter
and the lives of the rest of the hostages.

107
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:24,489
But our priority
is also to capture Escobar.

108
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:27,158
You cannot have both things at once.

109
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:30,328
Negotiate with Escobar
while trying to capture him?

110
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:33,038
Do you know what he is demanding?

111
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:39,378
That we call a constitutional referendum
to abolish extradition.

112
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:44,759
That he only plead guilty
to having trafficked drugs one time.

113
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:48,387
And worst of all,
he wants to build his own jail

114
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:51,850
and have his own guards
to watch over him.

115
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,310
This is a deal with the devil.

116
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,857
You are the president of a country
that became a living hell some time ago.

117
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:02,276
With whom else did you expect
to be making a deal?

118
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:07,365
[Steve] Gaviria could easier
cut a hundred deals with the devil

119
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,701
before he could cut one with Pablo.

120
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:13,412
Bowing to Pablo's demands
was political suicide.

121
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:17,333
So, he did what politicians do best:
he stalled.

122
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,961
He kept our planes in the air
and prayed to God that we got a hit.

123
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:22,672
[in Spanish] Hello. It's Gorilla.

125
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:30,930

not the hit that we were hoping for.

126
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:35,059
[in Spanish]
Forgive me, Gorilla, I don't feel well.

127
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,146
Miss Diana...

128
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,983
why are you so unpleasant with the boss?

129
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:47,780
You are loyal like a sheep,
aren't you?

130
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:55,747
That man is your kidnapper... and mine,
and that of the whole nation.

131
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,415
Here, you go first.

00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:32,658
Hide in here, quickly!

135
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:59,685
[Steve] Who would've thought a failed raid
would result in Escobar's biggest victory?

136
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:03,689
Pablo didn't even have
to pull the trigger. We did it for him.

137
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:07,234
[Carrillo in English]
Guys, we have a problem.

138
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:14,784
[Steve] For the battle-fatigued
citizens of Colombia,

139
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:17,620
Diana's death was the final straw.

140
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:20,080
This wasn't just an oligarch dying.

141
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:24,627
Her presence on the nation's TV screens
and in their homes transcended class.

142
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:27,755
The people were devastated.

143
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,634
For President Gaviria,
there was little room left to move.

144
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:34,762
[speaks indistinctly in Spanish]

145
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,973
[Nydia] Mr. President!

146
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:38,724
You killed my daughter.

147
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,226
Let her pass.

148
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:42,937
Wait...

149
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,233
If you had accepted his terms,
my daughter would still be alive!

150
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,656
Give him whatever he wants.

151
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:57,409
Don't let others go through the suffering
we've had to endure.

152
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:00,038
Mr. President... we need to leave.

153
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:08,754
God be with you, Nydia.

154
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,271
[sighs]

155
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:29,358
There's something
I want to make very clear.

156
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:34,488
You are not to blame for Diana's death.
OK? That has to be clear.

157
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:39,035
Escobar has the resources
for this to go on forever.

158
00:12:39,118 --> 00:12:40,786
Yes, and so do we.

159
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,496
We are the state.

160
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,417
We are going to fight, do whatever we have
to do, and we are going to finish him.

161
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,087
We have options.

162
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:53,049
For instance, why don't we allow
the American military to come in?

163
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:56,969
I know-- We don't like it.
I personally don't like it.

164
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,847
But if it's a specific, clear mission--

165
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:01,140
- No.
- Something covert.

166
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,349
No!

167
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:09,148
It's time to end all of this.

168
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,863
Give Escobar what he wants.

169
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,618
[Eduardo] Let's go.

170
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:36,383
[Javier in English] If your Congress
abolishes extradition, we lose our teeth.

171
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:39,344
- We're a paper fucking tiger!
- Everything we have done is lost.

172
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,139
[Eduardo] We have no choice.

173
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:45,143
The people, the public... it's tired
of all these bombs and bloodshed!

174
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,769
Right, and business goes as usual,

175
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:49,105
- he just runs it from that jail.
- Exactly!

176
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:52,817
All things considered,
it's a victory to put Escobar in jail.

177
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:55,611
For public relations?

178
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,446
It's capitulation.

179
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,699
You want Escobar.

180
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,534
Why?

181
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,454
Why?

182
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:10,542
Because you want to parade him
in your DEA jackets?

183
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:12,628
You think this is a game, right?

184
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:16,048
This is Colombia,
and our people want peace!

185
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:18,300
This is not a fucking game!

186
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:29,645
[in Spanish] Well...
at this time, our friend, Fernando,

187
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:32,481
is going to tell us a little something.

188
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:34,608
[clears throat]

189
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:38,737
The Colombian government is going
to allow Pablo to turn himself in,

190
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:44,785
accepting only one simple charge:
drug trafficking.

191
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:46,996
And...

192
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:49,373
they are going to let him build a jail

193
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:55,420
which the police
cannot be within three kilometers of.

194
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:58,924
At last...
we have liberated ourselves from tyranny!

195
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:02,344
- Long live Colombia, motherfuckers.
- ¡Viva!

196
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:05,014
- Fernando...
- Mm?

197
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:09,185
- ...thank you very much.
- No problem, Pablo.

198
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:14,023
And do you know when Congress
is going to vote to abolish extradition?

199
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:19,111
Mm! Yes, it's--
It's a matter of... of weeks.

200
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:22,990
And at that time, you will be able
to turn yourself over to the authorities.

201
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:26,577
It pleases me very much to finish my work
with you with such a great victory.

202
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,831
No, brother. Now is when I am
going to need your services the most.

203
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:37,588
- How-- How's that?
- Fernando...

204
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:45,263
now it's time for us to find legal means
to reduce my sentence even more.

205
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:50,768
Right?

206
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,270
[chuckles]

207
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,647
[sighs]

208
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:14,959
And what does this mean for us, huh?

209
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:21,132
It means, my love...
that now I have a jail.

210
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:28,222
And for you,
visiting days will be...

211
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:31,934
- every day.
- [laughs]

212
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:34,603
- I'm serious, Pablo.
- So am I.

213
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:39,691
[sighs]
The problem, Pablo, is that...

214
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:43,195
now that you have admitted
to trafficking in narcotics,

215
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,824
my image as a journalist
cannot be associated with yours.

216
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,370
[Pablo] Hm.

217
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,040
So then...

218
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:04,424
now you think I am going to damage your
credibility as a journalist... is that it?

219
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,679
You understand what I'm saying.

220
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,723
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course I do.

221
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:19,357
I think that... it's time for me

222
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,404
to set you free, so that...
you can find a boyfriend who's honest...

223
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:31,743
so that you can get a little house,
have little kids,

224
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,163
- little dogs...
- Don't joke around, Pablo.

225
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:36,207
No, I'm not joking.

226
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,086
[softly] I just want you to know...

227
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,589
that you, Valeria...

228
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:49,136
are a bandit, just like me.

229
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:56,435
So don't come to me with bullshit.

230
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:15,287
Looks like you got away with it,
eh, asshole?

231
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:26,090
Shit, I'd thought you'd gone crazy.

232
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:38,518
Geniuses...
are always branded as crazy.

233
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:41,439
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

234
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,529
- The Ochoas...
- The Ochoas what?

235
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:53,533
You can bet
they're going to be pissed off.

236
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:55,494
Because of the treaty?

237
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,539
Or because you're fucking their sister?

238
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,055
That was a stupid mistake, Gustavo.

239
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:24,273
Let's hope they don't
charge you for it later.

240
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:26,608
[Steve] The race was on.

241
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:30,321
Pablo needed to build his jail
as fast as possible.

242
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:34,616
As for his enemies, they needed
to get to him before that happened.

243
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:38,287
As soon as he walked inside,
Pablo would be safe.

244
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,998
And everyone on the outside wouldn't.

245
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:45,252
[in English] We got an official cease
and desist order for any further operation

246
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:47,587
when Pablo officially surrenders.

247
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,049
- Search Bloc is gonna be disbanded.
- [Javier] We heard the terms.

248
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:54,594
- No cops within two miles of the prison.
- This is a fucking sham.

249
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:56,972
It's a death warrant for my men.

250
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:00,309
I won't be able to protect them.

251
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:03,979
I won't let that happen.

252
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:10,569
There are cops that hate Escobar
just as much as I do.

253
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,113
More.

254
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:17,451
They're not gonna stop
just because they're told to.

255
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,829
You talking about vigilantes?

256
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,834
Call it what you like... but I'm still
gonna need those intel reports.

257
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:28,753
- We'll get you anything we find.
- Javi, you gotta cool it with that shit.

258
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:31,507
They know we've been helping.
One more and we're out.

259
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:33,384
I thought you said you were all in.

260
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,845
[in Spanish]
The soccer field will be over here.

261
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:43,060
Here, I want to have
a little doll house for Manuela,

262
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:48,566
and downstairs,
a bar with a Jacuzzi for the guys.

263
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,193
My family will live in a house
down the hill.

264
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:55,447
I'm going to install a telescope
so I can look at them whenever I want.

265
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,492
Yeah, right. More like
you can look at other girls' asses.

266
00:20:58,576 --> 00:21:03,455
No. The family, the family.
To see my kids.

267
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:08,752
- What can we do to help you, Pablo?
- Well...

268
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,963
while we're in prison,
Gustavo and me,

269
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:17,886
I will count on you, Moncada, and you,
Galeano, to oversee operations.

270
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:21,223
Thank you, Pablo.

271
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:26,478
We're privileged to be given
that responsibility. You can count on us.

272
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:30,274
We've already spoken about the operational
plan and everything's clear, right?

273
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,484
Yes. We won't let you down, Pablo.

274
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,819
Did you tell them about the tax?

275
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,282
- No, I didn't.
- The tax?

276
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,325
What tax is this?

277
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,829
Who paid for the war we fought?

278
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:46,415
You.

279
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:51,545
- You, Don Pablo.
- That's right.

280
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:55,466
We have peace now.

281
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:59,219
You're going to directly
benefit from that.

282
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,601
It's only fair that you contribute
to the legal and security costs

283
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:08,437
that Gustavo and I will face behind bars.

284
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:12,149
And about how much will that be?

285
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:16,861
We agreed to what,
$200,000 a month, right?

286
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,114
Yes, 200 grand.

287
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:21,450
200 grand?

288
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:25,454
That's a lot of money, brother.
A lot of money.

289
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:27,414
But consider it done.

290
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:31,793
And again... thank you
very much for this responsibility,

291
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,379
- and for considering us.
- All right, then.

292
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,216
- Don Pablo. All right. Gustavo.
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

293
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:49,894
Do you think that was a smart move, Pablo?

294
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:53,857
Why should I let them
reap the fruits of our labor

295
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,776
without compensating us for it, Gustavo?

296
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,531
I agree with you.

297
00:23:01,823 --> 00:23:05,952
But right now, we really
need those two fags to be loyal.

298
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:09,206
And what?
You don't think I inspire loyalty?

299
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:12,668
My loyalty?
Yes, you know you have it.

300
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:14,878
But I'm not sure about everyone else's.

301
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,591
You know, the thing is, Pablo...
you won.

302
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:21,968
There's no arguing that.

303
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,887
But you gave in.

304
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,558
And there are people
who will see that as weakness.

305
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:32,563
We've gotta keep our enemies close,
now more than ever.

306
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,527
- [waiter murmurs in Spanish]
- [Valeria] Thank you.

307
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:43,532
It's great to see you again, Valeria.

308
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:48,203
Likewise, Pacho.
I'm very happy to see you.

309
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:52,666
Although, I must say...
it was a little unexpected.

310
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,294
We are worried about you.

311
00:23:57,128 --> 00:24:00,465
And... why are "we" worried?

312
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:03,885
Pablo's cutting a deal
with the government.

313
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:05,929
He's going to have
to admit to certain things.

314
00:24:06,137 --> 00:24:10,392
Things that may damage
your reputation by association.

315
00:24:12,894 --> 00:24:18,149
If I'm good at anything,
it's protecting my reputation.

316
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:21,319
Listen, this time it's different.

317
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:27,785
Look... you helped create
that "Robin Hood Paisa" bullshit.

318
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:32,456
And when it all goes to shit, you'll have
to take responsibility for that.

319
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,417
Maybe he tricked me, too.
Like the rest of the world.

320
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:37,586
You have enemies, see?

321
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:39,546
They're not gonna
let you get away with it.

322
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:42,758
Look, Valeria...

323
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:48,430
we have a lot of connections in New York,
a strong presence, you could say.

324
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:51,725
You should go there,
at least for a little while.

325
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:53,184
And leave Colombia.

326
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:56,438
There are a million Colombians there.

327
00:24:56,521 --> 00:24:59,274
A new audience.

328
00:24:59,357 --> 00:25:02,402
And they don't care if you shared your bed
with a monster or not.

329
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:08,617
- [sighs]
- Just for a while.

330
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,787
When this is all over, you'll be able to
come back here with your head held high,

331
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:13,955
I guarantee it.

332
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:19,961
And not only that, you'll have earned
a brand-new audience in the United States.

333
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,925
- Betrayal is not my style.
- What betrayal?

334
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,762
And what would you be betraying?

335
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,056
Your role as his mistress?

336
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:39,230
You remain loyal to a man who has never
thought you good enough to be his wife.

337
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:41,983
His wife? Me?

338
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:44,736
No, no, no,
you're very much mistaken, my dear.

339
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,780
The last thing I want
is to be married to him.

340
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:51,075
Besides...
do you think I'd want to be his wife?

341
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:57,582
Do you think I want to be locked up,
waiting all day at the Monaco building,

342
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:59,459
while he's out with...

343
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,129
with me?

344
00:26:04,923 --> 00:26:06,257
No.

345
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,386
That's too boring.

346
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:13,765
- [Tata moans]
- [Pablo grunting]

347
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:20,397
I missed you so much.

348
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:23,233
I missed you, too.

349
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:30,490
- [Pablo grunts]
- [moaning]

350
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:35,286
No, it was terrible.

351
00:26:36,204 --> 00:26:37,789
It was terrible.

352
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:40,584
Every day in a different house...

353
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:44,421
worried about you...

354
00:26:45,923 --> 00:26:47,507
the kids...

355
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:50,928
[sighs]

356
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:54,890
The truth is...

357
00:26:57,517 --> 00:27:00,395
it's very good to be home.

358
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:05,024
- You look happy.
- Of course.

359
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,194
[soft chuckle]

360
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:10,321
That time has passed.

361
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:15,953
It's the happiest face I've ever seen
on a man about to go to jail.

362
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,204
[explosion]

363
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:22,292
- [shouting outside]
- [alarm blaring]

364
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,711
The kids!
[screams] The kids, Pablo!

365
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:26,170
- The kids!
- No, Tata!

366
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:28,381
- I have to go to them!
- Stay here!

367
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:31,009
- [sobbing] My children!
- Stay here!

368
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:33,261
I'll go get them. Stay here.

369
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:34,930
- [Tata sobs]
- [alarm continues]

370
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:37,432
- Juan Pablo!
- [Manuela crying]

371
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:40,226
Juan Pablo!

372
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,186
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

373
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,563
Come on.

374
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:51,237
Go to your mother.
Go to your mother.

375
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,367
- [sobbing]
- Come on, come on.

376
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:59,120
[sirens wailing outside]

377
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:00,622
[crashing]

378
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:07,921
[Steve] The explosion was
from a car bomb on the street below,

379
00:28:08,005 --> 00:28:10,340
about 800 pounds' worth of dynamite.

380
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:13,217
It made little Manuela
forever deaf in one ear.

381
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:15,595
- [whispers in Spanish]
- [Steve] In this war,

382
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,389
the innocent always seemed
to be the ones who got hurt.

383
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:24,729
For Escobar, the Monaco bombing
told him two things:

384
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:30,151
First, it showed him that the cops
weren't his biggest problem.

385
00:28:31,653 --> 00:28:33,446
They would never use a bomb.

386
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:39,118
This was a new player, one that
wasn't above going after his family.

387
00:28:40,037 --> 00:28:42,039
[in Spanish] Don't worry, cousin.

388
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:46,376
We're going to kill them all.

389
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:51,756
[Steve] Second, and the one
that fucked with his head the most...

390
00:28:54,175 --> 00:29:00,390
was that for the first time in his life...
someone had given him up.

391
00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:05,645
And worse yet,
he had no idea who.

392
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:11,109
[phone ringing]

393
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:15,154
[in Spanish] Hello?

394
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:18,783
[man] Valeria, there was an attempted hit
at the Monaco building.

395
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:23,705
- Just now?
- Yes, a few minutes ago. A car bomb.

396
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:27,125
- Who was inside?
- We don't know.

397
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:30,336
[stammers]
What other information do you have?

398
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,381
That's all the information
we have right now.

399
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:35,216
OK, thanks.

400
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:02,326
[Fabio]
He always takes her to the same motel.

401
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,788
[approaching footsteps]

402
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,374
- Marina.
- Where are you going?

403
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,878
I'm going to the city.

404
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:14,172
I have to get out of this prison.

405
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:17,968
- Come here, Marina.
- Yes?

406
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:23,556
Have a good time.

407
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,475
Be safe.

408
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:27,894
Thanks.

409
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:34,525
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

410
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,740
You know what he's going to do, right?

411
00:30:40,824 --> 00:30:43,284
He's going to continue conducting
his business behind those walls

412
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:46,871
that are protected
by the Colombian government.

413
00:30:46,955 --> 00:30:49,833
We should give him credit.
The man is a genius.

414
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:53,962
Well... all the more reason
that we should negotiate our surrender.

415
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:57,507
But you know that Pablo
took it upon himself to close that door.

416
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,717
So we need to take advantage
of your political contacts,

417
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:02,386
especially General Jaramillo.

418
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:05,056
Can you talk to him for us?

419
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,558
Yes, of course.

420
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:10,228
But I don't think it will be enough.

421
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:11,604
[Jorge]
What are you saying?

422
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:14,858
That you're going
to have to offer something more,

423
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:18,695
something that interests them enough
to make a deal with you.

424
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:22,240
Gustavo Gaviria.

425
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:26,036
He is the key to Pablo's business.

426
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:28,412
If that son of a bitch goes down,
the whole empire goes down.

427
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:33,168
Indeed, that could work.

428
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:36,087
That could work.

429
00:31:39,257 --> 00:31:42,677
[Steve] It is often said
there is no honor among thieves.

430
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,429
That's doubly true of drug dealers.

431
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:49,226
The Ochoas, with the help of Cali,
made their own surrender deal.

432
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:52,395
No extradition, no stiff sentence.

433
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:56,149
The Colombian government
was willing to overlook their part

434
00:31:56,357 --> 00:32:00,695
in the largest cocaine empire
on the face of the earth.

435
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:03,240
Instead, they would
serve reduced sentences.

436
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,366
- The charge?
- [in Spanish] Follow me.

437
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:09,412
Illegally importing bulls from Spain.
I shit you not.

438
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:12,207
They went to jail
with smiles on their faces,

439
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,834
'cause all they had to do
was use their sister as bait

440
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:17,921
to catch a fish the cops actually wanted.

441
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:47,533
[Marina in Spanish] Kiss me.

442
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:08,138
- You look pretty, baby.
- Yeah, sure.

443
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:11,266
What I mean is
you've always looked pretty.

444
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:24,112
Gustavo.

445
00:33:29,117 --> 00:33:30,743
[Marina] What's happening?

446
00:33:31,702 --> 00:33:33,246
[Gustavo] Nothing.

447
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,167
Nothing is happening here.
Isn't that right, Colonel Carrillo?

448
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,127
That's up to you.

449
00:33:42,505 --> 00:33:45,508
- Say goodbye.
- [Marina] No.

450
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,885
No, no, no.
Gustavo, look at me. Gustav--

451
00:33:47,969 --> 00:33:49,720
Does your family know where you are?

452
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:51,514
- Gustavo!
- Calm down, Marina.

453
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:58,771
[Gustavo]
You're making a big mistake, Carrillo.

454
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,943
We're already in negotiations
with the government.

455
00:34:04,027 --> 00:34:07,364
- You have no reason to be doing this.
- You're right.

456
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,867
That's why I'm not here.

457
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:15,872
Then what the fuck do you want?

458
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:19,667
Don't act stupid.

459
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:24,797
Give me your cousin...
and I'll let you live.

460
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:31,721
[sighs]

461
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,264
All right.

462
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:37,352
Kill me, then, motherfucker.

463
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,397
I won't do that myself.

464
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:46,527
But I want to introduce you to some people
who would love to do it for me.

465
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:50,698
This guy? This is Lastia.

466
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:57,621
His sister died in a bookstore in Bogotá
in a bombing you coordinated.

467
00:34:57,705 --> 00:34:59,749
She was 17 years old.

468
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:02,668
And this guy here...

469
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:08,049
this is Trujillo.

470
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:14,722
You killed his father
and his brother for being cops.

471
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:19,769
- That has nothing to do with me.
- No?

472
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:26,859
You know...
if you support evil, you are evil.

473
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:29,737
Look at them.

474
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:32,323
I just want you to look at their faces.

475
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:35,659
A few of the victims
you've left in your wake.

476
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:38,413
Tell me...

477
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,876
have you ever felt
the swift vengeance of justice?

478
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:50,633
Give me your cousin...

479
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:54,387
or I'll let these men
show you that vengeance with their fists.

480
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:11,821
Do it, then...
you sons of bitches.

481
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:13,614
OK, then.

482
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:21,247
We'll see how you feel...
after ten minutes.

483
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,916
Do it.

484
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:27,628
[grunts]

485
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:32,509
- [heavy punches landing]
- [Gustavo grunts, groans]

486
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:45,480
[shaky exhale]

487
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:49,025
[wheezing]

488
00:36:50,193 --> 00:36:52,653
Tell me where your cousin is.

489
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:56,240
It doesn't have to end like this.

490
00:37:07,377 --> 00:37:08,878
[sputters]

491
00:37:11,422 --> 00:37:13,716
[coughing]

492
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:18,513
Tell me where your cousin is.

493
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:21,932
[panting]

494
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:26,270
We...

495
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,318
are bandits...
not snitches, motherfucker.

496
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:40,451
[Gustavo laughs]

497
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:53,506
[shouts] You're--
You're all gonna die, motherfuckers!

498
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,384
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

499
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:59,095
You're all dead, motherfuckers!

500
00:37:59,178 --> 00:38:05,142
You, your families,
your wives are all dead, motherfuckers!

501
00:38:05,226 --> 00:38:06,436
You're all dead!

502
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:13,443
Dump his body on the road to Sabaneta.

503
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:16,153
Colonel, they're going
to make us pay for this.

504
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:22,410
Report his death as a result
of a shoot-out with the police.

505
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:25,162
Make sure you report that he fired first.

506
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:27,331
But Colonel, he's all beat up.

507
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,006
That work for you?

508
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:53,983
There is nothing... more beautiful
and more important in my life than this.

509
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:59,155
We're all here together... united.

510
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:05,869
Now let's eat and enjoy
this marvelous food.

511
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:11,792
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, yeah, the beets.

512
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:14,253
- Tata?
- Boss?

513
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:18,591
Hello, son. Have a seat.

514
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:21,636
- Sit down--
- Boss, I don't know how to say this.

515
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,973
Tell me like a man.

516
00:39:27,141 --> 00:39:29,143
- Gustavo is dead.
- What?

517
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:35,816
They found his body on the outskirts
of Sabaneta, badly beaten.

518
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:37,818
[Hermilda] How's that?

519
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:39,445
They also shot him, boss.

520
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:42,657
No, no!
How dare you come to my house saying that!

521
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:45,868
How dare you!
Leave! Get out of my house!

522
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:49,664
You... you are leaving right now!
Get out of my house! Go on!

523
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:53,334
No! Gustavo, no. Pablo...
Go on! Get out of here!

524
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:57,714
[whispers] It's OK.
Everything's going to be fine.

525
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:00,007
[sobbing]

526
00:40:08,224 --> 00:40:10,226
Are you sure about this?

527
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:12,311
[softly] Yes, boss.

528
00:40:16,857 --> 00:40:19,360
I want you to take him
to the funeral home...

529
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:24,532
and guard his body the entire time
until it's buried.

530
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:27,326
- All right.
- Go on.

531
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,794
[door opens]

532
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:40,715
How are you doing, son?

533
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:20,296
I'm going to miss him so much, Mama.

534
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:26,927
When...

535
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:36,145
you were nine... or ten...
do you remember?

536
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:40,357
How you would
ride around on your bicycles.

537
00:41:41,275 --> 00:41:42,860
[chuckles]

538
00:41:43,986 --> 00:41:47,573
You'd go up into the mountains
and just disappear.

539
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:51,494
The whole day would go by...

540
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:55,247
Oh, my.

541
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:58,334
And we would call you...

542
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:04,465
We seemed crazy,
yelling for you all over the place...

543
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:10,137
until finally you would appear.

544
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:13,557
Oh, my God.

545
00:42:14,558 --> 00:42:16,769
"Where were you?"

546
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:21,064
"Where have you been, son?"
I would yell out.

547
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:25,152
"In the mountains, Mama."

548
00:42:26,236 --> 00:42:32,743
"Higher than the clouds, Auntie,"
Gustavo would say, laughing.

549
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:41,502
He...

550
00:42:41,585 --> 00:42:44,171
He always wanted to go farther.

551
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:49,552
He always did.

552
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:52,054
- But with you.
- [sighs]

553
00:42:53,013 --> 00:42:55,098
Only with you.

554
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,857
I didn't think it would end this way.

555
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:05,984
[breath trembling]

556
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,976
Good afternoon.

557
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,854
[low murmurs]

558
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:46,734
Boss? Someone came
all the way out here to see you.

559
00:43:50,237 --> 00:43:52,072
Miss Valeria.

560
00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:08,547
Good day, ma'am. Pablo.

561
00:44:09,423 --> 00:44:10,925
What's she doing here?

562
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:13,928
I'm here only because
I have important information.

563
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:15,471
I hope it's very important.

564
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:18,140
It's about Gustavo.

565
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:21,101
Tell us, then.

566
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,856
I've been told the Ochoa brothers
have been seen in Cali.

567
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,109
They are the ones
who turned Gustavo over,

568
00:44:29,192 --> 00:44:32,863
in exchange for the cartel helping them
seal a deal with the government.

569
00:44:32,947 --> 00:44:34,281
How do you know that?

570
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,951
You know me, Pablo.

571
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:39,703
I have my ways.

572
00:44:48,712 --> 00:44:51,048
Who in Cali?

573
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:54,969
Pacho Herrera.

574
00:44:57,763 --> 00:45:00,557
[Steve]
Pablo wanted to send a message to Cali,

575
00:45:00,641 --> 00:45:04,812
so he ordered his sicarios
to hit them during a soccer match.

576
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,231
- It was very effective.
- [overlapping gunfire]

577
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,822
He did get 14 Cali men that day.

578
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:19,117
The problem was, everyone on
the soccer field was dressed the same.

579
00:45:21,954 --> 00:45:23,080
[men grunting]

580
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:29,086
- [gun clicking]
- By the time the sicarios spotted Pacho,

581
00:45:29,169 --> 00:45:30,921
he was already running away.

582
00:45:32,006 --> 00:45:34,842
[somber Latin song playing]

583
00:45:34,925 --> 00:45:37,386
[priest in Spanish]
"Will you hide yourself forever, Lord?

584
00:45:38,595 --> 00:45:41,473
Will your wrath burn like fire?

585
00:45:41,557 --> 00:45:44,601
Remember how fleeting is my life,

586
00:45:44,685 --> 00:45:49,065
for what futility
you have created the children of men."

587
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:52,359
[Steve] Pablo had Gustavo
buried in the hills of Medellín,

588
00:45:52,442 --> 00:45:54,653
- where the cousins had played as kids.
- [sniffling]

589
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:56,363
In his mind,
losing his best friend

590
00:45:56,446 --> 00:45:59,950
was a price he had to pay
to defeat extradition.

591
00:46:00,034 --> 00:46:03,537
So he ordered the burial
to take place at the exact same time

592
00:46:03,746 --> 00:46:06,832
- that Congress was voting to repeal it.
- [inaudible dialogue]

593
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:11,378
Whether it was Gaviria's support,
Pablo's "plata or plomo,"

594
00:46:11,461 --> 00:46:14,048
or maybe people
were just sick of the violence...

595
00:46:14,256 --> 00:46:17,467
extradition was defeated by a landslide.

596
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:21,013
Hours after the vote,
a military helicopter

597
00:46:21,097 --> 00:46:24,141
was dispatched to coordinates
just outside Medellín,

598
00:46:24,224 --> 00:46:26,435
where Pablo was waiting.

599
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:40,824
[Eduardo in Spanish] As you know,
I come on behalf of President Gaviria

600
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:42,076
and the Colombian government.

601
00:46:42,284 --> 00:46:46,789
This is the offer of our terms
for your surrender.

602
00:46:46,997 --> 00:46:50,126
[Steve] Peña and I
had to go see it with our own eyes.

603
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:54,463
A terrorist, a drug dealer and a murderer
surrendering to a grateful nation

604
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:57,507
who gave him everything he asked for.

605
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:01,720
It was the closest we'd ever come to him,
and we never felt further away.

606
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:04,598
[Pablo in Spanish] All right, then.

607
00:47:07,101 --> 00:47:08,894
Let me hand over my gun.

608
00:47:12,815 --> 00:47:15,943
- You won.
- We both did.

609
00:47:17,444 --> 00:47:20,405
Now Gaviria can announce
that Pablo Escobar has turned himself in.

610
00:47:22,992 --> 00:47:24,785
Except that's not so true.

611
00:47:24,868 --> 00:47:27,121
You and I know it's a big lie.

612
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:28,956
Mm.

613
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:37,047
Lies are necessary... when the truth
is too difficult to believe. Right?

614
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:42,719
[Steve]
It wasn't a fucking surrender.

615
00:47:42,928 --> 00:47:45,722
Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.

616
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:51,436
He was escaping it.
And all anyone could do was watch.

617
00:47:57,275 --> 00:48:01,571
Once again, Escobar had used violence
to bend the world to his will.

618
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:06,785
They called it "la gran mentira,"
"the big lie."

619
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:09,079
And it was a lie.

620
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:14,710
Except as I watched him
fly away to his luxury prison...

621
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:18,380
I couldn't help but think
there was some truth in it.

622
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:20,841
[Steve mutters] Damn it. Fucker.

623
00:48:20,924 --> 00:48:23,719
A truth that I hadn't
been willing to accept.

624
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:31,018
He'd beat us because
he was willing to do what we weren't.

625
00:48:32,352 --> 00:48:34,437
Bad guys don't play by the rules.

626
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:37,066
That's what makes 'em bad.

627
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:40,527
Maybe that's what lets 'em win.

628
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,363
[Poison in Spanish] Lagarto,
are we gonna party tonight or what?

629
00:48:43,446 --> 00:48:46,950
[in English] I got Poison at 400
to 1700 megahertz, gentlemen.

630
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:49,119
La Dispensaria.

631
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,455
So who do we give this to? DEA?

632
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:55,959
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

633
00:48:56,043 --> 00:48:57,920
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

634
00:48:58,712 --> 00:49:01,882
[Steve] I made a promise to myself
that when the time came

635
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:04,218
that I could strike a blow
against Escobar,

636
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:07,387
even if it meant breaking the rules,
oh, I was gonna do it.

637
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,557
- Hello?
- [man] Hey, Central Spike here.

638
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:12,350
[Carrillo in Spanish] All right.

639
00:49:14,644 --> 00:49:17,439
[up-tempo Latin music playing]

640
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:20,609
[Steve] You wanna tell me a good guy
wouldn't have pushed the buttons

641
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:22,319
on these motherfuckers?

642
00:49:24,154 --> 00:49:26,364
You wanna call me a bad guy?

643
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:29,701
- [overlapping gunfire]
- [screaming]

644
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:38,168
Fine. But if you do, it just means
that you haven't met enough bad guys yet

645
00:49:38,252 --> 00:49:39,419
to know the difference.

646
00:49:40,963 --> 00:49:43,799
There's one thing I've learned
down here in Colombia,

647
00:49:43,882 --> 00:49:47,219
- good and bad are relative concepts.
- [up-tempo Latin song plays]

648
00:49:47,303 --> 00:49:50,347
? Yesterday, I fought the devil
Who they say is very brave ?

649
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:54,935
? I hacked him with my machete so bad
That even I got freaked out ?

650
00:49:55,018 --> 00:49:57,980
? I jumped back, dodging his attack ?

651
00:49:58,063 --> 00:50:02,609
? And in one fell swoop
I cut off his tail ?

652
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:04,653
