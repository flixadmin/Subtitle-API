1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,673
Last season on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,676 --> 00:00:04,304
We have the six totems,
but you can't fight

3
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:06,893
what you can't see. What
if the only way to kill

4
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:08,703
Mallus is to let him out?

5
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:13,018
- Guys, we did it!
- My father's Time Stone.

6
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:14,754
He died to give you a second chance.

7
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:16,362
Don't waste it.

8
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:21,195
Whose brilliant idea was
it to let an ancient demon

9
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:23,101
out of his bloody cage?

10
00:00:23,103 --> 00:00:25,437
Well, you opened a door, love,

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,273
and Mallus wasn't the
only thing that got out.

12
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:35,881
The newest musical sensation

13
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:37,316
to cross the Atlantic...

14
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:39,251
A group of young men from Liverpool

15
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:41,353
who call themselves the Beatles

16
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:44,556
have just arrived at JFK.

17
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:45,858
The Beatles.

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,960
That's B-E-A-T,

19
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:50,835
because that's the
way they keep the beat.

20
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,167
Hey, Z, if you had to sleep with one,

21
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:56,668
which one would it be?

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,904
How can you even tell them apart?

23
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:00,786
Well, Paul's the cute one,

24
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:03,442
George is the quiet
one, there's Ringo...

25
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:05,444
Never met an Englishman
I haven't wanted to

26
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:06,511
punch in the face.

27
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:07,390
Relax, Mick,

28
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:09,113
if it wasn't for the British Invasion,

29
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:10,625
there would be no Rolling Stones,

30
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:13,020
no Led Zep,

31
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:14,887
no Black Sabbath.

32
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:16,321
- Black Sabbath.
- Yup.

33
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,323
Well, then we... We need to protect

34
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:19,858
these mopheads from whatever's

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,894
- screwing up history.
- That's right, Mick.

36
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:24,575
So, Gideon sent us
on a wild goose chase.

37
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:26,231
This event in history is playing out

38
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,133
exactly as it should.

39
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,820
The British are coming!

40
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,605
The British are coming!

41
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:35,207
Interesting fact: the
real Paul Revere didn't

42
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,943
actually say... Oh, my
God, it's Paul Revere!

43
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:40,946
- I got this.
- Who are you people?

44
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:44,149
Where am I? Why are all
those women screaming?

45
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,652
And now for the midnight
ride of Ray Revere.

46
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:47,887
Sorry.

47
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,223
Nate Revere to the rescue.

48
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:51,723
Now ring the alarm back in 1775.

49
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,875
I got a country to save, suckers!

50
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:55,570
See ya back on the ship, Nate.

51
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,996
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

52
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,665
Whoo!

53
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:04,836

54
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:13,078
Geez, who died?

55
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:16,281
Oh, come on.

56
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:19,584
We just met the Beatles
and saved Fourth of July.

57
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:22,721
No, it's cool; it's just all becoming...

58
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:24,817
I don't know. Old hat.

59
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,825
Yeah, we did spend all of
last night year returning

60
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:28,760
displaced people to their
proper place in history.

61
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:30,770
Four years doing the same old crap.

62
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:33,067
Yeah, I'm beginning to think
Wally had the right idea...

63
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,735
Taking time off, clearing
his head, traveling the world.

64
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:38,003
Speaking of the same old crap,

65
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:39,468
isn't that what he did last year?

66
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:42,207
Look, all I know is,
Constantine promised us new,

67
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,544
mysterious monsters, so
where they all hiding?

68
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:47,179
I'm confused.

69
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:50,816
We are all happy that there
was only one dragon, right?

70
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:52,896
We don't want to be fighting
werewolves in the Alamo.

71
00:02:52,898 --> 00:02:53,952
Eh.

72
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:56,945
Well, it would be good for our ratings.

73
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:58,724
- What ratings?
- Oh, you don't know?

74
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:00,659
The Time Bureau rates
all their employees.

75
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:03,218
But don't worry. We have
a few dedicated fans.

76
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,014
Yeah, Gary doesn't count.

77
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:08,352
Who gives a damn about Time Pig ratings?

78
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,288
I want dragons.

79
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,004
What is wrong with you guys?

80
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:15,240
Don't you get it? Constantine was wrong.

81
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:18,351
Our crazy plan to let Mallus out worked.

82
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:19,945
Finally, we're not screw-ups

83
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:21,713
forced to clean up our own mess.

84
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:26,651
For once in our lives,
we are actual heroes.

85
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:29,254
Captain, I'm receiving a communiqué

86
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:30,515
from Director Sharpe.

87
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:33,448
Ooh!

88
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:35,227
Put her on, Gideon.

89
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:38,382
Captain Lance,

90
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,165
I would like you and your team to report

91
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,067
to the Time Bureau immediately.

92
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,265
Copy that.

93
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:44,967
Gideon, set a course for Star City...

94
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,072
I'm not talking about our
field office, Miss Lance.

95
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:50,175
I meant our Time Bureau
Headquarters in D.C.

96
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:51,376
Over and out.

97
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:54,293
Dammit!

98
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:56,649
Who told Ava about the dragon?

99
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:08,960
You sure that you can't tell
us what all this is about?

100
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:11,196
Oh, I'd love to, but the
boss-lady will kill me.

101
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:12,464
Mick.

102
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,267
Talk.

103
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,712
I can't. Director Sharpe said...

104
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:17,217
Whatever Ava threatened is nothing

105
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,899
compared to what I'm about to do to you.

106
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:20,518
You told her about the
dragon head, didn't you, Gary?

107
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,845
- What? No.
- Did Constantine

108
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:23,243
- get you to squeal?
- I wish.

109
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:25,582
We looked; there are no more monsters.

110
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,052
This isn't what you think.

111
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:31,383
Then what the hell is it?

112
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:33,251
Surprise!

113
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,791
On behalf of the Time Bureau,
I would like to recognize

114
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:44,462
Captain Lance and her crew for
fixing the final Anachronism.

115
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:45,497
Congratulations!

116
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,503
What does that even mean?

117
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:53,105
Well, it means that...

118
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:55,040
Paul Revere was

119
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:56,529
the final crack in the timeline.

120
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:58,777
You, my friends, fixed history.

121
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:01,746
- The same history we broke.
- Just take the win.

122
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:03,715
I don't want your stinking medal.

123
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:05,183
There's an open bar.

124
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:06,751
Where?

125
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:13,024
Sorry, Sara, I know you
don't like surprises, but...

126
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:15,193
I like this one.

127
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:18,396
Now I was thinking maybe
you could give me a tour

128
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:21,032
of the Headquarters, Director Sharpe.

129
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:31,743
Gee, I really wonder how

130
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:35,313
she managed to escape
from the Time Bureau.

131
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:36,515
Yeah...

132
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:40,352
I mean... I mean, if I had to...

133
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:41,753
If I had to guess,

134
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:45,857
I'd probably say that
someone must have given Nora

135
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,373
her dead father's Time Stone.

136
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:49,628
And furthermore, that
someone must have done it

137
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,664
in hopes that she would
turn over a new leaf in life.

138
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,168
Sounds like that someone
forgot about Nora's serious

139
00:05:56,171 --> 00:06:00,406
lack of ethics... around
a murder, for one...

140
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:03,642
But that someone must have had

141
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:06,845
a really big heart to
give her a second chance.

142
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,749
You're a good guy, Ray Palmer.

143
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,356
- Okay, I gotta go.
- No, no, no...

144
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:20,258
Yes, I gotta get back to the ship.

145
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,193
The Legends aren't used
to being on furlough.

146
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:24,863
Come on, they will
be fine for one night.

147
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:27,065
Besides, I was hoping that you

148
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:30,402
and your team would be
spending more time here in 2018.

149
00:06:30,404 --> 00:06:32,604
But mostly, you know...

150
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:35,340
You, with me...

151
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:39,311
In this apartment.

152
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:42,280
Ava Sharpe.

153
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:44,248
Are you trying to make
a kept woman out of me?

154
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:46,931
What? No! I wouldn't dare.

155
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:48,934
I'm... just...

156
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:50,722
saying that, you know,

157
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,457
since you fixed all the Anachronisms

158
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:55,527
maybe you wouldn't mind being kept,

159
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:58,897
just part of the time.

160
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,932
It would be fun to come home to you.

161
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,805
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:10,306
Oh, that was stupid.

163
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:12,043
You just got back into
town, and here I am hitching

164
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,379
the old U-Haul to the
back of the Subaru.

165
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:16,181
- It was stupid.
- No, no.

166
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:20,018
Hey, it wasn't that. I'm...

167
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,520
I'm just thinking and...

168
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:26,547
I'm ready to take the next step.

169
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,483
I...

170
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:30,894
am ready

171
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:34,009
to be a partially kept woman.

172
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:38,870
Yes! Come here.

173
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,605
Mm. Mm!

174
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,675
Okay, so why don't you, uh, rustle us up

175
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:45,010
another bottle of champagne,

176
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,344
and let's make this thing official.

177
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:48,346
- That, I can do.
- Yeah?

178
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:04,636
Hello, John.

179
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,533
You know, tonight really isn't

180
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,935
a night for celebration, Sara.

181
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:14,005
The darkness, it's rising.

182
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:18,928
What are you doing? And
what does that even mean?

183
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,012
Mallus wasn't the
only prisoner to escape

184
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:24,157
when you decided to pull back
the veil between our worlds.

185
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,617
And yet for the past five months,

186
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:27,185
the Timeline has been quiet.

187
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:28,753
If you wanted to come and see me,

188
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,029
all you had to do was ask.

189
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:32,470
Five months is a blink of an eye

190
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:35,533
for an immortal monster.

191
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:37,329
Look, this is your bloody mess, Sara,

192
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:39,064
so stop playing
tiddlywinks with the missus

193
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,943
and get ready for the
fight that's coming.

194
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:43,290
What if this is who I am now?

195
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:44,736
Really?

196
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:47,772
This is who you are?

197
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:52,644
Fuzzy throws and fluffy pink slippers?

198
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:56,815
I like my pink fluffy slippers.

199
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:59,384
Okay, reunion's over.

200
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:00,485
Time to go.

201
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:09,368
What am I looking at?

202
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,829
The knuckle bones of a
martyred saint, obviously.

203
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:14,632
They act as a divining rod
able to detect the presence

204
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,068
of beings not belonging to our world.

205
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,439
My team spent the last five
months scouring the Timeline

206
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,342
for another one of
your mystical creatures.

207
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:25,210
You wanna know what we found? Nothing.

208
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,012
What the hell are you doing here?

209
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:31,850
Is everything all right?

210
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:33,212
Yeah, everything is great.

211
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:36,154
- I was just telling Sara...
- About an exorcism

212
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:38,189
that he has to do
tomorrow in Georgetown.

213
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:42,060
It's really nothing you
wanna hear before bedtime.

214
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:43,628
Come back again soon now, John.

215
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,797
Don't be shy about that doorbell.

216
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,199
I'll be seeing you around, Sharpie.

217
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:54,572
Should I be worried about
your ex-lover breaking

218
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,741
into my apartment, or...

219
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:59,110
Well, I thought that...

220
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,513
this was our apartment.

221
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:05,483
You are smooth.

222
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,087
Don't forget the bubbly.

223
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:22,434
Bollocks.

224
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:26,638
Mick, what are you still doing here?

225
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,934
Machine's still spinning,

226
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:29,497
and I'm still standing.

227
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,224
You know what? Hook me
up with one of those.

228
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:33,488
Now that we fixed our last Anachronism,

229
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:35,224
it's only a matter of
time before the Bureau

230
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:38,127
puts us out to pasture, which blows,

231
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:40,518
because being a Legend was
the only thing I was good at.

232
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:41,964
Well, speak for yourself.

233
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,666
I was a great criminal.

234
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:45,601
At least we got these cool medals.

235
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,857
Actually, the medal has
to remain top secret,

236
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,593
because no one can
know about time travel,

237
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:51,441
so I'll just take these
back now for safe-keeping...

238
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,036
What do you say you and
I find some real action?

239
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,473
Mick, I am 100% down.

240
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,376
Ooh! I'll come with.

241
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:10,565
I could have just called us an Uber.

242
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:12,128
You ready to steal something pretty?

243
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,364
Um... yeah.

244
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:16,615
I could do some light theft.

245
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,334
What is this, spring break?

246
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:19,835
I'm talking about a felony.

247
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:22,171
- Now get in!
- You know what, Mick?

248
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,973
If we're gonna rob a
house, we really should

249
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,108
make sure there's stuff
in there worth stealing.

250
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,344
And I think I know
just the neighborhood.

251
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:39,859
Mick, wait, wait, wait!
You are so aggressive.

252
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,496
Why don't you look for a spare key?

253
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:44,707
- Good spotting, pretty.
- Yeah.

254
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,943
I'm a real criminal mastermind.

255
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:00,425
Bingo.

256
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:10,953
Yes, I'd like to report a robbery.

257
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:13,011
You will do nothing of the sort.

258
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:17,058
Oh, Nate, it is so good to see you!

259
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:19,050
What the hell is going on here?

260
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:22,508
Um, Mick... these are my parents.

261
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:26,368
I am Dorothy Heywood;
you can call me Dot. Hi.

262
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,699
And uh, this is my dad, Hank.

263
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:30,973
Henry Heywood.

264
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,476
And I believe one of
my great grandmother's

265
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:37,113
silver candlesticks has
found its way into your coat.

266
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,316
Oh, you have exquisite
taste in silver, Mr....

267
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,261
Rory. Mick Rory,

268
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,960
of the Central City Rorys.

269
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:48,329
We didn't mean to scare you, Mom.

270
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,659
I thought you'd be up
by Martha's Vineyard

271
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,630
this time of year.

272
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,493
Oh, we were! But your father just took

273
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:55,064
a very exciting job at the Pentagon.

274
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,004
We'll... we'll get going, right, Mick?

275
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,488
- Good idea.
- Don't be ridiculous.

276
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:03,171
Mr. Rory, do you like sandwiches?

277
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:04,406
Bet your ass, I do ma'am.

278
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,808
Wonderful, then, um,

279
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,344
I'm gonna fix you boys
a little midnight snack.

280
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:11,480
You too, Henry; you're one of the boys.

281
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:16,652
Gary, wake up!

282
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:21,090
I got a hunch there might be
a monster loose in history.

283
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,993
Like the dragon you made me
not tell Director Sharpe about?

284
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:26,162
Exactly.

285
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,533
No.

286
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:32,735
The Timeline's only showing a few burps.

287
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:35,271
This is the only significant one.

288
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,840
What if there's a creature
that no one's noticed yet?

289
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:39,875
The only way people
wouldn't notice a monster is

290
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:41,911
if it was hiding.

291
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:44,580
Or if they were on drugs.

292
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:45,980
I'm gonna go check it out.

293
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:48,050
- Ooh, I'll come with!
- Nope.

294
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:50,590
But if you're going back to
1969, you're gonna need...

295
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:52,493
Your time courier.

296
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,363
Going somewhere, Raymond?

297
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:02,198
And don't give me any of that

298
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,433
routine maintenance
on the jumpship crap.

299
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:06,383
Yeah, no. I wouldn't do that.

300
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:10,406
I... I had Gideon
monitor the Time Bureau.

301
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:13,409
Someone over there pulled up
unusual activity in Woodstock,

302
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:15,644
- 1969.
- You think it's Nora,

303
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,713
and if the Time Bureau finds her first,

304
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:20,716
she's going to tell them you're
the one who helped her escape.

305
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:23,340
Ray, I'm not going to let
you get on that jumpship.

306
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:24,516
But...

307
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,582
- Not without me.
- Oh, good.

308
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,284
I was not looking forward to dealing

309
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,321
with those hippies on my own.

310
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,363
What's a hippie?

311
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,214
Give peace a chance.

312
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:54,817
Together, we can end the war in Vietnam.

313
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:57,219
Hey!

314
00:14:57,221 --> 00:14:59,388
Yeah, this place is groovy.

315
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,625
So, tell me, why would
Nora Time Stone to the least

316
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:05,027
- evil event in history?
- Well, who knows?

317
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,097
Maybe she's turning over
a new, non-evil leaf,

318
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:10,299
inspired by yours truly.

319
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:11,652
Right.

320
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:13,835
- All right.
- What is that?

321
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:16,438
Oh, it's my old trusty
Eagle Scout compass.

322
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,574
I thought we could locate
the epicenter of the temporal

323
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:19,975
disturbance the old-fashioned way.

324
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,578
- It sounds like a blast, Ray.
- Yeah!

325
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,382
197, 198, 199...

326
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:29,585
Sorry, Ray. Looks like
Nora's in the wind.

327
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:31,287
What is that?

328
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,697
What is that? Ray!

329
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,198
It's beautiful.

330
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,068
It's like some sort
of magical pixie goo.

331
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,337
No, not that. That!

332
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:53,375
Oh my God! Oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!

333
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:57,694
Why? Who would wanna
kill hippies at Woodstock?

334
00:15:57,697 --> 00:15:59,930
Literally ripping people's hearts out!

335
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,686
Now that's the Nora I remember.

336
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,281
You certainly can eat
a lot of sandwiches,

337
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,549
Mr. Rory.

338
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,551
Where did you get those big muscles?

339
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:16,687
Prison.

340
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:18,689
What a hoot!

341
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:20,458
Isn't he a hoot, Henry?

342
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,393
He's a real barrel of laughs.

343
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,995
Excuse me.

344
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,204
So you just drop in on us
in the middle of the night,

345
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,570
after barely a phone call
for the past two years?

346
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:33,904
I know, Dad, I'm sorry.

347
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:37,174
- I've just been busy.
- Busy doing what?

348
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:39,410
History stuff.

349
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:42,172
You know, the same stuff
you never took seriously.

350
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,315
Maybe that's because
deductive historical

351
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:48,452
reconstruction isn't
an actual profession!

352
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,455
I'm sorry.

353
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:55,893
So should I have your mother
just grab her checkbook

354
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:58,195
now, or would you prefer
your friend here swipe it out

355
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,626
- of her purse on the way out?
- It would be easy either way.

356
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:01,866
I don't want your money, dad.

357
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:03,133
Then, why are you here?

358
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:04,769
Honestly, I don't know.

359
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:06,739
You don't...

360
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:08,539
We had a name for people like you,

361
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,683
- back in my day...
- Oh.

362
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:11,844
Here comes the big rant
about hippies, go ahead.

363
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,245
To tell the truth, I have nothing
but pity for those people.

364
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:15,034
Yeah, since when?

365
00:17:15,037 --> 00:17:17,648
Since they were slaughtered
like lambs back in '69.

366
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,150
Look, I'm not saying
the Woodstock Massacre

367
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:21,519
was their fault,

368
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:23,888
but it wasn't not their fault either.

369
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,424
Mom, thanks for the sandwiches!

370
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:28,559
Wha...

371
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,762
There's something wrong with history.

372
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,733
Not Noras. Hi!

373
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:38,369
Not Nora, not Nora...

374
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,629
definitely not Nora.

375
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:44,974
Ray, I really don't need
to hear your inner dialogue.

376
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:47,077
Sorry, I'm just...
I'm... I'm... I'm nervous,

377
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:50,329
and upset. I mean, how
could she be so heartless?

378
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:51,938
Pun not intended.

379
00:17:51,941 --> 00:17:55,422
Well, her father did give her
over to a demon-loving cult so.

380
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,154
- Nora Darhk is here?
- Sara?

381
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,989
Hey, what are you doing at Woodstock?

382
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:00,457
Probably the same thing as you are,

383
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:03,427
looking for whatever
is messing with history.

384
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:07,131
Huh, I think I just
saw Joan Baez talking to

385
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,961
Carlos Santana. Woodstock...

386
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,137
- Turns into a massacre.
- Nate! You're here too?

387
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:15,152
Yeah, buddy.

388
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:18,490
Hey.

389
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:23,079
- Hey!
- Okay, what is going on?

390
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:25,610
Woodstock is no longer
remembered as three days of

391
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:28,686
peace and love, but instead,
the end of the hippie movement.

392
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:31,501
Reports from survivors
are sketchy at best.

393
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:34,091
But what they all could agree
upon was there was a series of

394
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:37,422
grisly murders that ultimately
lead to a deadly stampede

395
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:40,290
when 400,000 kids try to
escape the festival at once.

396
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah, Ray and I just
saw a body in the woods

397
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:44,969
with a gaping hole in its chest.

398
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,270
We think that Nora did it.

399
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,961
- Well, that's a relief.
- It is?

400
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:49,673
Yeah, it means we're in the clear.

401
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:52,176
Look, it's not our fault the
Time Bureau let Nora escape.

402
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:53,611
Guys, come check this out.

403
00:18:53,613 --> 00:18:55,412
Don't panic, I left Mick alone here.

404
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,448
He's itching to punch a hippie.

405
00:18:58,684 --> 00:18:59,950
That's not good.

406
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:04,288
Is that what I think it is?

407
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,958
Twilight Sparkle come to life.

408
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:10,661
You're a brony?

409
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,563
Dude, we're brony bros.

410
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:15,866
- Mick, join the herd!
- Outta my way.

411
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,468
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?

412
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,649
Well, it's not a dragon,
but it'll have to do.

413
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:23,707
Mick, hold on, it's not
like it's hurting anyone.

414
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:32,950
We didn't screw things up
for the better this year.

415
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:35,819
We screwed things up
for the more magical.

416
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:44,828
It's beautiful!

417
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:53,437
Oh my God!

418
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:55,773
What!

419
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:05,054
Oh my God! Is it...

420
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:07,094
Yup, yup. It's eating her heart.

421
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:08,858
I'm gonna be sick.

422
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,963
- Mick, shoot it.
- Shoot it!

423
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:19,936
Damn horse is fire-proof.

424
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:30,279
I hate glitter.

425
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,185
Seriously?

426
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:38,788
- Where'd it go?
- Okay, we can fix this

427
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,756
before the Time Bureau
even has to know about it.

428
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:42,225
Oh, really? Can we?

429
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:44,293
Look, Ava still thinks
of me as the woman

430
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:46,994
who saved the world
last year, and I don't

431
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,631
want her to know that there's a
whole new problem with history.

432
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:52,001
Yeah, that we basically created.

433
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:54,737
You go find the unicorn,

434
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,540
and I'll go find Constantine.

435
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:58,841
Yup.

436
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:00,843
Every time.

437
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:04,474
Somebody
can't read bloody signs.

438
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:06,749
You don't know that there's
a "do not disturb" sign

439
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,317
on the bloody door?

440
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,019
Sara.

441
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:13,356
Yeah, uh... I can't
talk right now, love.

442
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:16,092
I've got a threesome
that's about to pop off

443
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:18,227
in here with some contortionists.

444
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:20,830
You were right.

445
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:23,132
Ah.

446
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,700
What was that now?

447
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:26,302
You were right!

448
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:29,505
There's a magical creature
at Woodstock. Now let's go!

449
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:32,108
You know, for someone with
a time traveling machine,

450
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,043
you seem to be in an awful hurry.

451
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:37,079
John, the unicorn has
already gored two hippies.

452
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:41,617
- A unicorn?
- Yeah.

453
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:44,253
Well, all right, I'm in.
But first, I need to know,

454
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:48,624
was any of your team
musked by the beast?

455
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:49,898
If that's what you're calling

456
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:52,827
its sparkle-sauce, then, yeah. Why?

457
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:58,301
Oh, they're in for one hell of a ride.

458
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,041
Man, I wish my dad could see us

459
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:07,677
now hunting a bloodthirsty
creature through Woodstock.

460
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,208
What's the beef between
you and your old man anyway?

461
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,544
- He hit you?
- No.

462
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,082
- Burn you?
- Nope.

463
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:16,018
Did he dress up like a clown
and scare the hell out of you?

464
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,753
What the hell, Mick? No.

465
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:20,790
He was emotionally unavailable
to me when I was growing up.

466
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,892
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

467
00:22:22,894 --> 00:22:24,660
To the whole world,
my dad was this great

468
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:27,730
larger-than-life guy, but to me,

469
00:22:27,732 --> 00:22:29,365
he was just cold.

470
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,369
Boo-hoo!

471
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:38,975
Hank?

472
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:40,543
What?

473
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:41,911
I'm not your dad!

474
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:46,015
Oh, so you're ashamed of me?

475
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:50,186
I'm sorry I didn't follow
in your footsteps and enlist.

476
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:53,055
But for your information, I
had a medal pinned to my chest,

477
00:22:53,057 --> 00:22:55,424
only you don't have
the clearance to see it!

478
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:56,695
What's happening?

479
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:57,893
What?

480
00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:58,995
Axl?

481
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:01,864
I'm getting something off my chest.

482
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:03,132
And you know what, Hank?

483
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:04,867
It feels pretty good.

484
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:08,270
I just wish for once, you
would tell me you're proud of me

485
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:11,258
no matter what I do with my life.

486
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:12,552
You know what I'd say?

487
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:15,296
I love you.

488
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:19,444
I love you too.

489
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:22,418
- Really?
- I thought you were dead.

490
00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:25,955
I thought you were dead on the inside.

491
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:44,407
Ray. Ray, my hand is glowing.

492
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:46,776
- Can you see it?
- No.

493
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:49,045
- It looks like your hand.
- No, no.

494
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:52,248
You gotta open your eyes, man.

495
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,918
It's all around us.

496
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,787
What is?

497
00:23:57,789 --> 00:23:59,855
Love.

498
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:04,727
Oh, those hippies had the right idea.

499
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:06,896
Woodstock is beautiful.

500
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,201
- What's wrong, Ray?
- What?

501
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:18,541
You were hoping to see Nora here.

502
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:20,443
You like her, Ray-Ray!

503
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:21,811
No, no!

504
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:23,345
I do not like Nora.

505
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:27,483
Uh-huh, because you love her.

506
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:29,825
No-o, no!

507
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:32,154
The only reason I ever want
to see Nora Darhk again is

508
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:33,823
so that I can take
the Time Stone back and

509
00:24:33,825 --> 00:24:36,025
I can lock her up in the Time Bureau.

510
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:38,526
Oh my God, she's here!

511
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,533
You know, a unicorn is no bloody joke.

512
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:48,070
You might want to get your
ol' girlfriend on the blower.

513
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:50,039
You didn't tell Director Sharpe

514
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,708
that you let all the
monsters out to play, did you?

515
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,643
Ava and I are in a
great place right now.

516
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:56,645
Better than great.

517
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:59,615
In fact, she asked me to move
in with her, and I said yes.

518
00:24:59,617 --> 00:25:02,852
So, why rock the boat
unless absolutely necessary?

519
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:04,653
Because when the boat eventually tips,

520
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:06,756
- you'll both bloody drown.
- Nice.

521
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:08,190
I'm just trying to look after you, love.

522
00:25:08,192 --> 00:25:10,693
You and I are similar;
we're both survivors.

523
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:13,095
But our survival comes
at a terrible cost.

524
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:16,365
Look, you can take it from
a man who's caused nothing

525
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:18,501
but misery to everyone he's ever loved.

526
00:25:18,503 --> 00:25:21,537
Trust me, end it with
Ava before it's too late.

527
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,372
You ever think that you cause misery

528
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:27,099
not because of some romantic
"I was born to walk alone" crap,

529
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:28,644
but because you're an ass

530
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:29,979
who doesn't know how to trust people?

531
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:31,413
You know, I trust

532
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:33,415
that people around me get hurt, killed,

533
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:34,850
or far, far worse...

534
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:36,430
You think that I'm not scared?

535
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,387
That I don't know grief?

536
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:41,390
I'm not willing to turn my back on life,

537
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:45,327
because that is exactly
what you're doing, John.

538
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:48,030
Our friends and family,
they don't make us weaker;

539
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,899
they make us stronger.

540
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:53,502
You know what you need?

541
00:25:53,504 --> 00:25:56,806
You need to be a part of a team.

542
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:07,516
You were saying?

543
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,943
This is King Solomon's
original grimoire...

544
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:17,879
The oldest magical
textbook in existence.

545
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:21,916
Now, if there's a spell
to quell our equine friend,

546
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:23,551
it'll be in here.

547
00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:26,521
Well, not to pressure
you, but the entire fate of

548
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:28,490
the sexual revolution
is in the balance here.

549
00:26:28,492 --> 00:26:30,625
It is my favorite revolution.

550
00:26:30,627 --> 00:26:34,729
- John! Welcome aboard.
- Hey, Ray big-man!

551
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:36,998
Glad to see you're all
back from the land of milk

552
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,733
- and honey.
- I'm still a little

553
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:40,316
fuzzy on how exactly we were...

554
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,452
Roofied by a horse.

555
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:44,872
That beast sprays a powerful
mind-altering hallucinogen

556
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,875
to disarm its prey.

557
00:26:46,877 --> 00:26:48,610
Ah!

558
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,112
"How to expel a magical creature

559
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:52,814
from the mortal realm."

560
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:55,483
Now the ingredients for
this spell aren't so easy

561
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:56,885
to come by.

562
00:26:56,887 --> 00:26:59,220
Don't suppose any of
you lot have the saliva

563
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:01,322
from a nine-fingered man, now do you?

564
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:04,192
You could chop off one of my pinkies.

565
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:06,461
No, Ray. Don't be the Giving Tree.

566
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:10,131
Now, as every Deadhead knows,

567
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:12,734
Jerry Garcia was missing
most of his middle finger

568
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:15,904
on his right hand from
a wood chopping accident.

569
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:19,707
Cool, so how do we get his saliva?

570
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:31,486
Jerry, my man!

571
00:27:31,488 --> 00:27:33,121
Can I get a hit of that?

572
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:38,159
This doobie will make you fly.

573
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:40,328
Cool, cool.

574
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:46,634
- Spin-move!
- Hey!

575
00:27:46,636 --> 00:27:48,169
Not cool.

576
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:51,639
We need the Protection
Stone of a powerful shaman.

577
00:27:54,177 --> 00:27:55,210
Watch it...

578
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:01,382
Brother.

579
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:04,046
And the lock of a doomed woman.

580
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,262
Janis, this is... This
is quite the honor.

581
00:28:14,264 --> 00:28:17,665
- Little robot man.
- Hi.

582
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:19,019
My mom is a huge fan.

583
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:22,170
Your mom?

584
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:25,340
And for our final ingredient...

585
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:31,313
Quis virginem.

586
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:33,491
What?

587
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:35,116
A virgin.

588
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:37,249
A virgin, at Woodstock? Ha!

589
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:39,343
Good luck with that;
this is the least celibate

590
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:40,769
place in history.

591
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:42,222
Are you serious?

592
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:43,691
Yeah, apparently virgins are

593
00:28:43,693 --> 00:28:45,627
like catnip to unicorns

594
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:47,195
and we need one to volunteer.

595
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:50,231
Rory, do you see any
virgins where you're at?

596
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:59,140
- No.
- Oh, come to think of it...

597
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:01,676
I do know one virgin.

598
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:04,719
No, not a chance.

599
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:08,449
- This feels wrong.
- Well don't worry, we'll be

600
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:11,600
watching from a short
distance, and you'll be... fine.

601
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:13,621
What am I supposed to
do with the pomegranate?

602
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:16,424
Oh, the unicorns, they can't
get enough of them, mate.

603
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:17,825
Yeah that, and human hearts.

604
00:29:17,827 --> 00:29:20,795
So, the pomegranate is the bait?

605
00:29:20,797 --> 00:29:23,598
Yeah, we wouldn't put an interim member

606
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,093
of our team in jeopardy, right guys?

607
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:27,654
I'm an interim Legend?

608
00:29:30,073 --> 00:29:32,206
Well, then.

609
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:34,943
Uh, one more question, are
you sure that I'm a virgin

610
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:36,844
because that thing we did...

611
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:38,746
Positive, mate.

612
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:47,055
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Unicorn!

613
00:29:47,057 --> 00:29:50,613
Come get this nice,
juicy, red pomegranate.

614
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:53,962
Admit it, this is fun
working with a team.

615
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:55,597
Well if ol' Gary gets eaten alive,

616
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,131
it only goes to prove my point:

617
00:29:57,133 --> 00:30:00,034
People who care about us die.

618
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:02,070
- What was that?
- Oh, nothing mate.

619
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:03,471
You're golden, carry on, yeah?

620
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:07,041
Oh, hold it up... up a bit. More!

621
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:09,277
That's the money.

622
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:23,291
Come on, pretty pony.

623
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:26,060
Come on, come on.

624
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:31,132
Enjoy your snack.

625
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,139
Oh no, that's not pomegranate
juice, is it? Guys?

626
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:40,908
John, whatever you're
gonna do, do it now!

627
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,511
All right, here goes.

628
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:53,421
I don't wanna die a virgin!

629
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:09,237
Seriously, you're meditating right now?

630
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:11,473
John, hurry!

631
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:43,734
Come on, John.

632
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:07,162
Help! Help!

633
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:44,932
Gary, are you okay?

634
00:32:44,935 --> 00:32:48,303
- Just a scratch.
- Where'd the unicorn go?

635
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:51,473
Sent that bastard
straight to hell, didn't I?

636
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:56,144
Yup, folks, that is some
Grade A magic right there.

637
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:58,313
Maybe the Bureau will up our ratings.

638
00:32:58,315 --> 00:33:00,048
People do love the supernatural.

639
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,977
Gary, you're like really bleeding.

640
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,513
Ah!

641
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,688
The unicorn bit my nipple off!

642
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:10,858
Hey, maybe Gideon can
make you a new one.

643
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:13,395
Forget it, mate. Come
on, it's a badge of honor.

644
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:15,697
You see, my soul is
heading straight to hell,

645
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:19,734
but your nipple... it just
got there first, that's all.

646
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:22,604
It's like we're two birds
of the same, dark feather.

647
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:25,173
Yeah, yeah, that's right, mate.

648
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:26,906
Come on, let's grab a beer.

649
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:28,188
All right?

650
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:30,586
Now about this whole virgin situation.

651
00:33:46,596 --> 00:33:48,296
Nathaniel...

652
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:51,333
I assumed you would
have left town by now.

653
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:55,236
Yeah, I decided to stay
a couple extra days.

654
00:33:55,238 --> 00:33:58,940
Let me guess, you got fired
from whatever online college

655
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:01,076
you conned into hiring you.

656
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,678
Sweet burn, Hank, but um...

657
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,513
I was just...

658
00:34:05,515 --> 00:34:08,516
wondering if you wanted
to have a beer with me?

659
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:12,287
We don't do that.

660
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,089
Maybe we should start.

661
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,578
Wow, you're looking a
little glum there buddy.

662
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,211
Just, uh... thinking about all

663
00:34:39,214 --> 00:34:41,583
the musicians who died after Woodstock.

664
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:44,619
Janis Joplin overdosed in 1970,

665
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:46,721
sad and alone.

666
00:34:46,723 --> 00:34:52,093
That's terrible, but this
is obviously about Nora.

667
00:34:52,095 --> 00:34:56,598
When I gave her the Time
Stone, our hands touched,

668
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,435
and... I felt a spark.

669
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:03,972
Ray, Nora is...

670
00:35:03,974 --> 00:35:07,969
Nora is like a unicorn,
beautiful and dangerous.

671
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,412
She is going to eat you alive.

672
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:14,482
I guess she and I are doomed.

673
00:35:16,453 --> 00:35:18,500
There's something I want to show you.

674
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:20,321
Come on.

675
00:35:20,323 --> 00:35:21,689
Okay.

676
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:28,329
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

677
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:35,370
That's my mom, and that's me.

678
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:38,109
We lived in D.C.

679
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,846
in 2018 before my brother was born.

680
00:35:43,211 --> 00:35:45,313
It would be so easy, Ray...

681
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:48,616
to just walk over there
and tell her to get her

682
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:53,421
family and go to Canada
before everything changes;

683
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:57,759
before this country that
she worked so hard to become

684
00:35:57,761 --> 00:36:00,428
a citizen of betrays her.

685
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:05,133
You'd be changing your future.

686
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:08,937
You'd never meet us, you'd
never become a Legend.

687
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:10,371
Think of all the people you saved.

688
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:12,173
Yeah, I know. I know.

689
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:16,010
There's no loophole where I can
save my family, and not screw

690
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:18,414
up history, but that doesn't
mean I don't feel guilty every

691
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:21,618
day that I have the power
to change everything, and...

692
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,887
I do nothing.

693
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:29,157
I'm so sorry, Z.

694
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:33,161
Look at her, Ray.

695
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:35,964
How could anyone be afraid of her?

696
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:50,311
- Hello!
- Smells good in here.

697
00:36:50,313 --> 00:36:52,881
Oh yeah, I, uh, burned
the first chicken piccata,

698
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:55,083
but I think I got the
second one just right.

699
00:36:57,454 --> 00:36:59,721
Those our medals?

700
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:03,525
I wanted to remind you of all
the good you did last year.

701
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:08,129
Yeah, we, um... We weren't that good.

702
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:10,565
Would you stop being so
hard on yourself, Sara?

703
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,100
I'm proud of you.

704
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:15,503
When we freed Mallus,
we accidentally released

705
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:17,038
magical monsters into the world.

706
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,240
And I didn't want to tell
you because I love the idea

707
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:21,142
of us living together, and
I didn't want to risk that

708
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:24,179
or you thinking that maybe
I wasn't such a screw-up.

709
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:27,448
I know.

710
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,284
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

711
00:37:29,286 --> 00:37:31,686
Gary was very proud
about losing a nipple.

712
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:35,123
- But you cooked dinner...
- Yeah!

713
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,925
Because I love you, you goober, and

714
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:39,031
nothing is gonna change that.

715
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:40,733
Even after I went behind your back

716
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,764
to work with Constantine
to send a unicorn to hell?

717
00:37:42,766 --> 00:37:44,799
Okay, yeah, I wasn't so
crazy about that part.

718
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:47,468
Let's not talk about Constantine.

719
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,572
I'm crazy about you. Come here.

720
00:37:50,574 --> 00:37:52,402
Stop being neurotic.

721
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:55,076
I don't think that you're a screw-up.

722
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:57,712
I think that you are
a damn fine Captain,

723
00:37:57,714 --> 00:38:01,282
faced with some
extraordinary circumstances.

724
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:04,319
God, I love you.

725
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,357
And...

726
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,993
I got a question.

727
00:38:11,995 --> 00:38:13,691
- Do we...
- Mm-hmm.

728
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,230
You and I,

729
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:17,732
think that maybe right now

730
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:20,735
is not the best time for me to move in?

731
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:23,204
You know that I want to;
nothing would make me happier.

732
00:38:23,206 --> 00:38:26,975
It's just... I feel like
I need to be out there.

733
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:29,777
- With my team.
- I understand.

734
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:32,324
But can you promise me
that our relationship will

735
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:34,248
continue to evolve, please?

736
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:37,785
I want this... You and me... for real.

737
00:38:37,787 --> 00:38:40,321
So do I.

738
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:42,390
We're gonna figure it out.

739
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:12,787
No.

740
00:39:14,024 --> 00:39:16,858
I haven't even asked you anything yet.

741
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,528
It's not even magic,
love, it's deduction.

742
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,997
You need me to join the Legends,

743
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:26,567
despite knowing that needing me

744
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:29,404
always causes somebody trouble.

745
00:39:33,977 --> 00:39:36,377
What is up with you?

746
00:39:36,379 --> 00:39:38,913
Something must have happened
in the last five months.

747
00:39:38,915 --> 00:39:41,849
You're more mierable than usual.

748
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:45,320
Look...

749
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:47,455
You and I are friends.

750
00:39:47,457 --> 00:39:49,144
And I like friends.

751
00:39:49,147 --> 00:39:52,395
Friends are useful, but roommates...

752
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:56,030
See, Sara, I would
rather bloody top myself

753
00:39:56,032 --> 00:39:58,166
than move in with you lot.

754
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:08,276
See you around, John.

755
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:16,851
