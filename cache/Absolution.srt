00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:15,178
<i>I was--</i>
<i>I was about nine or ten.</i>

4
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:19,140
<i>My old man made me</i>
<i>fight this older kid</i>

5
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,516
<i>in the neighborhood.</i>

6
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,811
<i>He said I was a pussy.</i>

7
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:27,648
<i>And if I didn't want to be</i>
<i>a pussy my whole life,</i>

8
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:30,401
<i>I needed to</i>
<i>kick this kid's ass.</i>

9
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,991
<i>So...</i>

10
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,284
<i>I beat the kid up.</i>

11
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,165
<i>Beat him to a pulp.</i>

12
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,481
<i>He told me I might</i>
<i>not be a pussy, after all.</i>

13
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:01,117
I've got some product coming in
from New York the next few days.

14
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,830
Need a nice white face
to pick it up and deliver it when the time comes.

15
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,039
What kind of product?

16
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,879
Okay.

17
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,965
Look, I need to know
what the fuck we're bringing up.

18
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:21,304
No, you ain't fixing to ask me
specifics about my product, are you?

19
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,808
Didn't mean to offend you.

20
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:29,103
No, no.
Don't tell me what you meant. I fucking heard your ass.

21
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,191
Okay. Okay.

22
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,277
I'm sorry.

23
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,906
Hey,
don't come here acting

24
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,074
like you've got some
fucking weight behind your ass.

25
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:43,701
You know the fucking drill.

26
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,037
You gonna take the fucking job
or you're not.

27
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,375
How's that number?

28
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:54,503
Looks about right.

29
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,936
The fuck did you get that relic?

30
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,731
I inherited him from my old man.

31
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,483
A fucking throwback,
right there.

32
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,319
Does it talk?

33
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,697
This dude was the real deal back in the day, man.

34
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,574
Was, ain't is, homes.

35
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,702
Homie past his sell-by date.

36
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,832
Somebody tell this fuckpig

37
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,502
that if he don't stop
staring at me

38
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,504
I'm gonna have to break
his shoulders.

39
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,297
In the present tense.

40
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,471
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, man.

41
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,599
That motherfucker
still got some game, huh?

42
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,768
I like him.

43
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,688
So we got a deal or what?

44
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,274
Deal.

45
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,368
Dude, you really need
to not be saying shit like that.

46
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,869
You know who those guys are?

47
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,539
Somebody had to say something.

48
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,916
Never seen anyone
backpedal so fast.

49
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,377
Hey!
Who's the fucking boss here?

50
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,090
You want to be a boss one day,

51
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,217
you got to start
acting like one.

52
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,073
You really need that
to find your way home?

53
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:48,200
No, but my nav system

54
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:50,369
has real-time
traffic pattern algorithms.

55
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,460
Y-you can't smoke in here.

56
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,258
Algorithms...

57
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,471
That blow's gonna kill you,
you know that?

58
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,225
You think I'm a tool, don't you?

59
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,938
No, kid.
I don't think you're a tool.

60
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,440
You're just green is all.

61
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,044
There he is.

62
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,425
So, the kid bargained
a good price?

63
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,389
Ah, he got an okay price.

64
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,227
So, he shit the bed?

65
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,605
I would have been scared too
at his age, boss.

66
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,108
You know, when he managed to get
his degree from BC,

67
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,776
I wanted him
to go to law school.

68
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,070
He had other ideas.

69
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,030
He wants to be a tough guy,
like you.

70
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,660
You know, he set
this whole deal up himself.

71
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,162
He's trying to prove
to everybody he's a shot caller.

72
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,168
- What do you think?
- That ain't none of my business.

73
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,838
I'm not sure he's ever
gonna be ready, you know.

74
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,632
He's just not cut out for it,
like you and me.

75
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,884
He just needs some time,
Mister...

76
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,433
You forget
my fucking name again?

77
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,812
You forget my fucking name?

78
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,901
I've-- I've been having
trouble sleeping.

79
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,862
I get these headaches.

80
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,613
All right.

81
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,366
Just make sure the kid
doesn't fuck this one up.

82
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,221
Hey, there he is.

83
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,558
Like clockwork.

84
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,393
What, are you
late with the rent again?

85
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,520
You got anything or not?

86
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:24,064
I've got a hot kid
that could use some sparring.

87
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,778
I don't fucking need that.

88
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,843
You okay?

89
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,848
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

90
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,605
What'd you think of the mick?

91
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:51,360
Uh, he-- he can punch,
he's got some juice.

92
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,736
Bit mouthy.

93
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,033
Ain't you forgetting something?

94
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,040
Oh.

95
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,720
Hey.

96
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,555
Tilda says only single shots

97
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,432
and to cut you off
at three drinks.

98
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,600
I don't see Tilda.
Do you?

99
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:53,088
You can't touch
a lady like that! - Crazy bitch!

100
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,049
Who the fuck you calling a crazy bitch?

101
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,217
You can't touch a motherfuckin'
lady like that!

102
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,720
- What did I tell--
- I don't give a fuck.

103
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,597
You're gonna put me
in a bad mood.

104
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,725
Fuck you! I will kill you!
I will fuck you up, bitch!

105
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,643
- You're gonna fuck me?
- Yeah, bitch ass!

106
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,228
- You out of your mind?
- No.

107
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,730
- Fuck, you bit me!
- Hey!

108
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,981
You know what happens
when I get in a bad mood.

109
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,399
- Hey!
- Or what?

110
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,068
You want me to put my fucking
hands on you? - Hey!

111
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,819
Come on, pal.
Take it outside.

112
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:17,946
What'd you say to me?

113
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,783
I said take it outside.

114
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,535
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to your drink.

115
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,958
Hey, you killed him!

116
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:33,212
He ain't dead.
He's just stupid.

117
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,762
Hey! Hey, asshole!

118
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,306
Look lady,
I don't want no trouble.

119
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,017
You knocked out my boyfriend
and you don't want no trouble?

120
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,185
He had it coming.

121
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:53,482
Okay, maybe he had it coming.

122
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,736
But who's gonna walk me home?

123
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,413
Easy, babe, easy! Easy.

124
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,250
No need to be so rough.

125
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,836
We'll get there soon enough.

126
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,088
Promise.

127
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,802
Ah, easy!

128
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,931
Ea-sy.

129
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,104
Ea-sy.

130
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,067
Ea-sy.

131
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,074
Easy.

132
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,040
How you get
any sleep living here?

133
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,294
I like the noise.

134
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,838
I mean, that drunk guy,
he screams, like, every night,

135
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,965
so it's like music to me.

136
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,801
I hate silence.

137
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,761
I gathered that back at the bar.

138
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,141
Silence reminds me of home.

139
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,477
Where's that?

140
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,690
Wellesley.

141
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,609
Wellesley? Really?

142
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:23,739
Yeah, the good part,
big house on Cliff Road.

143
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,825
And I was a good girl, too.

144
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:30,204
Yeah?
What the hell happened to you?

145
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,622
Ugh...

146
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,587
Yo, Larry, shut the fuck up! I've got company.

147
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,340
Congratulations,
have a nice evening!

148
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,384
Woah!

149
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,722
See, you couldn't do that
in Wellesley.

150
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,433
I guess not.

151
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,945
- Get out.
- What?

152
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,322
- Lupe?
- Yeah.

153
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,740
That's my name.

154
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,867
You're kidding me.

155
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,370
It's not my real name,
it's my nickname.

156
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,705
Actually,
it's not even my nickname.

157
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:17,501
When I was at school,
they called me Loopy 'cause I was so fucking crazy.

158
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,003
It was kind of close, right?

159
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,713
That's trippy, don't you think?

160
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,549
Yeah, must be fate.

161
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:26,969
So who is she?

162
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,222
Oh, some whore.

163
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,434
That's not nice.

164
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,478
Listen,
she charged me ten bucks,

165
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,605
so I don't know
what else you would call her.

166
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,734
I thought I was in love.

167
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,239
Got her name
tattooed on my hand, went back to show her...

168
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,617
she was shagging
two of my friends.

169
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,910
That was the end of that.

170
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,374
That's fucking romantic,
is what that is.

171
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,174
Yeah, boss?

172
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,842
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to go to Dr. Gruber's</i>,

173
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,678
<i>pick something up for me.</i>

174
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:37,015
- Uh-huh.
- <i>You remember</i> <i>the address, right?</i>

175
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,392
Of course, I do.

176
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,708
Those
are the bombers. 30 mills.

177
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,628
They're all sealed.

178
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,464
That's what you said last time.

179
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,425
Hey, man, they were sealed.

180
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,844
Any tampering happened,
that was on the other end.

181
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:17,389
You sell this shit,
you've got to put your name on it, doc.

182
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,224
Any blanks in this batch--

183
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,976
Okay, okay, I get it.

184
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,104
I'll let 'em go for 15.

185
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,609
Okay, man. 12.

186
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,570
I don't have time
for this shit, doc.

187
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,698
Fine. Ten.

188
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,663
Let me ask you something.

189
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:47,544
I, uh, I've been having
some memory issues lately.

190
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,212
Like what?

191
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:53,216
Forgetting names and directions.
Shit like that.

192
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,135
How bad is it?

193
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,929
I forgot where I lived
for a few minutes this morning.

194
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,891
It's not the first time.

195
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,519
It's not good.
It's not good at all.

196
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,897
You should get that checked out.

197
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,571
Good afternoon.

198
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:57,739
Hey.

199
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,368
Okay.

200
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,166
Have you heard of CTE?

201
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,338
Stands for Chronic
Traumatic Encephalopathy.

202
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,092
Lots of football players
and boxers develop it.

203
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,471
- Too many blows to the head.
- Punch drunk.

204
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,765
That's what
they used to call it.

205
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:29,479
Have you sustained multiple
concussions over the course of your life?

206
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,315
You could say that.

207
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,277
Starting at what age?

208
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,362
I don't know.

209
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,616
First one was probably
around six or seven.

210
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,993
Maybe younger.

211
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,496
So, this took place at home?

212
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,039
Just tell me what I got

213
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,875
and what I need to take
to get better.

214
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,213
There is no treatment.

215
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,216
No drugs.

216
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,261
And it's a fairly advanced case.

217
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,687
Do you have anyone?

218
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,481
Wife?

219
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,733
Kids?

220
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,986
No. I-- I don't know.

221
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,654
I've-- I've got
a couple of kids.

222
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,698
Why?

223
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,491
In the next couple of years,

224
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,202
you can expect
a fairly sharp decline.

225
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,874
Eventually, you won't be able
to care for yourself.

226
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,210
Bullshit.

227
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:40,050
- I know it's hard.
- Listen, you don't know me.

228
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,844
Just tell me how long I have.

229
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:48,016
Until you're incapacitated?
I-- I can't predict that.

230
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,477
Just tell me,
how long do I have?

231
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,483
I don't know.

232
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,405
A couple of years at the most.

233
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,159
Could be sooner.

234
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,064
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hello, Daisy.</i>

235
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,357
<i>Dad?</i>

236
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,819
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

237
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,281
- No.
- <i>Did someone</i> <i>die or something?</i>

238
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:12,202
I-- I just wanted to say hello.

239
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,079
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

240
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,914
No!

241
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:18,041
<i>What the hell do you want then?</i>

242
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,168
Can I come by and see you?

243
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,377
<i>Uh, fuck no.</i>

244
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:27,050
Okay. Okay.
I-- I didn't mean to bother you.

245
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,010
<i>No,</i>
<i>I don't want to see you.</i>

246
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,762
<i>We have nothing to talk about.</i>

247
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,764
<i>I've got an okay thing</i>
<i>going on right now.</i>

248
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,432
<i>And I don't need you</i>
<i>or anyone else</i>

249
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,725
<i>fucking it up for me.</i>

250
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,228
Uh-huh.

251
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,437
Okay.

252
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,981
Have you heard from...

253
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,487
um, my-- my son?

254
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,782
<i>Your son? You mean Colin?</i>

255
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,909
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Colin.

256
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,582
You-- you have his number?

257
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,417
I-- I want to go see him.

258
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,587
<i>Colin's dead.</i>

259
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,006
What?

260
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,217
When?

261
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,802
<i>Almost two years ago.</i>

262
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,264
But--

263
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,474
What--

264
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:20,436
Why-- why didn't
anybody tell me?

265
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,147
<i>Why would they, Dad?</i>

266
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,274
<i>You didn't even remember</i>
<i>his fucking name.</i>

267
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,318
Where-- where is he buried?

268
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,870
Colin, Colin.

269
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,539
Colin.

270
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,333
Colin, Colin.

271
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,673
Fucking idiot.

272
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,008
Colin.

273
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,008
You should take better
fucking care of this place!

274
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:28,731
I thought
I told you not to come.

275
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,692
Just wanted to see you.

276
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,860
Okay. Well, you saw me.

277
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:35,029
You can fuck off now, Dad.

278
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:36,239
Excuse me.

279
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:43,121
This is un-fucking-believable.

280
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,457
And to invite you
and your family to dinner.

281
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,585
And why on earth
would I want to do that?

282
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,215
Hi, sweetie.

283
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:56,718
I'm your grandfather.

284
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,887
Get your butt
back inside.

285
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,187
Why are you--
why are you selling the house?

286
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,982
You really think
I can afford to buy a house?

287
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,026
I rent it.
The owner died

288
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,528
and his kids are
selling it out from under us.

289
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,823
Are you working?

290
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,576
- I'm dancing.
- Stripping?

291
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,536
No, I joined
the fucking Bolshoi.

292
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,371
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Mom!

293
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,664
Hi.

294
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:30,168
Um, this is your grandfather.

295
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,254
Hey.

296
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,091
So, you're the boxer?

297
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:38,259
Was.

298
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:43,014
You-- you play for Dorchester?

299
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,058
- Newton.
- Newton?

300
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,434
They have a football team?

301
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,561
He punched out
the Dorchester coach's son,

302
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,146
and they kicked him
off the team.

303
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,441
It's not funny.

304
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,069
I don't even want him
playing football.

305
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,570
You've got to go clean up.

306
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,530
I could smell you coming
from a mile away.

307
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:00,865
- Smell this!
- Goodbye.

308
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,290
What, did you find Jesus
or something?

309
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,211
I just want to explain.

310
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,423
Uh, you-- you don't understand.

311
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:20,802
No, that's just it.
I do understand.

312
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,887
You were
a fucking asshole to us.

313
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,098
Just like my babies'
daddies are assholes.

314
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,724
Just like your dad
was an asshole.

315
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,684
And his dad, and on and on.

316
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,814
Back to the asshole caveman
that spawned you all.

317
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,607
It's a fucking family curse.

318
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,486
The curse of the asshole father.

319
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,659
The dinner,
just think about it, yeah?

320
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:50,790
Okay. I thought about it.

321
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:51,999
Fuck off.

322
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,065
Dad?

323
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:59,275
Yeah.

324
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,448
- I thought you were dead.
- Nah.

325
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:07,867
It don't work that way.

326
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:21,881
Are you still mad?

327
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:30,223
Nah, I ain't mad no more, kid.

328
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:35,645
We gonna fish?

329
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:39,899
Nah.

330
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,325
Where are we going?

331
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,744
You'll see.

332
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:54,830
I don't see any land.

333
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,293
Enjoy the ride.
There'll be land soon enough.

334
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,631
- Promise?
- I promise.

335
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,011
What is that sound?

336
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:11,931
It's a guitar.

337
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,350
It's in the engine.

338
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,317
Yo!

339
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,320
Yo, you lost?

340
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,573
Come on!

341
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,369
Yeah, you're the boy
our parents warned us about.

342
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,622
- And look at you now.
- Mm-hm.

343
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,957
What do you do?

344
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,709
What, you a gangster?

345
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:04,960
Huh, you a gangster?

346
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,422
Were you born without a filter,

347
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:10,716
or is that something
you have to work at?

348
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,052
Ah, whatever.

349
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,763
No, I-- It's all
just a bunch of boo-boo.

350
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,973
- Boo-boo?
- Well, you know.

351
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,602
You know, like,
boo-boo just means, like...

352
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,312
some weak ass bullshit.

353
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,441
Life ain't weak.

354
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,738
Life's a shitstorm.

355
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,327
But it sure as hell
ain't a bunch of boo-boo.

356
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:39,495
Wow.

357
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,666
So deep!

358
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,668
I feel like I need to run.
Let's race!

359
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,378
- Come on, let's race!
- No.

360
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,672
Oh, whoa, whoa, okay.
Soccer knee, soccer knee.

361
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,634
- How about backwards race?
- That's even worse.

362
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:55,344
- What?
- It's worse.

363
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:58,013
- Come on!
- Stop it, there's people looking.

364
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,599
Oh, they gonna look, all right.
Come on!

365
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,393
What, you gonna buy me
a Guinness?

366
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:05,229
I'll make 'em stop looking
if you buy me a Guinness.

367
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,440
Come on, you gangster, boo-boo!

368
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,820
Hey,
where's the screaming drunk?

369
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:18,367
It's too early for him.
He's the closing act.

370
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,500
What are these bumps
in your tattoos?

371
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,461
Scars.

372
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,964
Cigarette burns.

373
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,426
When life gives you lemons,
you make flowers.

374
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,596
Who did this to you?

375
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,182
Some asshole.

376
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,019
I don't want to talk about it.

377
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,462
Hmm.

378
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,466
I see you got your own scars.

379
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:17,510
Yeah, well, who doesn't?

380
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,263
How'd you get those?

381
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:22,807
Uh, some asshole.

382
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,484
Where you going?

383
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:35,236
Have to go to New York.

384
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,950
You not gonna
kiss me goodbye? - No.

385
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,330
I don't have time for that.

386
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,792
Hm.
Quite the sweet talker you are.

387
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,234
Hey.

388
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,904
Hey! You deaf?

389
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,490
What?

390
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,659
I asked, how much longer
I stay on I-90?

391
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,872
Why aren't you using
your "gorithm"?

392
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,749
Yeah, very funny, smart-ass.

393
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,419
You said you've been to New York
like a million times, so...

394
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,045
What's the best way
to get there?

395
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,802
Did you-- did you forget?

396
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,304
No.

397
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,472
Go ahead. Use your toy.

398
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,434
Yeah, I think you forgot
how to get there.

399
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,227
Bullshit.

400
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:17,922
It's at northeast corner.

401
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:21,425
- Where should I park?
- Make a loop.

402
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:27,056
What are you looking for?

403
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,017
Anything that doesn't fit.

404
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:33,938
Keep driving.

405
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,108
Slower. Slower.

406
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:05,094
Is that us?

407
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,606
Yeah.

408
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:21,652
- I'll see you back in Boston.
- Hey, no, no, no.

409
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,906
I'm coming with you.

410
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:30,035
- No, it's not happening.
- Jeez, what is wrong with you?

411
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,955
Pop said he wants me to learn
the business from the bottom up.

412
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,498
Remember?

413
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,041
I got news for you.

414
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,795
This business is all done
on the bottom.

415
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,889
I want to know
what's back there.

416
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:53,434
No, you don't.

417
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:56,228
On jobs like this,
you got to learn not to look.

418
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,731
Just do your business.
And look the other way.

419
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:11,785
Cops.

420
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:15,330
Fuck.

421
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,712
- Just be cool.
- Oh, shit!

422
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,178
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

423
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,434
Do me a favor
and get on the floor.

424
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:37,394
- What?
- Get on the floor.

425
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:38,854
Why?

426
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,230
When this guy passes us,

427
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:41,899
he's gonna take
a good long look.

428
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,069
And I don't need him
seeing you shit your pants.

429
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,029
No, I'm-- I'm--
I'm cool, I'm cool.

430
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,281
You're not.
Do me a favor, get down.

431
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,533
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!
- Get on the fucking--

432
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,535
No, I'm not getting
on the fucking floor.

433
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:57,247
Hey, stop.

434
00:40:57,331 --> 00:41:00,375
- Get down, get down!
- Let me up!

435
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,628
Get down and stay there,
stay down. - Ow!

436
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:03,962
Stay down!

437
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,491
This is fucking bullshit, man.

438
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,954
I'm telling Pop
what you just did to me.

439
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,330
You mean, saving your ass?

440
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:42,292
I'm getting sick
of the lack of respect

441
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:44,253
that you've been showing me.

442
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,255
They don't just hand
that shit out, son.

443
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,422
You've got to earn it.

444
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:03,814
And I know you're talking shit
to my old man about me.

445
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:08,152
Trying to hold me back.

446
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,362
That rocket fuel's
making you paranoid.

447
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,603
If it ain't the dinosaur!

448
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:45,230
Hey, fuckpig,
where do you want this?

449
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:48,108
Just take it
around back, Jurassic Park.

450
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:49,526
What are you smirking at?

451
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:04,791
What are you doing?
Don't get out.

452
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,336
Those guys don't want us seeing
what's back there.

453
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,219
You afraid of that guy?

454
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:17,971
Just stay put.

455
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,650
Get her! Let's go!

456
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:30,817
Holy shit...

457
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:39,785
No, no, get away!

458
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:43,413
No!

459
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,999
- No!
- Get that shit back off there.

460
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,171
Shut her the fuck up!

461
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:53,507
Shut her up!

462
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,317
All right, here we go,
Number Four!

463
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:15,195
Here we go. You got this!

464
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:17,531
Come on, Dre!
Knock him on his ass!

465
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,123
Come on, Dre.
Get up off the ground.

466
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:29,376
Come on, focus!
Come on, you've got this.

467
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:31,586
All right, all right.
Here we go, here we go!

468
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,921
Hit it, hit it!

469
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,302
Don't like him
playing football, huh?

470
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:44,349
Do you mind?

471
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:46,351
Free country.

472
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:48,937
Jesus, he's playing terrible.

473
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:50,772
Come on!

474
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:52,149
Hit somebody!

475
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:59,114
Please tell me
that's not a beer in there.

476
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:10,417
Here we go! Yeah, Dre!
That's my boy!

477
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:16,590
Touchdown! Touchdown!

478
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,303
All right, let's do it again!

479
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,641
Okay, excuse me, where's
my little Patriots player?

480
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,310
Give me a hug. Oh, my God.

481
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:32,439
You are so good!
I am so proud of you.

482
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:35,025
- Thank you, Mom.
- Yeah, all right.

483
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,777
We've got to go pick up Katie.

484
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,278
You looked good out there.

485
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:40,322
Ah, I did okay.

486
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,325
Oh, here's something for you.

487
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,376
That's my old reel.

488
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,461
It's a Pflueger.

489
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:57,422
It ain't for the heavy-duty
deep-sea stuff, but...

490
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:59,966
it'll be good for what you need.

491
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:02,928
- But I don't fish.
- It doesn't matter.

492
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,179
What do you say?

493
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,597
Well, thank you.

494
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:09,184
All right,
we've got to go get Katie.

495
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:12,646
But you said I could stay
and watch the next game with my friends.

496
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:14,856
I did? Fine.
Just be home by dinner.

497
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,149
- Okay, bye, Mom.
- Okay.

498
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:17,317
Bye, I love you.

499
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,197
Didn't the court say
you couldn't hang out in parks?

500
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:24,783
Take it easy.

501
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,873
Yo, Dre! There you are.

502
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:37,254
- I want to go with my friends.
- You're riding home with me.

503
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:38,839
- Wait.
- I promised your mom.

504
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:42,843
Come on.

505
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,358
I have a question for you.

506
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:04,030
Why did you punch
that coach's son out?

507
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,327
He cheap-shotted me.

508
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:14,749
Sometimes,
you've just got to walk away.

509
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:26,636
Mom says you were in prison.

510
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,390
What for?

511
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:31,725
Not walking away.

512
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,521
I've done so much
stupid shit in my life,

513
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:37,731
I can't even tell you.

514
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,489
Are you still doing stupid shit?

515
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:55,040
Mom said you probably were.

516
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:57,834
What else did your mom tell you?

517
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,174
That you--

518
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,637
That you ran out on your family.

519
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:14,059
Is it true?

520
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,531
What was boxing like?

521
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,882
What are you doing here?
It ain't the end of the month!

522
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:48,051
This is my grandson.

523
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,761
I want him
to take a look around.

524
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,764
You want to be a boxer
like your grandfather?

525
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:56,309
Eh, I don't really know.

526
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:59,229
Hey, this guy, back in the day,

527
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:01,940
if he punched you, your fucking
ancestors would feel it.

528
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:04,901
You think I'm joking?

529
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,236
Make yourself at home, kid.

530
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:13,410
Hey. Watch these two.

531
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:18,081
Which one's better?

532
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:21,626
They both look good to me.

533
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,921
Watch their footwork.

534
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:26,590
Just their footwork.

535
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:31,094
The guy on the right
has more power.

536
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:34,431
But watch the girl.

537
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:37,392
She's coming at him
from five different angles.

538
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,520
Moving, sticking,
getting out of there.

539
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:41,688
See what I mean?

540
00:49:43,315 --> 00:49:45,942
Calm, controlled, moving fast.

541
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:47,319
Okay, now start punching.

542
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,029
Two lefts. Left!

543
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:51,114
Right. Don't stay still.

544
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:54,367
I'm gonna hit you
if you stay still.

545
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,873
Left, right. Left, right.

546
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:03,168
That's it. Don't stay still.

547
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:04,836
Don't stay still, that's it.

548
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,797
Back over this way.

549
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:09,549
Keep moving.

550
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:10,884
Good job!

551
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,596
There you go!

552
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:15,889
You're a natural, kid.

553
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:39,329
Hey!

554
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,915
Don't tell your mom
I took you to the gym.

555
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,918
You afraid of her?

556
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:46,753
Damn right, I am.

557
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:47,962
Me, too.

558
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,273
The water's really cold.

559
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:50,942
On top it is.

560
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,486
But not down deep.

561
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,574
Did you go to the bottom?

562
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:58,908
Sure, I did.

563
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:02,787
Is that where guys
like us belong?

564
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:06,166
Yeah.

565
00:52:14,424 --> 00:52:15,550
No!

566
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:23,516
Just don't think about it.

567
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:27,479
Hey!

568
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:30,231
Just don't think about it.

569
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:32,484
Do like I taught you.

570
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,653
Look the other way...

571
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:37,113
and enjoy the music.

572
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,651
<i>He used to take me</i>
<i>fishing every Sunday.</i>

573
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,488
<i>Every single Sunday.</i>

574
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:02,991
<i>Just me and him.</i>

575
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,289
<i>I wasn't allowed</i>
<i>to set foot in that boat</i>

576
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:10,456
<i>if he wasn't with me.</i>

577
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,052
<i>He gets arrested</i>
<i>this one Saturday night.</i>

578
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:28,224
<i>And we can't raise the money</i>
<i>to bail him out until Monday.</i>

579
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:32,103
<i>So, I figured I would</i>
<i>take the boat out, and...</i>

580
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,688
<i>he'd never find out about it.</i>

581
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,528
<i>Oh, but he found out.</i>

582
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,042
<i>He never took me fishing again.</i>

583
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,384
<i>It was the one thing</i>
<i>we loved doing together.</i>

584
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,517
<i>And he took it away</i>
<i>to punish me.</i>

585
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:31,996
Jurassic Park!

586
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,748
What are you doing here
on a Sunday?

587
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,333
You got some girls here, right?

588
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,502
I thought maybe I'd take a look.

589
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:42,882
You're a dirty
old dinosaur, homie!

590
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,886
We got Viagra too,
if you need it.

591
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:49,305
Come on, OG.

592
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:51,975
Hey!

593
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,726
I've got to give you
props, <i>viejo.</i>

594
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:56,521
You delivered us a good crop,
right here.

595
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,772
All right, now!

596
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:01,567
Lovely ladies. Smile for me!

597
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:03,069
Hmm?

598
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:07,490
Hey, come here.

599
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,701
Come on. Smile.

600
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:13,705
Ooh!

601
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:17,333
Trouble, ah, come.
She's my favorite.

602
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:20,336
Whole lotta trouble right here,
if you like that kind of stuff...

603
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:24,590
Smile.

604
00:56:36,144 --> 00:56:38,730
That's good.

605
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,885
No, no, no.

606
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:27,570
I don't--

607
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:30,865
I don't know why I'm here.

608
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:45,004
Do-- do-- do you have
family in the US?

609
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:47,340
<i>Familia?</i>

610
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,512
You want me to call?

611
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:05,108
They know?

612
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:15,243
How much?

613
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:19,705
20-- 20,000,
and they let you go?

614
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:21,040
I will be free.

615
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:25,837
Fuck...

616
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:42,770
I can't help you.

617
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,679
- Yeah?
- <i>Okay.</i>

618
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,723
<i>The Priest</i>
<i>can meet you after mass.</i>

619
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:20,516
Got it.

620
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,810
<i>Get the whole nut,</i>
<i>right? No excuses.</i>

621
01:00:09,148 --> 01:00:11,943
Hey, father!
What's the rush?

622
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,156
Fucking idiot.

623
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,150
Huh.

624
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:54,819
I...

625
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,654
I don't know
what I was thinking. Uh...

626
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:11,585
It's all there. 20,000.

627
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,840
Don't want to know where
you got this.

628
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,427
This'll buy you another month.

629
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,220
Hey, father.

630
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:23,347
Do you still take confession?

631
01:01:23,431 --> 01:01:26,517
I don't have that kind of time.
I'll see you next month.

632
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:31,647
Shit!

633
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:38,404
I shot a fucking priest.

634
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:40,114
So, where's our guy?

635
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,201
He must still be in there.

636
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:02,636
Oh!

637
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:04,722
Oh! Fuck!

638
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,447
Who the fuck are you?
Do I know you?

639
01:03:07,368 --> 01:03:08,536
Who hired you?

640
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:12,081
Fuck you.

641
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:13,666
You're gonna kill me either way.

642
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:18,879
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

643
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:21,424
You'll be dead in a few minutes.

644
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:23,551
And I'm gonna find out
where you live.

645
01:03:24,552 --> 01:03:27,096
I'm guessing
I'm gonna find someone there.

646
01:03:29,348 --> 01:03:30,474
Maybe your girl.

647
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,322
He's a big motherfucker.

648
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:49,452
Big spider tat on his neck.

649
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,039
He said you'd be hard to kill.

650
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:32,096
You don't think these guys
were there to get the 20 grand, do you?

651
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:33,681
It's not what the guy told me.

652
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:38,143
You owe anybody any money?

653
01:05:38,227 --> 01:05:40,229
Nothing worth
that kind of attention.

654
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,024
Revenge?

655
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:45,484
Now, that's a long list.

656
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:52,241
So, who the fuck are these guys?

657
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:54,535
Ah, it's just some
fucking amateurs.

658
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,957
You know, I'm starting
to worry about you a little bit.

659
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:03,419
You worried now?

660
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:08,257
Nice work.

661
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:41,624
Hey!

662
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:45,210
- Hey, what up, bud?
- You shouldn't be here.

663
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:47,880
- Oh, yeah, why not?
- Just go home.

664
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:51,425
So why don't you park
by your house?

665
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:52,843
I like my privacy.

666
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:57,306
I come all the way
out here to see you, and this is the greeting I get?

667
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,016
How do you even know
where I live?

668
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:01,060
I went through your wallet
the other day.

669
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:04,438
I know, that sounded
a little crazy out loud, right?

670
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,565
Come on!

671
01:07:06,649 --> 01:07:09,360
Cute place!

672
01:07:13,197 --> 01:07:14,990
It's a shitty rental.

673
01:07:20,996 --> 01:07:22,790
There's-- there's nothing
to do here.

674
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,710
Well, we can watch TV.

675
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:28,837
It doesn't work.

676
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:33,258
How about some music?

677
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:34,885
I don't have music.

678
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,388
- Everybody's got music.
- I don't.

679
01:07:53,529 --> 01:07:54,613
Those aren't mine.

680
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:02,788
Okay, they're mine.

681
01:08:13,674 --> 01:08:16,093
Did you notice
that I have memory problems?

682
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:20,723
Yeah.

683
01:08:20,806 --> 01:08:23,183
But I just thought
you were an alcoholic.

684
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:24,351
I am.

685
01:08:26,854 --> 01:08:28,897
I'm a real prize.

686
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,534
It's sure quiet here.

687
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:49,710
You know my son
I told you about?

688
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,879
- The one who died?
- Yeah.

689
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:56,800
He overdosed on heroin.

690
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:02,097
I'm sorry.

691
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:13,609
He was gay.

692
01:09:19,865 --> 01:09:21,617
Did that bother you?

693
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,327
I don't know.

694
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:26,205
I guess so, yeah.

695
01:09:26,288 --> 01:09:30,125
Maybe if I'd been around more
when he was growing up...

696
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:32,169
things would've been different.

697
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,008
So what, you think
you're so fucking macho,

698
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,551
it's just gonna rub off on him?

699
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:42,346
Shit don't work like that.

700
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:58,904
We aren't gonna end well,
you and me.

701
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,489
You know that, right?

702
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:14,920
Yeah, we're like that scene
in the movies

703
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:16,421
where the gasoline...

704
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,552
moves slowly...

705
01:10:23,846 --> 01:10:26,056
towards the flame.

706
01:10:30,686 --> 01:10:32,229
Yeah, sooner or later...

707
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,789
But not tonight.

708
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:17,733
Hey!

709
01:11:24,156 --> 01:11:25,490
It's me.

710
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:27,117
Yeah, I know.

711
01:11:29,578 --> 01:11:30,829
What are you doing?

712
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:36,960
Listening to that guy
playing the guitar.

713
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:44,635
What guitar?

714
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:49,431
He-- he was just playing.
Didn't you hear him?

715
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:52,351
No.

716
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:55,854
You're hearing things.

717
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:26,885
I'm taking my daughter
and her kids out to dinner on Friday night.

718
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:28,428
I want you to come with me.

719
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:32,849
You sure about that?

720
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:36,061
Yeah. I'm sure.

721
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,285
Oh!

722
01:12:58,333 --> 01:12:59,918
You look nice.

723
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:01,920
I need a drink.

724
01:13:02,004 --> 01:13:05,090
"Oh, why, thank you.
You look lovely, too."

725
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,137
Hey! Can I get a drink?

726
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,513
Sure.

727
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,306
Uh, double bourbon, rocks.

728
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,559
- What kind?
- The cheap kind.

729
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:20,439
And for the lady?

730
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:23,066
Uh, just
a glass of water, please.

731
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:30,198
Calm down,
Sally, they'll be here!

732
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:31,491
It's all good. Come on.

733
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:42,919
They aren't coming.
They aren't coming.

734
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:47,466
Maybe-- maybe I-- maybe
I gave her the wrong address.

735
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:50,343
Shit, I must've given them
the wrong address.

736
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:53,472
I'm sorry, but I simply
cannot hold this table any longer.

737
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,182
Fuck off!

738
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:58,435
- Excuse me?
- I said, fuck off!

739
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,353
And who says "simply cannot?"

740
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:02,773
No one talks like that.

741
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:04,274
Would you speak to our manager?

742
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:07,527
No, no, no!
That's not necessary.

743
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:08,904
- Yeah--
- No!

744
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:10,781
- Okay.
- No, no!

745
01:14:10,864 --> 01:14:12,908
Hey, hey, okay--

746
01:14:12,991 --> 01:14:14,951
What the fuck
are you looking at?

747
01:14:15,035 --> 01:14:17,037
Huh? High-end motherfuckers!

748
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,830
Hey. Okay.

749
01:14:18,914 --> 01:14:20,582
We were supposed to--
Hey, hey, hey!

750
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,167
Let's just go home.

751
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,128
Where's the person
we were supposed to meet?

752
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:26,379
Daisy.

753
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:27,589
- Daisy?
- Yeah...

754
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,341
What a-- what about Colin?

755
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:31,468
Colin couldn't make it.

756
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,719
Daisy?

757
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:36,014
Yeah, your daughter.

758
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:37,766
My daughter's not coming,
is she?

759
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,893
No, I don't think
she's going to be able to--

760
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,895
I gave her the wrong address.

761
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,480
- What-- what-- my--
- Hm?

762
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:46,525
My-- my daughter's not coming,
is she?

763
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:48,068
No, she's not coming.

764
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:49,820
What-- what's her name?

765
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:52,072
Your daughter's name
is Daisy, baby.

766
01:16:06,313 --> 01:16:07,731
W-- what--

767
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,232
What the hell's happening here?

768
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:11,276
Why didn't you tell me
you were sick?

769
01:16:14,154 --> 01:16:15,530
You told her?

770
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:17,616
Yeah. I called her last night.

771
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:19,951
I mean, I thought,
you know, you were--

772
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:22,204
- You fucking told her?
- Hey!

773
01:16:22,287 --> 01:16:23,663
Yeah, she should know.

774
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:26,333
Get out of my house!

775
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:28,585
Dad, stop.
She didn't mean anything.

776
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:31,087
Get out, or I'll throw you out.
Crazy fucking bitch!

777
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:32,505
Cut it out!

778
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:36,218
So, you want to hit me?

779
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:38,929
You want to hit me? Okay.

780
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:42,515
Okay, fucking hit me.
Hit me, you fucking pussy. I know you want to.

781
01:16:42,599 --> 01:16:45,560
Dre, get back in the car.

782
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:48,688
Dre! Please!
Go get in the car right now.

783
01:16:50,065 --> 01:16:51,107
Go!

784
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,390
I didn't want you to know.

785
01:17:23,473 --> 01:17:25,934
Yeah, okay, well,
she didn't deserve that.

786
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,146
Fuck.

787
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:33,900
Yeah.

788
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:41,324
Why-- why didn't you come
to dinner last night?

789
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:43,827
Says the guy who walked away,
and never came back.

790
01:17:44,828 --> 01:17:46,121
Fuck.

791
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:57,007
I've got to go pack, 'cause now
we've got to be out in two days.

792
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,301
Where-- where will you go?

793
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:01,845
I'll figure it out.

794
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:03,680
Is there--
is there anything I can do?

795
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:08,059
I can, uh, take care of myself.

796
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,734
Are you gonna get treatment?

797
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:16,860
I don't know.

798
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:20,989
Well, you got a doctor?

799
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:23,867
I did. That bitch can't help me.

800
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,035
Christ.

801
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:31,124
Hey.

802
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,335
You need my help
to find a new doctor?

803
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,213
Why-- why would you do that?

804
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:45,263
Well, if you need my help,
let me know.

805
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,525
Life's a shitstorm, isn't it?

806
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:44,114
Uh, what's her name?

807
01:19:46,074 --> 01:19:47,325
What's her fucking name?

808
01:19:49,744 --> 01:19:51,121
Fuck.

809
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:54,958
Yeah.

810
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:58,962
Maybe-- maybe my son.

811
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:01,506
He's dead.
Yeah, he was a big dude.

812
01:20:01,589 --> 01:20:03,675
Dude, dude...

813
01:20:03,758 --> 01:20:07,262
He had-- had...

814
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,889
Ta-- ta-- tattoo, tattoo.

815
01:20:09,973 --> 01:20:11,891
Big-- big dude, tattoo...

816
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:15,061
Big dude, tattoo--
tattoo on-- on his neck.

817
01:20:15,145 --> 01:20:18,398
I can't remember.

818
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:21,985
You fuckin' idiot!
You fuckin' idiot, fuck you!

819
01:20:22,068 --> 01:20:24,946
Big dude. Fuck you. Tattoo!

820
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,532
Tattoo! Fuck you! Fuck you!

821
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:28,658
Fuck you!

822
01:20:30,452 --> 01:20:32,579
Fuck you, you, you!

823
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:41,546
Here comes the packing train!
Choo-choo!

824
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:44,090
Thank you. Keep it coming.

825
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:51,222
Choo-choo!

826
01:20:51,306 --> 01:20:53,141
Train is leaving the station.

827
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:04,861
What?

828
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:07,155
Um, I need to talk to Dre.

829
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:12,368
All right.

830
01:21:22,504 --> 01:21:23,588
Hey.

831
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:31,012
Can we talk?

832
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:37,852
Dre, I...

833
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:44,400
It's hard.

834
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:47,820
Life-- life-- life is hard.

835
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:50,031
Mm-hmm.

836
01:21:52,242 --> 01:21:53,368
I, uh...

837
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:15,807
What you saw yesterday...

838
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:16,975
my anger...

839
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:21,854
What I'm saying
is don't be like that.

840
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:24,482
Don't be like me.

841
01:22:55,597 --> 01:22:56,723
Fucking idiot.

842
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:13,156
40,000 dollars.

843
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:18,328
It's, uh, it's for
a down payment on a house...

844
01:23:19,537 --> 01:23:21,122
For my daughter, Daisy.

845
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:28,421
Mr. Connor, I know
that's a lot of money...

846
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:34,636
I'm willing to pay
whatever interest you decide on.

847
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:39,349
Mr. Connor...

848
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,480
So, Mr. Connor...

849
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:49,817
I-- I know 40-- 40,000
is a lot of money, but...

850
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:52,987
I've been working for you
for 30 years.

851
01:23:53,071 --> 01:23:55,531
30 long years. And...

852
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:15,927
Mr. Connor?

853
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:19,055
Have a seat.

854
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:25,228
- Who's, uh...
- He works for me.

855
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:32,193
So, uh--

856
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:34,112
I saw Dr. Gruber yesterday.

857
01:24:34,195 --> 01:24:35,738
He came by for his Oxy money.

858
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:39,158
Okay.

859
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:43,496
He said something about

860
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:46,874
you maybe having some sort of
brain disease or something.

861
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,418
He said I might.

862
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:56,217
I mean, I-- I can't even put
into words how sorry I am--

863
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,385
Get to the point.

864
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:01,556
I have to let you go.

865
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,268
Let me go?

866
01:25:05,351 --> 01:25:07,186
Boss!

867
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:09,856
It's-- it's me! I'm fine.

868
01:25:10,857 --> 01:25:12,942
Please.

869
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:14,527
What about the other day?

870
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,487
The-- the-- the shooters?

871
01:25:16,571 --> 01:25:18,614
I got all your money.

872
01:25:18,698 --> 01:25:20,491
What's your phone number?

873
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,212
617...

874
01:25:42,305 --> 01:25:43,514
What's your address?

875
01:25:53,691 --> 01:25:56,360
"Gee, SpongeBob,
I don't know--"

876
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:58,446
- Kyle!
- No, fuck this guy!

877
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:06,788
I'm sorry.

878
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:09,624
I can't have somebody in
your condition working for me.

879
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:10,875
It's just too risky.

880
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:20,718
So, that's it?

881
01:26:23,054 --> 01:26:24,806
After 30 years?

882
01:26:26,307 --> 01:26:27,517
Afraid so.

883
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:37,652
This--
this doesn't make sense, boss.

884
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:41,072
Come on, man.
Let's not prolong this.

885
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,116
The door's over there.

886
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:46,911
Or do you need directions?

887
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:15,064
- First day on the job?
- Yeah.

888
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:28,619
You...

889
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:32,206
you hired those guys to kill me.

890
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,002
Did you know about this?

891
01:27:36,085 --> 01:27:37,712
Look...

892
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:39,630
you just walk away, all right?

893
01:27:39,714 --> 01:27:41,132
There'll be no repercussions.

894
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:42,758
I like repercussions.

895
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:44,510
Open your safe.

896
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:46,721
There's no winning here for you.

897
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:48,931
Open your fucking safe!

898
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,976
You're fucking crazy. Hey!

899
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:53,477
- No!
- Hey!

900
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:56,188
Don't kill him! Don't kill him!

901
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:57,523
Don't kill him, all right?

902
01:27:57,607 --> 01:27:58,900
I'm opening the safe.

903
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:06,908
Back up!

904
01:28:10,912 --> 01:28:12,038
Fill the bag up.

905
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:13,331
And the guns.

906
01:28:28,137 --> 01:28:30,890
I came in here
to ask you for a favor.

907
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:34,685
And you get rid of me
like I'm dogshit

908
01:28:34,769 --> 01:28:36,646
on the bottom
of your fucking shoe.

909
01:28:39,106 --> 01:28:40,191
Come on, man.

910
01:28:41,484 --> 01:28:42,735
Come on, man.

911
01:28:43,778 --> 01:28:46,447
I mean, isn't the money enough?
Can't you--

912
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:47,698
Can't you just walk away?

913
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:58,584
Yeah...

914
01:29:07,802 --> 01:29:09,261
Can you make me a promise?

915
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:13,140
The kid stays alive.

916
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:16,978
Sit down.

917
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:24,944
All right.

918
01:29:57,101 --> 01:30:00,813
What's the fucking emergency
I had to rush down here in the middle of the night for?

919
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:03,190
Like you have
anything better to do.

920
01:30:03,274 --> 01:30:05,234
I was playing poker.

921
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:07,820
I've seen you play cards.
I did you a favor.

922
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,618
Jesus.
You going on a shooting spree?

923
01:30:14,702 --> 01:30:15,786
Maybe.

924
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:20,166
This is for you.

925
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:23,335
You've got my attention.

926
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,131
Can you get a cashier's check
for 70 grand?

927
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:28,340
Sure.

928
01:30:30,551 --> 01:30:34,388
I want you to put
a down payment on this house.

929
01:30:34,472 --> 01:30:36,766
Take the check to my daughter,

930
01:30:36,849 --> 01:30:39,977
and help her with the paperwork
and tax stuff.

931
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:45,524
She's a bitch on wheels,
so watch yourself.

932
01:30:55,951 --> 01:30:57,036
Are you okay?

933
01:30:59,038 --> 01:31:01,415
Yeah. I'm good.

934
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:06,170
Should I ask you
where you got the dough?

935
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:15,137
It was nice knowing you.

936
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:26,649
Come on, come on, pick up.

937
01:31:37,535 --> 01:31:38,577
Fuck.

938
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:55,511
You home?

939
01:32:18,993 --> 01:32:20,744
Holy shit.

940
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:21,912
Hey, buddy.

941
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:28,252
How did you-- What--

942
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:30,421
Why the hell
would you do this to yourself?

943
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:32,756
Boo-boo.

944
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:36,468
- Come on.
- Oh! Shit.

945
01:32:36,552 --> 01:32:39,889
- Come on.
- Oh, shit.

946
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:42,808
Let's get you up.
It's after three.

947
01:32:42,892 --> 01:32:43,976
Oh, shit.

948
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:49,773
- Lay down with me.
- No.

949
01:32:56,155 --> 01:32:57,239
Ow.

950
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,745
How do you feel?

951
01:33:05,289 --> 01:33:07,291
I'm sorry I screwed up.

952
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:16,634
When I said things
weren't going to end well,

953
01:33:16,717 --> 01:33:19,511
I knew it would be me
that would fuck things up.

954
01:33:19,595 --> 01:33:21,013
Mm.

955
01:34:21,407 --> 01:34:22,491
You need help.

956
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:27,413
You're helping me.

957
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:31,583
I'm serious.

958
01:34:38,966 --> 01:34:40,592
You are helping me.

959
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:46,950
If it ain't my old friend,
Jurassic Park.

960
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:49,620
I want to talk some business.

961
01:35:58,754 --> 01:35:59,880
What's your business?

962
01:36:01,006 --> 01:36:02,966
I want to buy one of your girls.

963
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:07,805
You fall in love, <i>viejo?</i>

964
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:12,559
You gonna pimp her out?

965
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:18,065
You and me,
we're pieces of shit.

966
01:36:18,148 --> 01:36:21,693
Ah, sure, you're a funny guy.

967
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:26,740
We live off pain and weakness.
We're bullies.

968
01:36:26,824 --> 01:36:29,034
And you think buying a <i>puta</i>
gonna change all that?

969
01:36:32,913 --> 01:36:34,123
30,000.

970
01:36:42,965 --> 01:36:43,882
Not bad.

971
01:36:48,762 --> 01:36:50,597
Which one do you want?

972
01:36:50,681 --> 01:36:52,516
The little one
with the curly hair.

973
01:36:52,599 --> 01:36:54,309
And the blonde bangs.

974
01:36:58,730 --> 01:36:59,857
She ain't for sale.

975
01:37:00,941 --> 01:37:01,984
Hey.

976
01:37:02,818 --> 01:37:05,654
I'm offering you
10,000 above asking price.

977
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:08,282
- She ain't for sale.
- Why not?

978
01:37:16,457 --> 01:37:19,626
One of the <i>puteros </i>got a little carried away with her tonight.

979
01:37:25,507 --> 01:37:27,050
What was her name?

980
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:30,012
Araceli.

981
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:32,890
What are you gonna do with her?

982
01:37:34,433 --> 01:37:35,517
I don't know, man.

983
01:37:42,191 --> 01:37:44,276
You can't change
the world, <i>viejo.</i>

984
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:45,819
World don't want to be changed.

985
01:37:52,618 --> 01:37:56,413
I really don't want to hurt
anyone else, not even you.

986
01:37:56,497 --> 01:37:58,582
So, just do what I say, okay?

987
01:38:00,584 --> 01:38:02,002
Come on.

988
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:26,109
Come on, tell your boy
at the front door to go home.

989
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:27,611
- Do it!
- Armando.

990
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:30,489
- You can knock off now.
- You sure?

991
01:38:30,572 --> 01:38:32,908
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got it covered.

992
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:34,576
All right.

993
01:38:39,706 --> 01:38:41,083
Get the girls out of here.

994
01:38:52,511 --> 01:38:54,137
Johns stay inside!

995
01:38:55,389 --> 01:38:57,140
Johns stay inside.

996
01:38:58,267 --> 01:39:01,103
Hey, you, inside! Inside!

997
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:11,947
Which way do you want me to go?

998
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:14,074
<i>Cocina.</i>

999
01:39:14,157 --> 01:39:15,659
Girls, <i>cocina, cocina.</i>

1000
01:39:16,827 --> 01:39:18,078
You, sit down.

1001
01:39:20,247 --> 01:39:21,331
You, go!

1002
01:39:23,709 --> 01:39:26,670
<i>Dinero, </i>inside.
Bring. Bring in here.

1003
01:39:29,256 --> 01:39:32,342
Come on, here you go.

1004
01:39:32,426 --> 01:39:34,261
Go, go!

1005
01:39:36,138 --> 01:39:37,180
Pay them!

1006
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:41,226
Easy, easy.

1007
01:40:01,455 --> 01:40:04,166
Yeah, that's <i>sureño </i>style
right there, bitch.

1008
01:40:07,961 --> 01:40:10,547
You're bleeding out good, <i>viejo.</i>

1009
01:40:10,631 --> 01:40:13,300
I can finish it off.

1010
01:40:13,383 --> 01:40:15,010
You want me to make it quick?

1011
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:18,889
After you, fuckpig.

1012
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:32,861
Just go. Go!

1013
01:40:56,385 --> 01:40:58,178
Don't wake up your mom.

1014
01:40:59,346 --> 01:41:00,514
You hear me?

1015
01:41:16,613 --> 01:41:18,115
Don't come any closer.

1016
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,201
Are you okay?

1017
01:41:21,284 --> 01:41:22,494
Yeah, I'm fine.

1018
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,623
Listen to me, Dre.

1019
01:41:26,707 --> 01:41:30,585
You're gonna hear some bad stuff
about me in the next few days.

1020
01:41:34,423 --> 01:41:38,552
Maybe the only way
for me to do something right

1021
01:41:38,635 --> 01:41:40,387
is by doing something bad.

1022
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:45,684
I-- I don't get it.

1023
01:41:47,352 --> 01:41:50,439
It might not make
any sense to you now, but--

1024
01:41:59,322 --> 01:42:00,574
I tried.

1025
01:42:02,576 --> 01:42:03,827
I tried.

1026
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:06,663
Go back inside.

1027
01:42:06,747 --> 01:42:09,124
I-- I'll be fine. Go on.

1028
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,500
Go on, go on.

1029
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:28,495
Hello?

1030
01:43:52,769 --> 01:43:53,937
Hello?

1031
01:43:55,522 --> 01:43:56,982
Anybody here?
