1
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:21,447
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

2
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:24,124
Who's been naughty?

3
00:00:24,163 --> 00:00:26,373
- It is dead center on your brand.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:27,935
- Let's get a picture.
- I love pictures.

5
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:29,209
Hey.

6
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,649
Smile.

7
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:34,883
Another one.

8
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:52,317
Oi, gorgeous.

9
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:55,188
- Vodka soda, hold the soda.
- Thank you.

10
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:57,406
Drinks are free,
but the food's bloody awful.

11
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,156
Ahi tartare, for fuck's sakes.

12
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:00,798
Okay. Just let me shake
a few more hands,

13
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,865
and then we'll be
out of here... whoa.

14
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,660
Easy, tiger.
I want you on your "A" game.

15
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:07,665
- "A" game?
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:09,167
You know,
I like the sound of that.

17
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,418
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:11,999
Merry Christmas.

19
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:15,006
Becca.

20
00:01:15,089 --> 00:01:19,429
New senior director,
digital marketing.

21
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:22,388
- Uh, yeah. How did you know?
- I have my sources.

22
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,180
And your nametag.

23
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:27,734
Yes, that, too.

24
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:30,398
- Uh, this is my husband, Billy.
- Great to meet you.

25
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:31,728
Billy Butcher.

26
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:34,902
Becca, you handled
my takeover, right?

27
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:36,742
Y-Yes, I-I did.

28
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,527
- You saw it?
- I loved it.

29
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,821
- U-Uh, wow. Thank you.
- No, thank you.

30
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,676
- What'd you take over?
- Vought's Twitter account.

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,660
- Yeah.
- Your brilliant wife here

32
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:46,162
did all the work.

33
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:48,413
She posted my photos,
she wrote my messages.

34
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:49,956
It was exceptional.

35
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:52,629
All right, so they thought
it was you up there,

36
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:54,338
but it was really Becca.

37
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:55,731
Bit deceptive, isn't it?

38
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:57,335
Uh, no, Billy, that's what we do

39
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:59,181
'cause Homelander's busy
saving lives.

40
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:01,216
It's okay, it's okay.
I-It... you're right.

41
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,890
It's a little dishonest,

42
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:05,598
but I'm all thumbs when
it comes to that kind of stuff,

43
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,389
so leave it to the experts.

44
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:09,983
Listen, I would
love to talk to you

45
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,559
about maybe quarterbacking
the rest of my social media.

46
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:14,605
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

47
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:16,188
My dad, he always said,

48
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:20,073
"Surround yourself with people
smarter than you."

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,870
Oh, my, uh, better half is, uh,

50
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:26,368
wanting my attention, but maybe
we could chat tomorrow.

51
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,679
That sounds wonderful.
Thank you.

52
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:30,043
Thank you.
Greet to meet you, pal.

53
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,751
Good to meet you.

54
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,171
Love that accent.

55
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:38,924
Hello, beautiful.

56
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:40,514
How the fuck does he walk around

57
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,509
in that sweaty fucking wetsuit
all day long,

58
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:44,931
- balls mashed up against his leg like pancakes?
- Oh, shh.

59
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,600
- What?
- You promised to behave.

60
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,679
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah?

61
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:49,934
Yeah.

62
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,409
Hi.

63
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:12,099
- Huh.
- Hmm.

64
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:15,481
I didn't realize you were
such a cigar aficionado.

65
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,729
I really, I just...

66
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:22,902
Mm. I can't get enough
of huge gross logs

67
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:25,073
of filterless tobacco.

68
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,459
- This is all really nice.
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:44,593
But...

70
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:47,092
There is a "but" coming.

71
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:48,724
Okay.

72
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:53,101
But why did you bring me
to a hotel?

73
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,680
Hmm? And not your place?

74
00:04:55,726 --> 00:04:58,976
Well, you know.
I mean, yeah, sure, my Dad

75
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:02,531
could make you
some post-coital pizza rolls.

76
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:06,566
I just figured this would be
slightly less humiliating.

77
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:09,782
Yeah, all right.

78
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:11,993
Yeah.

79
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:15,004
Yeah, very convincing.

80
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:17,287
You okay? What's going on?

81
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,213
It's just...

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,670
I've never seen your place,
or your job.

83
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:28,304
You're kind of a mystery to me.

84
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,142
T-That's hot, right?

85
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:34,137
Look, you got to understand
that my dad

86
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:38,771
was nothing but corny jokes
and expensive gifts,

87
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:43,691
until he was gone, and all
the money along with him.

88
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:47,742
I know that
that's not you, but...

89
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,580
I need to know that the hotel
is a nice thing

90
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:56,247
and not a red flag thing.

91
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:02,749
I quit my job.

92
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,921
Um, I'm sorry, I-I...

93
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:09,724
I really should've told you.

94
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:15,847
After Robin, programming
other people's remotes,

95
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:18,849
it felt kind of pointless.

96
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:24,153
And yeah, I mean,
you can-you can meet my dad,

97
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,609
but you're gonna
regret asking that.

98
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,410
So everything's okay?

99
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,830
It's great.

100
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,206
No red flags.

101
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:47,054
Hmm.

102
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:53,953
Now, I know this is not
as swanky as New York City,

103
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:57,617
but to have a hero like you in
a place like Sandusky, I mean,

104
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:01,288
everyone down at the local
branch is just tickled pink.

105
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:04,158
- Yeah.
- Now, we got Cedar Point,

106
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:07,786
biggest roller-coaster park
in the whole U.S. of A.

107
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:11,205
We're just a couple short hours
from Cleveland or Toledo.

108
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:14,925
And Lake Erie? Right here,

109
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,967
- if you want to swim.
- Oh, yeah.

110
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,850
Ooh. Uh...

111
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,347
There it is.

112
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,059
- What's this?
- That's your per diem.

113
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:23,889
You get $75 a day.

114
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,984
Grocery store,
right down the street.

115
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,609
To make my own food?

116
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,107
There's a Dairy Queen, too.

117
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:31,319
Like Blizzards and stuff?

118
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:32,738
You betcha.

119
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:34,316
Well...

120
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:36,611
I mean, what about
my crime itinerary?

121
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:38,985
I think the best thing's just
to, you know, get out there

122
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,301
and put some points
on the board.

123
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:41,905
Not much crime in Sandusky.

124
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:43,832
I mean, we're not a shithole
like Akron.

125
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,080
But if something comes up,
we'll call.

126
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:50,836
You'll call?

127
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:53,958
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

128
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,078
- Oh, this is killing me.
- Come on.

129
00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:33,802
Damn.

130
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:35,797
Oh, no fucking way.

131
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,839
You need 3,000 calories an hour,
or you're gonna pass out.

132
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:42,255
I can't do this shit, man.

133
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:44,354
Tough shit.

134
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:46,139
You heard the doc.

135
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:49,233
Your heart is getting bigger,
balls are getting smaller,

136
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:50,979
your bone density's for shit.

137
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:52,901
That Compound V shit
is killing you.

138
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,459
Hey. Don't even say it out loud,
all right?

139
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:55,794
You don't know shit about it,
you understand?

140
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:57,818
I don't want to know.

141
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:00,991
And you're done, okay?
No more fucking around.

142
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:03,031
Did you see my last time
out there?

143
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:05,905
Sioux City's got a fucking
faster runner than me.

144
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:08,463
Then no more club openings
and commercial shoots.

145
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:10,117
Okay? None of that shit.
We train.

146
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:11,535
Back to the basics.

147
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,463
Nobody gets it back at my age.

148
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:18,013
I'm gonna be a freak show
like Ben Johnson,

149
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:19,878
racing against horses.

150
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:23,095
At least you'll still
be breathing.

151
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:28,729
Shit.

152
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,977
- I got to go.
- Where?

153
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,910
- What's going on?
- I missed you guys.

154
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:46,408
Just wanted to see
your smiling faces.

155
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:49,161
Take a seat, buddy.

156
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:56,502
And, truth be known,
I felt like we were overdue

157
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:59,085
a little heart-to-heart.

158
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:02,341
A rap session,
maybe a little tough love.

159
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:04,644
What's that supposed to mean?

160
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:10,233
It means that lately,
some of you

161
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:14,097
have been, eh,
a little out of sorts.

162
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:17,479
Erratic.

163
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,574
Unreliable.

164
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,530
Downright sloppy.

165
00:11:23,572 --> 00:11:25,532
Not you, Noir.
You've been great.

166
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:28,084
But the rest of you...

167
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:35,419
It is fair to say
that I am disappointed.

168
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,589
Got to keep your eye
on the ball, guys.

169
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,919
The enemies
are storming the gates.

170
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:45,184
I mean, we're not even The Seven
anymore, we're down to five.

171
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,678
We're dropping
like fucking flies,

172
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:51,061
but at least now I know why.

173
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:56,228
Uh...

174
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:59,441
Why...

175
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:01,573
Is this a joke?
Why is Hughie up there?

176
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,200
I don't understand.
Who is this guy?

177
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:05,656
This guy is Hugh Campbell.

178
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:08,987
He and Starlight
are going steady.

179
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:13,254
He's also one of the guys
who killed Translucent.

180
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:14,998
Wait, what?

181
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,500
As well as blackmailing

182
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,461
Mesmer, Ezekiel, Popclaw

183
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:22,174
- and God knows who else.
- Popclaw?

184
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:25,594
No. No, no, no.
You... That-that is insane.

185
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:29,184
Starlight, sticks and stones
won't break my bones,

186
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:31,721
- but words...
- No, sir.

187
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:35,095
I'm sorry. I wasn't...

188
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:37,023
It's just, he's not...

189
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,980
I mean, why would he do that?

190
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:42,693
Good question.
A-Train, over to you.

191
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:45,704
- What?
- Oh, boy.

192
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:49,567
That little egg of yours
is still scrambled, huh?

193
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:53,123
How about now?

194
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:56,001
Oh, shit.

195
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,999
I know this guy.

196
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,644
You did smash
through his girlfriend,

197
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:01,038
so I should hope so.

198
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:04,296
Robin s-something or other.

199
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:09,259
I-I remember now, I-I've seen
him outside of Popclaw's place.

200
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:12,512
He was all in my face.

201
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:15,636
- You're fucking this guy?
- S... Okay, slow down.

202
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:17,524
I don't know what's going on,

203
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:21,441
but Hughie is not capable
of anything close to this.

204
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:24,111
Well, that is true, actually.
That's very true.

205
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:26,241
He is just a man, and,

206
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:28,358
by the looks of it,
not much of one.

207
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,565
But... but hear me out.

208
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:34,695
W-What if he was helped? Hmm?

209
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:37,455
Say someone,

210
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:39,077
I don't know,

211
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:41,174
got him in to see Ezekiel

212
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:43,959
and got rid of the Deep.

213
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:46,304
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

214
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:50,049
Keep those hands down
by your sides, missy.

215
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:55,096
Sit down.

216
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:05,475
Now... I know

217
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:08,145
that you want to make
this whole Deep thing

218
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,065
an "All the single ladies"
moment.

219
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:11,873
Power, right?

220
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:14,697
But really, what you've done

221
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:17,753
is pulled off
every criminal's wet dream.

222
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:21,458
I mean, The Seven
is down by two.

223
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,210
I just can't help noticing
that it all started

224
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:27,212
when you came along,
which makes me wonder,

225
00:14:27,255 --> 00:14:30,045
which one of us is next, hmm?

226
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:31,592
You bitch.

227
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:34,755
- I didn't do anything.
- Enough!

228
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:37,345
We're a different fucking breed.

229
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,980
We shine with the golden light

230
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:42,807
of providence, but you,
you've been helping these

231
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:44,234
fucking mud people

232
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:47,482
- to go against us.
- No.

233
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:50,736
Shut your fucking mouth,
young lady.

234
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:54,951
If you were in my position...

235
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,000
...what would you do to you?

236
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:03,503
Homelander, that's enough.

237
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,542
You got something to add, Maeve?

238
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,839
She didn't know.

239
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:12,681
Well, she stinks of adrenaline

240
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:15,597
and her heart's beating
like a little rabbit.

241
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:17,847
The only thing she's guilty of
is being fucking stupid.

242
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,099
She obviously fell
for this Hugh Campbell guy

243
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:23,233
and he's pumping her
for information,

244
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,770
so back off, leave her alone.

245
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:33,863
Wow.

246
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:36,025
Starlight,

247
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:38,294
you must be something special.

248
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,116
Hmm?

249
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:43,752
I can't remember the last time
Maeve gave a shit ab...

250
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,380
Well, gave a shit about anyone,

251
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,417
really.

252
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
And if I say no?

253
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:04,186
Come on.

254
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:06,307
I got this.

255
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:09,074
It's you and me,

256
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:11,397
remember?

257
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:19,368
Don't say
I never do anything for you.

258
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,116
All right.

259
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:28,125
You want her, you got her.
She's your responsibility now.

260
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:30,498
I just hope
you're right about her,

261
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:32,545
for both your sakes.

262
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:35,679
Class dismissed.

263
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:49,935
Look at this.

264
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:52,031
Oh, no. You don't stir,

265
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,987
you fold. Like this.

266
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:58,739
Now that's what
makes them spongy.

267
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:01,082
Here you go.

268
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,998
She wants to know
where you were.

269
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:13,173
That's a compelling
fucking question.

270
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,215
Hey, can we talk?

271
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:18,639
That's what we're doing,
innit?

272
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:20,427
No, I mean...

273
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,470
There ain't no secrets here,
son. Spit it out.

274
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:25,925
Stop being an asshole,
just talk to the guy.

275
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:27,766
Hughie doesn't mind.
Do you, Hughie?

276
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:35,404
Okay, fine. I don't think
I can do this anymore.

277
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,409
- Do what?
- This.

278
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:42,868
I mean, Vought,
whatever with Kimiko,

279
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:45,249
it's-it's awful,
and you got to stop it,

280
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,707
- but I can't.
- Right.

281
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,327
You just want to kick back,
drink a few Mai Tais,

282
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,375
and let us do all the work,
is that it?

283
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:54,049
You know, I managed to go
my whole life

284
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:55,481
without seeing someone
die horribly,

285
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,165
and now I'm up to about
a half dozen,

286
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:58,585
- so I think I'm good.
- Please.

287
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:00,933
You're a fucking killer, Hughie,

288
00:18:00,969 --> 00:18:03,719
just like the rest of us.

289
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:06,023
Now, why don't you
stop pissing around

290
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:08,887
and tell everybody what this
is really all about?

291
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:11,305
- Yeah?
- Fine.

292
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:12,984
Annie.

293
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:14,153
- Fuck.
- Okay?

294
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,070
It's about Annie.

295
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:20,364
Fucking finally.

296
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:25,485
He's been sneaking off to
give her one at Lincoln Grand.

297
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:27,722
- You've been following me?
- Like you gave me a choice.

298
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:30,416
She doesn't know anything, okay?
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

299
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,600
- All right? We'll just...
- Just what?

300
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,674
Fuck off to Epcot? The Hamptons?

301
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,130
Maybe pump out a few
flying babies?

302
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,920
No. I... I don't know.

303
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:39,093
No, you don't know
'cause you ain't thinking,

304
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:41,722
- except with your dick.
- You're wrong about her.

305
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,850
That bitch is fucking
playing you,

306
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:46,508
and you're too fucking blind
to see it.

307
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:48,556
Right, so better to be loyal
to a dead woman

308
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,980
who doesn't know
and doesn't care?

309
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,018
How's that working out for you?

310
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,289
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Hughie.

311
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:16,254
Long time no talk.

312
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:18,314
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

313
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:19,588
Who's this?

314
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,221
I thought you would
recognize my voice.

315
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,387
You spend so much time obsessing
about me, am I right?

316
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:27,306
- Say hi to your baby boy, Dad.
- Oh. H-Hey, hey, hey, Hughie.

317
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:29,450
Why is he here? He says you're
in some kind of trouble.

318
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:30,684
Dad, are you okay?

319
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:33,523
Oh, o-okay.

320
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:36,061
He's fine.
Remington Steele's almost on.

321
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,016
A-Train, listen to me.

322
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:41,146
Oh, shit, if he's burned,
then I'm fucked.

323
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:42,574
He's on fucking Medicaid.

324
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:43,912
He's harmless. Let him go.

325
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:46,027
My place is burned.
They've got me.

326
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:48,374
Oh, my God.

327
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,410
Get your ass over here
in 20 minutes,

328
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:52,623
or I'm gonna burst through him
like a fucking piñata,

329
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:55,174
do you understand me?
Just like I did your girlfriend.

330
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,538
- Yeah. Got it.
- And, Hughie,

331
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:59,054
alone. If I catch a whiff,

332
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:00,507
a whiff of one of your

333
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:02,337
- little asshole friends...
- I got it.

334
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,680
All my bank accounts are frozen
and flagged. Monique,

335
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,299
listen, when you get this,

336
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:11,676
leave the house immediately.
Lay low and call me.

337
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,828
- Well, I hope she was fucking worth it.
- It's not Annie.

338
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:15,329
- She doesn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

339
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:17,693
- I'm gonna fucking do her in.
- The hell you will!

340
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,020
Hey, hold on a second.
She doesn't know. It wasn't her.

341
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,436
She's never seen me before.

342
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:24,574
Not once, not ever.
So how did I get burned?

343
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,540
Mesmer. You fucking idiots

344
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,197
had to go to Mesmer.

345
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:33,865
Fuck me.

346
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:39,134
Thank you.

347
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:41,839
That was not smart,
to sleep with her.

348
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:54,021
- Hughie.
- Dad.

349
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,770
He's acting strange.

350
00:20:57,812 --> 00:20:59,272
You know, real jumpy.

351
00:20:59,314 --> 00:21:01,904
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he...

352
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:04,651
Right here, sport.

353
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:07,534
Look what I got.

354
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:12,494
Special 2016 Comic-Con edition?

355
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:14,495
What, did they make, like,
a few hundred of these?

356
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:16,997
Watch out, A-Train's coming.

357
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,460
You were a fan!

358
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:22,171
You were a fan, and not,
like, a dabbler, no,

359
00:21:22,212 --> 00:21:24,382
you were super fan 99.

360
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:25,592
Excuse me, sir.

361
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,193
- W-What is this about?
- Shut the fuck up.

362
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:29,717
Dad, it's gonna be okay. Hey.

363
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:32,261
I came alone.

364
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:34,465
You let him go.

365
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:37,517
Alone, huh?

366
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,440
- Wow.
- Ah!

367
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,149
You really did come alone.

368
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:43,542
Next time... there's not gonna be
a next time, but next time...

369
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:47,106
have at least
a few cards up your sleeve.

370
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:50,993
Okay. You mean, um,
you mean, like this?

371
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:56,661
- Jonesing for a little jet fuel?
- W-What is that?

372
00:21:56,704 --> 00:21:58,624
I don't know what that shit is.

373
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:00,285
Oh, you don't?

374
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,093
So you don't mind if I do this.

375
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:04,087
- No, fuck!
- What?

376
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:05,458
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

377
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:06,625
I have a bigger dose.

378
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,234
I have a real dose
hidden somewhere outside.

379
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:09,798
Let him go, I hand it over,

380
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:12,182
then you can do whatever
you want with me.

381
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,930
Now tell me what's better,
the rush or knowing that,

382
00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:17,143
as long as you take it,
you'll be the fastest?

383
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:27,935
If you try anything,

384
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,656
I can catch up to dear old daddy
in a millisecond.

385
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:32,527
- Dad, time to go.
- Not without you.

386
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:33,914
I'll be right behind you.

387
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,550
I am not leaving you
with him, all right.

388
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:36,997
You're just a kid.
You're my kid.

389
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:39,286
Dad.

390
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,710
I'll be all right.

391
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:43,669
I got this.

392
00:22:45,753 --> 00:22:48,463
Go.

393
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:56,596
All right, where is it?

394
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:00,769
You know, this shit
must be pretty good

395
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:03,400
if it's worth running through
a human being for.

396
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:05,648
Oh, my God, man,
that was an accident.

397
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,440
- Where the fuck is the V?
- That accident had a name.

398
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:09,864
And what about Popclaw?

399
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:12,572
She had a name, too.

400
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:15,704
Charlotte!

401
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:19,332
The only good thing
in my life is gone now.

402
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,870
What is this, man? I kill your
girlfriend and you kill mine?

403
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:23,294
I didn't kill your girlfriend.

404
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,963
You used her.

405
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:26,881
You put her in danger,

406
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,759
and then you threw her out
like she was fucking garbage.

407
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:34,049
How does this not all start
with you, Hughie?

408
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:35,973
The only difference
between you and me

409
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:37,432
is that I made a mistake.

410
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,562
The shit that you did
was on purpose.

411
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,599
So who's worse?

412
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:46,863
You bitch!

413
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:48,358
You know, you're right.

414
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:50,149
It would've been stupid
to come alone.

415
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:57,281
Monique,
it's not safe here anymore.

416
00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:58,525
We got to go.

417
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:02,076
You swore to me
and to Jesus Christ

418
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:03,871
that you were done
with Billy Butcher.

419
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:05,665
I know, I get it.
Everything Butcher touches

420
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,878
- turns to flaming hot shit.
- No, I ain't blaming him.

421
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,669
Last I checked,
you're a grown-ass man.

422
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:13,512
It's my fault, okay?

423
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:15,719
But we can't do this right now.

424
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,155
- You put us in danger without thinking twice, Marvin.
- Monique, just...

425
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,559
Daddy!

426
00:24:20,598 --> 00:24:23,098
Hey, baby, come here.
Give me a hug. Oh.

427
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,189
- What have you been up to?
- I was drawing you a picture.

428
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,230
You were? Can I see?

429
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:32,283
Oh, my goodness,
this is beautiful.

430
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:34,068
Thank you, baby.

431
00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:36,572
Janine, honey, Daddy's gonna
take us on a sleepover.

432
00:24:36,614 --> 00:24:39,334
Can you help Mommy
pack your toys?

433
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,157
- Good girl.
- Baby, we're running late.

434
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:43,752
We don't have time to pack toys.

435
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:45,578
We got to go.

436
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:49,003
I knew you'd vote
your conscience, Senator.

437
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:51,253
Thank you.

438
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:53,295
Good-bye.

439
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:57,262
Three votes to go.

440
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:01,681
And the B.A. guys

441
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:03,983
said that the Pentagon
is shelling out

442
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:06,306
$35 billion on the low end.

443
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:10,482
- That puts us ahead of Lockheed.
- Amazing.

444
00:25:10,523 --> 00:25:14,493
That's incredible.
Edgar must be thrilled.

445
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:17,357
Ugh, fuck Edgar.

446
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:21,325
We did this, you and me.
This is about us.

447
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:26,455
Hey, do you remember
that marketing girl?

448
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:28,787
Ashley?

449
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,673
Um, I'm sorry,
I-I had to fire her, she...

450
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,380
No. No, no, no.
Seven, eight years ago.

451
00:25:35,423 --> 00:25:36,383
Becca.

452
00:25:36,424 --> 00:25:38,474
Becca?

453
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:40,259
- Yes.
- Becca Butcher.

454
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:41,433
That's it.

455
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:44,561
Mm-hmm. Yeah, her.

456
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:48,139
What about her?

457
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:50,646
Well, she's missing.

458
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:52,858
What do you mean, missing?

459
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:55,569
I mean missing, as in missing,

460
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,280
presumed dead.

461
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,030
- Wow.
- Yeah.

462
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,911
I looked at her file, and
the cops think it was suicide.

463
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:03,079
Mm.

464
00:26:03,117 --> 00:26:05,447
Yeah, it seems her husband...

465
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:08,285
Well, he got pretty riled up.

466
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:10,331
William Butcher.

467
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:15,586
Am I supposed to know his name?

468
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,430
No. Not specifically, but...

469
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:23,677
I was just wondering if you knew
what happened to her.

470
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:25,931
No, I just assumed
that she quit.

471
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:27,483
Quit?

472
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:31,187
Is there any particular reason

473
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:33,689
why you are asking
all of these questions?

474
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:36,481
No, no. I'm just... curious.

475
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:39,446
It's interesting, right?
I mean, it's...

476
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:42,367
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely sad.

477
00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:44,486
Yeah. Yes, very.

478
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:49,043
You know, I was, I was
thinking that maybe, um,

479
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,210
I could get Maria to stay late
with the baby and...

480
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,760
...maybe we could
order in and...

481
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,009
catch up.
Just me and you.

482
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:08,274
You know what?
That sounds amazing.

483
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:12,442
But you go be a mommy.

484
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:26,582
I'm telling you,
you're gonna love it here.

485
00:27:26,617 --> 00:27:28,237
You like roller coasters?

486
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:30,286
I'm more of a water park guy.

487
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:32,419
Well, Cedar Point's got both.

488
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:34,456
Mm-hmm.

489
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:45,675
You first.

490
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,100
Huh...?

491
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:51,389
Oh. Well, most girls
like the suit.

492
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:54,854
Well, I'm not most girls.

493
00:27:54,896 --> 00:27:58,356
Mm. Is it true what they say?

494
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,359
Come on, baby.

495
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:02,951
I got you here in the flesh.

496
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:04,357
I gotta see it.

497
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:06,695
Please?

498
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:11,291
I don't, I don't look
like everyone else.

499
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:13,749
That's what I'm counting on.

500
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,380
All right.

501
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,810
Oh, look at those gills.

502
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:35,138
Oh, my God, that's so fucked up.

503
00:28:35,186 --> 00:28:39,186
Hey, can-can...
Can we just, uh...

504
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,481
Ah... be gentle, be gentle.

505
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,645
Ow, it's tender. Oh, God.

506
00:28:43,694 --> 00:28:48,204
Okay. That hurts.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

507
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,594
- Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
- Come on, it's just my pinkie.

508
00:28:50,618 --> 00:28:53,198
No, I said it hurt.

509
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:58,669
All right, look,
I think maybe you should go.

510
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:01,419
I'm not going anywhere,

511
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:02,922
you little fucking freak.

512
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:07,085
Lay back.

513
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:09,104
I said, lay back.

514
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:11,056
Ah. God. Ow!

515
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:14,177
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

516
00:29:14,225 --> 00:29:15,805
- Oh, yeah. You like that?
- Ow.

517
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:19,061
Oh, you little fucking freak.

518
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:21,685
Oh, you like getting
your fucking gills fingered?

519
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:24,362
Ow. Oh, God.

520
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:27,701
Ow, ow. Oh, God.

521
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,139
Having a good growler, are we?

522
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:37,308
How did you...?

523
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:41,059
I stuck a little bug on you
back at that shithole of yours.

524
00:30:41,103 --> 00:30:44,073
'Cause, you know, fuck you.

525
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:45,436
No...

526
00:30:45,483 --> 00:30:46,863
What did you expect me to do?

527
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:48,491
It was Homelander.

528
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,820
You got to talk to me.

529
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:58,695
Wait, wait. No. I can help you.

530
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,039
Becca?

531
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:10,838
Your wife.

532
00:31:10,883 --> 00:31:12,843
'Cause she's missing?

533
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:15,095
I can help you find her.

534
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:45,417
Please, I have a daughter!

535
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,039
No!

536
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:11,316
Don't want none, fuck off.

537
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
I'm here about your wife.

538
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:16,987
I believe this was a few days

539
00:32:17,032 --> 00:32:21,332
after you met Homelander
at that Christmas party?

540
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:33,918
She was alone with him
for three hours.

541
00:32:50,941 --> 00:32:53,321
Not long after that,
Rebecca went missing

542
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,530
and has remained so ever since.

543
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:57,741
One way or another, Mr. Butcher,

544
00:32:57,781 --> 00:32:59,831
I believe Homelander
was involved.

545
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:02,237
Homelander?

546
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,330
But he's a fucking superhero.

547
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:10,337
You wouldn't believe
what they get up to.

548
00:33:15,132 --> 00:33:17,132
Who the fuck are you?

549
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,010
My name is Mallory.

550
00:33:22,056 --> 00:33:26,096
I'm the person
who can get you payback.

551
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:42,873
Who's calling?

552
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,620
Nobody.

553
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:54,344
Listen, if you...

554
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,090
if you want to talk,
I suppose we...

555
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:01,144
No.

556
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,980
But would it kill you
to make me one of those?

557
00:34:12,147 --> 00:34:15,527
You know, I had someone once.

558
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:19,407
We were gonna get away,
start a family.

559
00:34:20,447 --> 00:34:22,447
So what happened?

560
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:27,294
Well...

561
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:30,539
Everyone always asks,

562
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:34,172
what's our special weakness?

563
00:34:34,211 --> 00:34:35,591
Gamma rays?

564
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:38,049
Iron daggers?

565
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,640
Some ridiculous, stupid thing?

566
00:34:42,886 --> 00:34:45,256
The truth is,

567
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:49,806
our weakness
is the same as anyone's.

568
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:51,852
It's people.

569
00:34:52,896 --> 00:34:55,896
The people we care about.

570
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:59,901
So I say, cut them loose.

571
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:03,115
For your good and for theirs.

572
00:35:03,157 --> 00:35:06,617
That way
you're really bulletproof.

573
00:35:29,016 --> 00:35:31,186
What's up, man?

574
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:34,476
How'd you end up here?

575
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:36,691
Oh, tell me about it.

576
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:39,152
Me, too.

577
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:43,277
What's that?

578
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:45,322
Oh.

579
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:48,536
Wait, you can't get
in your head about that.

580
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:50,997
It's really not
that big of a deal.

581
00:35:51,038 --> 00:35:53,208
I'm gonna get you out of here.

582
00:35:53,248 --> 00:35:55,458
Just hang tight.

583
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:01,883
Excuse me, sir.

584
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:04,804
Oh, hey. Can I take one of these
lobsters back with me?

585
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:07,053
- You got it.
- Thanks.

586
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:15,274
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no.
Not that one.

587
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:16,312
This one.

588
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:17,765
Yeah, that's my guy.

589
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:28,623
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

590
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:32,371
Larry, please.

591
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:34,833
I just need a secure place
for a few nights.

592
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:36,753
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

593
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,792
Putain!

594
00:36:42,673 --> 00:36:44,383
Hi, you've reached Annie.

595
00:36:44,425 --> 00:36:46,185
- I can't come to the phone...
- Oh, damn it.

596
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:51,056
That's Hughie, baby.

597
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:54,229
- She looks like you.
- Nah.

598
00:36:54,268 --> 00:36:56,518
She's good-looking, man.

599
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:58,652
Right, baby?

600
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:14,579
Mr. Campbell.

601
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:16,121
Ooh, yeah.

602
00:37:16,165 --> 00:37:18,875
Pleasure to meet you.
Billy Butcher.

603
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,377
Oh, Hugh Campbell.

604
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,260
- You got a hell of a lad there.
- Well, yeah.

605
00:37:24,298 --> 00:37:26,298
He's all mine.

606
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:29,554
Hello, hello, hello.

607
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:32,885
What have we got here, then, eh?

608
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:34,681
What's your name, sweetheart?

609
00:37:34,725 --> 00:37:36,515
You can call me Uncle Billy.

610
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
He ain't your uncle, honey.

611
00:37:41,064 --> 00:37:43,784
- He ain't nothing to you.
- Monique.

612
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:47,404
Good to see you.

613
00:37:55,913 --> 00:37:57,753
Hi, you've reached Annie.
I can't come

614
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,789
to the phone right now...

615
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:05,802
What's she doing?

616
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,509
Uh, okay. It's okay.

617
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:11,511
It's okay.

618
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:14,365
Does the Oriental girl not talk?

619
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:15,929
Uh, Asian.

620
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:17,144
- Yeah.
- You're right. Asian.

621
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:19,194
And no, I don't think she does.

622
00:38:21,063 --> 00:38:23,113
Dad, I'm really sorry.

623
00:38:23,148 --> 00:38:25,148
I'm sorry about everything.

624
00:38:25,192 --> 00:38:27,902
No, no, no. Don't say sorry. No.

625
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:31,365
Look at you,
standing up for yourself.

626
00:38:31,406 --> 00:38:32,906
Jings.

627
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:41,922
Cold feet, huh?

628
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:43,339
What?

629
00:38:43,377 --> 00:38:44,747
You said Raynor got cold feet.

630
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:46,415
Yeah, that's what I said.

631
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:48,973
You know what I think it is?

632
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:51,257
I think
Raynor's plenty interested,

633
00:38:51,301 --> 00:38:54,851
only she didn't bring you
Homelander's head on a plate,

634
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:57,058
and you blew
the whole fucking thing up.

635
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:58,559
How am I doing so far?

636
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,730
No, mate. Way off.

637
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:03,359
Bullshit, Butcher.

638
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:06,477
You're so hot for Homelander
right now, Butcher,

639
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:08,815
you're not gonna let anything
get in your way,

640
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,740
even if it's
your own fucking friends, man.

641
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,240
You promised me
things would be different.

642
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:16,293
Matter of fact, you swore it.

643
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:19,286
But this is worse, man.

644
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,709
This is gonna be
Mallory's family all over again,

645
00:39:21,748 --> 00:39:23,998
only this time
it's gonna be my family.

646
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,422
And if something happens
to them, Butcher...

647
00:39:34,928 --> 00:39:37,098
I don't know what happened
with you and Raynor

648
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:39,559
or how that situation
got fucked up,

649
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,940
but just please call her.

650
00:39:41,977 --> 00:39:44,147
Please.

651
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,163
Yeah.

652
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,329
There you go.

653
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,710
Dr. Vogelbaum.

654
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:10,423
Surprise.

655
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:12,884
Thought I'd drop in on you.

656
00:40:13,884 --> 00:40:15,844
You look well.

657
00:40:15,886 --> 00:40:17,886
How long's it been, John?

658
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:21,809
Long enough that
no one calls me John anymore.

659
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,940
Mm.

660
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:29,399
So, what are these? Uh... pets?

661
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:31,401
No, just breeding them.

662
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:33,113
German retrievers.

663
00:40:34,154 --> 00:40:36,744
I try not to get
too attached to my subjects.

664
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:40,083
Hmm. Well, that's true.

665
00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:44,576
Seems retirement suits you.

666
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,498
Between this
and 80-hour weeks at the lab,

667
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:52,134
I'll take the lab. No contest.

668
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:56,798
So, you ever, uh...

669
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:59,143
catch up with any
of the old gang from Vought?

670
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:02,386
Look, do you mind
if we don't do this?

671
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:05,392
- Do what?
- This cat and mouse bullshit.

672
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:07,685
You want to know
about Rebecca Butcher.

673
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:09,540
You went to Stillwell
about it because you knew

674
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:11,654
that'd tip over
the first domino.

675
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:13,362
Well, it led to me.

676
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,950
So just ask.

677
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:19,779
I'll be honest.

678
00:41:23,578 --> 00:41:25,328
Well, that would be a first.

679
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:30,288
Eight years ago...

680
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:33,415
Stillwell called me with quite
an interesting challenge.

681
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:38,219
Rebecca Butcher
had come to her with a...

682
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,180
completely unprecedented
medical condition.

683
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:44,182
What condition?

684
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,860
She was pregnant.

685
00:41:50,897 --> 00:41:52,937
With your child.

686
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,159
Pregnant?

687
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:01,989
Wh...

688
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:07,287
But I thought I couldn't.

689
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,210
So did I.

690
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:11,289
Apparently, nature is tenacious.

691
00:42:11,334 --> 00:42:15,264
The fetus was developing
unnaturally fast.

692
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:17,467
We told her we'd deliver
the baby safely

693
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:19,007
at a secure location,

694
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,640
but she had to sign an NDA.

695
00:42:20,677 --> 00:42:22,177
Couldn't tell anyone.

696
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:25,601
Not even her husband.

697
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,350
You can imagine the size
of the potential scandal.

698
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:32,056
No!

699
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:34,815
No! Pull it out...
Oh, my...

700
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:44,369
The birth was difficult.

701
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:48,039
The baby clawed its way
out of her.

702
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:52,415
The blood loss...
no one could have survived.

703
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,300
She died on the table.

704
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:58,548
A-And the baby?

705
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,590
Lived all of ten seconds.

706
00:43:00,634 --> 00:43:03,514
Drowned in its mother's blood.

707
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,890
Was it a boy?

708
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:11,524
Does it matter?

709
00:43:12,562 --> 00:43:14,562
Why didn't you tell me?

710
00:43:14,606 --> 00:43:16,566
To protect you.

711
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:20,028
That's always job one
at Vought, isn't it?

712
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,860
Protect our
most profitable asset?

713
00:43:25,158 --> 00:43:27,198
So why are you telling me now?

714
00:43:27,244 --> 00:43:29,254
You don't understand.

715
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,250
The thing about
cross-breeding dogs,

716
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:36,252
you get the right genes,

717
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:38,094
you can get a perfect creation.

718
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:40,629
But it doesn't matter
how perfect they are.

719
00:43:40,674 --> 00:43:43,934
It's not enough.

720
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:45,969
When I raise subjects
without their mothers,

721
00:43:46,012 --> 00:43:47,392
they become violent.

722
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:50,100
Aggressive.

723
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:52,141
Downright hateful.

724
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:56,566
You should have been raised

725
00:43:56,606 --> 00:43:58,606
in a home with a family
who loved you.

726
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,280
Not in a cold lab with doctors.

727
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,820
And yet, I turned out great.

728
00:44:04,865 --> 00:44:07,525
When I think
what it's done to you,

729
00:44:07,576 --> 00:44:11,076
and what you can now do
to everyone else...

730
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:19,052
I'm sorry.

731
00:44:20,422 --> 00:44:22,172
I don't want
your fucking apology.

732
00:44:22,215 --> 00:44:24,125
All this is my fault.

733
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:26,885
What do you want?

734
00:44:26,928 --> 00:44:29,388
What?

735
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:33,562
What do you want... forgiveness?

736
00:44:33,602 --> 00:44:35,602
Now?

737
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:40,401
After you raised me
like a fucking lab rat?

738
00:44:44,487 --> 00:44:46,487
No.

739
00:44:48,074 --> 00:44:50,494
Too little, too late.

740
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:54,829
I don't want anything
from you, John.

741
00:44:56,499 --> 00:44:59,129
I'm just an old man,
thinking about his mistakes.

742
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:07,138
I'm the world's greatest
superhero.

743
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:11,142
You're my greatest failure.

744
00:45:19,272 --> 00:45:21,402
Hi. You've reached Annie.

745
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:23,401
I can't come
to the phone right now, but...

746
00:45:29,032 --> 00:45:31,122
Merde!

747
00:45:33,286 --> 00:45:34,656
Butcher.

748
00:45:34,704 --> 00:45:36,504
- Yeah, yeah, here's a gun.
- Fucking hell.

749
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:38,169
Calm down.

750
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,748
Okay, come on.

751
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,220
All right, easy, lads. Easy.

752
00:45:52,806 --> 00:45:54,516
M.M.

753
00:45:54,557 --> 00:45:56,427
Deputy Director.

754
00:45:56,476 --> 00:45:58,306
Your family's gonna be okay,
you have my word.

755
00:45:58,353 --> 00:45:59,853
Thank you.

756
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:06,439
You called?

757
00:46:06,486 --> 00:46:08,026
You are a human after all.

758
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:10,451
Well, let's not get
too carried away.

759
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:11,870
Thanks, man.

760
00:46:11,908 --> 00:46:13,908
Come right this way, ma'am.

761
00:46:18,957 --> 00:46:20,917
Monique, I'm sorry.

762
00:46:20,959 --> 00:46:23,039
I never want to see you again,
Marvin.

763
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,300
Come here, baby.

764
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,470
Mmm.

765
00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:31,339
Daddy loves you, okay?

766
00:46:31,386 --> 00:46:33,386
You're gonna be safe with Mommy.

767
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,430
All right? All right.

768
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:46,687
Take care of yourself.

769
00:46:46,735 --> 00:46:48,735
All right. All right.

770
00:46:57,328 --> 00:46:59,288
- No Homelander.
- No Homelander.

771
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,790
We had a deal.
Everyone else is fair game.

772
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:04,003
Do you want this or not?

773
00:47:34,574 --> 00:47:36,704
Annie, are you okay?

774
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,120
I have to see you.

775
00:47:42,457 --> 00:47:44,417
I, uh...

776
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:46,539
I don't know. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

777
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:48,336
You have to explain, Hughie.

778
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,339
You have
to make this make sense.

779
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:52,221
Just you and me.

780
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,760
You owe me that much.

781
00:47:58,306 --> 00:48:00,266
I'm sorry.

782
00:48:00,308 --> 00:48:02,188
I'm afraid I'm not following.

783
00:48:02,227 --> 00:48:05,057
You and your corporation
are fucked.

784
00:48:05,105 --> 00:48:09,355
Unequivocally,
unilaterally fucked.

785
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,200
How was that?
Is that clearer for you?

786
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:17,241
For the last half century,

787
00:48:17,283 --> 00:48:20,453
you have been feeding
the American people the line

788
00:48:20,495 --> 00:48:23,745
that your superheroes
are chosen by God.

789
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,010
I mean, I get it.

790
00:48:32,048 --> 00:48:33,798
Jamming illegal drugs
into babies' arms...

791
00:48:33,842 --> 00:48:36,302
I mean, that doesn't quite
have the same ring,

792
00:48:36,344 --> 00:48:38,224
and that's not even the worst.

793
00:48:39,514 --> 00:48:42,024
What did you do
to this one, and why?

794
00:48:42,058 --> 00:48:44,728
I've never seen her
in my entire life.

795
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:46,399
Uh-huh.

796
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:48,607
- What do you want?
- For starters,

797
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:51,478
there are no superheroes
in the U.S. Armed Forces.

798
00:48:51,526 --> 00:48:53,606
The bill's already gone down
to the floor.

799
00:48:53,653 --> 00:48:55,823
They're gonna vote on it
any day now.

800
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:57,414
And you're pulling it.

801
00:48:57,448 --> 00:48:59,988
Retooling the concept
for internal development.

802
00:49:00,034 --> 00:49:02,204
I don't give a shit,
but the deal is dead.

803
00:49:02,245 --> 00:49:04,615
And we're gonna go
back to status quo,

804
00:49:04,664 --> 00:49:06,624
where we're the government
and the military,

805
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:10,166
and you're just assholes
running around in your capes.

806
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:12,711
- And if we refuse?
- Everything goes public.

807
00:49:12,755 --> 00:49:14,545
Corruption story of the century.

808
00:49:14,591 --> 00:49:16,011
Vought shares go to zero.

809
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,430
The civil suits,
criminal prosecution,

810
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:20,389
and you go bankrupt,
and your cute

811
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,980
little suit goes to a lovely
shade of orange for 15 to 30.

812
00:49:26,144 --> 00:49:28,104
Ms. Raynor?

813
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,230
Thank you, Michaela.

814
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:37,493
We're done here.

815
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:40,201
Everything okay, I hope?

816
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:46,785
Someone tell me
what the hell is going on.

817
00:49:46,831 --> 00:49:49,211
About 12 minutes ago,
Navy SEALs took out Abu Ressam

818
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,920
about 15 miles
outside of Damascus.

819
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,420
Right, as planned.
So what's the problem?

820
00:49:54,464 --> 00:49:56,134
Watch.

821
00:49:58,176 --> 00:50:00,676
We got two.

822
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,680
- Nice eye.
- Stop.

823
00:50:03,723 --> 00:50:06,483
That's our guy. Light him up.

824
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:08,187
Great.

825
00:50:08,228 --> 00:50:11,108
The prick behind Flight 37
is dead. What am I missing?

826
00:50:11,147 --> 00:50:13,437
Just wait.

827
00:50:16,611 --> 00:50:18,911
- Step inside.
- Watch this.

828
00:50:22,617 --> 00:50:25,197
- We got movement!
- Hey! Hey! Get down!

829
00:50:25,245 --> 00:50:26,695
- Hey!
- Get down!

830
00:50:26,746 --> 00:50:28,666
- Get down, motherfucker!
- Don't fucking move!

831
00:50:28,706 --> 00:50:31,076
I said get down!

832
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:32,585
What the fuck does that say?

833
00:50:32,627 --> 00:50:34,707
"Naqib."

834
00:50:34,754 --> 00:50:36,554
Hey!

835
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:38,339
Freeze, motherfucker!

836
00:50:38,383 --> 00:50:40,643
Kill him!

837
00:50:54,524 --> 00:50:56,534
That's not all.

838
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:11,501
How is that son of a bitch
still alive?

839
00:51:14,168 --> 00:51:15,958
"Naqib" means "Captain."

840
00:51:16,004 --> 00:51:17,884
We believe it's his...

841
00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:19,922
Supe name.

842
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:31,313
Are you telling me

843
00:51:31,352 --> 00:51:34,442
they have a Supe terrorist?

844
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:56,669
Look, Annie, I-I...

845
00:51:56,711 --> 00:51:58,631
Did you kill Translucent?

846
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:02,506
It's-it's...
it's not that simple.

847
00:52:04,218 --> 00:52:06,888
And you haven't been using me
to get back at A-Train?

848
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,740
Y...

849
00:52:21,778 --> 00:52:23,318
You're a murderer.

850
00:52:23,363 --> 00:52:25,203
We didn't have a choice.

851
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:27,579
- There is always a choice.
- Wait.

852
00:52:27,617 --> 00:52:29,287
Aah. What-what are you doing?

853
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:31,537
- I'm taking you in.
- What... No. Annie, hold on.

854
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:33,619
To the cops! At least
they'll treat you better

855
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:35,184
- than The Seven would.
- Just listen to me.

856
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:37,168
Listen to me, okay?
I know this is so fucked.

857
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:39,460
You were the only thing, Hughie.

858
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:41,231
You were the only thing
that I could count on.

859
00:52:41,255 --> 00:52:42,965
I'm still me, Annie.

860
00:52:43,007 --> 00:52:45,387
Please. You know me.

861
00:52:45,426 --> 00:52:47,386
I don't know you.

862
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:50,098
- Never did.
- If you bring me in,

863
00:52:50,139 --> 00:52:51,809
- I'm dead before sunrise.
- No.

864
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:54,639
Vought will want to string
you up for a long trial.

865
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:56,645
Lots of press.
The guy who killed Translucent.

866
00:52:56,687 --> 00:52:58,607
This isn't about Translucent.

867
00:52:58,648 --> 00:53:00,858
Okay? This is about Compound V.

868
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:05,741
Compound V?

869
00:53:08,032 --> 00:53:10,202
It's this drug.

870
00:53:10,243 --> 00:53:12,953
It, um...

871
00:53:12,995 --> 00:53:15,365
It gives the Supes their powers.

872
00:53:16,624 --> 00:53:18,674
Vought will do anything
to cover it up.

873
00:53:18,709 --> 00:53:21,549
N... No. What? Wha...?

874
00:53:21,587 --> 00:53:23,587
What are you talking about?

875
00:53:25,383 --> 00:53:27,393
We're born like this.

876
00:53:29,137 --> 00:53:31,137
I'm so sorry.

877
00:53:33,975 --> 00:53:34,975
Annie. Annie.

878
00:53:35,017 --> 00:53:36,597
Annie, watch out!

879
00:53:36,644 --> 00:53:39,194
Fucking run, Hughie.

880
00:53:46,863 --> 00:53:49,663
I'm so sorry.

881
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:52,079
Get the fuck away from her!

882
00:53:55,413 --> 00:53:57,463
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

883
00:53:57,498 --> 00:53:59,038
I didn't ask for your help.

884
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,923
Yeah. Looked like
you had it all under control.
