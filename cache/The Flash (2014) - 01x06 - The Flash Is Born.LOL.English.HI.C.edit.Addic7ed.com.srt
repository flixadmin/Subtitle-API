remember all this stuff, Barry.

Because he's a little freak,

Is he gonna murder me, too?

Looks like you were born
to take a beating, Allen.

I just can't get my head around.

Uh-huh.

182
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:55,421
I fired a dozen rounds at our car thief,

183
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:58,993
and it was like they sparked off of him.

Huh, well, I mean,

185
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:04,927
he must have been
wearing some kind of body armor.

if you checked your messages.

Any comment, Detective?

Barry's incident last night.

I think he's at the station.

I need your help

It's about energy and power.

So what do you think?

00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,820
Judging by the mud and kegs
I'd say he got hammered,

302
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,355
stole a big-ass truck,

303
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:17,824
and went joyriding.

304
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,526
I bet the kegs are stolen, too.

- Let's check it out.
- Yeah.

308
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:43,111
Barry described a tornado
of red and yellow lightning

309
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:45,714
inside a man in yellow.

310
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,315
Then, bam.

311
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:48,883
He's blocks away on the street.

312
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:50,517
Doesn't know how he got there.

313
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,153
When I arrived, the place was a wreck.

314
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:53,354
Nora Allen is dead.

315
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:54,990

316
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:56,926
Henry Allen covered in her blood.

317
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:59,097
And despite all the evidence
that Henry Allen is guilty,

318
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:03,735
now you believe this... What,
man in yellow is responsible?

319
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,169
Last night, I saw Barry

320
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,339
rescue a young boy from being run over,

321
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,675
and it looked exactly like what
Barry described happened to him.

322
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,376
It got me thinking,

323
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:17,018
what if somebody with Barry's
abilities killed Nora?

324
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,820
There's one flaw with
your theory though, Detective,

325
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:22,689
and is that all of this
happened 14 years ago,

326
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,056
which is long before...

327
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:25,588
Your machine gave Barry his powers.

328
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,223
An accident gave Barry his powers.

329
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:29,928
Do you think it is possible

330
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,363

00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:21,491
- I had to go after him.
- Iris, where is she?

493
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,692
She's fine, she's fine.

494
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,962
Eddie put a detail her to be safe.

495
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,165
I thought I could handle him this time.

496
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,566
I tried.

497
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:31,135
Look, I know what this
punk put you through,

498
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:35,106
but you can't let emotion
cloud your judgment.

The tollbooth camera

- We lost him.
- Don't worry, Eddie.

They'll get him.

504
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,982
I wanted to take this guy down.

505
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,350
Not half as much as I did.

506
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:49,953
Let's go, Allen.

507
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,021
Go where?

508
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,123
Blow off some steam.

509
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,557
- I need to hit something.
- What?

510
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,992
I don't think he meant hit you.

511
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,527
Go.

512
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:10,137
So I heard you and this
Woodward guy have a history.

513
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:11,637
Hey, Allen.

514
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:13,306
It's okay. Trust me.

515
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:15,511
I had my fair share of bullies at school.

516
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,847
Yeah, somehow I find that hard to believe.

517
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:22,280
I was short, fat,
and the son of a politician

518
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:24,282
who closed the factory
in my school district,

519
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:28,017
so not so popular.

520
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,522
So what'd you do about it?

521
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:34,559
I got my ass kicked.

522
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:39,862
A lot, until my gym coach took pity on me.

523
00:25:39,864 --> 00:25:42,531
She said the key to fighting is patience.

524

Here.

525
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:48,008
A lot of guys waste energy
trying to land the most punches.

526
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:52,212
All it takes is one,
but you got to make it count.

527
00:25:52,214 --> 00:25:55,417
Choose your spot and drive through it,

528
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:59,120
like it's six inches behind the target.

529
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:08,293

Hmm, well these days
it's rare to find someone

00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:37,430
happy to have a drink with me.

537
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:41,934
Well, our conversation
yesterday got me thinking.

538
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:44,805
You said, as a scientist,
you look for the probable?

539
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:46,073
That's right.

540
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:48,344
And we both recently have seen things

541
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:51,615
that have redefined what is possible.

542
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:53,819
Yes, we have, and we both know

543
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,987
the direct cause of those things.

544
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,755
Your accelerator explosion.

Evolutionary leaps follow the
creation of new technologies.

546
00:26:59,793 --> 00:27:00,959
It's that simple.

547
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:04,364
Like the Roomba. [Laughs]

548

Yes, like the Roomba.

So humor me here.

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,773
Hmm?

551
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:18,444
If we know that meta-humans were created

552
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:21,347
by the particle accelerator
and testimony shows

553
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,050
that a meta-human may have been
involved in the murder

554
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:28,754
of Barry Allen's mother 14 years
ago, it seems to me that...

555
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:31,991
Way back then there must have been

556
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:37,001
another particle accelerator.

557
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:40,505
- Another particle accelerator?
- Hmm.

558
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:43,211
I can assure you that's
extremely unlikely, Detective,

No, no, I don't.

When did you move to town, Dr. Wells?

564

Something tells me
that you already know the answer

to that question, Detective.

after Nora Allen's murder.
