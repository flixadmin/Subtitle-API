isn't it?

476
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,842
It's been a stressful day.

477
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,124
- Is that all you're doing?
- I'm afraid so.

478
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,327
Disappointed?

479
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,084
Don't play with me, Barbara.

480
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,605
I was there, remember?

481
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,366
- Through all of it.
- You mean you're part of it?

482
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,085
Fine.

483
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,687
- Answer the question.
- Yes.

484
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,887
This is it.

485
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,849
Now that you've broken into my home...

486
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,651
...and accused me of being a drug addict,
you can leave.

487
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,370
Not until we talk about Gordon.

488
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,761
- He's killed a man.
- You told me. It's not true.

489
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,809
Not Mario Pepper.
Another man.

490
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,770
And he killed him on the orders
of Carmine Falcone...

491
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,763
...biggest crime boss in Gotham.

492
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,649
You're lying.

493
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,322
But you know,
I guess I should be used to that.

494
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,244
True.

495
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,243
When we were together,
I did lie to you.

496
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,365
A lot.

497
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,727
But you always knew.

498
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,405
You looked in my eyes...

499
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,961
...and you knew when I was lying to you.

500
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,848
Am I lying now?

501
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,167
Is this just because I love him?

502
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,160
Is that why you are so determined
to destroy him?

503
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,691
I've been sober for a year and I know
that doesn't erase the things that I did...

504
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,881
...but I still care about you.

505
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,011
I can't stand you being with this man.

506
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,288
You deserve better.

507
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,046
Leave.

508
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,810
Now.

509
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,523
Ask him where he was the night
that Oswald Cobblepot disappeared.

510
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,688
That's the name of the man he killed.

511
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,008
I'm telling the truth. I didn't kill those guys.
I mean, a cop? Why would I kill a cop?

512
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,130
Maybe because you're a thieving,
cop-murdering pile of crap.

513
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,163
But mind you, that's just a theory.

514
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,722
- You admit stealing the balloons?
- Yeah, but I owed these loan sharks.

515
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,491
And if I didn't pay them,
they were gonna cut off stuff.

516
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,366
If you didn't kill Danzer and Cranston,
who did?

517
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,330
- Who did you sell the balloons to?
- I never saw his face.

518
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,965
We had a drop off point
to exchange the balloons and money.

519
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,724
You know what we got here, Jim?

520
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,565
We got us a criminal mastermind.

521
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,087
Not only is the murder weapon
in the stratosphere...

522
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,567
...but so are the bodies.
It's the perfect crime.

523
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,044
The bodies will come back.

524
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,960
What are you talking about?

525
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,401
You guys not know
how weather balloons work?

526
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,325
Tell us, genius.
Or I'll beat it out of you.

527
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,323
Wait-- Okay, they rise up...

528
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,848
...and it gets colder and colder,
and the balloon gets brittle...

529
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,411
...and the helium expands.

530
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,641
Then what?

531
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,491
It pops.

532
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,601
[DOG BARKS]

533
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,760
BULLOCK:
I'm really starting to dislike this case.

534
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,810
Where do you think
they find shovels that big, huh?

535
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,481
We only have to worry about
one more balloon.

536
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,883
- Who?
- Quinn. He's meditating in his garden.

537
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,764
Alvarez is on his way to the scene.

538
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,763
We're gonna have the church
on our back.

539
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,246
Great. Forget the fact...

540
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,801
...that Quinn was known
as "the diddling priest."

541
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,002
Here's what we found in Cranston's pockets.
What wasn't smashed to bits.

542
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,085
Why is your name on this, Jim?

543
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,851
I know who the Balloonman is.

544
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,680
MARONI: You see,
Falcone is only the boss of Gotham...

545
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,968
...because people believe he's the boss.

546
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,851
That's what this Arkham thing
is gonna change.

547
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,004
People are gonna see
that the emperor's got no clothes.

548
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,644
I'm wasting my breath.
You're an idiot. Get out of here.

549
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,201
Who the hell are you?

550
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,124
I-- I'm sorry, sir. I am--

551
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,328
Hold on. Put that down.

552
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,050
You were listening, huh?

553
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,123
You're new.
What's your name?

554
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,921
Paolo, sir.

555
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,242
Italian? You don't look Italian.

556
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,445
On my mother's side.

557
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,210
It's the side that I claim.

558
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,044
A boy who loves his mother.

559
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,887
Here. Take it.

560
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,491
I was a lot like you.

561
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,404
Started from nothing.

562
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,848
But I kept my head down, I worked hard,
now look at me.

563
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,447
Gotham is the city of opportunity.

564
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,648
Yes, sir. I believe that too.

565
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,689
You hear what I was saying back there?

566
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,003
Those names? Falcone. Arkham.

567
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,686
They mean anything to you?

568
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,123
Honestly, sir,
I didn't hear anything at all.

569
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,805
Attaboy.

570
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,402
<i>The Balloonman has struck once again.</i>

571
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,484
<i>Cardinal Quinn, accused of multiple accounts
of sexual abuse...</i>

572
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,411
<i>...is the latest victim of the vigilante.</i>

573
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,604
See this? This is not good.

574
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,081
You can't go around killing priests.

575
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,649
At least not in public.

576
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,843
Go take care of your mother, Paolo.

577
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,923
GORDON:
<i>His name is Davis Lamond, 48.</i>

578
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,481
He's worked at Juvenile Services
for 15 years.

579
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,246
No priors.
He didn't show up at work today.

580
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,131
And he hasn't been back to his apartment.

581
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,085
- We have uniforms in both.
- You're positive he's the killer?

582
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,801
We found a form on Cranston's body
that I've given Lamond yesterday morning.

583
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,962
Also, keys that opened
Lamond's apartment.

584
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,369
I'm guessing they had a scuffle.
Cranston went through his pockets...

585
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,887
...but Lamond managed
to attach him to the balloon.

586
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,008
What caused Lamond to snap?

587
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,810
GORDON:
Not sure.

588
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,806
Lamond's coworkers describe him
as thoughtful, dedicated, sweet.

589
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,007
A few said that.

590
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,925
Great, one of those
sweet cop-killing vigilantes.

591
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,926
- What about his last target?
- Same profile as all the rest.

592
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,686
Well-known. Seemingly respectable.

593
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,966
Actually corrupt.

594
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,482
This is Gotham.
That doesn't exactly narrow it down.

595
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,768
Meanwhile,
I have the mayor, city council...

596
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,531
...half the city's judges
and clergy hiding indoors...

597
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,967
...screaming at the commissioner
to find the guy.

598
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,246
Guess who he screams at?

599
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,483
We've got his photo out there.
It's just a matter of time.

600
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,129
- Nothing.
- Really?

601
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,887
Your network of Chinese loan sharks
and hookers came up empty?

602
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,168
Gloat later. Just think about it.

603
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,609
He had to store the balloons, the helium
canisters, the carts he was using...

604
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,926
Maybe a storage facility, a warehouse?

605
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,128
Or an abandoned building.

606
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,322
That's it? How'd you come up with that?

607
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,005
It's the same thing I just said.

608
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,329
What made you figure this place?

609
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,690
The girl yesterday, Selina,
she told me she was in a new juvie building.

610
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,804
Lamond, the counselor, said the same thing.
So I'm thinking:

611
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,042
What happened to the old juvie building?

612
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,885
Turns out,
the city's getting ready to demo it.

613
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,327
Even if he was here,
he's probably long gone.

614
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,484
He's only got one balloon left.
He knows we're closing in...

615
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,041
Or that's him right there.

616
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,411
Bullock!

617
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,926
Drop the gun now!

618
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,681
- I can't do that, detective, I'm not done yet.
- One more time, drop it.

619
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,002
- You should be helping me.
- You're wasting your breath.

620
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,731
My partner thinks
you're as bad as the scum you kill.

621
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,322
Me, I can see how you're doing us a favor,
so don't shoot me, all right?

622
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,369
You believe as I do.

623
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,807
You're the one
who caught those child snatchers.

624
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,928
- You risked your life.
- So did I.

625
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,924
You wanna protect the innocent?

626
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,048
Yes, we have laws for that.

627
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,361
And what good are laws...

628
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,007
...when they require men like your
Lieutenant Cranston to implement them?

629
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,849
And Ronald Danzer? You think he would
have seen the inside of a jail?

630
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,161
