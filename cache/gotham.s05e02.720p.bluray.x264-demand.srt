1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,677
<i>- Previously on</i> Gotham...
- Gotham falls, we rise.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,040
<i>After the bridges blew,</i>

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,713
<i>the city was up for grabs.</i>

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,276
<i>Gangs are carving up territory.</i>

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,355
We are running out of food.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
<i>Ammunition.</i>

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,917
We are surrounded
by hostile forces.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,796
Say hello to Butch.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
Put out the word.

10
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,359
100,000 rounds of ammunition

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,597
to whoever kills Jim Gordon.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,880
<i>You want to cure her?</i>

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,416
You have to go to the witch.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,352
And where do I find this witch?

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,789
You have to help us.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,999
My brothers and sisters,

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
they're killing us.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,039
<i>His name is Will Thomas.</i>

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,600
Parents died in a home invasion

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,552
a few weeks after the
bridges came down.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,199
Guys that broke in

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,839
took him to some sort of factory

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,834
where he was held alongside
dozens of other stolen kids,

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,515
all chained together.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
God.

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,429
Who are these guys?

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,958
Call themselves
The Soothsayers.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,238
- You ever heard of them?
- No.

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,034
But who can keep track
these days?

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,317
- Which district?
- Granton. Near the water,

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,995
he said. Had them digging
some sort of tunnel.

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,237
Will broke free
from his restraints last night

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,274
and walked nine miles through
the Dark Zone to find us.

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,840
What kind of tunnel?

35
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,355
Unclear.

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,040
There's an abandoned waterworks
by the old dock in Granton.

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,035
Detective Gordon?

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,314
My friends.

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,677
You'll save them, won't you?

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,320
I'll look into it.

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,396
The Soothsayers
won't be happy I escaped.

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,799
They'll punish
the others for it.

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,549
Please, Mr. Gordon.

44
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,393
I promised them I'd bring help.

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,995
I know it's a sad story
and emotions are high,

46
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,256
but need I remind you that
every two-bit criminal out there

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,936
is looking to kill you
to claim Penguin's bounty?

48
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,160
So you're saying
we do nothing?

49
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,096
No, I'm saying the second
you step outside that door,

50
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,376
someone's gonna
take a shot at you,

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,736
and if it's not you
that's getting hit,

52
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,336
it's gonna be the schmo
standing next to you,

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
which is most likely
gonna be me.

54
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Captain.

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,154
There's a call
from the mainland.

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
<i>All of us here believe</i>

57
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,151
<i>that if peace is to be sustained
on the island,</i>

58
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,993
<i>confrontations must be avoided.</i>

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,351
We have kids in danger
out there.

60
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,473
We're their only hope
for rescue.

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,000
<i>Your dedication to your job
is admirable, Captain,</i>

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,594
<i>but you lack perspective.</i>

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
<i>Travel into harm's way,
and you may save a few lives,</i>

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,320
<i>but you'd also be jeopardizing</i>

65
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,080
<i>thousands of others
should you be killed.</i>

66
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,596
<i>The collective opinion over here
is that you stand down</i>

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,831
<i>and keep those
within your Green Zone safe.</i>

68
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,799
I don't need opinions,
I need supplies.

69
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,314
When can I expect them?

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,069
<i>Until Gotham airspace
can be declared safe again,</i>

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,397
<i>we cannot sacrifice
any more pilots,</i>

72
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,711
<i>whether they're ours
or Wayne Enterprises'.</i>

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,680
So you can save a few lives
for thousands, but I can't?

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,154
<i>Mr. Gordon...</i>

75
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Jim.

76
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,675
I need five men and transport
for 20 kids or more.

77
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,320
We only have a few squad cars

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,711
- and that rust bucket transporter.
- That'll have to do.

79
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
How are we on ammo?

80
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,176
Well, we got what we got
from Penguin,

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,839
and we got a box
of shotgun shells

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and a box of nine mils.

83
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,880
What did the bureaucrats
on the mainland say?

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
Do nothing,
protect the Green Zone.

85
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Four shells each.

86
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,110
Half a mag each.

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,399
Boy said The Soothsayers
are here.

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,600
That means we have to pass
through Sirens territory,

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,536
but it's only three
or four miles from then on.

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,313
Three or four miles
into the Dark Zone?

91
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,120
God only knows what's out there.

92
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,114
Barbara's been
stockpiling vehicles

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,200
and everything else
as payment to enter her club.

94
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,936
- It's worth a shot.
- She's gonna be thrilled

95
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,156
to see you after what
happened with Tabitha.

96
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,976
We're gonna need housing
for those kids when we get back.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,593
- Yep.
<i>- If</i> we get back.

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,234
Let him go.

99
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,231
- Are you with her?
- Who?

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,555
The witch.

101
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,519
I'm not with the witch.

102
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
I just came here
for her help.

103
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,753
Come for her magic, have you?

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,914
So did others from our district.

105
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,429
And look at them now.

106
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,030
They came for help, too,

107
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,429
and she took their souls.

108
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,074
But she'll never kill again.

109
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,795
We have her this time.

110
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
You captured her?

111
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,880
She's locked
in the storeroom back there.

112
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,589
We stripped it clean
before we locked her in.

113
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,752
The plants, you see.

114
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,390
She talks to them.

115
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,834
Makes them do things.

116
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,872
So we took her light, water;
put salt on the floor.

117
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,080
She's helpless now.

118
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
I need to talk to her.

119
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,557
No. We sent

120
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,915
for more of us.

121
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,119
When they come, we burn her.

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,156
Listen.

123
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,194
My brother is missing.

124
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,079
I know this witch took him.

125
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,472
I need to find out
what she did with him.

126
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,476
Please, let me talk to her.
Five minutes is all I need,

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,120
and then you can do
whatever you want.

128
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,200
Your brother's dead.

129
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,513
She'll kill you, too.

130
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,880
Five minutes.

131
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
In there.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,719

144
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,036
So, what brings you crawling out
into the open tonight?

145
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Come to join the party?

146
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,676
One last hoorah
before someone wastes you?

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm here to ask a favor.

148
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,790
A favor, right.
Is this after

149
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,792
you stood by and did nothing

150
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,874
while my best friend
on this Earth

151
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,240
was stabbed through the heart?

152
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,471
- I put him down.
- You restored his limp.

153
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,199
- He should be dead!
- Barbara.

154
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,874
Everybody out!

155
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,311
Now!

156
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,639
I said move!

157
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,154
Planning revenge?

158
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,232
Well, someone has to do
something about that freak.

159
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,710
He has an army.
It would be suicide.

160
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Look around, Jim.

161
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,233
We're all slowly dying.

162
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,596
Just some of us
get to choose how.

163
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,474
I'm sorry about what happened
to Tabitha.

164
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,554
Things got out of control.

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,394
I'm just trying to keep
this city from falling apart.

166
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
You're too late.

167
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,396
So, this favor?

168
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,040
I need transportation.

169
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,910
- Trucks, maybe.
- Where are you going?

170
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,912
It's a police matter.

171
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,119
You know, they should really
write that on your tombstone.

172
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,240
They're downstairs
in the basement lot.

173
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,470
Knock yourself out.

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,834
Drive right into this nightmare
you created.

175
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,069
You won't last the night.

176
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,074
Here he comes, Gotham.

177
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,720
Your judge, your jailer,
your most hated son!

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Have at him!

179
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,238
Rip him to shreds!

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,515
No one deserves to die
more than he.

181
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,456
<i>All right,
we're entering the Dark Zone.</i>

182
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,119
<i>Everybody, stay sharp.</i>

183
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,795
<i>This place was a cesspit</i>

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,356
before the rest of the world
turned its back on us.

185
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,920
I wonder what's left here now.

186
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,639
I doubt many stayed up here.

187
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,796
This whole grid
never regained power.

188
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,916
Damn it! You were
saying, Jim?

189
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,400
It's a freaking arrow, Jim.

190
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,673
It's a freaking arrow!

191
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,713
Welcome to the badlands.

192
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,435
Come on.

193
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,439
Come on, come on.

194
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,040
- Get up!
- Aah!

195
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,429
Come on!

196
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

197
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,195
Leave him alone.

198
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,113
Causing trouble again,
Gabriel?

199
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,040
We need water and food.
Some of us haven't slept

200
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,754
in two days.

201
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,360
You know, you could've woken me

202
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,750
when that sneaky rat left
in the night.

203
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,354
But you didn't,
and now, he's out there,

204
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,671
and he's causing all kinds
of problems for us.

205
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,079
The smoke.

206
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,754
You should take it.

207
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,960
It'll give you energy.

208
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,269
Inhale enough...

209
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,752
...and it'll let you
see the future.

210
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,558
You fail to see the importance
of our work here, Gabriel.

211
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,474
But you see,
once this tunnel is complete,

212
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,639
we will have exclusive access
to the mainland.

213
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,159
People will be forced
to do business with us.

214
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,755
Food, booze, guns,

215
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,550
smoke.

216
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,991
All will come from the tunnel.

217
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,279
We've been digging
for over a month.

218
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,874
We've only gotten
a hundred feet.

219
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
It's too narrow.

220
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,036
The roof is leaking. Once we hit
the river, it'll flood

221
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,237
- and kill anyone inside.
- So negative!

222
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,590
Gabriel.

223
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Shame.

224
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,391
I had such high hopes for you.

225
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,274
That one day you would
wear the mask and share

226
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,272
in our good fortune.

227
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,194
Never mind.

228
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,039
Sykes.

229
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,520
Man, you got
to come out front.

230
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,189
Who was on watch?!

231
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,360
Put your weapons down.

232
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,998
Is that James Gordon?

233
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,192
<i>The</i> James Gordon?

234
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,873
It's our lucky day, fellas.

235
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,277
Kill this one,
and we're bullet rich!

236
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,478
In Penguin's graces we will be.

237
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,035
I said put 'em down.

238
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Give us the kids

239
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,993
you're holding captive.
We'll leave.

240
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Kids?

241
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,240
I don't know
what you're talking about.

242
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,279
What are the cattle prods for?

243
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,470
Fun.

244
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Stay here.

245
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,917
He moves, kill him.

246
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,235
It's okay.

247
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,434
It's all right.
I'm a cop.

248
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,835
Will's alive?

249
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,736
He found you and sent you
to rescue us, didn't he?

250
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
He did.

251
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,469
Will made it! He's alive!

252
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,996
We need the keys.

253
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,919
There are trucks outside.

254
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,074
We'll drive you
to the Green Zone,

255
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
find you a new home.

256
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,314
Thank you.
God bless you.

257
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,592
Okay, guys. We're gonna
get out of here.

258
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,638
Gonna help us get out.
One at a time.

259
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,993
Yeah, we're
gonna be okay.

260
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,590
Why would anyone be a cop
in a world like this?

261
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,435
Well, the Halloween shop
was all out of gas masks,

262
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,037
so it was either this
or sexy nurse.

263
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
You know what?

264
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,790
My guess is these cops ain't
got enough ammo to shoot a duck.

265
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,794
Wrong.
Penguin gave us a boatload.

266
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,310
Penguin wants your
boss skinned.

267
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,909
Let's take 'em, boys.

268
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,795
Come on! Go! Go!

269
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Hey!

270
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,119
Go!

271
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,993
Gabriel!

272
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,999
You okay? Come on.

273
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,838
Take cover! Go! Go!

274
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,955
- The alley! Go! Go!
- Come on!

275
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Bruce?

276
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,880
Thank God.

277
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,154
You have to help me.

278
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,394
I didn't kill those men
out there in the vines,

279
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,320
- you have to believe me.
- You'll forgive me

280
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,199
if I find it hard to do so.

281
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,120
It wasn't me.

282
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
It was the park.

283
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,996
The park?

284
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,074
The trees,
the plants, the roots

285
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,356
underground...

286
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,198
They're speaking to one another.

287
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,314
When those men came
to kill me...

288
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,311
...the plants came
to my protection.

289
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,674
Then maybe
we can help each other.

290
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,789
I have...

291
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,560
a friend... who was shot.

292
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,314
The bullet severed
her spinal cord.

293
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,113
The doctors can't
seem to help her.

294
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,240
But a woman at the hospital said
that you might be able to.

295
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,437
Normally, I would say no.

296
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,230
But this park...
ever since we were cut off

297
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,915
from the rest of the world,
it's been behaving differently.

298
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,194
There are things growing here

299
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,794
I have never seen before.

300
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,758
You okay in there?

301
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
Our friends are
on their way.

302
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,999
Time's running out
for you, witch!

303
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,350
There's a seed.

304
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,839
It's growing under the oaks.

305
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,351
It's said
to have magical qualities.

306
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,116
When digested, it heads

307
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,198
for damaged tissue and bone,
healing them.

308
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,673
If I help you find it...

309
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,236
...will you protect me
from those men out there?

310
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,474
Yes! Yes!

311
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,040
Yes, it worked!

312
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,200
No... more...

313
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,357
sleepwalking for me.

314
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,555
Good morning.

315
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,196
See, it was just some...

316
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,198
random stupid thing
brought on by stress.

317
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,913
It's all in your head.

318
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,960
There's nothing there.

319
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,196
Who the hell are you?

320
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,996
What? Are you serious?

321
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Very.

322
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,749
You don't remember?

323
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,878
- No.
- Oh.

324
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,960
Name's Tank.

325
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,833
You're part of
the Street Demonz gang?

326
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,119
Yeah.

327
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,190
You know that.

328
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,030
Why should I?

329
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,870
What are you doing here?

330
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,120
You brought me here.

331
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,592
- I brought you here?
- Last night.

332
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,194
Did I, uh...

333
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,158
hit you, et cetera?

334
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,160
Any idea why?

335
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,069
You wanted information,

336
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,279
and I wouldn't give it to you.

337
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,232
I'm gonna guess
you gave it to me.

338
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,873
Huh. I can't remember.

339
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,357
We're gonna have to do this
all again, aren't we?

340
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,800
Guess so.

341
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Fine.

342
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,554
Gordon,
where are you?

343
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,349
We need to hide.

344
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,116
Follow me.

345
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,395
It's not safe out there.

346
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,216
We've got to get out
of the daylight.

347
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
We're sitting ducks.
How are they holding up?

348
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
We'll be fine.

349
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,035
Jim, we're not alone.

350
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,917
Someone lit that candle.

351
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,630
In the old west, settlers used
to leave a candle burning

352
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,598
to lead others to safety.

353
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,838
Maybe there's still good
people left in Gotham.

354
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,479
All right, fine.

355
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,755
We'll take a look around.

356
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Stay here.

357
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,993
If you see something, shout.

358
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Radio check.

359
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,555
Ah, forget it.

360
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,798
We're out of range of
the precinct's antenna.

361
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,276
Look, if those other trucks
made it back to safety,

362
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,576
maybe they'll send someone back
here to get us, huh?

363
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,320
Maybe. Until then, I'll take the
next floor, you do the basement.

364
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,712
Oh. Check out the basement
in a creepy hotel by myself?

365
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,839
Sure.

366
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,274
What could go wrong, right?

367
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,310
Let's get settled.

368
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,275
Hello?

369
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,719
Is somebody there?

370
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,310
GCPD.

371
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,200
Come out, now.

372
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,633
Whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's all right.

373
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,509
Oh, my God.

374
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,600
Oh. Not good.

375
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,114
Oh, God. This...

376
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,396
This is not good.

377
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,037
Jim!

378
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,435
Fine. I'll tell you.

379
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
You wanted to know where the
Street Demonz base was.

380
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,439
That's it?

381
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,750
And you wanted to be sure
the boss would be there.

382
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,195
Emmanuel Vasquez?

383
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Yeah.

384
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Okay. How did I seem?

385
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,872
Was I confident, flamboyant,

386
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,150
charisma for days?

387
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,520
Or a little more conservative,

388
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,153
kind of repressed,
a little nerdy?

389
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,431
You seemed stiff,
man of few words.

390
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,599
In a daze, actually.

391
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,070
Interesting.

392
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,840
Okay, let's go.

393
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,470
Where?

394
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,440
To where you
told me to go.

395
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,279
To the Street Demonz' base.

396
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,280
To Vasquez.

397
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,193
I want to know why I went there.

398
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,397
- Oh, no!
- Push her back inside. Lock the door.

399
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,676
Stay calm.

400
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,880
Okay? Her name is Ivy.

401
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
She's a witch,

402
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,240
and will burn for
what she's done.

403
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,119
I take full responsibility
for her.

404
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,709
If she's done what you say,

405
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,400
she will pay
for her crimes, but...

406
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,079
You are so utterly naive.

407
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,959
You didn't have to kill them.

408
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,594
I wanted to.

409
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,720
Why are you here?

410
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,080
I'm here for my friend.

411
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,755
Our friend.

412
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Selina.

413
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,314
Selina's the one that's hurt?

414
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,870
She's paralyzed and has
lost the will to live.

415
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Good.

416
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,352
That bitch destroyed the last
of the Lazarus Water.

417
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,714
Let her suffer.

418
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,279
I don't believe
you mean that.

419
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,256
You've known each
other for a long time.

420
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,794
You grew up on the
streets together.

421
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,674
You know, I wasn't lying when
I said this park is changing.

422
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,829
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

423
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,113
It consumes them,
and then it flourishes.

424
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,590
I think I shall plant

425
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,434
your body in the ground, Bruce.

426
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,310
What will grow from you,
I wonder?

427
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,356
Those men you killed were right.

428
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,796
You are a witch.

429
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,195
A murderous,
callous witch.

430
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,549
Trying to bait me, boy?

431
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,399
I wouldn't waste my breath.

432
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,911
I can see there's
no good left in you.

433
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,992
If you were trying to
help this park flourish,

434
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,356
it would be full
of beauty and color.

435
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,796
Instead it smells of death.

436
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,958
It's a work in progress.

437
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,273
It's a nightmare.

438
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,840
If I do help you,
you'll leave me alone?

439
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,910
Follow me.

440
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,919
It's okay.

441
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm Jim. What's your name?

442
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,992
I-I can't remember.

443
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,195
Where are your parents?

444
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Dead.

445
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,000
When the lights went
out in the city,

446
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,759
a gang came,
they murdered them.

447
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
I ran.

448
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,550
She found me.

449
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Who?

450
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
The ghost.

451
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,394
She was kind at first.

452
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,399
But she can be very cruel.

453
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,836
Jim!

454
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,736
We're not alone.
There's a crazy woman.

455
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,796
She's killing people.

456
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,394
The ghost.
We got to go.

457
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,296
- She hates strangers.
- There's no such thing as ghosts.

458
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,656
We'll protect you
from whoever she is.

459
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
You can't.

460
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,116
Why? Who is she?

461
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,717
She makes me call her Mother.

462
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,719
We got to go.

463
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,871
He's not lying!
Come on, Jim.

464
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
Hey!

465
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Hey!

466
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,909
Come on!

467
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,680
Kid!

468
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Hey, kid!

469
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,434
The lights will make you dizzy.

470
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,994
And then you'll fall asleep.

471
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,516
You won't feel a thing.

472
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,272
Jim, I don't feel so good.

473
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,517
You can't fight it.
Give in to it.

474
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,510
Jim!

475
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,398
- Who are you?
- I'm the only mother that boy knows.

476
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,313
You're a crazy bitch
who kills people,

477
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,392
takes their stuff
and burns their bodies.

478
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,119
I'm protecting him.

479
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,395
When I found him,
he was barely alive.

480
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,710
Those animals out there,

481
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,639
they would have
killed him or worse.

482
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,192
I taught him how to survive.

483
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Hey!

484
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,196
Where is everybody?

485
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,599
Beats me.

486
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,670
Come on.

487
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
Oh, boy.

488
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,878
Holy crap.

489
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,794
That's Vasquez.

490
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,076
Did you do this?

491
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,439
Honestly, I don't remember.

492
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,110
What about that?

493
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,194
Penguin did this.

494
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,794
I think not.

495
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,474
Well, whoever did
just started one hell of a war.

496
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Here.

497
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,509
Is that human blood?

498
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,995
If Selina ingests this, it'll
find its way to her wound.

499
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,039
Its roots will wrap around
her spine,

500
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,317
fusing the nerves
and cartilage together.

501
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,836
It'll cure her?

502
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
Maybe.

503
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,999
Just maybe?

504
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,195
Everyone's different.

505
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,880
Depends
on how strong she is.

506
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,439
One thing
is for sure though...

507
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,753
the seed
will alter her forever.

508
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,113
- How?
- Some say

509
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,432
the darker angels of our nature
are unlocked and set free.

510
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,436
Can she live with that?

511
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,559
Can you?

512
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,313
I don't know
if there's any other way.

513
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,913
Then go.
Give it to her.

514
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,674
What's the matter, Bruce?

515
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,117
Don't know
if you can trust me?

516
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,914
- I don't.
- Good.

517
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,833
Then you're finally
becoming a man.

518
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,360
- Where will you go?
- Where I'm going is none of your business.

519
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,314
Best hurry.

520
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,870
That root will die if left out
in the open for too long.

521
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Uh...

522
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,096
Where have you guys been?
You've been gone for a while.

523
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,952
Chasing ghosts.
They're like rats

524
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,336
in the walls.
This whole place is

525
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,238
their spiderweb. Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

526
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,352
We got to go. Not everyone
wants your help,

527
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,676
Jim Gordon.

528
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,840
Detective Gordon,
your hand's bleeding.

529
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,630
We need to leave.

530
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Come on.

531
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,715
How many bullets
you got left?

532
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Two.

533
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,879
Looky here, boys!

534
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
I'll tell you what,

535
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,238
you give me
my workers back,

536
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,917
and I'll let you
and your partner go.

537
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,035
I'm just kidding.

538
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,674
Of course I'm not gonna do that.

539
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,480
I'm gonna kill you all!

540
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,200
Wait just a minute,

541
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,955
please.

542
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,278
The prize for
this man's head

543
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
is mine.

544
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,716
How is she?

545
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Not great.

546
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,679
I mean,
she hasn't said a peep

547
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,716
since you've been gone.

548
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,475
You all right?

549
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,950
Did you find the witch?

550
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,640
It was Ivy.

551
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
What's that?

552
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:48,198
Ivy said it could
help Selina.

553
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,439
What, and you trust her?

554
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,760
What choice do I have?

555
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,516
Listen, I want to help Selina
as much as you,

556
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,036
but Ivy is a maniacal,
cold-hearted killer.

557
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,431
- You know that, don't you?
- Give it to me.

558
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,154
Selina, I have doubts.

559
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,070
Bruce, I was willing
to kill myself yesterday.

560
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,880
Nothing's changed since then.

561
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,033
So if Ivy wants
to kill me,

562
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,594
she can have at it.

563
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,239
What do I do,
just swallow it?

564
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
Yeah.

565
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,709
Still here.

566
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,279
I know Ivy's lost her mind.

567
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
But...

568
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,714
after her mom and dad died,

569
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,400
she was just...

570
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,275
sleeping on the streets.

571
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,677
And it was
a cold winter, and...

572
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,437
she started
to get really sick.

573
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,073
So I...

574
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,355
took her under my wing, I guess,

575
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
and...

576
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,598
showed her where to get food,

577
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,037
where to get a roof
over her head.

578
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,999
And after some time,

579
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,673
she started to get color
in her face.

580
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,960
And I just...

581
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,638
kept checking in on her.

582
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,479
Almost every day.

583
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,513
She may look old now, but...

584
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,870
she'll always be
that little girl to me.

585
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,440
- No, no, no, Selina.
- Doctor!

586
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,920
- Selina.
- Doctor!

587
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Selina, stay with me.

588
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,271
Stay back. Give us room.

589
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
No, Selina.

590
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,680
She's burning up.

591
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,273
Pulse is low. What happened?

592
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,193
Oh, God, what have I done?

593
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,800
Put it down, Knucklehead!

594
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,840
You two clowns ain't got
a single bullet between you.

595
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
Wrong.

596
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,476
I got two.

597
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Prove it.

598
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,713
I won't say it
again, freak.

599
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,355
Gordon comes with me.

600
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,910
I'll tell you what!

601
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,193
I'll take his head,
and you can have

602
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,555
the rest of him!

603
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Hi, Jim.

604
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,760
About our last chat...

605
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,512
...I may have been
a little rash.

606
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,039
This what got you
all hot and bothered?

607
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,192
- They need a bath.
- Crazy bi...

608
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,270
Wow.

609
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,797
Your last bullet,
just for me, huh?

610
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,515
Must be love.

611
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,600
Not all square yet though.

612
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,960
You're gonna help me do
what we all know needs doing.

613
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,230
Oh, yeah? What's that?

614
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,714
Kill Penguin.

615
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
How 'bout we table this
until I can get them safely

616
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,758
into the Green Zone, huh?
Come on.

617
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Wow.

618
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,994
You're safe now. Go on.

619
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,075
You made it.

620
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,955
You had me worried.

621
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
All sorts of chatter out there
about people hunting

622
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,353
you down for Penguin's
reward money.

623
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,400
Well, they'll just have
to try harder.

624
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,714
He did have help from
the unlikeliest of places.

625
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,715
You're welcome.

626
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,479
Show me what you got.

627
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Nice place.

628
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,872
250 apartments.
Running water, hot and cold.

629
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,799
Gas. No electricity yet.

630
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,110
Is there a bar?

631
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,198
Once the kids
we liberated moved in,

632
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,880
word got out pretty fast
that there was

633
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,394
a safe place
to live in the city.

634
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,992
Citizens are heading here
in droves.

635
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,395
This place will be full
by sundown.

636
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,515
Then we'll find another.

637
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,191
I just want to thank you,
Captain Gordon.

638
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,075
My family, we've been drifting
from one place to the next

639
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,560
ever since
the blackout.

640
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,509
You've delivered us.

641
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,314
Seriously?

642
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,513
I'll see you around, killer.

643
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,950
We have some unfinished
business, you and I.

644
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,040
Whatever she took
put her body into shock.

645
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,429
Her temperature
skyrocketed.

646
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,751
Her WBC count was
off the charts.

647
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,199
Then, two hours ago,
everything stabilized.

648
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,273
I have no idea why.

649
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,076
She was still in a lot of
pain, so we sedated her.

650
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,160
She's been sleeping
for a while now.

651
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,669
I think it'd be best to
come back in the morning.

652
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,519
Thank you, Doctor.

653
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,520
Right. Master Bruce,
I think we should,

654
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
uh...

655
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,880
we should get
some shut-eye.

656
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Come on.

657
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,195
Bruce.

658
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,960
It's a miracle.

659
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
How do you feel?

660
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,240
Different.

661
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
Any pain?

662
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
No.

663
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,517
Selina, I thought
I'd killed you.

664
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,560
I'm better.

665
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,636
Even better than before,
in fact.
