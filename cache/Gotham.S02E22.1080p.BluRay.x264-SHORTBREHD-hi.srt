- Mother.
- Why?

Why? It was not your fault.

Where are you going?

651
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:26,907
I have to find Lee.

652
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:28,826
Right move, mate.

653
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,455
(INHALES) Do me a favor.

654
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,123
Say goodbye to Bullock for me.

655
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,459
I don't really want
the whole Celtic farewell.

658
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:43,424
Will do.

I'll keep that in mind.

662
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:07,573
Well, there's a man who's
got his priorities straight.

663
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,785
The love of a good woman and all that.

664
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,623
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson, Master Bruce.

665
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:19,168
And that's the end of your adventures
with the police, eh?

666
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:23,631
There's a secret council, Alfred.

667
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,217
A secret council that
runs everything in Gotham.

668
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:27,760
Oh, bloody hell.

669
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,345
It's them that wanted me dead.

670
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:32,848
We're so close, Alfred.
We're so close to the ultimate truth.

671
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,435
- Oh, bloody hell.
- Hey, don't look at me.

672
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,817
Right.

673
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:44,819
Right.

Hey.

We got monsters to find.

678
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:54,870
And you'll find 'em. I have to go.

679
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:56,831
But the city's in danger!

680
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,668
You got this, I know you do.
And I have more important things to do.

681
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,419
- And Harvey--
- Yeah?

682
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:04,421
You're the boss now.

683
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:06,966
Maybe get a haircut?
