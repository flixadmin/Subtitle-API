SLADE:
So your campaign begins.

480
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,995
The city needs a leader.

481
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:03,917
And putting the copycat Hoods up to
assassinating the mayor was just the first step.

482
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,838
The vigilante...

483
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,342
...he destroyed the centrifuge
and the serum along with it.

484
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,804
I will arrange for you
to receive another sample of my blood.

485
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,557
And then you can begin
to mass-produce the serum again.

486
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:24,604
When I ask you not to confront the vigilante,
you will listen.

487
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:29,359
Remember,
your mask can be worn by another.

488
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,280
You know who he is under that hood,
don't you?

489
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:38,076
I know exactly who he is.

490
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,954
He's my friend.

491
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,415
That's why you don't want him dead.

492
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:49,796
Death would be a release from this life,
and his sentence is yet to be carried out.

<i>I am going to tear everything he cares about
away from him.</i>

<i>Destroy those who choose to follow him.</i>

495
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,732
<i>Corrupt those he loves.</i>

496
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:14,362
Once he has lost everyone
and everything he values...

497
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,992
...I will drive an arrow through his eye.
