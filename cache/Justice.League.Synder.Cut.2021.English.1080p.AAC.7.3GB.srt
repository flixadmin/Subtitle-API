if we're gonna do this,

838

you're gonna need to be open

that we didn't...

You still have a life

01:29:06,089 --> 01:29:07,341
Give me your hand, man.

998
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:16,016
[sighs] I want you
to listen to me, Barry.

999
01:29:16,183 --> 01:29:19,937
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

1000
01:29:25,692 --> 01:29:27,820
I want you
to give all that up.

1001
01:29:30,447 --> 01:29:33,825
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

1002
01:29:35,994 --> 01:29:39,164
I am a drag on your life.

[sighs]

1004
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:46,213
Okay. Um...

1005
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:49,842
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

1006
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:51,176
Please.

1007
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:52,844
Hey, you know what
criminal justice

1008
01:29:52,928 --> 01:29:54,680
would be for me?

1009
01:29:54,763 --> 01:29:59,560
My son not wasting his life.

1010
01:30:00,894 --> 01:30:02,729
You can be
whatever you wanna be.

1011
01:30:02,813 --> 01:30:04,231
You're brilliant, man.

1012
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:09,528
Absolute best of the best.

1013
01:30:11,029 --> 01:30:16,034
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

1014
01:30:16,118 --> 01:30:17,953
for some old dude

1015
01:30:18,078 --> 01:30:21,248
who's not going anywhere.

1016
01:30:21,331 --> 01:30:22,791
-Dad, that's not true.
-[prison guard] It's time.

1017
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:24,126
That's not true.

1018
01:30:24,251 --> 01:30:25,711
[prison guard]
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

1019
01:30:25,794 --> 01:30:27,379
I want you
to make your own future.

1020
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:29,423
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

1021
01:30:29,548 --> 01:30:30,883
[prison guard] Open gate.

1022
01:30:30,966 --> 01:30:32,467
Great.

1023
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:34,094
[gate buzzing]

1024
01:30:35,971 --> 01:30:38,265
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

1025
01:30:38,432 --> 01:30:39,975
[prison guard] Clear.
Close the gate.

Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

1032
01:31:36,198 --> 01:31:37,699
You said that like it explains

1033
01:31:37,824 --> 01:31:40,160
why there's a total stranger
in my place

1034
01:31:40,327 --> 01:31:43,413
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

[paper rustles]

1036

Tell me about this.

1037
01:31:51,171 --> 01:31:53,965
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

1038
01:31:54,049 --> 01:31:57,010
but who is definitely not me.

1039
01:31:57,928 --> 01:31:59,805
Somebody... I don't know.

1040
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:01,807
Hippie, long hair.

1041
01:32:01,932 --> 01:32:04,726
Very attractive Jewish boy.

1042

Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.

1043
01:32:09,022 --> 01:32:10,482
I know you have abilities.

1044
01:32:10,524 --> 01:32:12,818
I just don't know
what they are.

1045
01:32:12,943 --> 01:32:13,986
My special skills

1046
01:32:14,069 --> 01:32:16,738
include viola, web design,

1047
01:32:16,863 --> 01:32:19,700
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

1048

[Bruce] Silica-based
sand quartz fabric.

1049
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,872
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.

1050
01:32:26,039 --> 01:32:27,916
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

1051
01:32:28,041 --> 01:32:29,668
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

1052
01:32:29,793 --> 01:32:31,503
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

1053
01:32:31,628 --> 01:32:34,381
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

1054
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,509
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

1055
01:32:37,592 --> 01:32:39,886
but whoever
you're looking for,

1056
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:41,138
it's not me.

You're the Batman?

1060
01:33:24,806 --> 01:33:27,601
So, you're fast.

1061
01:33:27,684 --> 01:33:29,352
That feels
like an oversimplification.

1062
01:33:29,478 --> 01:33:31,271
I'm putting together a team.

1063
01:33:31,396 --> 01:33:33,440
People with special abilities.

1064
01:33:33,607 --> 01:33:35,233
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

1065
01:33:35,275 --> 01:33:37,527
Stop right there. I'm in.

1066
01:33:38,612 --> 01:33:39,905
You are?

1067
01:33:39,988 --> 01:33:41,072
Just like that?

1068
01:33:41,156 --> 01:33:42,449
Yeah. [hesitates]

1069
01:33:44,242 --> 01:33:46,787
I need friends.

1070
01:33:46,912 --> 01:33:50,165
Great. Great.

1071
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:52,501
Can I keep this?

1072
01:33:52,626 --> 01:33:54,461
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

1073
01:33:54,544 --> 01:33:56,254
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

1074
01:33:56,379 --> 01:33:57,798
I call it the Speed Force.

1075
01:33:57,923 --> 01:33:59,633
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

1076
01:33:59,716 --> 01:34:02,594
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

1077
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:05,180
I am a snack hole.

1078
01:34:05,305 --> 01:34:08,183
How many people are
on this special fight team?

1079
01:34:08,308 --> 01:34:10,268
-Three, including you.
-Three?

1080
01:34:10,352 --> 01:34:13,105
Against what?

1081
01:34:13,188 --> 01:34:14,731
I'll tell you on the plane.

1082
01:34:15,273 --> 01:34:17,067
Plane?

1083

What are your
superpowers again?

Oh, Miss Prince,
let me do that.

1091
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,682
[Diana] No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

1092
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,642
[sniffs] Would you like
to have some?

1093
01:34:50,767 --> 01:34:52,185
Uh, no, thank you.

1094
01:34:53,353 --> 01:34:55,814
If you put the water in first.

1095
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:59,276
-[Diana] Of course.
-So we don't scald the tea.

1096
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:03,488
-Yes.
-Great.

1097
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:05,824
No, that's probably
enough tea.

1098
01:35:05,907 --> 01:35:08,201
[Diana] All right.

1099
01:35:08,326 --> 01:35:09,703
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

1100
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:13,915
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

1101
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:17,043
I will.
I will, definitely will.

1102
01:35:17,127 --> 01:35:19,337
Uh... What are you working on?

1103
01:35:19,421 --> 01:35:21,256
It's a gauntlet

lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

1105

-Wow.
-Here, let me show you.

1106
01:35:27,721 --> 01:35:30,932
We borrowed this from

Thank you, thank you.

1110
01:35:35,645 --> 01:35:36,688
Of course.

A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

It's Master Wayne's idea.

1118
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:57,584
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

1130
01:37:43,189 --> 01:37:44,482
You know who I am.

1131
01:37:44,566 --> 01:37:46,818
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

1132
01:37:46,901 --> 01:37:50,155
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

1133
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,489
The world does.

1134
01:37:52,574 --> 01:37:54,534
Fuck the world.

1135
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:58,538
[Diana] You've obviously
been through a great deal.

1136
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:02,667
I can't begin to imagine what.

1137
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:06,338
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

1138
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:08,256
Gifts?

1139

looks like a gift to you?

1140

We need you, Victor.

1141
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:14,220
And maybe you need us.

1142
01:38:14,304 --> 01:38:16,014
I don't need anyone.

1143
01:38:18,224 --> 01:38:19,392
Not anymore.

1144
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:21,936
I told myself the same
for a long time.

1145
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:31,571
I lost someone I loved once.

1146
01:38:34,324 --> 01:38:39,079
I shut myself off
from everyone.

1147
01:38:40,663 --> 01:38:43,583
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

1149
01:38:49,672 --> 01:38:53,635
And if you asked to meet me...

1150
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,679
you're working on it, too.

do you think
Batman is connected

to the object
the CID is looking for?

No...

I don't.

and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:47,410
I'll talk to him tonight.

the perimeter guards
were taken.

He won't send reinforcements.

He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel. [sighs]

Your queen left me

what they know,

Okay.

[The Flash] At the lab.

1296
01:52:57,102 --> 01:52:59,230
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

So the eight
may still be alive.

Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

1302
01:53:14,078 --> 01:53:15,329
So, how do we find him?

1303
01:53:15,454 --> 01:53:16,997
There must be a nest nearby.

1304
01:53:17,122 --> 01:53:21,418
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

1305

No discernable pattern
I can see.

don't converge.

On land.

1308
01:53:26,757 --> 01:53:28,175
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

between the two cities.

1310
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:30,594
These are air vents.

1311
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,179
They all lead
down to the tunnel

1312
01:53:32,304 --> 01:53:34,473

that was abandoned in '29.

is he coming with us now,

1315
01:53:39,019 --> 01:53:40,980
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

02:08:41,838 --> 02:08:44,841
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

[Wonder Woman]
It called to him.

1488
02:08:50,930 --> 02:08:52,348
The Mother Box.

1489
02:08:52,432 --> 02:08:53,933
The one he already has.

1490
02:08:54,058 --> 02:08:57,270
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1491
02:08:57,395 --> 02:08:59,898
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

1492
02:08:59,981 --> 02:09:01,274
If he doesn't already have it.

1493
02:09:04,819 --> 02:09:06,362
He doesn't have it.

1494
02:09:09,365 --> 02:09:10,658
I do.

1495
02:09:21,085 --> 02:09:23,213
Have you finished
the conquest?

1496
02:09:23,296 --> 02:09:24,547
Not yet, DeSaad.

1497
02:09:24,631 --> 02:09:27,091
Then why do you summon me?

1498
02:09:27,217 --> 02:09:28,718
I bring news.

1499
02:09:28,843 --> 02:09:31,846
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

1500
02:09:31,971 --> 02:09:37,143
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1501
02:09:37,268 --> 02:09:39,395
The Anti-Life Equation.

1502
02:09:39,479 --> 02:09:41,564
The key to
controlling all life

1503
02:09:41,606 --> 02:09:44,108
and all will
throughout the multiverse.

1504
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:47,445
He found it hidden
on a primitive planet,
but before...

1505
02:09:47,528 --> 02:09:50,406
The story of the defiance
is well-known.

1506
02:09:50,531 --> 02:09:53,201
I have found
the primitive planet.

1507
02:09:53,326 --> 02:09:55,328
The world that fought back.

1508
02:09:55,453 --> 02:09:57,413
It is Earth.

1509
02:09:57,455 --> 02:09:59,707
The Anti-Life Equation
is carved

1510
02:09:59,832 --> 02:10:03,878

of this very world.

Are you certain?

1513
02:10:09,133 --> 02:10:10,176
I have seen it.

1514
02:10:10,301 --> 02:10:13,513
I have looked
with my own eyes.

Oh, Steppenwolf.

[Steppenwolf] My lord, I am
but your humble servant.

1525
02:11:08,443 --> 02:11:11,321
Can it be true
that you have found it?

1526
02:11:11,404 --> 02:11:14,240
[Steppenwolf]
I have, great one.

1527
02:11:14,365 --> 02:11:17,326
The lost world is Earth.

1528
02:11:17,452 --> 02:11:21,664
Anti-Life is here.

1529
02:11:21,706 --> 02:11:25,043
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

synchronize The Unity,
and when this world
is scorched,

I will come
for my great prize.

You will come to Earth?

1533
02:11:35,803 --> 02:11:40,224
I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust

02:11:40,349 --> 02:11:41,768
looking for Anti-Life.

1535
02:11:41,893 --> 02:11:45,271
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1536
02:11:45,396 --> 02:11:48,566
I will stride
across their bones

1537
02:11:48,649 --> 02:11:51,235
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

1538
02:11:51,319 --> 02:11:54,113
And all of existence

1539
02:11:54,238 --> 02:11:57,533
shall be mine.

[grunts softly]

It shall be so, my master.

02:12:09,253 --> 02:12:10,880
[Barry] So cool.

1543
02:12:10,963 --> 02:12:13,925
From the outside,
it looks like this building
was abandoned.

1544

It wants to fly.

1545

You talk to machines?

[Victor] I speak
to intelligence.

1547

This one's saying
she can't fly

1548
02:12:25,853 --> 02:12:27,480
because of a software issue,

1549
02:12:27,605 --> 02:12:29,732
but I could fix it
with a little time.

1550
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:41,744
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

1551
02:12:41,828 --> 02:12:44,288
I could feel
the other two boxes.

1552
02:12:44,372 --> 02:12:46,249
I know they're awake,

1553
02:12:46,332 --> 02:12:47,875
but I can't see
where they are.

1554
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,128
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

1555
02:12:50,253 --> 02:12:52,296
Even if we knew,

1556
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:55,633
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1557
02:12:57,635 --> 02:12:59,011
Maybe one.

1558
02:12:59,137 --> 02:13:01,556
Hmm, Superman.

1559
02:13:01,681 --> 02:13:03,349
[Victor] As long as
the third box is asleep,

1560
02:13:03,474 --> 02:13:05,726
they can't see it,
only sense it.

1561
02:13:05,852 --> 02:13:08,104
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1562
02:13:08,187 --> 02:13:09,605
No. That's just a strategy

1563
02:13:09,730 --> 02:13:11,691
to lose more slowly,
not to win.

1564
02:13:11,816 --> 02:13:14,652
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

1565
02:13:14,735 --> 02:13:15,820
Why don't we just destroy it?

1566
02:13:15,945 --> 02:13:18,030
Fire doesn't
destroy the boxes.

1567
02:13:18,156 --> 02:13:20,074
They're an unknown form
of matter.

1568
02:13:20,199 --> 02:13:21,450
Oh, they love heat.

1569
02:13:21,492 --> 02:13:23,661
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

1570
02:13:23,786 --> 02:13:26,455
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

1571
02:13:26,497 --> 02:13:27,790
Makes you think.

1572
02:13:27,874 --> 02:13:30,501
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

1573
02:13:30,626 --> 02:13:32,295
Are you trying
to say something?

1574
02:13:32,378 --> 02:13:34,130
Oh, I'm saying it.

1575
02:13:34,213 --> 02:13:36,507
How do we know you're not
working for them?

1576
02:13:38,217 --> 02:13:40,261
It's a long story.

1577
02:13:40,386 --> 02:13:42,221
You got somewhere else to be?

1578
02:13:49,604 --> 02:13:51,063
The Nazis found the box

1579
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:53,524
at the end
of the Second World War,

1580
02:13:53,608 --> 02:13:56,694
buried under
an Italian monastery.

1581
02:13:56,777 --> 02:13:59,113
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1582
02:13:59,238 --> 02:14:02,158
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

1583
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:06,495
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1584
02:14:06,537 --> 02:14:08,414
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

1585
02:14:08,539 --> 02:14:10,291
for 70 years

1586
02:14:10,416 --> 02:14:13,920
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

1587
02:14:15,213 --> 02:14:17,715
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

1588
02:14:17,798 --> 02:14:18,966
between the ship...

1589
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:22,220
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1590
02:14:22,386 --> 02:14:26,057
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

1591
02:14:26,182 --> 02:14:28,226
Different civilizations,

1592
02:14:28,309 --> 02:14:31,354
similar properties.

1593
02:14:31,437 --> 02:14:34,857
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1594
02:14:34,982 --> 02:14:38,444
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

1595
02:14:38,569 --> 02:14:40,571
And so did.

1596
02:14:42,615 --> 02:14:43,783
Then...

1597
02:14:45,743 --> 02:14:48,788
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

1598
02:14:48,913 --> 02:14:52,124
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

1599
02:14:52,250 --> 02:14:54,835
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

He unleashed

02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:15,815
he didn't fully understand.

1604
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:18,609
He used that power
to keep me alive.

but turned into this.

1608
02:15:28,786 --> 02:15:31,205
The box went back to sleep

1609
02:15:31,956 --> 02:15:33,874
and he never returned it.

1610
02:15:36,210 --> 02:15:38,629
That researcher
was Silas Stone.

1611
02:15:40,214 --> 02:15:41,882
My father.

1612
02:15:45,136 --> 02:15:46,762
Wait,

1613
02:15:46,846 --> 02:15:50,141
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1614
02:15:50,308 --> 02:15:52,643
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

1615
02:15:52,810 --> 02:15:55,104
They're change machines.

1616
02:15:55,187 --> 02:15:58,357
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

1617
02:15:58,482 --> 02:16:00,401
alive or dead.

1618
02:16:00,526 --> 02:16:02,945
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1619
02:16:02,987 --> 02:16:04,739
regenerate, reinstate.

1620
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:06,282
Reinstate?

1621
02:16:06,407 --> 02:16:07,825
[Victor] A box has the power

1622
02:16:07,908 --> 02:16:09,827
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1623
02:16:09,994 --> 02:16:11,829
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1624
02:16:11,954 --> 02:16:13,080
can't be created or destroyed,

1625
02:16:13,205 --> 02:16:15,207
their relations
just transform.

1626
02:16:15,333 --> 02:16:18,169
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1627
02:16:18,252 --> 02:16:20,838
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1628
02:16:20,963 --> 02:16:25,176
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1629
02:16:27,053 --> 02:16:28,804
But a Mother Box...

1630
02:16:28,929 --> 02:16:31,307
...turns smoke
back into a house.

1631

[sighs]

I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

[softly] Hi.

1639
02:17:32,243 --> 02:17:33,828
I went to the Daily Planet

to finally pick up
Clark's things. [chuckles]

I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

02:17:44,922 --> 02:17:46,757
I lost the farm.

02:17:48,092 --> 02:17:50,344
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

1644
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:53,055
Truth is, the house is too big

02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:55,891
for me to live in
by myself anyway.

1646
02:17:56,016 --> 02:17:58,936
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1647
02:17:59,019 --> 02:18:01,147
for as long as you need.

1648
02:18:02,106 --> 02:18:05,025
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

1649
02:18:06,402 --> 02:18:08,696
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1650
02:18:08,821 --> 02:18:10,781
right by the diner.

1651
02:18:10,865 --> 02:18:12,283
I'm not here for help.

1652
02:18:13,451 --> 02:18:15,953
I'm here because

1653
02:18:16,078 --> 02:18:18,789
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

1654
02:18:19,999 --> 02:18:23,085
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

1655
02:18:25,629 --> 02:18:26,922
[sighs softly]

1656
02:18:27,757 --> 02:18:29,425
I can't.

1657
02:18:36,182 --> 02:18:38,851
The whole world is mourning.

1658
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:40,019
[sighs]

1659
02:18:40,144 --> 02:18:42,438
Grieving over a symbol.

1660
02:18:42,563 --> 02:18:46,817
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."

1661
02:18:47,735 --> 02:18:49,778
I hear what people say.

1662
02:18:49,862 --> 02:18:51,864
They talk like they knew him.

1663
02:18:52,865 --> 02:18:55,284
But they didn't know Clark.

1664
02:18:56,744 --> 02:18:59,038
And I can't stop them

1665
02:18:59,163 --> 02:19:03,542
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

1666
02:19:05,586 --> 02:19:08,005
You're the only one who knows.

1667
02:19:08,130 --> 02:19:10,841
Who feels what I do.

1668
02:19:11,884 --> 02:19:15,054
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

1669
02:19:18,015 --> 02:19:21,519
I came all this way
because I wanted...

1670
02:19:21,602 --> 02:19:23,562
because I wanted to see you.

1671
02:19:24,814 --> 02:19:26,815
Tell you...

1672
02:19:26,857 --> 02:19:28,943
I understand.

1673
02:19:30,694 --> 02:19:32,655
I...

1674
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:36,825
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1675
02:19:40,454 --> 02:19:42,414
And I just miss him.

1676
02:19:43,582 --> 02:19:46,001
I miss him so much.

1677
02:19:46,085 --> 02:19:47,378
[Lois sniffles]

1678
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:54,218
So do I, sweetheart.

1679
02:19:57,054 --> 02:19:58,556
[sighs]

1680
02:19:58,681 --> 02:20:03,561
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1681
02:20:07,064 --> 02:20:09,942
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1682
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:14,488
Come back to the living.

1683
02:20:17,908 --> 02:20:19,076
[door opens]

1684
02:20:28,210 --> 02:20:30,045
[suspenseful music plays]

1685
02:20:54,278 --> 02:20:57,364
The world
needs you, too, Lois.

1686
02:21:00,993 --> 02:21:02,328
[Arthur] The dead are dead.

1687
02:21:02,453 --> 02:21:04,455
The box brought Victor back.

1688
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:06,040
Victor wasn't dead.

1689
02:21:06,165 --> 02:21:07,958
Life is either one or zero.

1690
02:21:08,083 --> 02:21:11,045
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

1691
02:21:11,170 --> 02:21:12,796
Can you operate this box,
Victor?

1692
02:21:12,921 --> 02:21:14,214
[Victor] Of course.

1693
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:16,634
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1694
02:21:16,717 --> 02:21:18,969
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

1695
02:21:20,554 --> 02:21:22,139
-[Diana sighs]
-[Barry] Okay, but...

1696
02:21:22,306 --> 02:21:26,602
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1697
02:21:26,644 --> 02:21:27,937
What do we have to lose?

1698
02:21:28,062 --> 02:21:30,522
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

1699
02:21:30,648 --> 02:21:32,066
As soon as it wakes up...

1700
02:21:32,191 --> 02:21:34,652
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1701
02:21:34,818 --> 02:21:37,279
activates The Unity.
The end.

1702
02:21:37,363 --> 02:21:39,698
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1703
02:21:39,823 --> 02:21:41,992
to a bunch
of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

1704
02:21:42,117 --> 02:21:44,495
Even if Superman could return,

1705
02:21:44,662 --> 02:21:46,789
who's to say
that he could defeat them?

1706
02:21:46,872 --> 02:21:48,874
The Mother Box did.

1707
02:21:48,999 --> 02:21:51,168
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

1708
02:21:51,293 --> 02:21:54,129
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

1709
02:21:54,254 --> 02:21:56,173
Didn't call out
to Steppenwolf.

1710
02:21:56,256 --> 02:21:57,841
None of the boxes did.
Not until...

1711
02:21:57,966 --> 02:22:00,010
Not until Superman died.

1712
02:22:00,177 --> 02:22:02,471
Not until Superman died.

1713
02:22:02,596 --> 02:22:04,556
It's like they were
afraid of him?

1714
02:22:04,682 --> 02:22:07,685
[Bruce] Yes,
they were afraid of him.

1715
02:22:10,729 --> 02:22:12,523
This is the only way.

1716
02:22:13,857 --> 02:22:18,028
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1717
02:22:34,211 --> 02:22:36,213
[Barry] Cross this one off
the bucket list.

1718
02:22:36,296 --> 02:22:40,300
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

1719
02:22:41,969 --> 02:22:44,680
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

1720
02:22:45,431 --> 02:22:46,724
We could.

1721
02:22:54,231 --> 02:22:56,066
He was my hero.

1722
02:22:58,610 --> 02:22:59,737
All right.

1723
02:23:03,282 --> 02:23:06,535
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

1724
02:23:06,618 --> 02:23:07,786
Half-Atlantean.

1725
02:23:09,580 --> 02:23:12,791
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1726
02:23:12,916 --> 02:23:17,046
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1727
02:23:17,129 --> 02:23:19,965
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

1728
02:23:20,090 --> 02:23:22,259
Hate is useless.

1729
02:23:25,429 --> 02:23:26,597
Yep.

1730
02:23:27,931 --> 02:23:29,558
No, thank you.

1731
02:23:33,979 --> 02:23:35,105
You know, my father told me

1732
02:23:35,230 --> 02:23:37,149
there's a saying
in Atlantis...

1733
02:23:38,609 --> 02:23:40,903
"None are taken back
from the darkness.

1734
02:23:40,986 --> 02:23:42,196
"Not without..."

1735
02:23:42,321 --> 02:23:43,822
"Not without
giving one up in return."

1736
02:23:46,074 --> 02:23:47,659
We say the same thing.

1737
02:23:50,245 --> 02:23:51,997
How about that?

1738
02:23:52,122 --> 02:23:54,166
Wonder Woman.

1739
02:23:55,292 --> 02:23:56,585
What do you think, man?

1740
02:23:56,668 --> 02:23:59,463
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

1741
02:23:59,588 --> 02:24:02,424
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1742
02:24:04,134 --> 02:24:06,178
Every guy's a younger guy.

1743
02:24:07,971 --> 02:24:09,056
[Alfred] Jesus.

1744
02:24:09,181 --> 02:24:10,599
[steam hissing]

1745
02:24:10,641 --> 02:24:12,434
Oh, Christ.

-[blasting]
-Oh, bloody...

1747
02:24:18,690 --> 02:24:19,775
Any luck?

1748
02:24:19,817 --> 02:24:21,193
If by "luck" you mean

1749
02:24:21,318 --> 02:24:24,112
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1750
02:24:24,238 --> 02:24:26,448
then, no. No luck.

1751
02:24:27,199 --> 02:24:28,659
[Bruce] It's okay.

1752
02:24:28,742 --> 02:24:30,702
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1753
02:24:30,828 --> 02:24:31,954
to the Kryptonian ship.

1754
02:24:32,079 --> 02:24:33,330
It's basically
an organic computer.

1755
02:24:33,455 --> 02:24:35,165
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

1756
02:24:35,332 --> 02:24:37,918
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?

1757
02:24:38,043 --> 02:24:39,294
[Bruce] Something like that.

1758
02:24:39,419 --> 02:24:43,215
[Alfred] Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

1759
02:24:44,174 --> 02:24:45,551
[Alfred sighing]

1760
02:24:49,721 --> 02:24:51,348
Master Wayne...

1761
02:24:53,225 --> 02:24:54,601
you did it!

1762
02:24:54,726 --> 02:24:58,272
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1763
02:24:58,397 --> 02:25:01,483
You've fulfilled your promise.

1764
02:25:01,567 --> 02:25:05,487
But to try to do that...
I mean...

1765
02:25:05,612 --> 02:25:08,532
your guilt's
overcome your reason.

1766
02:25:08,699 --> 02:25:10,826
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

1767
02:25:10,868 --> 02:25:14,204
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly
on faith,

1768
02:25:14,329 --> 02:25:16,707
not on reason.

1769
02:25:16,832 --> 02:25:21,170
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

1770
02:25:21,295 --> 02:25:23,422
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

1771
02:25:23,547 --> 02:25:26,508
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

1772
02:25:26,592 --> 02:25:29,136
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

1773
02:25:29,261 --> 02:25:31,054
then don't wave
the red cape at it.

1774
02:25:31,138 --> 02:25:32,848
You do
when it's this red cape.

1775
02:25:32,931 --> 02:25:35,225
This red cape charges back.

1776
02:25:49,865 --> 02:25:50,949
Okay.

1777
02:25:57,789 --> 02:26:00,292
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

1778
02:26:00,417 --> 02:26:01,919
Everyone's clear,
including you.

1779
02:26:02,085 --> 02:26:04,755
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1780
02:26:04,838 --> 02:26:06,757
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1781
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:07,799
Absolutely.

1782
02:26:11,637 --> 02:26:12,888
-Thanks.
-Listen up, everyone.

1783
02:26:12,971 --> 02:26:15,599
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

02:26:15,724 --> 02:26:17,267
If you need
more medical attention...

1785
02:26:17,351 --> 02:26:21,271
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1786
02:26:21,355 --> 02:26:22,773
-Definitely not "A."
-Okay.

1787
02:26:22,898 --> 02:26:25,943
Or... "B"?

1788
02:26:27,486 --> 02:26:28,862
Let me see "A" again?

1789
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:37,663
Right. We should get dressed.

1790
02:26:39,623 --> 02:26:41,750
I'm always dressed.

They let you out
of quarantine.

1802

Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1803

Look, crazy things
happen to time,

Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

Well, I'll put on the tea.

Great.

Not even the army goes in.

so radioactive

We'll attack from above.

So we can't blow it up?

[Cyborg] Not from the outside.

Fuse with it.

2159
02:57:35,811 --> 02:57:37,145
Weaken its bond
from the inside

2160
02:57:37,312 --> 02:57:38,563
so we can break it back
into three.

No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

These boxes together
are world destroyers.

A billion years old.

and use them to destroy you.

You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

That's what I'm gonna do.

I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

2177
02:58:26,444 --> 02:58:29,322
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

he's won.

[Deathstroke] I heard
you were a few clowns
short of a circus.

[chuckles] I was, thank you,

03:43:07,581 --> 03:43:09,833
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

03:43:09,917 --> 03:43:12,044
find some much needed clarity.

2636
03:43:12,127 --> 03:43:14,463
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

Why the pro bono work?

[sighs] It's personal.

Ah, let me guess,

You said you had something
I'd want?

You'd better not be
wasting my time.

Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

No, I wouldn't think of it.

2645
03:43:32,064 --> 03:43:33,274
Uh, I have too much
to live for.

And more important things
to do.

2647

But if you want the Batman,

here is something
that can help you.

2649

His name is Bruce Wayne.

We're almost there.

Well, we need to hurry.

We can't be out in the open
much longer.

He'll come for us.

[Mera] Let him come.

Let the bastard come.

2662
03:45:31,517 --> 03:45:33,769
I'll stab this
through his heart

2663

for what he did to Arthur.

2664
03:45:36,188 --> 03:45:38,315
I want to make him pay.

2665
03:45:39,692 --> 03:45:42,653
I understand
how you feel, Mera.

2666
03:45:42,736 --> 03:45:45,406
You have no idea how I feel.

2667
03:45:45,531 --> 03:45:47,366
But we have to
stick to the plan

2668

to have any chance
to make this right.

He knows exactly
what it's like

2674

to lose someone he loves.

2675
03:46:27,656 --> 03:46:30,075
You know, like, uh,

a father,

2677
03:46:34,037 --> 03:46:36,206
like a mother.

2678
03:46:36,290 --> 03:46:39,501
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

2679

Like an adopted son.

Maybe, in a way,

that smelly
old flounder is right.

2684

Because how many
can die in your arms

2685
03:47:02,483 --> 03:47:04,234
before you grow numb to death?

2686
03:47:05,736 --> 03:47:08,489
That's not very careful.

2687
03:47:08,614 --> 03:47:12,409
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

2688
03:47:12,451 --> 03:47:15,329
before you die inside
yourself?

2689
03:47:15,454 --> 03:47:19,166
I've been dead inside
a long time,

2690
03:47:19,291 --> 03:47:21,251
but even I have a limit.

2691
03:47:21,335 --> 03:47:23,170
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

2692

Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

is tear it in half

and I'm happy
to discuss with you

2720
03:48:45,169 --> 03:48:47,754
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

2721

to do a man's job?

You know, it's funny

2723
03:48:56,597 --> 03:48:58,056
that you would talk
about people

2724

who died in my arms

with her last breath

that when I killed you,

and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...
