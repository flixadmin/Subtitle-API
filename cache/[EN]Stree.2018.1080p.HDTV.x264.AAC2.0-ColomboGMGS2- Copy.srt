Hey, Uncle,

40
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:08,308
you start this charade in
every festival, don't you?

41
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:11,249
Vicky, there's still time.

42
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,093
This is no ordinary ink.

43
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:17,982
Crushed bones of a bat
mixed with the pee of a white crow.

44
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:19,586
That's how this ink is prepared.

45
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:24,633
Ay, Uncle, sell these stories to
those who like reading hallucinations.

46
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,566
We're the modern generation.

47
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,665
The entire city believes
in this ignorance.

48
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,749
Vicky, if any house that has
this ink outside their house...

49
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,249
<i>they will always be safe.</i>

50
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,345
I see...

51
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:38,918
Have you ever heard that the
Ambani's daughter was possessed?

52
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:40,832
Or the Tatas or Birla's were haunted.

53
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,848
I know she will come, Vicky!

54
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:45,260
Loosen your pockets
and let me finish writing.

55
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,179
<i>Hey, Uncle,</i>

56
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,625
Don't forget to write on our wall too.

57
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:49,589
And listen,

58
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,040
Please write it in bigger letters.

59
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,399
Otherwise, she might not
read it...

60
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,232
and would crash right in.

61
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,225
<i>Yeah yeah! I will.</i>

62
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:01,039
Your mouth will end
up like that aunty.

(Chanting Surya Namaskara)

65
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,457
Close the gate, mister.

66
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:08,801
Or the cow will barge in.

67
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:10,658
I am the watchman as well.

68
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:12,139
So you finally found
time to come home?

69
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,102
What is it? You should also
come with me from tomorrow.

70
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:16,999
I don't need to. My good ol sewing
machine gives me all the exercise I need.

71
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,832
And, you also don't have to'

72
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,375
Or soon you'll be
hanging from a hanger.

73
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,915
Was that a joke?

74
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,400
<i>And you're trying to be wise.</i>

75
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:27,053
I'm already observing a fast for the next four
days. And, you're making me waste my energy.

76
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:28,078
Another fast?

77
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,641
<i>Focus on your job, son...</i>

78
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,517
Soon the ladies will queue up.

79
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:36,505
Dad, How many times did I tell you
to stop taking alteration work.

80
00:08:36,506 --> 00:08:38,962
<i>"Loosen the petticoat,
tighten my blouse."</i>

81
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,963
We'll only accept orders
for stitching new clothes.

82
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:43,752
Brand new clothes only.

83
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:44,551
<i>Only?</i>

84
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:45,165
<i>Only? eh?</i>

85
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,399
And what will you do for
the rest of the year, son?

86
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,798
Ringing the bell?

87
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,193
Daddy, explaining you is impossible.

88
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:51,862
Ay, Listen...

89
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:52,499
Whoa... whoa!

90
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,125
Listen... Listen... Listen...

91
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:56,066
Look...

92
00:08:56,067 --> 00:09:01,024
You should spend some time
learning how to run the shop.

93
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:06,176
Otherwise, if someday when your daddy passes
away, you won't be able to run the show alone.

94
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:10,636
Daddy, Even if Death comes himself
to collect your soul, you won't die.

95
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:14,396
Even when your fingers will become frail,
you'll still be dealing with blouses and petticoats.

96
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:18,213
Son, soon you'll be following
in my footsteps.

97
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:20,907
Daddy,

98
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:22,999
I wasn't born to alter ladies' dresses.

99
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,791
Then what are you destined for, son?

100
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:28,249
I don't know yet, dad.
But I will know pretty soon.

101
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:44,459
Let them in.

102
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,570
brother Vicky, How are you?

103
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:48,544
Here, Stitch a suit for me.

104
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,760
Take down sister-in-law's
measurements. Step back a little.

105
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,082
Length;48, Shoulder; 14.5.

106
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,126
- Take off the shawl, sister-in-law.
- Yes.

107
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:59,665
Arm-hole;16, Wrist;
7, Chest; 38, waist; 42.

108
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,954
Turn around,

109
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,332
Hip;44, Neck:10

110
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,531
Deep or Medium?

111
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:06,376
No, not deep.
Keep it medium.

112
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:08,165
Deep's better, sister-in-law.
It's in fashion these days.

113
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,376
You'll look nice.

114
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:13,249
I am telling you, my son
is the tailor-incarnation of God.

115
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,290
Do you want it tighter?

116
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,665
The shoulder on this dress...

117
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,916
But this idiot doesn't
respect his own talent.

118
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,715
What is this boy, Khan sir?

119
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:36,083
<i>What is he?</i>

120
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,291
<i>I've stitched thousands of clothes.</i>

121
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,832
But the way his fingers
moves on the machine...

122
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,458
...feels like God's fingers
moving on the machine.

123
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:46,471
<i>The way he handles
the scissors...</i>

124
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:48,833
sounds like Goddess
Saraswati playing her Veena.

125
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:51,808
<i>When he puts a
thread in the needle,</i>

126
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:54,618
It's like conches are
resonating in my ears.

127
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,485
I am sure it's some...

128
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:58,957
connection from his past life.

129
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,138
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I am the tailor of the heart.</i></font>

130

132
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,557
I'll be back in 10 minutes, dad.
Break time.

133
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,208
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I am the tailor of the heart.</i></font>

134
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:47,541
Hi.

135
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:53,250
Hi...

136
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:55,214
Is your name Vicky?

137
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:55,795
Y...

138
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:56,137
Ye...

139
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:56,651
Yes.

140
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:59,541
last year, I saw you at the puja.

141
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:01,020
Y...

142
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:01,305
Yeah...

143
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:01,753
Yeah, yeah...

144
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,563
I've heard a lot about you.

145
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,764
I don't live here, but...

146
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:10,116
I come every year
during the festival.

147
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:11,442
I see... okay.

148
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,703
Can you stitch a dress for me?

149
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:15,359
Sure...

150
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,730
How long?

151
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:18,851
2 weeks, maybe...

152
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:20,854
Can you do it a bit quick?

153
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:23,369
How about...10 days?

154
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,073
I want it on the last
day of the festival.

155
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:28,785
for the mangal Aarthi*.
(A sort of Religious veneration)

156
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,964
Vicky, please.

157
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,126
Please hurry up...

158
00:12:45,997 --> 00:12:46,812
Then fine.

159
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:48,548
I'll get it done by someone else.

160
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:49,545
Thank you.

161
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:49,790
Uhh....

162
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,488
w... wait... t...

163
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:51,938
Two days... Two days?

164
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:57,460
Two days.

165
00:12:57,461 --> 00:12:58,751
Thank you so much.

166
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:02,766
My measurements.

167
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:11,645
Can you please....
Take the... jacket off?

168
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,578
Turn...

169
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,762
Turn around?

170
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:18,553
Turn back,

171
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:21,733
Done.

172
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:22,963
Ohh...

173
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:25,958
Thank you.

174
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:34,966
I'll be visiting the
temple in the evening.

175
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:36,300
Good.

176
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:43,799
For the evening veneration.

177
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,466
Very good.

178
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:55,090
Visiting the temple...

179
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:56,008
Okay.

180
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:06,466
(Religious venerations)

181
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:17,466
One.

182
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:30,884
See?

183
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,103
She doesn't even look at you, and
you can already hear wedding bells.

184
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:39,674
And you're Mister know-it-all,
aren't you?

185
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:43,632
Whenever I pass through her lane,
she always looks at me.

186
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,152
No, she doesn't, she stares at you.

187
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,258
Are you all right?

188
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:55,800
Will you say something? What happened?

189
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,500
Love at first eye-sight.

190
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,038
Love at first eyesight?

191
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,664
Love at first eye sight.

192
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:05,675
We both attended the English Speaking
course together. Don't try to be Shakespeare.

193
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,882
Who is the girl?

194
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:11,757
The same girl who attended the puja
last year. The one with brown eyes.

195
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:12,983
One with the long hair.

196
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:14,007
Oh...

197
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:15,883
The one you bragged about last year?

198
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,424
I wasn't bragging.

199
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,850
She came out of nowhere
like a cool breeze.

200
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:22,517
Took my hand and said...

201
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,571
"Vicky, please!"

202
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:26,924
held your hand?

203
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:27,865
Bull's sheet!

204
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:29,608
And she even said please?
-Yes.

205
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:32,713
He is lying and you believe him.
-Swear on my sewing machine.

206
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,672
She held your hand and said,
Vicky, please.

207
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:38,716
Vicky, please...

208
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:40,508
Vicky, please!

209
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:43,176
"Vicky, please!"

210
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,007
That's what I am saying,
Vicky, please.

211
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:47,290
You have no romantic emotions at all.
Give me your hand.

212
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,425
"Vicky, please!"

213
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:52,639
See, that's the emotion.

214
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:54,586
But why you?

215
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,631
She wants me to stitch a dress.

216
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,257
Stitch a dress...
I have a readymade dress shop.

217
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,799
Who gets dresses stitched nowadays.

218
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,046
You idiot, stitched dresses
have a different charisma.

219
00:16:04,324 --> 00:16:06,713
And love is never readymade.

220
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:09,091
It's always tailor-made.

221
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,466
Right.

222
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:12,425
"Vicky, please!"

223
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:15,165
Bro put it on my tab.

224
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:17,062
Jealous.

225
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,424
Ye ye...

226
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:20,171
She held this hand.

227
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:21,050
Smell it.

228
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:22,841
Sunflower.

229
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:25,935
I think you should start
planning your wedding.

230
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:28,257
Even I can hear wedding bells, Jana.

231
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:29,306
Ay dudes!

232
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:30,965
Get outta your dream worlds.

233
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,758
Today is the first
day of the festival.

234
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:36,719
Lokesh is throwing a
party at his uncle's home.

235
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,215
So we're going to have
a ball for the next four nights.

236
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:40,507
Nobody be late.

237
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:42,424
Meaning party all night and,
in the morning...

238
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:43,361
Full tight.

239
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:44,174
Right.

240
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:45,175
But that's in the morning.

241
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:51,383
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Just tell me why
do you throw tantrums.</i></font>

242
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:55,675
<font color="#ffff10"><i>I can follow you around
like your crazy lover.</i></font>

243
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:59,674
<font color="#ffff10"><i>I feel a little shy to convey.</i></font>

244
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:04,352
<font color="#ffff10"><i>But, I want to sleep in your arms.</i></font>

245
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:08,145
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I've been telling
you since February came.</i></font>

246
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:12,576
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Darling,
step out of Chanderi for me.</i></font>

247
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:16,028
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Come over to my mansion.</i></font>

248
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:26,303
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Come over to my mansion.</i></font>

249
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:34,175
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Come over to my mansion.</i></font>

250
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,246
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Come over to my mansion.</i></font>

251
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:53,050
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Come over to my mansion.</i></font>

252
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,787
You guys go ahead,
I'll join you in five minutes.

253
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:57,007
What's up?

254
00:17:57,008 --> 00:18:00,007
Nah, it's just... My head is a little
restless. I guess I'll just sit here and pray.

255
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:02,057
What's wrong with you, Vicky? Why
are you feeling so religious today?

256
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:05,496
That dancer from Bhopal must have arrived too.
I've been waiting for a year to see her. Let's go...

257
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:06,402
Jana, you just go.

258
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:08,028
- I'll come later...
- Hold on.

259
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:10,424
He's going to see that Lehenga girl.

260
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:11,581
One who said Vicky Please.

261
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:13,174
And he's making excuses to us.

262
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,799
Is sister-in-law coming?

263
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,799
Then we'll wait too.

264
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,632
- What?
- No one's coming.

265
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,332
- I'll get the offerings for you.
- What offerings.

266
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,375
Stop making excuses, Vicky.

267
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,911
Remember, females have been
the reason for the downfall of men.

268
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:23,720
Man, What?

269
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:25,940
It was a female who disrupted
Vishwamitra's penance.

270
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:28,620
So what, Am I Vishwamitra Now?
I ain't looking for a boon.

271
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,080
I am not standing on one leg and waiting
for some Meneka to disrupt my penance.

272
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:32,665
What do you think?

273
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,602
You explain to him.

274
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:34,748
He's talking nonsense.

275
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:37,124
Take him with you, Jana.
This is not about any girl.

276
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,283
Let's go, Bittu.

277
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:39,582
Go on.

278
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,371
Come soon.

279
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:41,332
You too.
- Come on.

280
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,333
I'm coming.
-Not you too.

281
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,872
Jana.

282
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:44,499
Go on.

283
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,458
<i>Why did you say yes?</i>

284
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:27,986
<i>Hi.</i>

285
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:29,583
Hi.

286
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,146
Hello.

287
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:32,355
I thought you didn't understand.

288
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:37,458
No, I understood,
but it takes me a little time to...

289
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:40,340
I mean I've very
little experience in...

290
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:41,708
I...m... part of mine...um...

291
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,512
Do you have a
problem in speaking?

292
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:45,682
No. Why?

293
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,452
Because if you do, it can be treated.

294
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,525
No, no, I can speak pretty well.

295
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:55,400
"Peacock."

296
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,769
1) Peacock is our National bird.

297
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,024
2) Peacock has a long and sharp beak.

298
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,222
3) The Peacock is around 1.5 feet tall.

299
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:00,107
4) The Peacock is a beautiful bird.

300
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:01,859
5) The Peacock's feather has many colors.

301
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,690
6) Some people believe when the female
peacock drinks the male peacock's tear...

302
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:04,586
...then a baby peacock is born.

303
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,065
7) When the Peacock dances
during the monsoons...

304
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,357
...people are enchanted
to see the sight.

305
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:08,486
Just like I was
enchanted when I saw you...

306
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,221
Sorry.

307
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,808
By the way,

308
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:16,897
you're looking...

309
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:18,384
really nice tonight.

310
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,936
Even you're looking...

311
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:20,927
Even you're looking...alright.

312
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,601
Ah...

313
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:22,983
Thank you!

314
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:27,188
You're late. That Aarthi is over.

315
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:28,940
Was it over?
-Yes.

316
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,517
Didn't know I was running late.

317
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:31,597
Maybe,

318
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:32,956
Maybe, it's this... gloom.

319
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:37,315
But I will inform you before
the Aarthi starts tomorrow.

320
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:38,570
I will call you...
can you...

321
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,149
Store your number on this.

322
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,649
I don't have a mobile phone.

323
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,967
No mobile?

324
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:44,339
Great...

325
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,738
So if I...or anyone else wants
to talk to you, or call you, then...

326
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:51,857
how to do that?

327
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:53,863
I don't know about others, but...

328
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,775
...if you want to talk, then...

329
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:58,858
Then?

330
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,648
Just think about me.

331
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,067
And I'll come over.

332
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:06,605
Fine, I will do that.

333
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:10,900
Letter.

334
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:13,190
To Vicky.

335
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:13,941
For me?

336
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:15,575
No.

337
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,715
Read it tomorrow morning,
after taking your bath.

338
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:20,001
After a bath?

339
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:22,483
Right, right...

340
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:23,952
Thank you!

341

343

Huh?

362
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,718
It was his good luck,
that he found a girl.

363
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:05,051
But he could've introduced
us to her as well. Why didn't he?

364
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:07,817
I think there is no girl in the first place. If not,
then there's something wrong with her.

365
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:08,943
What was that sound?

366
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:11,307
Who else is speaking, dude?
I've been speaking all this time?

367
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:13,178
Why? Got hallucinated
by Kishore Kumar or what?

368
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:14,518
Here again...

369
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:15,246
Man, What the...?

370
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:16,210
Whoa!

371
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,205
Rudra brother.

372
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:18,852
Greetings!

373
00:22:18,853 --> 00:22:19,851
Hello, brother Rudra...

374
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:20,963
Are you two okay?

375
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:21,894
Yeah, actually.

376
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,865
Then where are you two
going this night alone?

377
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:24,499
Why?

378
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,369
What happened?

379
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,708
The festival has begun.

380
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,646
She will be out
hunting for the next four days.

381
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:30,500
Who?

382
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,166
She.

383
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,083
Stree.

384
00:22:37,717 --> 00:22:40,500
Stop scaring him, brother Rudra.

385
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:42,400
I am not scaring him,
just warning you.

386
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:47,733
Look, our city is the
only place in this world...

387
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:52,733
...where no male steps out alone
during these days of the festival.

388
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:57,483
She abducts male,
leaving only his clothes behind.

389
00:22:57,858 --> 00:22:58,650
Only his clothes.

390
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:02,065
It's just that I like you two,
you two are like family...

391
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,357
...that's why I was telling you,
otherwise...

392
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:06,691
Brother Rudra, please tell us.

393
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:08,982
Form a triangle. Form a triangle.

394
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:09,525
Come here.

395
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:13,065
What is that?

396
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:13,982
Beer.

397
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:15,316
All right. I have mine.

398
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:20,650
Yes.

399
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,108
There are certain rules
to escape the wrath of Stree.

400
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:29,816
Rule no. 1.

401
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:33,108
Under no circumstances, and I mean none...

402
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:36,191
don't step out of the house alone.

403
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:43,024
And only those men are safe, who have
written outside their home, O Stree...

404
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:44,025
...Come tomorrow.

405
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:45,941
Rule no. 2.

406
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:52,440
If in case you've to step out, then don't
try to be a lion, be a wolf instead.

407
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:53,732
- Wolf?
- Why?

408
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:57,232
- Travel in packs, not alone.
- I see.

409
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,608
Rule no. 3.

410
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,900
If you ever come across the Stree...

411
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,941
...then she will first
call out your name.

412
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:08,691
Hello, Tom-Dick-Harry.

413
00:24:09,691 --> 00:24:10,816
What do you do?

414
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:13,899
Take off your slippers,
hold it in your hand, and...

415
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,983
- Run!
- No!

416
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:18,358
No running.

417
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:20,816
Keep walking.

418
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:22,066
Do what?

419
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:23,816
Keep walking.

420
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,983
Then she will call out to you again.

421
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,982
This time with more passion.

422
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:29,649
And what do you do?

423
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,815
Keep walking.

424
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:32,274
Then she will call out to you again,
for the third time.

425
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:34,107
With an enchanting, alluring voice.

426
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:35,275
Like an angel.

427
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:42,816
Embrace me now... because this
night may not come again.

428
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,025
That's the kind of
emotions you'll feel.

429
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,940
Your breathing will get faster,
your heart will start pounding.

430
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:50,275
Bedroom. Bedroom. Bedroom
will be the only thing on your mind.

431
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:51,940
And what do you do?

432
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:53,733
- Keep walking.
- No.

433
00:24:56,025 --> 00:25:01,150
No man could ever resist the Stree
when she calls out for the third time.

434
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:05,066
You will start losing
control over yourself.

435
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:07,066
And as soon as you turn around...

436
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,150
Gone!

437
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:16,107
But brother Rudra,
there must be some way.

438
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:16,858
Yes.

439
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:19,150
Rule no. 4.

440
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:23,733
And the most important thing to
remember if you want to escape the Stree.

441
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,733
At any point...

442
00:25:28,358 --> 00:25:29,108
Yes, Shama.

443
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:30,566
What?

444
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:32,525
You're coming into my life.

445
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:34,233
I am coming right over.

446
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,815
Brother Rudra.

447
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:39,816
You didn't finish the 4th rule.

448
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:46,269
Keep walking!

449
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,302
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

450
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:49,732
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

451
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:50,941
Don't make a noise.

452
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:53,354
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

453
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:56,069
....walking...

454
00:26:00,983 --> 00:26:02,874
- Wait a minute.
- No!

455
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:03,815
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

456
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:27,090
Bittu.

457
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,753
Jana, look.

458
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:32,251
What?

459
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:33,554
Someone's there.

460
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:49,882
Bittu...

461
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:51,052
Bittu...Bittu...

462
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:51,331
Stop!

463
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:51,608
Stop! Stop!

464
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:51,883
Stop! Stop! Stop!

465
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:55,843
Bittu!

466
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:57,625
Stop Bittu, for your mother's sake.

467
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:00,234
Why are you running?

468
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:01,446
Because you're running.

469
00:27:03,353 --> 00:27:04,257
Let's go in...

470
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:05,285
What was that?

471
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:06,408
How do I know?

472
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,238
Don't tell Vicky anything.
or he'll make fun of us.

473
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,865
Do you understand or not?

474
00:27:10,866 --> 00:27:12,116
Do you understand?

475
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:14,615
Where were you two?

476
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:16,419
What happened?

477
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:17,184
Huh?
-N...

478
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:17,843
Huh?
-N...Nothing...

479
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:18,865
What...

480
00:27:31,661 --> 00:27:33,128

Cut it now.

548
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:00,814
What happened?

549
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,540
Our vehicle is on its way.

550
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,751
Mmm... Okay,

Come on. Come in.

559
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:43,487
That's...

560
00:31:43,488 --> 00:31:44,315
My girlfriend, man!

561
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,376
I called her over for 'friendship'!

562
00:31:47,377 --> 00:31:48,448
BRUH!

563
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:51,304
Come in.

564
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:53,109
This kind of 'Friendship'
isn't allowed in here.

565
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:55,183
Wasn't it enough
that we called a dancer?

566
00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:56,943
Uncle will never approve of this.

567
00:31:56,944 --> 00:31:59,328
Just go out and start
the generator, okay.

568
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:01,121
Why didn't you inform me before that
there are going to be more people?

569
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:02,541
Don't worry, darling.

570
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,667
I've already reserved
a room for us upstairs.

571
00:32:04,935 --> 00:32:05,561
No one's going to disturb us.

572
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:06,988
Just me, and you.

573
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:07,737
you and me.

574
00:32:07,738 --> 00:32:08,937
All alone in a room!

575
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:09,298
Come...

576
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:09,671
Come...come...

577
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:12,088
Well then, if I had known, I would've
brought my friends along too.

578
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:14,328
And even your friends could've
snuggled up with them in a room.

579
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:14,834
Ohhh...

580
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:15,574
Naughty!

581

<i>Narender?</i>

583
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:21,414
<i>Narender?
-Hoot!</i>

584
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:23,207
Shake it... Shake it...

585
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,458
Come on.

586
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,033
Are you carrying protection?

587
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:46,415
Protection?

588
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,457
No protection, no friendship.

589
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,458
Oh...

590
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:50,549
"Protection."

591
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:17,375
Hello. Who is it?

592
00:33:25,082 --> 00:33:26,178
Jana?

593
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:28,403
Are you carrying protection?

594
00:33:28,404 --> 00:33:29,207
Huh?

595
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,458
A Protection, dude!

596
00:33:30,983 --> 00:33:32,245
No, I don't carry one.

597
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,207
Let's ask one of the guys.

598
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,056
Guys...

599
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:35,890
Guys...guys?

600
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:37,474
Does anyone have a protection?

601
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:38,649
<i>No bro, I have none...</i>

602
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,019
<i>Come on, quickly.</i>

603
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:00,750
Lights back!

604
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:01,691
Lights back!
Lights back!

605
00:34:01,692 --> 00:34:02,582
Lights back!
Lights back!
Lights back!

606
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,208
I got the stuff.

607
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,582
Why have you turned off the lights?

608
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:09,458
I like the lights on.
Because now I've protection.

609
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,625
This thing is older
than my grandfather.

610
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,583
Such a cheap quality.

611
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:16,825
Yeah!

612
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:17,867
Narender!

613
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:27,957
- What happened?
- There...

614
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:28,790
What?

615
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:29,832
Outside the window.

616
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:30,582
What?

617
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,707
Someone dragged him out of the window.

618
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,415
Narender.

619
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:37,500
I came into the room and
someone dragged him outside.

620
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:38,374
Check here!

621
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:39,083
You go check there!

622
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:40,416
Narender!

623
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,166
<i>Narender.</i>

624
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,458
Clothes.

625
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:47,916
Clothes?

626
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,000
Narender's clothes.

627
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,207
Narender's clothes.

628
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,166
Only his clothes.

629
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:55,541
Stree took him.

630
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,458
This is Stree's doing.

631
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:02,291
Whenever she takes any man with her,
she leaves his clothes behind.

632
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:12,124
But I don't understand one thing?
How did Stree come inside?

633
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:12,875
I don't know.

634
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,457
I wrote O Stree come
tomorrow on the wall...

635
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,708
...so that we can party peacefully.

636
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,041
Someone erased it.

637
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,749
I think that someone
intentionally peed on it.

638
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,250
Who peed on the wall?

639
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,541
Who was it?

640
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,791
Who was it?

641
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,500
Speak up now.

642
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:34,124
Vicky?

643
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:35,425
You?

644
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:36,592
No, it wasn't me.

645
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:37,917
Really?

646
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:39,457
Then who did this?

647
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,917
Right... you went out
in the middle of the dance.

648
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:44,539
You peed on the wall.

649
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,999
Yes, I did.

650
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,209
It didn't say no peeing here.

651
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:47,874
It didn't say no peeing here. Get lost.

652
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,856
Why did you have to pee
there of all the places?

653
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,785
My pee, my will,
I can pee anywhere I want.

654
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:56,220
We just lost a friend
because of your frickin pee!

655
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,459
He's a junkie. He must be
high and wanderin' around.

656
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,432
We won't hear anything against our friend.
You made him disappear in the first place!

657
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:02,998
I didn't do anything.

658
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:05,832
Damn whoever made it so,
But you peed on the wall.

659
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:12,917
Stop!

660
00:36:12,918 --> 00:36:14,178
Stop! Stop...

661
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:15,159
Cut it, guys!

662
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,635
What's the point of beating Jana up?

663
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:19,382
Your friend's missing,
go look for him.

664
00:36:19,383 --> 00:36:20,962
Stop ranting Stree.

665
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,498
It's pretty late.

666
00:36:35,148 --> 00:36:37,065
Daddy must be waiting for me.

667
00:36:37,568 --> 00:36:39,401
Even I didn't tell my
mom that I'm coming here.

668
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,671
Fine,

669
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:43,708
let's come back tomorrow.

670
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:56,189
<b><font color="#791028">REAL WAY TO GET RID OF STREE</font></b>

671
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,427
<b><font color="#791028">REAL WAY TO GET RID OF STREE
JUST 150/-</font></b>

672
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:00,088
Chit...

673
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:00,346
Chit...Chit...

674
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:01,065
Chit...Chit...Chit!

675
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,398
Here's the letter.

676
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:13,958
Brother,

677
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:15,754
Some madam's here to see you.

678
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:16,980
Who is it? Tell her
to come back later.

679
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:17,939
It's her.

680
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,806
Take a look for yourself.

681
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:25,686
What the hell!

682
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:27,393
Did you tell her
that I am at home?

683
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:29,000
I did, brother?

684
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:33,831
Come here.

685
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:35,644
What are you doing here?

686
00:37:36,227 --> 00:37:37,375
I want my money.

687
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:38,144
Whose money?

688
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,041
Money for the 'friendship'.

689
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:42,683
Your friend didn't pay
me for the 'friendship'.

690
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:43,599
So?

691
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,599
So you're going to pay me.

692
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,641
Why will I pay?

693
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,099
I see... you pee on the
wall and I won't get my money.

694
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,975
Has the government
put a ban on my pee?

695
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,349
I can pee anywhere I want.

696
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,183
Pay up quietly.

697
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,516
I heard that the
friendship never happen.

698
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:01,016
We were halfway through...

699
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:04,182
Please sister,
I don't have that kind of money.

700
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:05,140
I don't have money...

701
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:07,140
Look here, stop making excuses...

702
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:09,849
...otherwise, I will come down
here with my friends and make a scene.

703
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,975
Calm down.

704
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,640
And, your father won't like it.

705
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:14,807
I have heard a lot about him.

706
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:16,558
How much do I pay, sister?

707
00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:19,516
She's collecting donation.

708
00:38:21,975 --> 00:38:23,391
I think 3000 will be fine.

709
00:38:25,058 --> 00:38:26,057
Take some lessons from him.

710
00:38:26,058 --> 00:38:26,766
Jai Mata Di.

711
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,266
So mister, are you going to stand
around like this or put something on.

712
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:44,141
Take care of your son.

713
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,016
He's bustling with energy.

714
00:38:51,058 --> 00:38:56,100
Son, I'm going to share a
really important experience of life.

715
00:38:56,933 --> 00:39:01,391
Youth... is a weird phase.

716
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,307
The body bustles with vitality.

717
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:08,183
A tank full of energy.

718
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:14,640
And this energy... craves to come out.

719
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:18,724
But this body... is puzzled
about what to do or not to do.

720
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:21,266
And this restlessness...

721
00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:26,808
...provokes it to have
friendship with the opposite sex.

722
00:39:27,058 --> 00:39:29,266
Dad, I hope you know
what friendship means here.

723
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:31,016
Friendship.

724
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:35,725
Son, I was born in
this town before you.

725
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:38,225
I've had a lot of friendship
back in my days.

726
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:40,933
- You had friendships.
- I did.

727
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:46,266
Yes, but once I met your mother...

728
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,475
...she completely changed
my point of view.

729
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:51,974
The union of a male and a female...

730
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,807
- Listen to me.
- Go on.

731
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:57,640
The union of a male
and a female is pure.

732
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:59,099
It's auspicious.

733
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,932
Like the union of Heaven and Earth.

734
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,015
The confluence of Shiv and Shakti.

735
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:07,683
But why are you telling me all this?

736
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:11,557
I telling you so that
you don't pay for friendship.

737
00:40:11,558 --> 00:40:13,225
When did I pay for friendship?

738
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:18,682
- And what about her...
- Dad, she wasn't here for me.

739
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:19,640
I didn't pay for friendship.

740
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:21,933
Listen to me first.

741
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:27,558
My advice to you is that you must
wait for a companion...

742
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:32,682
...with whom you can enjoy this
process for the rest of your life.

743
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:37,308
And learn to control this energy
bustling in your body till then.

744
00:40:38,058 --> 00:40:42,266
And if you can't, then...

745
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:44,183
Then what?

746
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,225
Then be self-reliant.

747
00:40:47,683 --> 00:40:48,599
Cater to your needs.

748
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,808
Meaning...

749
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:52,850
Meaning... yourself.

750
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:54,349
How, daddy?

751
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,225
I mean...

752
00:40:56,808 --> 00:40:57,390
I mean...

753
00:40:57,391 --> 00:40:58,141
Loss of words?

754
00:40:58,433 --> 00:40:59,349
Come on. Go out.

755
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,099
Listen...

756
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,641
Come on. Go out.

757
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:08,225
Energy.

758
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:13,850
Where is my energy?

759
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,266
My dear Vicky.

760
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,557
If she's started with 'my dear'
then she will end it with 'with love'.

761
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:27,349
Okay.

762
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,683
My dear Vicky, how are you?

763
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:30,391
What a stupid question?

764
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,724
She just met yesterday and
today she wants to know how you are.

765
00:41:32,725 --> 00:41:33,308
Keep reading.

766
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:38,850
Honestly speaking I was
really happy to meet you.

767
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:47,016
After talking to you I felt like that
we've known each other for a long time.

768
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,058
Since I retreated...

769
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,058
Returned.

770
00:41:53,058 --> 00:41:54,225
Sorry, since I returned
after meeting you...

771
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:56,350
...I want to meet you again.

772
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:59,766
And this time when we meet,
my dear Vicky...

773
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,515
...can you bring these things for me?

774
00:42:03,516 --> 00:42:04,391
PTO.

775
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,600
A quarter brandy.

776
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:09,183
Half a kilo of mutton.

777
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:11,516
A kilo of charred glass.

778
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,099
Thornapple flower.

779
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,140
Hair of a cat.

780
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:16,433
- And...
- And?

781
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,141
The tail of a lizard!

782
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:21,266
Thanking you, with love.

783
00:42:21,555 --> 00:42:22,763
With love. See...

784
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:24,933
What is this stupid stuff?

785
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:27,725
Who asks to get stuff like these?

786
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,140
Plus she drinks.

787
00:42:29,141 --> 00:42:30,349
So what if she drinks?

788
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,515
Sister-in-law is cool.

789
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:32,641
That's not the point.

790
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:35,474
She wants you to get
the tail of a lizard.

791
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:38,765
And you're a tailor,
not the ancestor of lizards.

792
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:41,807
You're prepared to go on this impossible
mission because she told you.

793
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:44,474
Jana has been telling to you to
stitch a shirt for him. But did you?

794
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,683
I have been telling you to
let's go to Goa. But did you?

795
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,884
Trying to be a hero for the girl.

796
00:42:50,891 --> 00:42:52,058
You say something.

797
00:42:52,891 --> 00:42:53,893
What now?

798
00:42:54,183 --> 00:42:56,225
- She's asked so politely...
- So?

799
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:57,600
Then I must get it.

800
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,390
What?

801
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:00,638
It's very simple.

802
00:43:01,183 --> 00:43:03,307
Guys always do what
girls tell them to.

803
00:43:03,308 --> 00:43:03,808
That's it.

804
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:37,825
Shahjahan built the
Taj Mahal for his love.

805
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,200
And our brother
chasing cats and lizards.

806
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:44,866
Whoever imagined love would
fall to such levels in 500 years.

807
00:43:46,908 --> 00:43:49,200
Tell me something, don't
you think something is wrong?

808
00:43:50,575 --> 00:43:52,699
Right and wrong is just
a point of view, Bittu.

809
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,325
Don't try to be wise.

810
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:59,075
I am telling you,
I have a bad feeling about this.

811
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:01,325
Something is wrong about this girl?

812
00:44:02,075 --> 00:44:03,991
Got it. Got it. Got it.

813
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,533
Got it.

814
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,075
Come on, now hurry up.

815
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:23,783
That Stree already
took one male last night.

816
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,575
We must return home before
she comes out to hunt.

817
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:28,407
I am going as fast as I can.

818
00:44:28,408 --> 00:44:29,615
Don't be scared.
I am with you.

819
00:44:29,616 --> 00:44:32,033
You can't handle one woman, and
now you're scared of another.

820
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,532
Hello.

821
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,075
Jana, meet me right now.

822
00:45:16,241 --> 00:45:16,825
Vicky!

823
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:19,700
Vicky!

824
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:20,783
Hi.

825
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:22,325
Hello.

826
00:45:22,866 --> 00:45:26,450
Sorry, I was too engrossed
in listening to music.

827
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:27,991
What do you listen to?

828
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:29,366
English.

829
00:45:29,991 --> 00:45:30,783
Wow!

830
00:45:31,533 --> 00:45:33,033
- Akon.
- Who?

831
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:34,283
Akon.

832
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:38,533
Wanna be my Chammak Challo.

833
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:41,616
The guy's like Kumar
Sanu of his country.

834
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:42,574
I see.

835
00:45:42,575 --> 00:45:43,991
- You don't know?
- No.

836
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,325
I see.

837
00:45:46,783 --> 00:45:48,824
You missed the veneration again.

838
00:45:48,825 --> 00:45:50,908
I guess I don't get
along with God too well.

839
00:45:51,575 --> 00:45:52,783
Right. Right.

840
00:45:54,658 --> 00:45:55,658
I...

841
00:45:56,075 --> 00:45:57,825
I brought this offering for you.

842
00:45:58,741 --> 00:45:59,866
I'm fasting today.

843
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,325
Even offerings are not allowed.

844
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:04,783
I see.

845
00:46:05,658 --> 00:46:06,199
Doesn't matter.

846
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,450
Whether you eat it or me,
it's the same.

847
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:10,700
By the way, we can go inside.

848
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:12,408
I know the priest.

849
00:46:12,825 --> 00:46:14,950
I can arrange for a
special veneration for you.

850
00:46:15,658 --> 00:46:17,658
And even make a donation
of 11 rupees in your name.

851
00:46:18,825 --> 00:46:20,491
- Your name...
- Did you get the items on the list?

852
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:22,450
Yes.

853
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:24,950
I got everything you asked for.

854
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:28,450
You didn't tell me which brand
of brandy, so I got every brand.

855
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,490
But it's better this way.
You can try every brand, for variety.

856
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:34,907
And, I couldn't find a
cat with completely white hair.

857
00:46:34,908 --> 00:46:36,490
She had mixed colors.

858
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:38,366
But what will you
do with all these things?

859
00:46:41,075 --> 00:46:42,366
Are you going to ask
everything right now?

860
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,325
Let's go someplace else.

861
00:46:49,129 --> 00:46:51,450
- At this hour?
- Yes.

862
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:53,783
Okay.

863
00:46:54,455 --> 00:46:55,830
But where?

864
00:46:57,116 --> 00:46:59,241
Let's go. I know a spot.

865
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,575
Fair...you're so fair.

866
00:47:14,844 --> 00:47:17,491
Like the moonlight that's
falling on earth.

867
00:47:17,924 --> 00:47:20,075
Bad... very bad.

868
00:47:20,351 --> 00:47:22,740
The world's intentions are very bad.

869
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:25,449
I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you...

870
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,199
...this thought keeps
scaring me all day.

871
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,907
I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you...

872
00:47:30,908 --> 00:47:34,575
...this thought keeps
scaring me all day.

873
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:50,824
This silky dress...that
you've worn tonight.

874
00:47:50,825 --> 00:47:55,824
When you smile...all
my sorrows get alleviated.

875
00:47:55,825 --> 00:47:58,615
I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you...

876
00:47:58,616 --> 00:48:01,324
...this thought keeps
scaring me all day.

877
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:04,074
I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you...

878
00:48:04,075 --> 00:48:06,825
...this thought keeps
scaring me all day.

879
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,766
- Vicky's gone tonight.
- Where?

880
00:48:16,516 --> 00:48:18,475
Focus on my meaning.

881
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:20,891
I pondered over this a lot.

882
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:24,308
And the verdict I've
reached is pretty dangerous.

883
00:48:24,808 --> 00:48:25,933
What is your verdict?

884
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:30,808
You were a genius at school,
then how are you so slow in real life?

885
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,100
I go to the depth of every
matter and weigh it properly.

886
00:48:34,683 --> 00:48:36,141
My dear Pacific Ocean.

887
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:39,225
Why aren't your depths
showing you what I can see?

888
00:48:41,808 --> 00:48:42,725
This girl...

889
00:48:44,016 --> 00:48:46,266
...comes once in
a year like an endangered species.

890
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:48,433
And always during the festival.

891
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,015
And do you know who else
shows up during the festival?

892
00:48:51,016 --> 00:48:51,641
Who?

893
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,766
Stree!

894
00:48:57,266 --> 00:49:00,600
Mister, open your mind

895
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:04,141
Has anyone else seen
her except for Vicky?

896
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:05,516
No.

897
00:49:07,016 --> 00:49:09,141
And what does she ask him
to get in her first love letter?

898
00:49:10,808 --> 00:49:13,850
- Cat hair, lizard leg...
- Tail.

899
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:15,474
It's one and the same.

900
00:49:15,475 --> 00:49:16,683
Who asks to get stuff like this?

901
00:49:19,058 --> 00:49:19,849
He's not picking up.

902
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:22,390
- Mister, turn off your phone.
- You shut your mouth.

903
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:23,808
And fill fuel worth 50 rupees.

904
00:49:24,058 --> 00:49:24,725
50 again.

905
00:49:25,141 --> 00:49:26,516
Why don't you ever put more?

906
00:49:26,766 --> 00:49:28,308
Why don't you try
telling my father that?

907
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:31,099
You try calling him.

908
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:35,216
He's gone to meet her,
I am telling you.

909
00:49:35,957 --> 00:49:37,957
Our friend is in trouble, understand.

910
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,223
Stree has laid a trap.

911
00:49:40,224 --> 00:49:43,599
And our love hungry friend,
is heading straight for it.

912
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:45,524
He is actually cutting the calls.

913
00:49:46,507 --> 00:49:48,382
Why do people become blind in love?

914
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,760
<i>How would I know?</i>

915
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:52,265
Bittu, blind faith is
really catastrophic.

916
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:53,973
You can be anyone you want,
but not a devotee.

917
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:56,972
Where do you think the new couple would
have gone to spend some time alone?

918
00:49:56,973 --> 00:49:57,766
The lake.

919
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:00,331
<font color="#ff0000"><b>S</b></font>

920

00:50:00,538 --> 00:50:00,737

00:50:00,738 --> 00:50:00,949

929
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:06,549
<font color="#ff0000"><b>SECOND NIGHT</b></font>

930
00:50:10,922 --> 00:50:13,102
How do you know about this place?

931
00:50:16,187 --> 00:50:18,559
And why did we come here?

932
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,000
Because it's dark out here.

933
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:22,375
And no one comes here.

934
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:27,891
Dark...

935
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:33,183
He isn't here either.

936
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:34,932
Where could he be?

937
00:50:34,933 --> 00:50:37,350
I am telling you,
we'll only find his clothes today.

938
00:50:40,465 --> 00:50:42,253
Your clothes are very nice.

939
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,183
Where did you buy them?

940
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:47,141
I designed them myself.

941
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:49,683
People call me the Manish
Malhotra of Chanderi.

942
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:53,890
Isn't it too tight?

943
00:50:53,891 --> 00:50:55,307
It's just my body...

944
00:50:55,308 --> 00:50:56,516
How do you open it?

945
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:01,474
- Listen.
- Yeah...

946
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,391
- Shall we leave?
- Why?

947
00:51:03,808 --> 00:51:06,016
- Are you scared too?
- No.

948
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:07,850
I am not scared of
any ghosts or spirits.

949
00:51:08,141 --> 00:51:10,933
But how long are we going
to waste our time on a selfish guy?

950
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:12,725
But he's our friend.

951
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:17,765
Bittu.

952
00:51:17,766 --> 00:51:18,850
Wait.

953
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:21,683
So what else do you
stitch at your shop?

954
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:24,600
Just skirts and long dresses,
or anything else?

955
00:51:25,141 --> 00:51:26,475
Actually, we make everything.

956
00:51:26,725 --> 00:51:27,725
Completely ladies fashion.

957
00:51:28,058 --> 00:51:31,309
Skirts, tops, traditional dresses,
tunics. Midis, minis.

958
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,578
Short dresses, long dresses,
kaftans, fringe, party dresses.

959
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:36,396
Blouses: Deep Neck, Medium Neck,
Modern blouses...

960
00:51:36,397 --> 00:51:40,723
Katori, Chammak, Bhawna, Suits
Skirts, Tops, Everedy, Frocks, Gowns...

961
00:51:40,724 --> 00:51:43,308
Mirror work,
stonework, designer panty, nightfall.

962
00:51:44,225 --> 00:51:45,516
Nighty fall.

963
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:46,725
That's it.

964
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,766
When will you give me my dress?

965
00:51:51,391 --> 00:51:54,433
It completely slipped off my mind.

966
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,933
- I troubled you a lot, didn't I?
- Of course not.

967
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,600
It was no trouble at all.

968
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:05,725
And anything for you.

969
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:12,766
I should have taken
your measurements that day.

970
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:15,850
I thought you did.

971
00:52:16,946 --> 00:52:21,916
Normally I am good at this,
but in your case, I goofed up.

972
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:29,791
So take it now.

973
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:33,125
But I don't have my measuring tape.

974
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,166
Can't you take my
measurement without it?

975
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,083
I can, but...

976
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:39,833
Should I?

977
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,041
Take it.

978
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:42,500
Should I?

979
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,083
Take it.

980
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,625
Okay, I will.

981
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,250
Hello.

982
00:54:29,522 --> 00:54:30,357
Where are you?

983
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:31,233
Hello!

984
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:40,670
Bittu.

985
00:54:40,671 --> 00:54:41,297
Yes.

986
00:54:41,298 --> 00:54:43,256
I am missing my mom.

987
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,416
Shall we go back?

988
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:48,916
You're right.

989
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:54,541
- Parents are more important than friends.
- You're right.

990
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,375
Let's go back.

991
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,083
What happened?

992
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:06,750
Let me check.

993
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,624
What?

994
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:17,125
I think we're out of petrol.

995
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:19,666
I told you, didn't I?

996
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:22,500
Tell me one thing...is
your father a menial labor?

997
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:24,790
You own a big shop in the city.

998
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:27,249
From Manish Malhotra to Manish Behl.

999
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:27,875
What is this?

1000
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:31,333
Whether you fill 50 rupees
petrol at a time or fill your tank.

1001
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:32,790
It's still the same.

1002
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:34,500
The petrol pump is close-by. Push.

1003
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,582
It's your bike, isn't it?

1004
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,166
You push.

1005
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:38,291
Why should I?

1006
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:39,875
I've been pushing
it since we were kids.

1007
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:41,249
What's wrong with you?

1008
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,541
That Stree is wandering
around the city.

1009
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:45,374
And we're stuck in
the middle of nowhere.

1010
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,666
And you want to know what's wrong?

1011
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,208
Mom clearly said that
I should come back soon.

1012
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:52,375
If I don't hurry up,
she will lock the doors and sleep.

1013
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,250
What now?

1014
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Push!

1015
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,291
Mummy!

1016
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:08,041
Hello.

1017
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:13,708
Where are you?

1018
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,708
Madam.

1019
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:42,507
Where are you going?

1020
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:44,999
I knew it, selfish rascal.

1021
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,249
What's wrong with you today?

1022
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:48,124
I am your friend, not your slave.

1023
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,666
First I go over to your house so that you
can tuck yourself neatly under the blanket.

1024
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:53,457
- And then I go home all alone.
- But we do that all the time.

1025
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:54,124
Not today.

1026
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:54,707
Fine, let it be.

1027
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:55,790
I've been listening to
your nonsense for a long time.

1028
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:56,249
Go on.

1029
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,249
Fine, you don't have to.

1030
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,000
Get going.

1031
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,166
Weird guy.

1032
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,583
- I hope Stree abducts you.
- Same to you.

1033
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,250
Son!

1034
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,208
No...no...

1035
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:06,039
<i>If you ever come across the Stree,
this is what you do.</i>

1036
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,250
<i>Jana...</i>

1037
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:18,458
No.

1038
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:20,791
Don't turn around.

1039
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,875
Keep walking.

1040
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,916
Jana

1041
00:59:42,391 --> 00:59:45,256
<i>Jana...</i>

1042
00:59:45,257 --> 00:59:49,494
<i>And the most important thing to
remember if you want to escape the Stree.</i>

1043
00:59:49,495 --> 00:59:51,514
<i>At any point...</i>

1044
01:00:55,946 --> 01:00:58,196
Jana!

1045
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:02,547
Jana. My Jana.

1046
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:05,333
Curse that Stree.

1047
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:09,083
My Jana never even touched any female.

1048
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,916
And now she must be
sitting on top on him.

1049
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:17,250
I told him a thousand times not to hang
around with these worthless friends.

1050
01:01:17,916 --> 01:01:20,458
Jana could've had a good job.

1051
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:24,416
But these rascal friends spoiled him.

1052
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:27,541
Lord, give him strength.

1053
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:30,291
Give my son strength.

1054
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:32,166
I know you went to meet her.

1055
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:37,083
Stop getting jealous of my love life.
Think about Jana.

1056
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:39,666
Did anything weird happen?

1057
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:41,333
Weird how?

1058
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,583
Anything at all,
when you were with her?

1059
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:46,875
What did you two do?

1060
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:48,750
Why?

1061
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:50,083
Just tell me.

1062
01:01:52,884 --> 01:01:54,319
We went to the temple.

1063
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:56,250
Then to the river banks.

1064
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,307
We were just
sitting and chatting,

1065
01:01:58,308 --> 01:01:59,541
and then she disappeared.

1066
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,374
And didn't return.

1067
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:02,208
I knew it!

1068
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:05,456
I knew it, Vicky.

1069
01:02:05,457 --> 01:02:06,098
What?

1070
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:08,167
That your
girlfriend is a ghost.

1071
01:02:08,168 --> 01:02:09,332
What do you mean ghost?

1072
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:11,167
Jana and I were coming to save you.

1073
01:02:11,168 --> 01:02:13,026
And she took Jana instead.

1074
01:02:13,027 --> 01:02:14,220
What nonsense.

1075
01:02:14,221 --> 01:02:15,674
Mister Romeo!

1076
01:02:15,675 --> 01:02:17,574
Get outta your dream world.

1077
01:02:17,575 --> 01:02:22,311
Why does your girlfriend show up only
during the festival, and then disappear?

1078
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,683
She asks you to get ingredients
for black magic in her love letter.

1079
01:02:26,684 --> 01:02:28,245
Have you ever seen her feet?

1080
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:29,506
Are they straight or crooked?

1081
01:02:29,507 --> 01:02:31,750
Did you ask her name?
Do you know her phone number?

1082
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:37,211
Has anyone seen her except for you?
Because I haven't.

1083
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:40,250
But...

1084
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:46,416
Oh no!

1085
01:02:51,572 --> 01:02:53,989
<i>I just don't understand one thing.</i>

1086
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,500
<i>How does she enter the temple?</i>

1087
01:02:57,014 --> 01:02:59,014
Are these ghosts atheists, nowadays?

1088
01:02:59,385 --> 01:03:01,495
Aren't they scared to god?

1089
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,250
She never enters the temple,
always stays out.

1090
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08,408
She won't even take the offerings...

1091
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,487
<i>Vicky,</i>

1092
01:03:16,786 --> 01:03:19,318
<i>For the first time
I am feeling sad for you.</i>

1093
01:03:20,106 --> 01:03:23,440
Because of all the things in the
world... you fell in love with a demon.

1094
01:03:27,354 --> 01:03:29,000
<i>Go and ask her,</i>

1095
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:31,354
<i>Your Stree, where she took Jana.</i>

1096
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,208
I miss him.

1097
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:38,416
And one more thing.

1098
01:03:40,385 --> 01:03:42,718
Don't tell her that
Bittu told you all this.

1099
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,458
Otherwise, she might abduct me too.

1100
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:20,150
<i>Warning!</i>

1101
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:21,143
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

1102
01:04:21,144 --> 01:04:22,291
<i>Warning! Warning! Warning!</i>

1103
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:26,666
<i>An important piece of warning
for all the males in the city.</i>

1104
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,135
<i>Stree is out hunting</i>

1105
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:31,833
<i>and the males are in threat.</i>

1106
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:35,665
The method to save yourself
from Stree is written in this paper.

1107
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:37,291
Remember it.

1108
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:38,597
Show me one...

1109
01:04:38,598 --> 01:04:39,790
No, it's not for you.

1110
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:40,540
You're safe.

1111
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:44,790
<i>If you ever run into Stree...</i>

1112
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:47,457
...then there's just
one way to escape

1113
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:49,999
Under no circumstance will you...

1114
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,707
Hello!

1115
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:51,291
Hello!

1116
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,832
How do you know so
much about the Stree?

1117
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,250
I know everything.

1118
01:04:56,541 --> 01:05:00,624
Triple BA, Double MA,
literarian, musician, teacher.

1119
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,083
I have all these degrees.

1120
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,790
I spent my childhood
amongst crocodiles.

1121
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:06,040
Rudra Book Depot.

1122
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:08,707
But why do we write
"O Stree Come tomorrow"?

1123
01:05:08,708 --> 01:05:10,999
We could write something else.
Like, "Stree, never come back again."

1124
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,915
As long as it's working,
let it continue.

1125
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:16,040
And by the way,
if we ever have an unwanted guest...

1126
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,915
...we don't directly say
"Get lost" back to him.

1127
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:21,540
This is what we'd politely
say, "Come back tomorrow".

1128
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:25,333
I've heard that the Stree first
s**** her prey before killing him.

1129
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:28,165
That's the system with
female scorpions too.

1130
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:31,040
She swallows the male
scorpion which she mates with.

1131
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:34,457
Listen wise guy, please don't
share your knowledge with us.

1132
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:35,915
Leave all that aside.

1133
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:38,374
Tell us what's the solution to it.

1134
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:40,665
My wife says that I should
wear a saree when I step out.

1135
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:42,958
Please don't spread such rumors.

1136
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:45,583
Or soon we'll see everyone
in our city draped in a saree.

1137
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:47,790
My beloved's arrived type.

1138
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:48,457
No, no.

1139
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:50,582
How does she know everyone's name?

1140
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:52,665
Because all our databases
are linked to her.

1141
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:53,457
I see.

1142
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:54,999
Shut up, idiot.

1143
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,915
You see, two youngsters
have already been abducted.

1144
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,290
Be alert.

1145
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:02,333
Poor guy was abducted from the town
square. He was such a healthy boy

1146
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:04,458
Wasn't he your friend too, Vicky?

1147
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,250
But not anymore. Not anymore.

1148
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:13,041
- Keep the glass down.
- What?

1149
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,415
Trying to be over smart. Huh!

1150
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:17,916
Get lost.

1151
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,166
He's still alive.
My friend isn't dead.

1152
01:06:53,206 --> 01:06:53,998
Brother.

1153
01:07:00,903 --> 01:07:02,570
Master-ji!

1154
01:07:26,557 --> 01:07:27,667
Brother Vicky,

1155
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:28,807
Brother Vicky, You are amazing!

1156
01:07:29,301 --> 01:07:31,309
You stitched this dress in 31 minutes.

1157
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:32,102
Master-ji!

1158
01:07:57,797 --> 01:07:59,257
What happened?

1159
01:07:59,258 --> 01:08:01,216
No... it's nothing.

1160
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,300
No, I haven't done anything.
I didn't do anything.

1161
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,386
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1162
01:08:27,387 --> 01:08:29,064
Please... please leave me alone!

1163
01:08:29,065 --> 01:08:29,691
<i>What happened?</i>

1164
01:08:29,692 --> 01:08:31,278
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1165
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,863
<i>Vicky, what's wrong?</i>

1166
01:08:35,258 --> 01:08:36,432
What happened?

1167
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:42,841
It's nothing.

1168
01:08:43,425 --> 01:08:45,549
You look like you saw a ghost.

1169
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:46,257
Ghost.

1170
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:47,715
No... no ghost.

1171
01:08:47,716 --> 01:08:48,549
It's nothing.

1172
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:51,216
- You okay right, Vicky?
- Yes, I am okay.

1173
01:08:51,508 --> 01:08:52,175
I am all right.

1174
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:57,425
- Is it ready?
- Yes, it is.

1175
01:08:59,591 --> 01:09:00,341
Thank you.

1176
01:09:00,716 --> 01:09:01,300
It's all right.

1177
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:06,216
Shall we go out somewhere?

1178
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:07,758
Out?

1179
01:09:08,258 --> 01:09:10,216
I'll take you to another
one of my favorite spots.

1180
01:09:10,925 --> 01:09:11,757
No!

1181
01:09:11,758 --> 01:09:13,299
This is my favorite place.

1182
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,758
- Let's sit here.
- Okay.

1183
01:09:28,175 --> 01:09:29,925
There's magic in your fingers.

1184
01:09:32,633 --> 01:09:34,508
Even my feet are sorta magical.

1185
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:37,466
I can turn it around like this.

1186
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,758
Can you turn your feet around too?

1187
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:44,341
- Is there a problem?
- No. What problem?

1188
01:09:44,591 --> 01:09:45,550
There is no problem.

1189
01:09:47,925 --> 01:09:52,550
Can I ask you a question
for my personal knowledge?

1190
01:09:53,228 --> 01:09:55,801
Do you believe in ghosts or demons?

1191
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,424
I've heard that a woman
wanders in this city at night.

1192
01:10:01,425 --> 01:10:02,591
Called Stree.

1193
01:10:03,383 --> 01:10:04,674
She is a witch.

1194
01:10:04,675 --> 01:10:06,675
She abducts males.

1195
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:08,758
Strips them.

1196
01:10:10,628 --> 01:10:13,128
I know she must have a good reason.

1197
01:10:13,578 --> 01:10:15,869
No one is born as a witch. Right.

1198
01:10:16,466 --> 01:10:17,841
I understand.

1199
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:22,758
My friend Jana,
he's disappeared as well.

1200
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,216
He's a very nice guy.

1201
01:10:25,258 --> 01:10:27,050
People say that Stree took him.

1202
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,550
Have you seen Jana?

1203
01:10:37,883 --> 01:10:39,133
Can I ask you a question?

1204
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:44,008
Its personal,
but don't take it personally.

1205
01:10:45,425 --> 01:10:47,633
Are you...

1206
01:10:48,383 --> 01:10:49,340
Are you...

1207
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:51,132
I mean not intentionally.

1208
01:10:51,133 --> 01:10:53,716
Are you... Stree.

1209
01:10:55,008 --> 01:10:56,382
I just asked.

1210
01:10:56,383 --> 01:10:57,674
I don't have a problem.

1211
01:10:57,675 --> 01:10:58,883
I was just confirming.

1212
01:10:59,341 --> 01:11:01,007
If you're a ghost...

1213
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:02,966
I mean you are what you are.

1214
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:05,549
If it's anything like that,
please tell me now.

1215
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:09,466
I'll just be prepared mentally.
That's all.

1216
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:16,300
Uncle.

1217
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:18,675
Do you see that girl standing there?

1218
01:11:21,633 --> 01:11:22,590
What girl?

1219
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:23,925
That one...

1220
01:11:24,425 --> 01:11:25,175
That...

1221
01:11:38,633 --> 01:11:40,383
You should listen
to your friends as well.

1222
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:46,633
But how can a beautiful
woman like her be Stree?

1223
01:11:47,425 --> 01:11:48,425
Was she beautiful?

1224
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:51,300
Sorry.

1225
01:11:53,633 --> 01:11:54,966
Think about Jana.

1226
01:11:55,258 --> 01:11:56,425
What condition will he be in?

1227
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,216
Lying somewhere naked in this cold.

1228
01:12:02,091 --> 01:12:02,966
What now?

1229
01:12:06,258 --> 01:12:09,675
We'll have to find someone who's
an expert in such absurd folklores.

1230
01:12:20,047 --> 01:12:21,257
You came to the right place.

1231
01:12:21,258 --> 01:12:22,383
I know everything.

1232
01:12:23,008 --> 01:12:24,895
Doesn't get me high.

1233
01:12:24,896 --> 01:12:26,054
Then why do you drink?

1234
01:12:26,591 --> 01:12:28,340
In Shama's memory, that's why.

1235
01:12:28,341 --> 01:12:30,049
Leave Shama aside.

1236
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,965
And tell us what you know about Stree.

1237
01:12:31,966 --> 01:12:34,091
I am doing research on Madam Stree.

1238
01:12:34,716 --> 01:12:37,043
And like they say, the fruits
of hard work is always sweet.

1239
01:12:37,465 --> 01:12:38,564
And I got one too.

1240
01:12:38,565 --> 01:12:39,308
Sweet fruit.

1241
01:12:39,309 --> 01:12:40,768
No. A book.

1242
01:12:41,341 --> 01:12:42,049
A book?

1243
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:43,591
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1244
01:12:46,716 --> 01:12:47,466
Here you go.

1245
01:12:53,091 --> 01:12:53,841
Ohh...

1246
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:55,258
KS.

1247
01:12:56,425 --> 01:12:57,632
Ka Su...

1248
01:12:57,633 --> 01:12:58,924
- Are you researching on this?
- Not that.

1249
01:12:58,925 --> 01:13:00,132
This one. This is it.

1250
01:13:00,133 --> 01:13:01,800
This is Chanderi Puran.

1251
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,840
Chanderi has its own manuscript.

1252
01:13:03,841 --> 01:13:07,341
Our city is older than you think.

1253
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,341
The spot where you're sitting.

1254
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,631
If we dig beneath it,
you'll find the Harappa Civilization.

1255
01:13:12,008 --> 01:13:13,755
Right here. Harappa!

1256
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,507
Exactly under this spot.

1257
01:13:15,508 --> 01:13:19,925
So look, Chanderi Puran
written by Shankar Shashtri.

1258
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,175
Here we go.

1259
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,758
Many years ago.

1260
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:31,841
Many years ago there used to be
a beautiful and attractive courtesan.

1261
01:13:32,258 --> 01:13:34,800
Every male in the city
would dream about her.

1262
01:13:35,466 --> 01:13:40,216
Finally, she found a man
who loved soul and not her body.

1263
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:41,715
True love.

1264
01:13:41,716 --> 01:13:43,507
And talk about your generation.

1265
01:13:43,508 --> 01:13:45,049
Love at first sight.

1266
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,590
Then your place or mine.

1267
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:48,215
What direction is this
generation heading in?

1268
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:49,133
Brother Rudra.

1269
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:50,382
Don't try to be a dad.

1270
01:13:50,383 --> 01:13:52,133
- Please read ahead.
- Yes.

1271
01:13:52,758 --> 01:13:54,758
They both decided to get married.

1272
01:13:55,383 --> 01:13:57,632
But the other males
couldn't tolerate their joy.

1273
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:03,425
And before their wedding night, some
jealous people murdered both of them.

1274
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:06,758
Since then she has been
wandering in this city.

1275
01:14:07,216 --> 01:14:11,674
Looking for her love,
and complete her wedding night.

1276
01:14:11,675 --> 01:14:15,716
And this can only happen when
she will find her lost love again.

1277
01:14:16,175 --> 01:14:18,049
Such insolent people.

1278
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,507
They can't tolerate
someone's happiness.

1279
01:14:20,508 --> 01:14:22,465
Every female has the
right to find her true love.

1280
01:14:22,466 --> 01:14:23,965
Brother Rudra. Brother Rudra.

1281
01:14:23,966 --> 01:14:26,216
We can have this debate later.

1282
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:29,050
First, tell us if there's
a method to stop Stree?

1283
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:32,132
There I just one way
to get rid of Stree...

1284
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:33,508
- Yeah
- Turn the page.

1285
01:14:34,383 --> 01:14:35,716
- Turn the page.
- Okay.

1286
01:14:38,883 --> 01:14:41,840
The city's main business was silk.

1287
01:14:41,841 --> 01:14:43,632
People had such high
Scarcity for education,

1288
01:14:43,633 --> 01:14:45,840
...that they actually believed
that the moon was their uncle.

1289
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:46,966
The main...

1290
01:14:47,466 --> 01:14:50,133
How come Shastri turn
up in west from east.

1291
01:14:51,425 --> 01:14:53,340
After page 66 there is page 80.

1292
01:14:53,341 --> 01:14:54,257
Where are the rest of the pages?

1293
01:14:54,258 --> 01:14:56,883
This is why I don't let anyone in.

1294
01:14:57,133 --> 01:14:59,882
Children tear pages from
the book and make paper boats.

1295
01:14:59,883 --> 01:15:01,590
How will we save Jana now?

1296
01:15:01,591 --> 01:15:02,383
Just a minute.

1297
01:15:03,883 --> 01:15:05,133
I've seen this place.

1298
01:15:05,716 --> 01:15:06,675
- You have?
- Yes.

1299
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,466
Where?

1300
01:15:08,841 --> 01:15:09,841
Above the hill.

1301
01:15:10,591 --> 01:15:12,507
- We should go there.
- Then let's go.

1302
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,007
- We might find something here.
- Yes.

1303
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:16,550
- Go. Go on you two.
- What go?

1304
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,090
- You must come along too.
- Me?

1305
01:15:19,091 --> 01:15:22,090
- Brother Rudra, you have done research.
- Of course.

1306
01:15:22,091 --> 01:15:22,507
I see...

1307
01:15:22,508 --> 01:15:23,217
Wait a minute then.

1308
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:24,676
Let me take a sip. Take this along.

1309
01:15:26,612 --> 01:15:28,071
Shama, I am going.

1310
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:32,289
<font color="#ff0000"><b>T</b></font>

1311
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:32,410

1312
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:32,527

1313
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:32,635

1314
01:15:32,636 --> 01:15:32,745

1319
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:33,985
<font color="#ff0000"><b>THIRD NIGHT</b></font>

1320
01:15:33,986 --> 01:15:35,702
We're running out of fuel...

1321
01:15:35,703 --> 01:15:37,528
How much further, Vicky?

1322
01:15:37,529 --> 01:15:38,612
Let's go straight up a bit.

1323
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:43,382
Stop!

1324
01:15:43,383 --> 01:15:44,050
Stop.

1325
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:55,050
What?

1326
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,502
I am allergic... to dust.

1327
01:15:57,503 --> 01:15:58,045
Come on.

1328
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,091
It's so dark around here.

1329
01:16:05,716 --> 01:16:09,466
- What if she abducts me?
- She is a female, not a male.

1330
01:16:10,008 --> 01:16:12,508
She doesn't use force
against your will, like men.

1331
01:16:13,008 --> 01:16:14,800
She will first ask
for your permission.

1332
01:16:16,008 --> 01:16:17,383
Hello Mr. Tom-Dick-or-Harry.

1333
01:16:17,758 --> 01:16:18,800
And if you turn around.

1334
01:16:19,216 --> 01:16:20,715
Then she will think it's a yes.

1335
01:16:20,716 --> 01:16:22,341
Yes, means yes.

1336
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:23,716
Then she will take you away.

1337
01:16:24,216 --> 01:16:26,633
So under no circumstance
will you turn around.

1338
01:16:26,925 --> 01:16:28,340
- No turning around.
- No.

1339
01:16:28,341 --> 01:16:28,966
Let's go.

1340
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:39,633
Jana.

1341
01:16:40,633 --> 01:16:41,550
Jana.

1342
01:16:47,175 --> 01:16:48,050
Jana.

1343
01:16:55,216 --> 01:16:56,091
Jana.

1344
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,341
Jana.

1345
01:17:07,258 --> 01:17:09,050
What are you doing?

1346
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:18,341
Brother Rudra. Give me the alcohol.

1347
01:17:19,175 --> 01:17:19,925
Alcohol.

1348
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:22,008
Why?

1349
01:17:23,675 --> 01:17:25,466
This is no time or a drink.

1350
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:27,215
No.

1351
01:17:27,216 --> 01:17:27,800
Power.

1352
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,550
No power.

1353
01:17:31,466 --> 01:17:32,216
Okay, give me.

1354
01:17:36,966 --> 01:17:38,508
Save some for me.

1355
01:17:39,591 --> 01:17:41,340
You're worried about the alcohol.

1356
01:17:41,341 --> 01:17:42,674
You go that way.

1357
01:17:42,675 --> 01:17:44,590
Brother Rudra, you search upstairs.

1358
01:17:44,591 --> 01:17:45,549
- Why?
- And I will look here.

1359
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:46,465
Let's stay together.

1360
01:17:46,466 --> 01:17:47,425
We don't have time for that.

1361
01:18:41,966 --> 01:18:45,466
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1362
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:55,800
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1363
01:18:57,456 --> 01:18:59,531
Mom always told me...

1364
01:18:59,532 --> 01:19:01,760
to learn the Hanuman Chalisa.

1365
01:19:02,408 --> 01:19:03,994
Now see!

1366
01:19:05,182 --> 01:19:06,390
Sorry, mom.

1367
01:19:15,133 --> 01:19:19,257
Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake!

1368
01:19:19,258 --> 01:19:20,966
Run.

1369
01:19:21,216 --> 01:19:21,841
Snake!

1370
01:19:40,841 --> 01:19:41,466
Mummy!

1371
01:19:47,216 --> 01:19:49,049
Brother Rudra! Brother Rudra!

1372
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:49,758
Where are you going?

1373
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:51,167
I was just warming up.

1374
01:19:51,675 --> 01:19:53,042
I saw her.

1375
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:53,933
You did?

1376
01:19:55,883 --> 01:19:56,800
Brother Rudra!

1377
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,175
Jana.

1378
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,896
<i>Vicky...</i>

1379
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:58,925
Stree... it's me. Vicky.

1380
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,591
Remember I stitched your dress.

1381
01:21:02,966 --> 01:21:08,550
I am here for Jana,
he's a... very nice guy.

1382
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,841
In fact, he calls you sister-in-law.

1383
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:13,737
Vicky...

1384
01:21:14,925 --> 01:21:19,675
I stitched your dress in 35 minutes,
Stree, and you want to abduct me.

1385
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,216
You hurt me.

1386
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:24,425
I won't turn around.

1387
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,924
- Vicky...
- I can't hear you at all.

1388
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:29,050
Hello. Hello. Hello.

1389
01:21:44,977 --> 01:21:46,723
I... ain't... gonna turn...

1390
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:50,036
No way...

1391
01:21:52,314 --> 01:21:53,522
Daddy...

1392
01:21:54,979 --> 01:21:55,854
Daddy!

1393
01:22:56,046 --> 01:22:57,296
Vicky!

1394
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:08,707
Are you okay?

1395
01:23:08,708 --> 01:23:11,791
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am fine.

1396
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,833
Is she gone?

1397
01:23:14,506 --> 01:23:15,381
Don't know.

1398
01:23:16,154 --> 01:23:17,154
Don't know?

1399
01:23:20,678 --> 01:23:22,511
But at least one good thing happened.

1400
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,654
You're not Stree.

1401
01:23:25,678 --> 01:23:27,053
You know, like in the morning...

1402
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:29,947
Sorry.

1403
01:23:30,612 --> 01:23:31,820
Shall we go back?

1404
01:23:32,104 --> 01:23:33,604
- But Vicky is still inside.
- Bittu.

1405
01:23:33,854 --> 01:23:36,771
Where were you?

1406
01:23:37,217 --> 01:23:38,009
Did you see Jana?

1407
01:23:39,894 --> 01:23:40,565
No!

1408
01:23:40,566 --> 01:23:42,839
Run brother Rudra.
He's fallen prey as well.

1409
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,316
That's not her.

1410
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:46,026
- She is not Stree.
- You are lying.

1411
01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:47,200
That's the girl.

1412
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:48,284
The letter... Remember.

1413
01:23:48,525 --> 01:23:49,441
The dress.

1414
01:23:50,611 --> 01:23:51,653
Vicky Please!

1415
01:23:52,197 --> 01:23:53,114
That's her.

1416
01:23:53,787 --> 01:23:56,286
I swear she risked
her own life to save mine.

1417
01:23:56,287 --> 01:23:57,412
You two would've...

1418
01:23:58,193 --> 01:23:59,151
Been amazed.

1419
01:23:59,557 --> 01:24:01,388
She flung her dagger at the witch.

1420
01:24:01,389 --> 01:24:03,722
If we had posted her video on Youtube,
it would've been an instant hit.

1421
01:24:04,381 --> 01:24:05,723
#daggergirl.

1422
01:24:05,724 --> 01:24:08,474
But what is she doing here?
How does she know we're here?

1423
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:10,856
Your friend is not
the only one missing.

1424
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:13,167
Many people go missing every year.

1425
01:24:13,576 --> 01:24:15,868
I've been coming here for the
past three years during the festival.

1426
01:24:16,694 --> 01:24:19,152
So that I can get rid of her for good.

1427
01:24:19,572 --> 01:24:23,390
Just like you guys, I've also lost one of mine.

1428
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,641
I know he will never come back.

1429
01:24:27,175 --> 01:24:28,008
But still...

1430
01:24:29,807 --> 01:24:32,182
You can share your sorrow with me.

1431
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,201
It will lighten your burden.

1432
01:24:36,231 --> 01:24:36,814
No!

1433
01:24:37,432 --> 01:24:38,557
Okay.

1434
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:41,271
By the way,
where did you learn this art?

1435
01:24:41,832 --> 01:24:42,998
I had to wander around for it.

1436
01:24:43,483 --> 01:24:47,066
I went to ascetics, and tantric.

1437
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:52,152
Tantra, magic, hypnosis, and spells
from the red book. I learned everything.

1438
01:24:52,675 --> 01:24:55,092
I've had only one mission
for the past three years.

1439
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:56,858
Defeating Stree.

1440
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,010
I tried everything I knew.

1441
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:04,016
But it wasn't enough.

1442
01:25:04,449 --> 01:25:06,316
I thought I was ready.

1443
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:09,025
I thought that I would
defeat her this time.

1444
01:25:09,977 --> 01:25:14,901
You see, ma'am. I've done
extensive research on this subject.

1445
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:15,945
Research.

1446
01:25:15,946 --> 01:25:21,168
I have books on magic spells, hypnosis,
and other art forms in my library.

1447
01:25:21,169 --> 01:25:23,085
You can come over
if you need any help.

1448
01:25:23,086 --> 01:25:25,010
Even we have a shop
for lady's fashion.

1449
01:25:25,011 --> 01:25:26,099
Best in town.

1450
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,350
If you need anything at any time,
just let me know.

1451
01:25:28,718 --> 01:25:31,843
And anyway... it's always
better than stitched clothes.

1452
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,733
I don't like readymade.

1453
01:25:37,316 --> 01:25:37,900
Shall we?

1454
01:25:39,441 --> 01:25:40,316
Vicky.

1455
01:25:41,203 --> 01:25:41,995
What happened?

1456
01:25:55,566 --> 01:25:58,565
Jana. My Jana is back.

1457
01:25:58,566 --> 01:26:00,316
My son is back.

1458
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:04,066
My son, where were you?

1459
01:26:04,441 --> 01:26:07,649
- Where were you...
- You'll tear his (the) clothes.

1460
01:26:07,650 --> 01:26:09,066
He's lost so much weight.

1461
01:26:09,608 --> 01:26:11,775
Forgive me, son. Forgive me.

1462
01:26:12,025 --> 01:26:14,107
You really are his friend.

1463
01:26:14,108 --> 01:26:15,982
- I said such bad things.
- It's all right.

1464
01:26:15,983 --> 01:26:16,732
It's okay, aunty.

1465
01:26:16,733 --> 01:26:19,940
Jana, it's your mom, your mom.

1466
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,191
I want to go sleep.

1467
01:26:22,316 --> 01:26:23,400
He wants to sleep.

1468
01:26:23,858 --> 01:26:25,482
- Yes son, let's go.
- Come on.

1469
01:26:25,483 --> 01:26:27,524
Please send my coat back.

1470
01:26:27,525 --> 01:26:28,191
Okay, aunty.

1471
01:26:29,387 --> 01:26:30,096
Bye, Jana.

1472
01:27:06,314 --> 01:27:07,792
<i>Aunty...</i>

1473
01:27:07,793 --> 01:27:08,940
Aunty... Aunty!

1474
01:27:08,941 --> 01:27:11,232
She took my husband.

1475
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:15,815
She took my son too.

1476
01:27:15,816 --> 01:27:18,775
She took him too.

1477
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:22,649
She took my husband.

1478
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:25,316
My husband too.

1479
01:27:45,036 --> 01:27:47,453
But... how did so
many people disappear?

1480
01:27:49,362 --> 01:27:51,112
Someone erased the ink.

1481
01:27:57,764 --> 01:28:00,014
<i>Jana, look what Stree did.</i>

1482
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,650
She abducted a dozen men.

1483
01:28:03,184 --> 01:28:05,892
And she's also
erased the ink, Jana!

1484
01:28:07,016 --> 01:28:07,650
You...

1485
01:28:12,855 --> 01:28:13,816
Jana.

1486
01:28:18,404 --> 01:28:18,866
J...

1487
01:28:18,867 --> 01:28:19,658
Jana?

1488
01:28:21,484 --> 01:28:23,669
<i>Why are you sitting like that, Jana?</i>

1489
01:28:26,465 --> 01:28:27,549
And your palms...

1490
01:28:29,558 --> 01:28:30,644
Jana?

1491
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:40,983
I am your mother.
Listen to your mom, son.

1492
01:28:43,247 --> 01:28:44,983
Jana, spare your friends at least.

1493
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:48,566
Listen to me,
I am already 70% damaged.

1494
01:28:52,903 --> 01:28:53,391
Jana.

1495
01:28:53,392 --> 01:28:53,952
Jana, Hey!

1496
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:56,418
We're humans, not kites.

1497
01:28:57,691 --> 01:28:58,400
Jana!

1498
01:28:58,956 --> 01:29:02,208
Vicky, look at Jana's hand.
He erased the ink.

1499
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:03,496
Divert his attention?

1500
01:29:03,497 --> 01:29:04,226
Me?

1501
01:29:04,227 --> 01:29:05,102
Yeah! Go, Go...

1502
01:29:05,692 --> 01:29:06,630
Jana.

1503
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:07,923
Someone get a blanket.

1504
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,691
Jana...

1505
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,108
Jana!

1506
01:29:11,566 --> 01:29:12,275
Jana.

1507
01:29:12,893 --> 01:29:14,082
Jana, stop.

1508
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,365
Jana...

1509
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:15,680
Jana-

1510
01:29:15,681 --> 01:29:16,070
Jana-Jana-

1511
01:29:16,071 --> 01:29:16,431
Jana-Jana-Jana-

1512
01:29:16,432 --> 01:29:16,861
Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-

1513
01:29:16,862 --> 01:29:17,260
Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-

1514
01:29:17,261 --> 01:29:17,736
Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-

1515
01:29:17,737 --> 01:29:18,117
Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-Jana-

1516
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:18,973
JAnanjAaJa!

1517
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:21,783
Jana! It's me, Vicky!

1518
01:29:24,408 --> 01:29:26,449
Jana.

1519
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:27,450
Quiet!

1520
01:29:27,866 --> 01:29:30,157
Or else I will slap you.

1521
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:30,700
Quiet!

1522
01:29:34,483 --> 01:29:35,129
Oy!!!

1523
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:35,884
Jana.

1524
01:29:35,885 --> 01:29:37,219
What are you doing?

1525
01:29:38,075 --> 01:29:39,408
It's Vicky.

1526
01:29:41,942 --> 01:29:43,381
Bittu!

1527
01:29:43,382 --> 01:29:44,311
Bittu! Bittu!

1528
01:29:49,241 --> 01:29:50,116
Come on.

1529
01:29:55,533 --> 01:29:57,449
This is the only solution left.

1530
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:00,282
Wear saree, and
bangles like women do.

1531
01:30:00,283 --> 01:30:04,325
Your solutions were not effective
at all. That Stree took 20 men.

1532
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:06,325
Yes, Shyama?

1533
01:30:06,658 --> 01:30:08,283
Yes, I know. I am coming.

1534
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,517
I am coming.

1535
01:30:09,518 --> 01:30:11,851
We want our youngsters back.

1536
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:15,408
Whoever brings the
missing men back,

1537
01:30:15,825 --> 01:30:22,116
...will be rewarded
10,000 for every male.

1538
01:30:23,241 --> 01:30:24,325
Understand?

1539
01:30:27,158 --> 01:30:28,824
This city wants freedom.

1540
01:30:28,825 --> 01:30:30,532
Freedom.

1541
01:30:30,533 --> 01:30:32,324
Everyone knows...

1542
01:30:32,325 --> 01:30:34,032
Stree is a thief.

1543
01:30:34,033 --> 01:30:36,199
Let's all unite.

1544
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,907
And drive Stree away.

1545
01:30:37,908 --> 01:30:41,115
<i>You give us men...</i>
<b><font color="#791028">REAL WAY TO GET RID OF STREE</font>
JUST 250 RUPEES</b>

1546
01:30:41,116 --> 01:30:42,908
<i>We'll give you freedom.</i>

1547
01:30:44,241 --> 01:30:47,241
It's the smoke coming on my face.

1548
01:30:48,575 --> 01:30:51,657
- Bittu, untie me.
- Wait.

1549
01:30:51,658 --> 01:30:53,033
No one listens to him.

1550
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:56,325
That Amol Palekar turned to be Baahubali.

1551
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,283
How can someone beat
up your own friend?

1552
01:30:58,707 --> 01:31:02,207
We cannot waste any more time,
Jana is completely under her control.

1553
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:04,866
We must do something solid
before the festival ends.

1554
01:31:05,116 --> 01:31:07,234
You're experienced in this field,

1555
01:31:07,235 --> 01:31:09,240
Please suggest something to us.

1556
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:11,968
If we can find out
more about Stree,

1557
01:31:11,969 --> 01:31:14,094
then I can come
up with something.

1558
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:15,867
But from where?

1559
01:31:16,656 --> 01:31:18,317
We found a book at his shop.

1560
01:31:18,318 --> 01:31:19,406
Library.

1561
01:31:20,825 --> 01:31:21,766
We found a book in his

1562
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:22,920
We found a book in his LiBraRy,

1563
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:24,465
<i>But the pages were missing.</i>

1564
01:31:26,033 --> 01:31:29,283
What if we find the
guy who wrote that book...

1565
01:31:29,575 --> 01:31:31,783
...then he would know what
was written on those pages.

1566
01:31:32,491 --> 01:31:33,708
Do you know that guy?

1567
01:31:33,709 --> 01:31:35,115
I know everything.

1568
01:31:35,116 --> 01:31:36,658
Is he alive?

1569
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,033
He lives in Emergency.

1570
01:31:39,658 --> 01:31:40,700
E.R.?

1571
01:31:41,866 --> 01:31:42,908
Emergency.

1572
01:32:07,384 --> 01:32:09,967
Which book are you talking about?

1573
01:32:11,518 --> 01:32:13,387
Respected Mr. Shastri.

1574
01:32:13,388 --> 01:32:17,681
You wrote the history
of our city in a book.

1575
01:32:17,682 --> 01:32:19,997
Chanderi Puran,

1576
01:32:19,998 --> 01:32:20,849
Remember?

1577
01:32:21,429 --> 01:32:24,843
The book was launched
in my Rudra Book Depot.

1578
01:32:25,753 --> 01:32:28,996
You were used to sell
erotica books back then.

1579
01:32:29,531 --> 01:32:30,679
<i>Mr. Shashtri,</i>

1580
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,029
that Stree abducted our friend.

1581
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:34,864
Along with many other males too.

1582
01:32:34,865 --> 01:32:36,824
Can we get them back?

1583
01:32:37,711 --> 01:32:38,796
Stree.

1584
01:32:38,797 --> 01:32:40,547
Please, Mr. Shashtri.

1585
01:32:41,093 --> 01:32:42,218
We request!

1586
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:47,050
Did the emergency end?

1587
01:32:47,465 --> 01:32:50,612
We've been banging our heads against a
wall, This man doesn't remember anything.

1588
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:52,083
Yes, sir... uhh...

1589
01:32:52,084 --> 01:32:54,873
Emergency is over,
things are keeping up better.

1590
01:32:55,399 --> 01:32:56,983
No-no-no.

1591
01:32:57,493 --> 01:32:58,267
Shashtri-ji, we're...

1592
01:32:58,268 --> 01:33:00,430
we're talking about Stree.

1593
01:33:00,431 --> 01:33:01,140
Stree.
- Stree.

1594
01:33:01,141 --> 01:33:02,397
Like "Stree Come tomorrow."

1595
01:33:02,398 --> 01:33:03,106
<i>Stree.</i>

1596
01:33:03,676 --> 01:33:05,301
What is a Stree?

1597
01:33:07,705 --> 01:33:11,032
She has no s tature compared to males.

1598
01:33:11,033 --> 01:33:11,950
What?

1599
01:33:12,349 --> 01:33:14,800
She should always
stay within her limits.

1600
01:33:15,267 --> 01:33:18,100
Never step out of the home.

1601
01:33:18,714 --> 01:33:23,165
Her job is to keep her husband happy,
and bear children.

1602
01:33:23,166 --> 01:33:27,909
And if she crosses her limit,
then burn her alive at the cross.

1603
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:31,168
He has no solution.

1604
01:33:31,169 --> 01:33:33,171
Such wild thoughts!
-Just a waste of our time...

1605
01:33:33,411 --> 01:33:36,310
What kind of a writer is he, ah?
Is this what he writes?

1606
01:33:36,595 --> 01:33:38,873
What about Jana now?
He's too strong to control.

1607
01:33:38,874 --> 01:33:39,375
Let's think.

1608
01:33:39,376 --> 01:33:40,659
What a freakshow!

1609
01:33:41,776 --> 01:33:43,362
Not me!

1610
01:33:44,316 --> 01:33:46,849
I ain't got those filthy thoughts.

1611
01:33:47,468 --> 01:33:50,343
It's those townspeople
who have got filthy thoughts.

1612
01:33:50,344 --> 01:33:53,879
They used to use that Stree
as long as they wanted.

1613
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,847
And then disposed her!

1614
01:33:56,256 --> 01:33:57,721
<i>And that one man...</i>

1615
01:33:57,722 --> 01:33:59,371
who gave her respect,

1616
01:34:00,487 --> 01:34:02,723
they took him away as well.

1617
01:34:03,577 --> 01:34:05,081
They will all die.

1618
01:34:05,668 --> 01:34:06,709
Everyone.

1619
01:34:09,278 --> 01:34:13,165
As long as there's even
one male in this city,

1620
01:34:13,166 --> 01:34:15,156
she won't shut herself.

1621
01:34:16,507 --> 01:34:18,231
<i>Just one...</i>

1622
01:34:18,232 --> 01:34:21,672
One man can cease this fire.

1623
01:34:21,673 --> 01:34:23,145
Who is he, Shastri-ji?

1624
01:34:23,146 --> 01:34:24,431
How does he look?

1625
01:34:25,283 --> 01:34:27,976
Wheatish color, long nose.

1626
01:34:27,977 --> 01:34:29,831
And treats himself like a king.

1627
01:34:30,316 --> 01:34:32,779
Born in the arms of a banyan tree.

1628
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:34,793
<i>The only prince of his family.</i>

1629
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:36,907
<i>Love reflects in his eyes.</i>

1630
01:34:36,908 --> 01:34:38,529
<i>A true artist.</i>

1631
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:41,554
He's the true protector of this city.

1632
01:34:43,315 --> 01:34:46,399
A prostitute's son who's a bachelor.

1633
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,595
Courtesan's son... who's a bachelor.

1634
01:34:48,596 --> 01:34:50,741
<i>A courtesan's son</i>

1635
01:34:50,742 --> 01:34:52,263
who's a bachelor.

1636
01:34:54,253 --> 01:34:57,574
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1637
01:34:57,575 --> 01:35:00,367
Born in the arms
of the banyan tree.

1638
01:35:00,368 --> 01:35:02,922
The only prince of his family.

1639
01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:04,995
Eh, Vicky!

1640
01:35:05,628 --> 01:35:08,590
Weren't you born
at your grandma's house?

1641
01:35:09,361 --> 01:35:11,903
And there was an banyan
tree behind her house.

1642
01:35:12,688 --> 01:35:13,479
Yes.

1643
01:35:13,758 --> 01:35:14,300
So?

1644
01:35:14,966 --> 01:35:16,341
And you're the only son.

1645
01:35:17,258 --> 01:35:18,508
Prince.

1646
01:35:18,883 --> 01:35:19,675
Very good.

1647
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:24,507
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1648
01:35:24,508 --> 01:35:27,925
- He has wheatish color.
- And a long nose.

1649
01:35:28,591 --> 01:35:33,591
And, you always think
of yourself as a king.

1650
01:35:33,925 --> 01:35:36,008
Love reflects in his eyes.

1651
01:35:36,508 --> 01:35:37,800
And a true artist.

1652
01:35:38,258 --> 01:35:39,675
There's love in your eyes.

1653
01:35:40,175 --> 01:35:42,674
And Stree saw that,
which is why she didn't abduct him.

1654
01:35:42,675 --> 01:35:44,090
There's love in my eyes?

1655
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:46,049
Stree can see it, not her.

1656
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:47,675
And you're an artist as well.

1657
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:50,008
Aren't you getting carried away now?

1658
01:35:50,258 --> 01:35:51,425
What artist?

1659
01:35:51,925 --> 01:35:57,382
Vicky is the best ladies tailor
in the neighboring three districts.

1660
01:35:57,383 --> 01:35:58,299
Exactly.

1661
01:35:58,300 --> 01:35:59,758
This is a good coincidence.

1662
01:36:00,133 --> 01:36:02,424
But we must find someone
who has all five qualities?

1663
01:36:02,425 --> 01:36:04,549
And what about the fifth quality?
courtesan's son?

1664
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,758
How will find him?

1665
01:36:06,716 --> 01:36:08,840
Courtesan means that right?

1666
01:36:08,841 --> 01:36:09,300
That...

1667
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:22,383
No one told him.

1668
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,591
Nobody.

1669
01:36:24,008 --> 01:36:27,425
Everyone knows, but you don't know.

1670
01:36:28,091 --> 01:36:28,675
What?

1671
01:36:31,508 --> 01:36:32,425
- What?
- Look...

1672
01:36:35,216 --> 01:36:37,508
There's no need to feel bad.

1673
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:43,341
Some mothers are school teachers,
some are government officers.

1674
01:36:43,716 --> 01:36:45,591
Some make pickles.

1675
01:36:46,716 --> 01:36:49,550
- Your mother was that...
- What?

1676
01:36:50,216 --> 01:36:50,841
That.

1677
01:36:52,675 --> 01:36:53,341
What?

1678
01:36:54,716 --> 01:36:55,466
Courtesan!

1679
01:36:58,341 --> 01:37:00,300
I will kill you right now.

1680
01:37:03,966 --> 01:37:06,341
I thought you never meant
it when you called me a bas***

1681
01:37:06,841 --> 01:37:07,633
You...

1682
01:37:08,133 --> 01:37:09,258
This is absurd.

1683
01:37:11,508 --> 01:37:12,925
And in front of her.

1684
01:37:15,925 --> 01:37:17,633
Vicky. it's true.

1685
01:37:19,508 --> 01:37:21,966
Jana, I will break your head.

1686
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:26,174
Vicky.

1687
01:37:26,175 --> 01:37:27,008
Don't look at me.

1688
01:37:27,633 --> 01:37:29,425
I won't believe you.

1689
01:37:31,925 --> 01:37:33,341
My mother was not a courtesan.

1690
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:35,425
- Listen!
- No.

1691
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:37,383
Vicky!

1692
01:37:44,591 --> 01:37:46,216
We've found the protector of the city.

1693
01:37:48,758 --> 01:37:50,091
He will deal with Stree.

1694
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:53,508
- You mean Stree.
- Yes. Stree.

1695
01:38:11,258 --> 01:38:11,966
One more.

1696
01:38:19,508 --> 01:38:22,800
Brother Vicky, mom's asking
when you will return her blouse.

1697
01:38:27,341 --> 01:38:28,091
Dad.

1698
01:38:32,133 --> 01:38:33,841
What were you lecturing
me about energy?

1699
01:38:37,383 --> 01:38:39,425
You've done a lot of
friendship when you were young.

1700
01:38:41,841 --> 01:38:43,300
Tell me something.

1701
01:38:44,508 --> 01:38:48,050
Did you do friendship with mom,
or marry her?

1702
01:38:55,383 --> 01:38:56,633
Blouse petticoat.

1703
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,383
Who was she?

1704
01:39:05,841 --> 01:39:06,925
Why didn't you tell me?

1705
01:39:08,966 --> 01:39:11,175
You kept lying to me.

01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:25,841

1710
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:28,675
Sorry.

1711
01:39:29,633 --> 01:39:30,675
Eat.

1712
01:39:35,341 --> 01:39:36,924
You could've told me this once.

1713
01:39:36,925 --> 01:39:37,633
That's all.

1714
01:39:41,166 --> 01:39:41,958
Eat.

1715
01:39:47,208 --> 01:39:48,375
I talked to daddy.

1716
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:49,833
And I thought how does it matter.

1717
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:51,583
She was my mother after all.

1718
01:39:52,856 --> 01:39:54,231
Maybe my father's someone else too.

1719
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:56,439
But I know only one father.

1720
01:39:58,016 --> 01:40:00,933
The guy who stands at the
shop with the measuring tape.

1721
01:40:02,962 --> 01:40:05,557
And who thinks that my talent...

1722
01:40:05,558 --> 01:40:07,736
is the greatest
talent in the world.

1723
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:10,916
But this city...

1724
01:40:11,603 --> 01:40:13,448
Everyone knew about me,

1725
01:40:13,909 --> 01:40:16,054
but they never made fun of me.

1726
01:40:16,797 --> 01:40:19,089
Otherwise, people like to gossip.

1727
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:21,793
I always...

1728
01:40:21,794 --> 01:40:23,068
knew that...

1729
01:40:23,069 --> 01:40:24,733
I wasn't meant for...

1730
01:40:24,734 --> 01:40:26,981
mending mere blouses and petticoats...

1731
01:40:26,982 --> 01:40:30,607
But I didn't know that
I was born to save these people.

1732
01:40:31,592 --> 01:40:35,301
Lord chose a really
unique mission for me.

1733
01:40:37,099 --> 01:40:39,415
Born in the arms of the banyan tree.

1734
01:40:39,416 --> 01:40:41,355
The sole prince...

1735
01:40:44,406 --> 01:40:45,531
The son of a courtesan
who's a bachelor.

1736
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,941
<i>If I really am the
son of a coutesan...</i>

1737
01:40:48,942 --> 01:40:50,817
<i>...then I will save this city.</i>

1738
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:53,500
<i>Along with Jana,
I will save everyone!</i>

1739
01:40:55,148 --> 01:40:57,065
<i>Bittu, gather everyone.</i>

1740
01:41:02,146 --> 01:41:03,563
What do we know about the Stree?

1741
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:05,458
She is scary.

1742
01:41:05,459 --> 01:41:06,582
Ferocious.

1743
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:07,409
Nope.

1744
01:41:08,207 --> 01:41:09,354
She can read.

1745
01:41:09,355 --> 01:41:12,582
Ever heard about a ghost
or a demon who can read?

1746
01:41:12,583 --> 01:41:14,082
Right.

1747
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:16,749
Meaning we're up against
an educated witch.

1748
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:18,291
She is the new generation witch.

1749
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:19,416
Point no. 2.

1750
01:41:19,916 --> 01:41:21,875
She comes every year during
the festival, to abduct men.

1751
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:25,416
But if you write outside your
house O Stree, come back tomorrow.

1752
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:28,166
Then she reads it and thinks...

1753
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:33,750
Oh... okay. Rest today,
and I'll come back tomorrow.

1754
01:41:34,208 --> 01:41:36,790
Meaning she listens.

1755
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:38,415
Meaning she is obedient.

1756
01:41:38,416 --> 01:41:39,333
No. 3.

1757
01:41:39,916 --> 01:41:41,332
She is very stupid.

1758
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:42,416
Next night she comes back again.

1759
01:41:42,708 --> 01:41:45,541
Reads the same line
again and thinks...

1760
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:49,165
Oh shit, now I'll have
to come back tomorrow again.

1761
01:41:49,166 --> 01:41:50,000
This is cheating.

1762
01:41:50,333 --> 01:41:52,415
And she goes back to her home.

1763
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:54,750
Poor thing doesn't understand
that these people are s...

1764
01:41:56,625 --> 01:41:57,583
I mean making a fool of her.

1765
01:41:58,041 --> 01:42:00,290
- She has a low IQ level.
- Exactly.

1766
01:42:00,291 --> 01:42:02,958
And we're much smarter than her.

1767
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:03,999
Thank you.

1768
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,500
And, if we get serious...

1769
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:09,000
...then we can easily
get rid of this witch forever.

1770
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:12,291
- Then let's get serious.
- Correct. Let's get serious.

1771
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:15,791
But what are we going to do?

1772
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:20,625
Wedding night.

1773
01:42:21,375 --> 01:42:22,375
Wedding night.

1774
01:42:22,791 --> 01:42:24,624
But brother Rudra,
aren't you too old for that?

1775
01:42:24,625 --> 01:42:25,677
No... not me.

1776
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:26,722
No!

1777
01:42:26,723 --> 01:42:28,639
According to Mr. Shashtri's book,

1778
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:32,325
Stree wants her wedding
night which was left incomplete.

1779
01:42:32,326 --> 01:42:33,246
Yes so.

1780
01:42:33,247 --> 01:42:34,932
And if you're the
protector of this city...

1781
01:42:34,933 --> 01:42:38,457
...then you must fulfill her wish.

1782
01:42:38,458 --> 01:42:39,457
What are you saying?

1783
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:40,415
Have you lost your mind?

1784
01:42:40,416 --> 01:42:41,708
- No.
- What are you saying?

1785
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:44,582
My father never even let
me watch a wedding night on TV,

1786
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:45,915
...how can I do it with a witch?

1787
01:42:45,916 --> 01:42:46,625
Yes.

1788
01:42:47,226 --> 01:42:49,492
If I'm the protector, shouldn't
I prepare for a fight or something.

1789
01:42:49,493 --> 01:42:51,993
The real fight begins
after the wedding night.

1790
01:42:52,967 --> 01:42:53,883
Brother Rudra...

1791
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:58,374
You mean, me and that witch...

1792
01:42:58,375 --> 01:43:00,916
We just have to use it as bait.

1793
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:04,541
We must lead her to you, that's all.

1794
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:07,000
Remember she saw love in your eyes.

1795
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:07,957
Yes.

1796
01:43:07,958 --> 01:43:09,875
- And then?
- Then leave it to me.

1797
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,958
She is very strong in her own home.

1798
01:43:12,375 --> 01:43:15,708
But I know how to overpower
her when she is out of her house.

1799
01:43:17,106 --> 01:43:18,419
But where will we call her?

1800
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:22,166
Right here, in Vicky's Palace.

1801
01:43:22,416 --> 01:43:23,083
Best place.

1802
01:44:41,197 --> 01:44:42,740
Stree is out hunting today.

1803
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:45,366
Don't step out of the
house and lock the door.

1804
01:44:45,611 --> 01:44:45,979
Okay.

1805
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:46,460
Listen dear...

1806
01:44:46,461 --> 01:44:47,245
Please come back soon.

1807
01:44:47,246 --> 01:44:48,000
I feel scared alone.

1808
01:44:48,001 --> 01:44:50,458
I'll be back soon.
Keep the doors closed.

1809
01:45:04,792 --> 01:45:06,251
Vicky, you're looking really handsome.

1810
01:45:06,252 --> 01:45:07,803
- Now wear this cap.
- No, no.

1811
01:45:07,804 --> 01:45:09,013
- I said wear it.
- No, no, caps. You'll ruin my hair.

1812
01:45:09,014 --> 01:45:10,765
- But the groom has to wear...
- I don't want to...

1813
01:45:10,766 --> 01:45:11,391
Wear it.

1814
01:45:25,806 --> 01:45:27,926
Dad had such vivid
dreams about my wedding.

1815
01:45:28,195 --> 01:45:29,353
Who knew that I'll be...

1816
01:45:29,354 --> 01:45:30,967
marrying a witch some day.

1817
01:45:30,968 --> 01:45:32,010
Don't worry.

1818
01:45:32,449 --> 01:45:34,484
You're getting a chance
to save the entire city.

1819
01:45:34,485 --> 01:45:36,241
Not everyone gets this
opportunity. Don't be scared.

1820
01:45:36,242 --> 01:45:37,993
Absolutely! Don't you
want to save Jana?

1821
01:45:37,994 --> 01:45:39,577
Don't you want to make
him a human being again?

1822
01:45:40,147 --> 01:45:42,085
What is the plan?
What do we do?

1823
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:46,362
Stree will definitely come here
after reading the message on the wall.

1824
01:45:48,558 --> 01:45:52,184
When she looks into your eyes,
don't look away.

1825
01:45:52,185 --> 01:45:53,893
Instead look into her eyes.

1826
01:45:54,504 --> 01:45:55,754
I know a spell.

1827
01:45:56,138 --> 01:45:58,475
That spell will render her powerless.

1828
01:45:58,476 --> 01:46:02,198
And then we must drive
this dagger through her heart.

1829
01:46:02,199 --> 01:46:04,074
Dagger? How can I...

1830
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:06,621
We're waiting inside.

1831
01:46:06,886 --> 01:46:07,636
Don't be scared.

1832
01:46:08,997 --> 01:46:09,581
Let's go.

1833
01:46:09,891 --> 01:46:10,849
Listen...

1834
01:46:11,319 --> 01:46:13,567
Will your spell work?

1835
01:46:13,568 --> 01:46:14,460
90%

1836
01:46:14,461 --> 01:46:16,253
What is 90%?

1837
01:46:17,098 --> 01:46:18,666
Maybe 99%.

1838
01:46:19,044 --> 01:46:21,833
Meaning there is a
1% chance I'll be dead.

1839
01:46:23,378 --> 01:46:24,601
Daddy...

1840
01:46:24,602 --> 01:46:25,666
Let's go.

1841
01:46:25,922 --> 01:46:27,416
Listen.

1842
01:46:28,683 --> 01:46:30,541
I am going...

1843
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:35,494
Don't worry, okay.

1844
01:46:35,495 --> 01:46:36,963
Don't forget you are Vicky.

1845
01:46:36,964 --> 01:46:39,756
The guy who can spend
a night with a witch.

1846
01:46:39,757 --> 01:46:41,875
In case I don't come back,

1847
01:46:41,876 --> 01:46:43,638
don't come looking for me.

1848
01:46:43,639 --> 01:46:44,633
<i>And...</i>

1849
01:46:44,634 --> 01:46:46,181
<i>Please look after my dad.</i>

1850

<font color="#ff0000"><b>LAST NIGHT</b></font>

1859
01:46:50,676 --> 01:46:53,291
<i>O Stree come back tomorrow.</i>

1860
01:46:54,304 --> 01:46:57,416
O Stree there are no men here.

1861
01:46:58,954 --> 01:47:01,455
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1862
01:47:02,064 --> 01:47:05,421
O Stree there are no men here.

1863
01:47:39,813 --> 01:47:46,117
<font color="#791028"><b>O STREE COME HERE.</b></font>

1864
01:48:02,363 --> 01:48:04,280
<i><font color="#791028">O STREE COME</font></i>

1865
01:48:15,416 --> 01:48:16,458
I think it's her.

1866
01:48:28,458 --> 01:48:33,041
<font color="#791028"><i>O STREE COME HERE.</i></font>

1867
01:48:41,785 --> 01:48:43,359
She isn't coming inside.

1868
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,982
Is she suspicious?

1869
01:48:44,983 --> 01:48:48,219
Stree is smarter than
you all thought she is.

1870
01:48:50,997 --> 01:48:52,288
- Jana.
- Jana.

1871
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:53,790
Jana.

1872
01:48:53,791 --> 01:48:54,790
Listen to me.

1873
01:48:54,791 --> 01:48:55,583
Jana.

1874
01:48:59,619 --> 01:49:00,456
Jana.

1875
01:49:00,457 --> 01:49:02,082
Leave him.

1876
01:49:07,179 --> 01:49:08,179
Jana.

1877
01:49:09,904 --> 01:49:12,404
<i>Vicky...</i>

1878
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:25,958
Jana.

1879
01:49:31,281 --> 01:49:31,915
Jana!

1880
01:49:45,452 --> 01:49:46,661
<i>Vicky is missing.</i>

1881
01:49:47,969 --> 01:49:48,677
Vicky?

1882
01:49:55,804 --> 01:49:56,804
Vicky!

1883
01:49:59,632 --> 01:50:00,340
Vicky!

1884
01:50:02,264 --> 01:50:03,015
Vicky isn't here.

1885
01:50:03,016 --> 01:50:03,766
He's not.

1886
01:50:04,921 --> 01:50:06,691
Where could he be?

1887
01:50:07,374 --> 01:50:10,084
Meaning Stree was here
and she took her lover.

1888
01:50:10,085 --> 01:50:11,044
Don't say that.

1889
01:50:11,045 --> 01:50:14,211
All our arrangements, the wedding
night preparations, didn't work.

1890
01:50:15,771 --> 01:50:19,063
Where did your sister take him?

1891
01:50:19,494 --> 01:50:21,875
Vicky just sent a
message, on WhatsApp.

1892
01:50:21,876 --> 01:50:22,410
What?

1893
01:50:22,785 --> 01:50:24,652
He just shared his location.

1894
01:50:29,336 --> 01:50:30,745
Stree-ji?

1895
01:50:33,701 --> 01:50:34,547
Where are you,

1896
01:50:34,548 --> 01:50:35,164
Where are you, S...

1897
01:50:35,165 --> 01:50:37,540
Where are you, Stree-ji?

1898
01:50:52,122 --> 01:50:53,080
Stree, I...

1899
01:51:16,696 --> 01:51:19,863
Okay. Fine. I am sitting here.

1900
01:51:19,864 --> 01:51:21,155
I'm not going anywhere.

1901
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:23,383
I am sitting right here.

1902
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:36,922
This is the same place.

1903
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:39,182
I guess she took him to the bedroom.

1904
01:51:39,183 --> 01:51:41,141
And she won't let him go until
she spends her wedding night with him.

1905
01:51:50,495 --> 01:51:51,454
Oh, God.

1906
01:51:58,375 --> 01:51:59,626
Stree ji...

1907
01:52:00,301 --> 01:52:01,882
I am ready.

1908
01:52:02,773 --> 01:52:05,083
Come on this bed.

1909
01:52:05,084 --> 01:52:06,415
We'll spend our wedding night.

1910
01:52:10,648 --> 01:52:13,023
I am getting ready.
I am getting ready.

1911
01:52:18,382 --> 01:52:19,791
I'm taking it off.

1912
01:52:26,249 --> 01:52:28,083
Do I have to take my pants off too?

1913
01:52:28,773 --> 01:52:30,606
Fine, I'll take it off.

1914
01:52:34,558 --> 01:52:36,774
I am ready now.

1915
01:52:37,508 --> 01:52:39,135
Please come on.

1916
01:52:44,416 --> 01:52:45,584
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1917
01:52:45,585 --> 01:52:49,295
Sorry, Stree. I understand
that you've no interest in all this.

1918
01:52:49,296 --> 01:52:51,087
I respect you.

1919
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:54,383
I'll even wear my clothes back.

1920
01:52:54,384 --> 01:52:56,217
See, I am wearing them back.

1921
01:52:56,873 --> 01:52:57,971
Don't kill me, Stree.

1922
01:52:57,972 --> 01:53:00,597
I am the only son.

1923
01:53:47,035 --> 01:53:47,611
<i>Vicky!</i>

1924
01:53:53,223 --> 01:53:54,265
Jana.

1925
01:53:56,697 --> 01:53:58,073
What happened?

1926
01:53:58,074 --> 01:53:59,032
Is she dead?

1927
01:53:59,447 --> 01:54:01,364
She is just powerless at the moment.

1928
01:54:01,365 --> 01:54:04,281
But we must finish her
before she gets her powers back.

1929
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:06,541
Where are your clothes?

1930
01:54:07,435 --> 01:54:08,542
Sorry, I...

1931
01:54:08,543 --> 01:54:11,958
I thought in order to save the city,
I will have to sleep with her.

1932
01:54:12,726 --> 01:54:13,579
But you know what,

1933
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:16,000
I don't think she
wants any of these.

1934
01:54:16,652 --> 01:54:17,809
Here you go.

1935
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:20,379
You must pierce her
heart with this dagger.

1936
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:21,546
And cut off her braid.

1937
01:54:21,958 --> 01:54:22,832
Braid?

1938
01:54:22,833 --> 01:54:24,874
How did her braid get in all this?

1939
01:54:24,875 --> 01:54:26,417
And, how will I do this?

1940
01:54:26,418 --> 01:54:27,335
You do it, please.

1941
01:54:27,336 --> 01:54:29,962
I would've done it if I could.

1942
01:54:29,963 --> 01:54:30,797
You will have to do it.

1943
01:54:30,798 --> 01:54:32,306
You're the protector of the city.
Come on.

1944
01:54:32,307 --> 01:54:35,891
Yes, I know I am the protector,
but I am a tailor, not a killer.

1945
01:54:35,892 --> 01:54:36,908
Kill her before she wakes up again.

1946
01:54:36,909 --> 01:54:37,501
Take it.

1947
01:54:37,502 --> 01:54:38,836
- Come on.
- Yes.

1948
01:54:40,594 --> 01:54:41,302
Go.

1949
01:55:15,739 --> 01:55:17,416
Do we have to kill her?

1950
01:55:17,853 --> 01:55:19,479
Poor thing is lying
down so comfortably.

1951
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:21,542
This is exactly how the
people of this city treated her.

1952
01:55:21,543 --> 01:55:22,543
And we're doing the same.

1953
01:55:22,872 --> 01:55:24,501
So what's the difference
between us and them?

1954
01:55:24,502 --> 01:55:26,060
She must have a reason.

1955
01:55:26,061 --> 01:55:28,416
She is trying to find her true love.

1956
01:55:29,083 --> 01:55:30,416
Let her go, please.

1957
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:34,749
There must be another way.
Like lizard's tail, cockroach soup...

1958
01:55:39,485 --> 01:55:41,336
Then cut off her braid.

1959
01:55:41,337 --> 01:55:44,083
This will keep her powerless.
And, she won't die either.

1960
01:55:44,713 --> 01:55:45,463
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1961
01:55:52,798 --> 01:55:54,977
No, no, no!

1962
01:55:54,978 --> 01:55:56,215
Find the dagger.

1963
01:55:56,608 --> 01:55:58,322
Vicky, look in her eyes...

1964
01:55:58,930 --> 01:56:00,328
<i>Vicky, open your eyes.</i>

1965
01:56:00,329 --> 01:56:02,912
She won't do anything
if you look in her eyes.

1966
01:56:03,267 --> 01:56:04,542
It's not working.

1967
01:56:04,543 --> 01:56:06,124
She is hungry for love.
For love...

1968
01:56:06,125 --> 01:56:07,166
Look into her eyes with love.

1969
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:08,844
Love.

1970
01:56:10,344 --> 01:56:11,458
I Love you...

1971
01:56:17,623 --> 01:56:18,581
Love...

1972
01:56:19,016 --> 01:56:20,559
<i>More love, Vicky.</i>

1973
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,936
I am shitting in my frickin' pants,
and you want more feelings.

1974
01:56:25,416 --> 01:56:26,250
Quiet!

1975
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:28,610
Quiet!

1976
01:56:29,618 --> 01:56:31,549
What is all this BAHH-BAHH for?

1977
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:33,216
<i>Is this how you take revenge?</i>

1978
01:56:34,700 --> 01:56:37,117
I am the protector of the city,
so show some respect.

1979
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:39,166
<i>Always screaming.</i>

1980
01:56:39,601 --> 01:56:40,583
Vicky!

1981
01:56:41,741 --> 01:56:42,666
Here.

1982
01:57:25,408 --> 01:57:26,450
Vicky.

1983
01:57:27,033 --> 01:57:28,450
Throw the braid away.

1984
01:57:31,450 --> 01:57:32,908
Are you okay?

1985
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:36,074
Yes.

1986
01:57:36,075 --> 01:57:37,575
Dagger.

1987
01:57:41,408 --> 01:57:42,449
Sit up.

1988
01:57:42,450 --> 01:57:43,700
Get up.

1989
01:57:44,741 --> 01:57:46,408
Sit up straight.

1990
01:57:50,116 --> 01:57:52,115
- I think she's gone.
- Yes.

1991
01:57:52,116 --> 01:57:52,741
Isn't it?

1992
01:57:53,658 --> 01:57:56,200
She kept attacking her.

1993
01:57:56,658 --> 01:57:59,032
But I snuck up behind
her and cut off her braid.

1994
01:57:59,033 --> 01:58:00,365
Then she disappeared.

1995
01:58:00,366 --> 01:58:01,032
And didn't come back.

1996
01:58:01,033 --> 01:58:02,450
But is the Stree dead or not?

1997
01:58:03,950 --> 01:58:04,700
Tell me.

1998
01:58:06,366 --> 01:58:08,366
Meaning she will come
back again next year.

1999
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:12,950
- She's only hungry for one thing.
- No. it's two.

2000
01:58:13,283 --> 01:58:13,825
What?

2001
01:58:14,866 --> 01:58:18,200
Love and respect,
which this city never gave her.

2002
01:58:18,908 --> 01:58:20,491
And that was this
city's biggest mistake.

2003
01:58:21,283 --> 01:58:22,783
And we were going to
repeat the same mistake.

2004
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:28,741
And if this city gives her
the respect, which she never received.

2005
01:58:29,783 --> 01:58:31,200
Then she might leave us alone.

2006
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:13,450
These brave men together
have protected the city...

2007
01:59:13,866 --> 01:59:17,200
...and we will never
forget their contribution.

2008
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:23,199
All the youngsters who went missing
in the last two days have returned.

2009
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,950
Are you listening?

2010
01:59:31,932 --> 01:59:36,552
<font color="#ff0000">CHANDERI BUS STOP</font>

2011
01:59:37,866 --> 01:59:39,241
- There she is.
- Stop. Stop.

2012
01:59:39,741 --> 01:59:41,241
Sister-in-law.

2013
01:59:41,866 --> 01:59:43,865
The flower. The flower.

2014
01:59:43,866 --> 01:59:45,033
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

2015
01:59:46,116 --> 01:59:49,241
Everyone was looking for you.

2016
01:59:52,241 --> 01:59:54,241
You wore the dress.

2017
01:59:55,116 --> 01:59:55,908
Does it fit well?

2018
01:59:56,825 --> 01:59:58,575
You took my measurements so well.

2019
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:02,658
This is for you.

2020
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:05,825
I could've never fought
against the Stree without you.

2021
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:08,075
Thank you.

2022
02:00:10,616 --> 02:00:12,241
You are very nice, Vicky.

2023
02:00:12,866 --> 02:00:15,616
I wish we had met before, then
we could've become friends before.

2024
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:17,950
Will you be my friend?

2025
02:00:21,116 --> 02:00:24,658
You mean friends, or...

2026
02:00:25,575 --> 02:00:27,950
Yes. Isn't that what friendship means?

2027
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,115
No.

2028
02:00:30,116 --> 02:00:32,366
There's another meaning
for friendship in our town.

2029
02:00:43,991 --> 02:00:47,074
What if I want to talk to you,
or meet you?

2030
02:00:47,075 --> 02:00:48,408
I don't even have your number.

2031
02:00:49,908 --> 02:00:51,075
Just think of me.

2032
02:00:53,491 --> 02:00:55,408
Do you have to go?

2033
02:00:55,741 --> 02:00:57,283
Please wait for a few more days.

2034
02:00:58,283 --> 02:00:59,283
Please.

2035
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:01,825
Vicky, please!

2036
02:01:16,875 --> 02:01:17,832
Name?

2037
02:01:17,833 --> 02:01:19,416
You didn't tell me your name...

2038
02:01:19,898 --> 02:01:23,523
This is my first time where he's smitten
by love but doesn't know her name.

2039
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:25,000
Maybe this is true love.

2040
02:01:31,125 --> 02:01:33,541
'For the past three years,
I had only one motive.'

2041
02:01:34,166 --> 02:01:35,416
'Defeating Stree.'

2042
02:01:36,083 --> 02:01:40,291
'I tried everything I knew,
but it wasn't enough.'

2043
02:01:41,083 --> 02:01:44,291
'There's always a method
to control any power.'

2044
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,333
'Just cut off her braid.'

2045
02:01:46,583 --> 02:01:49,458
'She will become powerless,
and won't die.'

2046
02:02:06,846 --> 02:02:09,874
'I would've done
it long ago if I could.'

2047
02:02:09,875 --> 02:02:12,333
'You're the protector of the city,
you have to do it.'

O STREE PROTECT US.

2061
02:03:59,273 --> 02:04:00,459
Music.

2062
02:04:15,759 --> 02:04:17,633
Everyone's talking about you.

2063
02:04:17,634 --> 02:04:19,508
They all know that you're an angel.

2064
02:04:19,509 --> 02:04:20,549
You're hard to get...

2065
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:23,341
...your poor beloved's been waiting.

2066
02:04:23,342 --> 02:04:25,258
All I know is there's a cave...

2067
02:04:25,259 --> 02:04:27,174
...but the cave's hard to open.

2068
02:04:27,175 --> 02:04:29,091
No matter what I do,
but you're never impressed...

2069
02:04:29,092 --> 02:04:31,258
...your beloved's
been wandering around.

2070
02:04:31,259 --> 02:04:33,174
I've played all the shots right.

2071
02:04:33,175 --> 02:04:34,966
And seen have all slots.

2072
02:04:34,967 --> 02:04:38,509
But I haven't hit
the jackpot yet, but...

2073
02:04:38,925 --> 02:04:40,841
You'll get it... You'll get it.

2074
02:04:40,842 --> 02:04:42,758
You'll get it...

2075
02:04:42,759 --> 02:04:44,299
I'll get it too.

2076
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:46,216
The miracle's going to happen.

2077
02:04:46,217 --> 02:04:48,466
You'll get it... You'll get it.

2078
02:04:48,467 --> 02:04:50,299
You'll get it...

2079
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:51,924
Someday we'll all get it.

2080
02:04:51,925 --> 02:04:53,800
Be patient my friend.

2081
02:05:16,634 --> 02:05:17,633
I warned you before...

2082
02:05:17,634 --> 02:05:18,591
I warned you before...

2083
02:05:18,592 --> 02:05:19,549
She will come draped in a saree...

2084
02:05:19,550 --> 02:05:20,508
Draped in a saree...

2085
02:05:20,509 --> 02:05:21,842
And come for your...

2086
02:05:22,384 --> 02:05:24,299
Heart... Your heart... Your heart...

2087
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:26,216
She comes alone.

2088
02:05:26,217 --> 02:05:28,133
When she comes along.

2089
02:05:28,134 --> 02:05:31,842
Just meet me.

2090
02:05:32,259 --> 02:05:34,258
Meet me in my dreams.

2091
02:05:34,259 --> 02:05:36,092
Meet me completely decked up.

2092
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:39,924
Because...

2093
02:05:39,925 --> 02:05:41,758
You'll get it... You'll get it.

2094
02:05:41,759 --> 02:05:43,217
You'll get it...

2095
02:05:43,675 --> 02:05:45,216
I'll get it too.

2096
02:05:45,217 --> 02:05:47,133
The miracle's going to happen.

2097
02:05:47,134 --> 02:05:49,091
You'll get it... You'll get it.

2098
02:05:49,092 --> 02:05:51,258
You'll get it...

2099
02:05:51,259 --> 02:05:52,883
Someday we'll all get it.

2100
02:05:52,884 --> 02:05:54,717
Be patient my friend.
