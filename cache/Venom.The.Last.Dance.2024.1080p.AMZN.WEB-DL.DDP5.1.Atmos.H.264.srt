1
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,355
I am Knull.

2
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,224
God of the void.

3
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,861
Slicer of worlds.

4
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:04,899
<i>Long ago,</i>
<i>when light invaded my kingdom,</i>

5
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:08,870
<i>my symbiote children</i>
<i>betrayed me</i>

6
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:12,205
<i>and imprisoned me here.</i>

7
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:19,379
At last,
a codex has been created.

8
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:22,650
It is the key to my freedom.

9
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:25,887
It will unlock this prison.

10
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,655
I order you

11
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,324
to search the corners
of the universe

12
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,528
until you find this key.

13
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,898
Find me the codex.

14
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,540
And when I escape

15
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,909
and annihilate
every living planet

16
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:52,080
and destroy
my symbiote offspring,

17
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:56,651
I will reward you
with your lives.

18
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,755
<i>So you're saying</i>

19
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,758
<i>in this universe,</i>
<i>there's these superhero people.</i>

20
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,593
All right.

21
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,796
So tell me again
about your purple alien friend

22
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,699
who really loves stones.

23
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,134
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,

24
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:48,301
aliens,

25
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,337
they do not love stones.

26
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,806
<i>-Eddie, don't start.</i>
-No, no.

27
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,975
They do not love stones.

28
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,011
Do you know what they love?

29
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,013
They love eating brains!

30
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,516
Because that's what they do.

31
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,986
Senor, he made
my family disappear.

32
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,654
For five years.

33
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,523
Mm.

34
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,190
Well, five years, huh?

35
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,627
<i>Sí.</i>

36
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,327
Well, that is a long time.

37
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:16,964
All right.

38
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:18,066
<i>Eddie!</i>

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,068
<i>We are drunk.</i>

40
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,816
<i>We're home!</i>

41
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,919
<i>I'm so done with</i>
<i>the multiverse shit.</i>

42
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,987
<i>And I like our version</i>
<i>of the barman better.</i>

43
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,388
Ow.

44
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,590
My head hurts.

45
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,092
I feel like I'm drunk

46
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,561
but I'm also hungover
at the same time.

47
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:47,662
<i>Eddie!</i>

48
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,396
<i>You want a Bloody María.</i>

49
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,497
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

50
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:56,070
-No.
-I don't want a drink.

51
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,473
<i>Ay, Dios mío.</i>

52
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,210
Stop! You are destroying
this man's bar.

53
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,784
<i>Tequila!</i>

54
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,385
<i>I'm having the time</i>
<i>of my life, Eddie!</i>

55
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,255
I'd rather have
a glass of water.

56
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,958
<i>Be a man, Eddie!</i>

57
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,962
<i>We should've been a bartender.</i>

58
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,033
<i>Tequila!</i>

59
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,102
-I did it.
<i>-I did it.</i>

60
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:29,302
<i>Senor?</i>

61
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:33,273
What the hell
were those things?

62
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,408
I was born with them.

63
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,214
Freaking bar.
I'm done with this shit.

64
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:43,918
<i>This is Keli Reule</i>

65
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,753
<i>reporting from San Francisco.</i>

66
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,956
<i>Police are still trying</i>
<i>to locate former reporter</i>

67
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,092
<i>-Eddie Brock for questioning...</i>
-Oh, no.

68
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:54,128
<i>...after the tragic death</i>
<i>of Detective Patrick Mulligan.</i>

69
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:55,530
No.

70
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,532
<i>Detective Mulligan</i>
<i>was found impaled</i>

71
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:00,168
<i>amidst a series</i>
<i>of bizarre happenings</i>

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,669
<i>at the city's cathedral.</i>

73
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,370
They think that I killed him.

74
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,606
<i>How long can</i>
<i>he evade authorities?</i>

75
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,008
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

76
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,409
<i>If we are on the news here,</i>

77
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:12,180
<i>we are on the news everywhere.</i>

78
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,750
Well, we can't go back
to San Francisco.

79
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,084
And I'm not staying down here,

80
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:18,920
hiding for the rest
of my life in Mexico.

81
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,087
That's for sure.

82
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,289
<i>Where will we go?</i>

83
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,456
I don't know. I-I don't know.

84
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,563
Ooh.

85
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,498
That could work. Hey.

86
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,734
This judge got me
kicked out of New York.

87
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,169
<i>-What a dick!</i>
-Yeah.

88
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:37,337
I still got
a ton of shit on him, too.

89
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,875
<i>I've always wanted</i>
<i>to see the Statue of Liberty.</i>

90
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,710
Maybe we could blackmail him...

91
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:45,546
and clear my name.

92
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,447
<i>Let's go!</i>

93
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,150
<i>Road trip!</i>

94
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,785
Let's get the hell out of here.

95
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,486
<i>Keep the change!</i>

96
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,829
We keep our heads down,
and we keep moving.

97
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,901
<i>We are fugitives.</i>

98
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,436
<i>We are on the run.</i>

99
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,173
<i>Yes, we are innocent, yes,</i>

100
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:16,476
<i>but I will eat every bad guy</i>
<i>that gets in our way.</i>

101
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:17,979
I need a Tylenol.

102
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,760
Do you hear that?

103
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,262
<i>Hmm.</i>

104
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,240
<i>Someone's in trouble.</i>

105
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,376
<i>And I need fuel for the road.</i>

106
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,510
Yeah, okay.

107
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,400
<i>That way.</i>

108
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,278
<i>Bad men, Eddie.</i>

109
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:29,116
<i>Are we the Lethal Protector</i>
<i>or not?</i>

110
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,288
Do your thing.

111
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:35,690
<i>Easy-peasy.</i>

112
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,507
Jesus.

113
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,450
<i>Cute!</i>

114
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,051
<i>I promise not to eat it.</i>

115
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:08,122
They're fighting dogs.

116
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,025
<i>I draw the line</i>
<i>at fighting dogs, pal.</i>

117
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:17,832
<i>Qué haces aquí, pendejo?</i>

118
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,500
<i>Oye, vato.</i>
You're in the wrong place.

119
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:22,970
Oh, hello.

120
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:24,638
This is our territory.

121
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,508
Well, I assume

122
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,644
by the threatening look
on your faces that I, uh...

123
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,246
I ought to be scared, right?

124
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,051
<i>Pues</i> you took the wrong path,
<i>hermano.</i>

125
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,387
We can't let you leave.

126
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:42,590
I have a headache,

127
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,860
on account of the fact
that I was drinking a lot.

128
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,261
I'm gonna be honest.

129
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:50,865
I have a really dark
and unpredictable side to me.

130
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,534
We all have monsters
inside us.

131
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,336
Not like this.

132
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,938
So dark that it is
highly likely

133
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:02,410
to tear your head off
and feed it to your asshole.

134
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,512
<i>Or me!</i>

135
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:04,578
You can feed it to me.

136
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:05,980
Yeah, or I can feed it to him.

137
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,548
Yeah.

138
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,483
All right, look. Whoa, whoa.
Come on. I got a suggestion.

139
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,852
-No. Stop speaking.
-I'm not gonna stop speaking.

140
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,054
This is for you.

141
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,389
I'm doing this
for your benefit, all right?

142
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:17,892
I don't have to, okay?
So pay attention.

143
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,061
We're gonna find all of these
dogs loving forever homes

144
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:21,228
because what you're doing

145
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:22,531
is reprehensible.

146
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,399
And what does your mother
think of you, man?

147
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:26,700
My mother's dead, culero.

148
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,370
<i>You made it awkward.</i>

149
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:31,005
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-<i>Calla!</i>

150
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:32,740
<i>Ah?</i>

151
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,975
<i>Parto la madre.</i>

152
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:37,546
<i>Ah?</i>

153
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,280
<i>Entiendes?</i>

154
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,449
-I'm giving you a chance.
-Ah.

155
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,584
Sweetie, I-I really am
giving you a chance.

156
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,152
You should probably take it.

157
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,956
<i>-Sí?</i>
<i>-Sí.</i>

158
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,925
<i>Quién?</i>

159
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,161
<i>-Say when.</i>
-When.

160
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,140
<i>Hola</i> , bitches.

161
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,000
Who's a bad boy?

162
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,109
<i>Now, that's</i>
<i>some sturdy footwear.</i>

163
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,347
Where you going?

164
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,183
Home.

165
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,351
Nah.

166
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:02,163
What... are you?

167
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:07,434
-We are...
-We're Venom!

168
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:09,937
-We are...
-Venom!

169
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,372
-No.
-Oh.

170
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:16,277
-Yeah, we... are Venom.
-We are Venom.

171
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,179
What?

172
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,682
We're totally
gonna need to work on that.

173
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:33,127
<i>Mm, mm! That was delicious!</i>

174
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,029
You're welcome.

175
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,497
Thank you.

176
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:39,233
<i>You take me</i>
<i>to all the finest places.</i>

177
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,068
Let's get the hell
out of here.

178
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:42,403
Where's my shoe?

179
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:44,905
Oh, hey, buddy.

180
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,040
That's my shoe.
That's my shoe.

181
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,107
That's my shoe.

182
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,776
Give me my shoe.

183
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,251
<i>These will fit.</i>

184
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,253
Now we are on the run.

185
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,288
For something
we actually did do.

186
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:03,625
And I got stuck with
a superhero who can't fly.

187
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:04,959
<i>Want to bet?</i>

188
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,186
There you are.

189
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:37,091
Get me General Strickland.

190
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,413
What the...

191
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:07,921
Viral shedding.

192
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:10,291
These things want to live.

193
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,931
<i>-Hola.</i>
<i>-Hola.</i>

194
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,169
Tell me about the man
who was just here.

195
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,977
He was acting, like, crazy,
talking to himself.

196
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,080
What was he saying?

197
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:38,352
He-he had these big,
massive, wild arms.

198
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,953
They were bobbling like this.

199
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,457
Bring him.

200
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,011
<i>You think there are another</i>

201
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,714
<i>brother and sister</i>
<i>on one of those stars...</i>

202
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,415
...looking at the same sky?

203
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,018
I'll be able to tell you
one day.

204
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:16,524
My twin brother,

205
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:18,560
a future NASA scientist.

206
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,028
One day.

207
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,000
When thunder roars,
head indoors.

208
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:45,720
No!

209
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,420
He's on life support.

210
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:21,255
Get him to
emergency symbiosis now.

211
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:37,605
It should be you.

212
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,874
<i>This</i>
<i>just came across our news desk</i>

213

214

<i>For all you alien enthusiasts</i>

<i>the decommissioning of Area 51.</i>

217
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,518
<i>The controversial site</i>

<i>Strickland authorized.</i>

222
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:45,138
It's finally happening, then.

223
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,941
Yeah.

224
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,342
Yes, ma'am.

225
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,143
Be nothing left
but rock and dust.

226
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,746
And roaches.

227
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,681
Even the biggest of bangs
couldn't kill 'em.

228
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:56,885
They've been around
280 million years and counting.

229
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,853
I did not know that, Dr. Paine.

230
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,227
Good to go.

231
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,329
-Have a good one, Gus.
-You, too.

232
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:45,165
-Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

233
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,835
Dr. Kendall,
report to trans bay three.

234
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:50,404
Dr. Kendall, report to
transportation bay three.

235
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,640
Morning, Dr. Paine.
We'll keep 'em safe for you.

236
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:55,275
I still don't think anyone
wants my old beater, Jim.

237
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,077
Never judge a book
by its cover.

238
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,613
Reminder:

239
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:01,281
This facility is now under
heightened security protocol.

240
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,251
Early morning wake-up,
General Strickland.

241
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,153
Looks like all your dreams
came true.

242
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,556
I know how that must bug you.

243
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,092
He arrived
shortly before you did.

244
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,928
Did our new friend
give him any trouble?

245
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:15,597
You see,
that's exactly the problem.

246
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,764
What?

247
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,498
Your assumption
we're meeting friends.

248
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,234
Morning.

249
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,904
Good morning.

250
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:24,706
The bonding was successful.

251
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,974
I heard.

252
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:32,145
You always have
this look on your face

253
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,615
like something terrible
is imminent.

254
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:34,949
Because in my line of work,

255
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,951
something terrible
is always imminent.

256
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:39,954
We contain them,
you study them.

257
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:41,254
It's how it works.

258
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,664
Let's have a look.

259
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:51,431
-Hello, Doctor.
-Morning.

260
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:53,467
His other symbiote
left him for dead.

261
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:56,804
<i>We saved him.</i>

262
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,840
He would have died.

263
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,511
Oh, try lowering those levels.

264
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,686
Morning, Sadie.

265
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,186
Let me get that.

266
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,689
We got this down in Mexico.

267
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:17,290
Hi. Welcome.

268
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,861
Any more on where
the rest of him is?

269
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,396
-We're getting there.
-Update me as you have it.

270
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,366
I don't get this obsession.

271
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,703
I told you--
my mom made me this pin.

272
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,872
It's July.

273
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,607
-I'll see you in there.
-Mm-hmm.

274
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:38,112
Everyone on this side is weird.

275
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,814
Leave her alone, Rex.

276
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,884
God forbid anyone should
actually enjoy their work.

277
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:58,933
Area 51 will be
fully decommissioned

278
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,168
by the end of the week.

279
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,703
It's just a shipwreck anyway,

280
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:03,738
and they're tired
of the tourists.

281
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,174
But we don't exist down here.

282
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,608
A hundred feet subsurface,

283
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:10,778
undetectable to any human...

284
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:12,412
or nonhuman.

285
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:14,882
No one's phoning home
from here.

286
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:16,584
My brother's greatest ambition

287
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:20,320
was to work up there at 51
doing what I do.

288
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:22,757
I wish I could've shown him
what we've built down here.

289
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,428
You're okay.

290
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:32,767
Just... try to breathe.

291
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,869
Okay?

292
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,171
When my brother and I
were kids, they told us

293
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,941
that UFOs were just
weather balloons, space trash.

294
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:43,276
Kubrick directed the moon
landing in a Hollywood studio.

295
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:45,412
Cool story.

296
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:47,548
Where are you going?
This first.

297
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:49,416
Is there an increased risk
of exposure?

298
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,385
It's not us I'm worried about.

299
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,421
You know we carry all kinds
of viruses and bacteria

300
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,758
that could be harmful
to a sensitive life-form.

301
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:58,860
And we don't know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

302
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,796
As long as we're keeping
the guests safe.

303
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,402
This is
the first time we've had

304
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,404
a host compatible
with one of our symbiotes.

305
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,640
And now we'll be able

306
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:13,941
to talk to one.

307
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,245
<i>Monsters.</i>

308
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:35,563
He's been experiencing panic
surges since we bonded him.

309
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:37,265
You try "Jingle Bells"?

310
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,465
So soothing.

311
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,735
Wow.
Why didn't I think of that?

312
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,105
Release him.

313
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:49,811
<i>Monsters.</i>

314
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:54,314
I'm Dr. Paine.

315
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:55,783
Teddy.

316
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,518
You're safe here.

317
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm gonna help you.

318
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:01,454
Both of you.

319
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,958
Monsters.

320
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,827
The transfer was successful.

321
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:08,062
We had no choice.

322
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:09,864
<i>We had to try and save you.</i>

323
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,706
<i>Monsters.</i>

324
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:28,049
<i>You're broken, too.</i>

325
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,025
May I...

326
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:43,798
May I ask you some questions?

327
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:51,205
Is the symbiote
communicating with you?

328
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,243
Do you hear it?

329
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:00,214
Sound distresses them.

330
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:03,985
Okay.

331
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,556
Why are they here?

332
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:09,624
What do they want?

333
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:12,593
<i>-Safe haven.</i>
-Safe haven?

334
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:14,362
<i>We were running.</i>

335
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,530
Is he talking about
the other symbiotes?

336
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:18,132
I think so.

337
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:22,435
<i>His creatures</i>
<i>search the universe for us.</i>

338
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,972
<i>But we will be found.</i>

339
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:30,544
<i>And when we are,</i>
<i>he will kill us all.</i>

340
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,648
Who?

341
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:36,050
<i>There will be nothing left.</i>

342
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,552
Here? On Earth?

343
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:43,391
Why were they running?

344
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,628
<i>Because there is a dark,</i>

345
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:51,032
<i>cold sea</i>

346
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:53,367
<i>around this universe.</i>

347
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,936
What is it?

348
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,879
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

349
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:16,958
<i>I've s-seen the f-future.</i>

350
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:38,079
<i>The darkness...</i>

351
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:42,482
<i>has teeth.</i>

352
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:48,823
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

353
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:52,860
<i>We are currently cruising</i>
<i>at a comfortable 31,000 feet.</i>

354
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:55,363
<i>If you look out there</i>
<i>to your left just now,</i>

355
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,132
<i>you'll see the Grand Canyon.</i>

356
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,435
<i>Told you we could fly.</i>

357
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:02,937
Oh, my God!

358
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,271
<i>Direct to New York.</i>

359
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:06,173
My mouth is so dry!

360
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:07,808
<i>And we clear your name.</i>

361
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:10,177
It's so unpleasantly cold!

362
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:13,547
How does Tom Cruise do this?

363
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,816
<i>He doesn't whine</i>
<i>like a little bitch!</i>

364
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:28,929
What was that?

365
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:33,034
What is that?

366
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:35,269
<i>Oh, fu...!</i>

367
00:25:58,527 --> 00:26:00,594
I'm sorry, Eddie,
but I got to disappear.

368
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,263
-What, now?
<i>-We're in deep shit.</i>

369
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,069
Why did you do that?

370
00:26:08,202 --> 00:26:09,703
<i>I will explain.</i>

371
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,440
No! No!

372
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,978
No! No!

373
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,718
Oh, I'm gonna go ahead and say

374
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:27,721
that this is the shittest
hangover of all time.

375
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,957
<i>Look at it, Eddie.</i>

376
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:32,460
<i>Isn't it just astonishing?</i>

377
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,295
Oh, shut up.

378
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:35,596
<i>I don't think I mind</i>

379
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,064
<i>living here forever.</i>

380
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,567
We just came face-to-face

381
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,468
with a literal death machine.

382
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,571
Forever seems
pretty optimistic.

383
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:51,546
<i>With the</i>
<i>decommissioning of Area 51,</i>

384
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,548
<i>will the Pentagon</i>
<i>finally admit</i>

385
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:54,849
<i>that they've been</i>
<i>holding UAPs?</i>

386
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:57,818
That's "unidentified
aerial phenomena" to you.

387
00:26:57,952 --> 00:26:59,386
Yeah, Dad, we know.

388
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:02,123
What I wouldn't give to see
who built one of those things.

389
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:03,491
That's why we cashed in
our savings

390
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:04,892
and came on
this road trip, babe.

391
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:05,993
Hmm?

392
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:07,828
So you could finally
get to see...

393
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:09,063
That it's bullshit?

394
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,498
Yeah, well, what if I'm right?

395
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:11,966
Then I really hope
we don't end up

396
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,301
in an alien space lab
with probes up our asses.

397
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,337
Or dead.

398
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,439
"Asses."

399
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,343
Whoa.

400
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:23,545
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

401
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,547
Whoa-ho!

402
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,183
Kicked up some gravel there.

403
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,185
-Hang tight, family.
-You good?

404
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,187
That was wild.

405
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,855
-Did the dog vomit?
-Yeah.

406
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:49,370
<i>Okay</i>

407
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:50,771
<i>We've got this.</i>

408
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:53,274
<i>Soft landing. Bend your knees.</i>

409
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:55,442
<i>Engage your core.</i>
<i>Engage your core!</i>

410
00:27:55,577 --> 00:27:57,612
-Whoa, whoa.
<i>-Yes! Yes, that's it.</i>

411
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,847
<i>Yes. That's it!</i>

412
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:04,018
-Whoa.
<i>-Well done.</i>

413
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:05,786
That was terrifying.

414
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,323
Uh, this is not New York.

415
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:10,824
No, this is a wasteland.

416
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,960
<i>I'm detecting</i>
<i>passive aggression.</i>

417
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:14,228
-Are you?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

418
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,665
Oh, I'm sorry. How about
some active aggression?

419
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:19,668
-You just threw me off a 757...
<i>-Mm.</i>

420
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,102
<i>...without even</i>
<i>the slightest consideration</i>

421
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:23,737
for my chronic vertigo.

422
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:25,574
<i>It was an Airbus A320.</i>

423
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,074
Was it? I am sorry.

424
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,275
All right.

425
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,178
And what was that thing--

426
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:33,113
that thing that we just
juiced back there?

427
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:34,616
<i>You're not going to like this.</i>

428
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:37,552
No, I can absolutely guarantee
you that I'm not gonna.

429
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:41,155
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

430
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:42,356
That's, uh...
You're being weird.

431
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:43,424
That's creepy.

432
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:45,192
That was a Xenophage.

433
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:47,861
-A what?
-A Xenophage.

434
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:50,030
-A symbiote hunter.
-Of course.

435
00:28:50,164 --> 00:28:52,701
<i>Problem is,</i>
<i>if she has found her way here,</i>

436
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,501
others will soon follow.

437
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:55,836
Others?

438
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,106
The Xenophage's maker
also created us symbiotes.

439
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,175
So that's your sister.

440
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:02,910
All the symbiotes
turned on him,

441
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,512
locked him up on Klyntar.

442
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:05,714
Your planet.

443
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:07,448
-No, not a planet.
-Not your planet.

444
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,517
A prison we built
for him to sleep...

445
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:11,452
-Of course.
-...for eternity!

446
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:13,220
What's his name, then?

447
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:16,457
I didn't hear a word you said.

448
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:17,958
-Knull.
-Knull.

449
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:20,461
No!

450
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:25,399
This is serious, Eddie.

451
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:27,901
Let's just not talk.

452
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:30,271
Quiet.

453
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:36,910
What does this
"Xyla-Xyn" thingy,

454
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:39,346
this symbiote hunter,
want with you anyway?

455
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,981
It doesn't. It wants us.

456
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:42,283
We have something it needs.

457
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:45,286
We only have this shitty shirt.

458
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,756
We got one boot and sunburn.

459
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,356
And the codex.

460
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,725
The what, now?

461
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:52,126
I'll show you.

462
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,962
Damn it, what are you doing?

463
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,464
<i>Let's say you died.</i>

464
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,932
<i>I could bring you back to life.</i>

465
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:00,334
<i>Well, I like that.</i>

466
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,936
<i>But if I did,</i>
<i>our separate life forces</i>

467
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,774
<i>would become one single force</i>

468
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:08,075
<i>called a codex.</i>

469
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,744
<i>What the hell is a codex?</i>

470
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:11,078
<i>It's a key.</i>

471
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:14,248
<i>A key that unlocks a cage.</i>

472
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:15,949
<i>The prison on Klyntar.</i>

473
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,951
<i>It would free our creator.</i>

474
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:19,521
Well, thank God
we haven't died.

475
00:30:19,654 --> 00:30:21,322
<i>Yeah, except that one time.</i>

476
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,193
<i>Oh, no. No.</i>

477
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:28,295
<i>So you're telling me</i>
<i>we're carrying this thing.</i>

478
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:30,297
<i>That's why</i>
<i>the Xenophage is hunting us.</i>

479
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,534
<i>What do we do?</i>

480
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:34,234
<i>She can only see the codex</i>

481
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:37,037
<i>when a symbiote is in</i>
<i>its full true form.</i>

482
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,543
Right.

483
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:42,876
You mean you can't come out?

484
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,346
I can do this. I can do this.

485
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,582
But if I fully transform,

486
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:50,217
the codex sends her
a tracking signal.

487
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:53,187
She'll find us,
rip it out of our spine

488
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,155
and free Knull from Klyntar.

489
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:56,691
So how do we get rid
of this codex?

490
00:30:56,825 --> 00:31:01,563
As long as you and I both live,
the codex exists.

491
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:03,063
If one of us should die...

492
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:04,632
-No.
-...the codex would die.

493
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,735
-That's not gonna work for me.
-Nor me.

494
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:09,336
That Xenophage was fast.

495
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,338
It won't take long
for the Feds to tie us

496
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:13,974
to those four headless bodies
we left in Mexico.

497
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:16,210
-We got to get out of here.
-Yeah, we better go.

498
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,049
Ah.

499
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:24,184
<i>Four legs are better than one.</i>

500
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:26,954
Be honest with me, buddy.

501
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:30,090
How fast do you think
you can get that thing to go

502
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,392
without killing it?

503
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:32,926

for a safe haven.

525
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:50,304
How about a new home,
evict the current tenants?

526
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:53,675
I think you've watched too many
alien invasion movies, Rex.

527
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:57,612
Have I?

528
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:06,253
They were running.
That's what he said.

Don't kid yourself.

530
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:09,791
They were always migrating.

531

<i>A meteor carrying symbiote life</i>

00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,505
Let's go get 'em.

536
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:26,340
You're so desperate to believe

537
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:28,375
that they're here
for altruistic reasons.

538
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:31,144
Makes you dangerous.

539
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,223
We just intercepted
an emergency call

540
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:44,559
from an Airbus out of Mexico

541
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:46,661
saying a man jumped
off the plane over Sequoia.

542
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:49,162
We'll take the Osprey.

543
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:51,265
Eyes wide, Paine.

544
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:03,143
I can't feel my balls.

545
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:07,982
That... that was horrible.

546
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:25,399
Visual on suspect.

547
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:29,571
Take him out.

548
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:30,772
Collect the symbiote.

549
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:33,808
<i>Team Six engaged.</i>

<i>Disengage harness. Let's go.</i>

551
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:23,785
-No! The codex!
-Can't let you die.

552
00:36:43,403 --> 00:36:44,772
Where did that come from?

553
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:00,420
-Morph!
-Copy.

554
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,530
<i>-Time to go.</i>
-Hell yeah.

555
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,237
What happened?

556
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,638
<i>There's something else</i>
<i>out here.</i>

557
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:51,873
Something else?

558
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:52,807
<i>He said this would happen.</i>

559
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,575
I just lost three people.

560
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:56,309
Can you collect any samples?

561
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:59,113
Samples?

562
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,903
Those were not Feds.

563
00:38:22,036 --> 00:38:24,105
Those were some
Special Forces shit.

564
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:25,606
They were trying to kill us.

565
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,242
Yeah. Yeah, great. Great.

566
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:31,478
So now we have the cops,
the United States Army

567
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:35,183
and some creature from hell
hunting us.

568
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:38,119
Oh, God,
I just saw blood mist

569
00:38:38,252 --> 00:38:41,388
spray out of the back
of an alien's face.

570
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:52,900
I killed someone.

571
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:55,203
<i>They didn't give you a choice.</i>

572
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:57,972
You didn't give me a choice.

573
00:38:58,105 --> 00:39:00,241
<i>-I couldn't get to you.</i>
-Not in the rapids.

574
00:39:00,373 --> 00:39:02,342
A year ago
when you stole my life.

575
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,312
<i>We've been together</i>
<i>for a whole year?</i>

576
00:39:04,444 --> 00:39:05,680
A year too long.

577
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:07,181
Just stay hidden
while we get to New York

578
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:08,583
without getting killed.

579
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:21,729
We need you to come out.

580
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:28,468
The thing you talked about,
the creature...

581
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:29,837
it's here.

582
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:34,374
It killed some people.

583
00:39:57,665 --> 00:39:59,399
Wow.

584
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,871
He's so beautiful.

585
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,127
<i>I sense...</i>

586
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:30,398
<i>I sense my own.</i>

587
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:41,242
<i>And yet, the one Knull seeks</i>

588
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,144
<i>is not here.</i>

589
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,481
What does he seek?

590
00:40:52,386 --> 00:40:54,121
<i>The black one.</i>

591
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:56,023
Brock's symbiote?

592
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:59,527
<i>He's the only one</i>
<i>who carries a codex.</i>

593
00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:05,099
<i>The end is Knull.</i>

594
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:14,875
You need your suit.

595
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:18,112
Still worried about
giving this thing a cold?

596
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:21,449
<i>Venom carries the key</i>
<i>to Knull's freedom.</i>

597
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:23,951
<i>He must never obtain it.</i>

598
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:25,619
Or your race will be killed.

599
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:28,155
<i>You.</i>

600
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:31,459
<i>And you.</i>

601
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,694

<i>Everyone, everything.</i>

604
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:42,970
How do we stop whatever's
up there from coming down here?

605
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:44,805
<i>You can't.</i>

606
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,509
<i>He's older than the universe.</i>

607
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,978
<i>He needs the key.</i>

608
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:56,317
<i>Then everything will end.</i>

609
00:41:59,653 --> 00:42:01,856
How do we stop him
from getting it?

610
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:06,927
<i>If the symbiote</i>
<i>and the host are alive,</i>

612
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:13,734
And if one of them dies?

613
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:15,236
<i>The codex dies.</i>

614
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:18,205
<i>The codex dies.</i>

615
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:22,710
-Rex, you can't be serious.
-Oh, I'm game.

616
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:24,311
Destroying the codex
is the only way

617
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:26,247
it remains unobtainable, right?

618
00:42:27,882 --> 00:42:29,016
Hey, buddy,
I'm talking to you.

619
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,351
Destroying it?

620
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:32,153
We have barely even
scratched the surface.

My people are dead.

622

Oh, that would be so good.

969
00:59:48,856 --> 00:59:51,892
And room service.

970
00:59:52,026 --> 00:59:53,894
Yes!

971
01:00:03,871 --> 01:00:04,905
We got him.

972
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,107
Positive I.D. on Brock.

973
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,577
CCTV hit, the Paris Hotel.

974
01:00:08,709 --> 01:00:09,910
Vegas.

975
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:11,212
Have we reconstituted the Six?

976
01:00:11,345 --> 01:00:12,547
Yes, sir.

977
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,281
Put 'em in.

978
01:00:28,563 --> 01:00:30,664
The Six are en route.

979
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:33,300
They'll bring him in.

980
01:00:33,434 --> 01:00:35,169
At this time,
I'm requesting control

981
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:37,471
of the Imperium Program.

982
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:41,876
You have my permission,
General.

983
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:53,854
<i>When thunder roars,</i>

984
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:55,656
<i>head indoors.</i>

985
01:01:14,275 --> 01:01:15,644
Let's dance, baby.

986
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:17,811
-No. No. N-No.
<i>-Yeah! I love dancing!</i>

987
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:20,814
Are you crazy?
That thing will find us.

988
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:21,982
Don't be a party pooper.

989
01:01:22,116 --> 01:01:24,818
No. Do... do not encourage him.

990
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:26,787
You know what, Mrs. Chen,
we are fugitives.

991
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:29,123
We are on the run,
so thank you for having us.

992
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:30,391
Um, we got to go.

993
01:01:30,525 --> 01:01:32,026
<i>You're no fun!</i>

994
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:34,995
-One last dance before you go.
<i>-We never do anything</i>

995
01:01:35,129 --> 01:01:36,230
<i>-I want to do.</i>
-What?

996
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:38,065
Just a little dance.

997
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:41,502
<i>And you gave away my chickens.</i>

998
01:01:43,672 --> 01:01:44,738
Yeah!

999
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:53,180
Let's cut a rug, Mrs. Chen.

1000
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:55,015
<i>I give up.</i>

1001
01:02:04,693 --> 01:02:06,860

01:03:03,652 --> 01:03:05,654
Wow. So ugly!

1021
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:09,056
Stay very calm.

1022
01:03:09,189 --> 01:03:11,091
She can't see the thing
she's looking for.

1023
01:03:30,311 --> 01:03:31,278
Target acquired.

1024
01:03:31,412 --> 01:03:33,180
-You leave Eddie alone!
-Silence!

1025
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:36,518
My shoes.

1026
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:38,653
Go. Move out, move out!

1027
01:04:05,513 --> 01:04:07,147
Wow.

1028
01:04:10,652 --> 01:04:12,152
Area 51.

1029
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:13,987
-Yeah.
-Huh?

1030
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:15,724
Yeah.

1031
01:04:16,924 --> 01:04:18,626
We made it.

1032
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:23,997
You finally got to see it, Dad.

1033
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:26,634
It's kind of cool...

1034
01:04:26,768 --> 01:04:28,670
I guess.

1035
01:04:28,803 --> 01:04:30,037
Yeah.

1036
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,809
Leaf.

1037
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:37,044
Where you going, hon?

1038
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:40,381
Well, let's see if we can't
find us something cooler.

1039
01:04:40,515 --> 01:04:42,383
Come on. Come on, guys.

1040
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:44,385
Okay, babe. Lifelong dream.

1041
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:47,121
All right. Go, go, go, go, go!

1042
01:04:47,254 --> 01:04:48,889
I smell alien.

1043
01:04:55,095 --> 01:04:57,898
He's deteriorating
without his host.

1044
01:04:58,031 --> 01:05:00,134
Poor thing.

1045
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:02,202
Put him below with the others.

1046
01:05:02,336 --> 01:05:03,937
Safer there.

1047
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,240
Down, down.

1048
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:42,142
Come on, come on.

1049
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:51,586
All right.

1050
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,320
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1051
01:05:54,923 --> 01:05:57,625
I think we're gonna get
a better view from up there.

1052
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:01,328
Follow me, guys. Come on.

1053
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:03,330
This is so exciting.

1054
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:05,466
I can't believe we're here.

1055
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:19,914
Wow.

1056
01:06:23,116 --> 01:06:25,285
Whoa.

1057
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:26,855
Oh, wow.

1058
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:29,924
What is this?

1059
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:42,469
It's all broken.

1060
01:06:43,872 --> 01:06:45,239
So sad.

1061
01:06:57,886 --> 01:06:59,186
Buddy?

1062
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,856
Hey, buddy?

1063
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,159
Oh, no.

1064
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:09,731
No.

1065
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:15,870
Oh, my God, how many hangovers
can you have in one day?

1066
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:19,206
<i>Eddie?</i>

1067
01:07:23,878 --> 01:07:25,245
Hello?

1068
01:07:27,682 --> 01:07:29,984
<i>They did this to me.</i>

1069
01:07:31,886 --> 01:07:33,086
<i>Mulligan?</i>

1070
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:36,490
<i>-Why?</i>
<i>-You're alive?</i>

1071
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:39,527
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1072
01:07:41,696 --> 01:07:43,397
<i>We're being hunted, Eddie.</i>

1073
01:07:43,531 --> 01:07:45,700
<i>You have what he needs.</i>

1074
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:51,973
Protect the codex
from dark hands.

1075
01:07:52,105 --> 01:07:56,376
<i>A symbiote army waits here.</i>

1076
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:58,980
<i>Free them.</i>

1077
01:07:59,112 --> 01:08:01,415
<i>Protect it, Eddie.</i>

1078
01:08:01,549 --> 01:08:07,154
Knull must stay locked away.

1079
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:13,327
Eddie, I'm Dr. Paine.

1080
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:16,965
<i>Where's my friend?</i>

1081
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:18,198
<i>He's safe for now.</i>

1082
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:20,868
Great news.

1083
01:08:21,002 --> 01:08:22,070
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1084
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:23,170
We're all done here.

1085
01:08:23,303 --> 01:08:25,272
All of this
is out of your hands.

1086
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:26,574
This is my lab.

1087
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:27,909
No, no, not yours.

1088
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:29,811
You just work here--
or you did.

1089
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:31,913
You, Christmas,
you're going home.

1090
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:33,313
And what about them?

1091
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:35,083
-You heard what it said.
-Hands up.

1092
01:08:35,215 --> 01:08:36,951
The codex only exists
if they're both alive.

1093
01:08:37,085 --> 01:08:38,485
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

1094
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:40,655
You killed one of my people.

1095
01:08:40,788 --> 01:08:42,090
I'm returning the favor
personally.

1096
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:43,558
Please escort Dr. Paine
out of here.

1097
01:08:43,691 --> 01:08:44,626
-No.
-Don't move!

1098
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:46,293
Christmas, time to go.

1099
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:48,328
Hey.

1100
01:08:56,804 --> 01:08:58,372
Big mistake.

1101
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:05,947
Fire!

1102
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,515
-Run!
-Oh, my...

1103
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:12,854
-Oh, my God!
-Fall back, fall back!

1104
01:09:19,661 --> 01:09:22,096
Venom, run. Go!

1105
01:09:29,236 --> 01:09:30,705
Let's go! Move!

1106
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:32,974
Clear! Clear!

1107
01:09:34,809 --> 01:09:36,376
Release the symbiotes!

1108
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:37,645
Go! Go!

1109
01:09:45,987 --> 01:09:47,655
-Come on.
-Go! Go!

1110
01:10:00,168 --> 01:10:01,334
Hurry up! Move!

1111
01:10:01,836 --> 01:10:03,203
Get back!

1112
01:10:03,336 --> 01:10:05,106
Jim!

1113
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:12,747
Bring her down!

1114
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,082
Get back!

1115
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:20,822
Let's go.

1116
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:22,156
Take her down.

1117
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:55,823
Come on!

1118
01:11:03,064 --> 01:11:06,100
Get the codex out of here.

1119
01:11:10,705 --> 01:11:11,672
Go, go, go!

1120
01:11:11,806 --> 01:11:13,273
That's our way out.

1121
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:26,286
You, break us out of here!

1122
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:31,592
There's no aliens here, kids.

1123
01:11:31,726 --> 01:11:33,326
Mm.

1124
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:39,000
Best shoes ever!

1125
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:41,269
Whoa! What was that?

1126
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:45,973
Let's go!

1127
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:47,074
Okay.

1128
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:48,676
We got to go! Move it!

1129
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:52,113
Get these people out of here!

1130
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:57,350
We are leaving!

1131
01:11:57,484 --> 01:12:00,353
Move! Move, move!

1132
01:12:03,257 --> 01:12:04,992
It's all right.
It's all right, kids.

1133
01:12:10,698 --> 01:12:11,866
Aliens!

1134
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:13,500
Alien invasion!

1135
01:12:13,634 --> 01:12:15,837
Alien attack!

1136
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:26,047
Motherfucker!

1137
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:33,187
-You two, get airborne!
-Right away, sir!

1138
01:12:33,321 --> 01:12:34,487
On me!

1139
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:36,724
Hurry up!
Airborne! Move, move, move!

1140
01:12:36,858 --> 01:12:38,292
In the Hummers! Go!

1141
01:12:38,425 --> 01:12:40,460
We've got to get the
codex as far away as possible.

1142
01:12:42,997 --> 01:12:43,965
It's Eddie?

1143
01:12:44,098 --> 01:12:45,032
-It's Eddie.
-It's Eddie.

1144
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:46,366
-Eddie!
-Eddie?

1145
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:47,735
-Hey!
-Oh, no.

1146
01:12:47,869 --> 01:12:49,502
-Eddie! Eddie!
-Eddie!

1147
01:12:51,873 --> 01:12:54,041
Martin. And family.

1148
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,014
You can't be here, Martin.

1149
01:13:00,147 --> 01:13:01,883
Dark forces, man.

1150
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:21,736
Eddie, can you help us?

1151
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:24,639
I lied. Aliens are real.

1152
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:26,574
My best friend
in the whole world is one.

1153
01:13:26,707 --> 01:13:28,242
He's gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1154
01:13:28,376 --> 01:13:29,409
Okay.

1155
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:33,047
Don't-don't be scared.

1156
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:34,916
Hi.

1157
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,017
Wow.

1158
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,052
Pleasure to meet you.

1159
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:40,955
Thanks for the chocolate.

1160
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:42,757
You're welcome.

1161
01:13:58,506 --> 01:13:59,674
No!

1162
01:14:02,944 --> 01:14:05,012
-Mom! Dad!
-Whoa! Whoa!

1163
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:13,688
Dad!

1164
01:14:13,821 --> 01:14:15,289
-Hold on, kids!
-Look out!

1165
01:14:17,425 --> 01:14:19,260
Hold on, kids!

1166
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,666
Eddie!

1167
01:14:36,744 --> 01:14:38,846
He was trying to protect you.

1168
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:41,849
We are not the bad guys!

1169
01:14:45,286 --> 01:14:47,021
-Echo! Leaf.
-My baby, my baby.

1170
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:48,155
-Mom!
-Oh, my God.

1171
01:14:48,289 --> 01:14:50,524
-Thank you, Eddie.
-You're welcome.

1172
01:14:54,428 --> 01:14:55,830
You got to be kidding me.

1173
01:15:05,106 --> 01:15:06,640
Get in!

1174
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:09,977
Run!

1175
01:15:26,694 --> 01:15:28,829
Go. Bring me that codex.

1176
01:15:32,233 --> 01:15:34,468
What's that noise?

1177
01:15:34,602 --> 01:15:36,704
<i>She phoned home.</i>

1178
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:43,077
Oh, shit.

1179
01:16:05,266 --> 01:16:06,600
-Oh, God.
-Get down! Get down!

1180
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:07,868
Come on, you guys!
Get down here!

1181
01:16:08,002 --> 01:16:09,236
-Come on.
-Take cover! Take cover!

1182
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:10,571
-Dad! Dad!
-I got you.

1183
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:24,118
She saved us.

1184
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:26,387
There's only one thing
that's gonna distract them.

1185
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:27,788
-Copy.
-Okay.

1186
01:16:30,891 --> 01:16:32,726
-Get 'em back to their van!
-What?

1187
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:34,728
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

1188
01:16:36,897 --> 01:16:39,300
I'm gonna round them up.
Have the chopper follow me.

1189
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:43,604
Go, go, go! Go!

1190
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:59,487
Go!

1191
01:17:00,788 --> 01:17:02,156
He's leading them
to a kill box.

1192
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:04,258
When you get a lock,
vaporize 'em!

1193
01:17:28,617 --> 01:17:30,050
We're home. We're back.

1194
01:17:30,184 --> 01:17:31,218
Okay, okay, home.

1195
01:17:31,352 --> 01:17:33,454
-Run!
-Go, kids. Go. Come on.

1196
01:17:33,588 --> 01:17:35,389
Hurry. Hurry, honey.

1197
01:17:35,524 --> 01:17:36,558
Thank you.

1198
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:40,961
Aliens suck!

1199
01:18:03,552 --> 01:18:04,752
Light 'em up.

1200
01:18:04,885 --> 01:18:06,655
Copy that.

1201
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:19,733
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

1202
01:18:21,636 --> 01:18:24,305
No! No! No!

1203
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:25,739
Thompson down!

1204
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:27,808
<i>It's coming down! Go!</i>

1205
01:18:50,497 --> 01:18:51,700
Oh, sh...

1206
01:19:02,544 --> 01:19:04,011
Let's finish this.

1207
01:19:04,144 --> 01:19:06,847
With pleasure.

1208
01:19:11,952 --> 01:19:13,722
The chopper blades!

1209
01:19:35,276 --> 01:19:37,811
I got you.

1210
01:19:41,716 --> 01:19:42,983
Okay. It's okay.

1211
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:45,486
Get him somewhere safe.

1212
01:19:47,254 --> 01:19:48,255
Oh, God.

1213
01:20:12,747 --> 01:20:15,449
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1214
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,652
Okay. Okay.

1215
01:20:37,438 --> 01:20:39,440
No.

1216
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:42,811
Okay. Okay.

1217
01:20:46,581 --> 01:20:49,551
Still living
your brother's dream?

1218
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,858
Oh, my God.

1219
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:02,996
I'm coming.

1220
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:04,833
-I'm coming!
-Dad, come on!

1221
01:21:04,965 --> 01:21:07,234
-Dad, Dad, run! Come on!
-Dad!

1222
01:21:34,763 --> 01:21:36,430
I'm proud of you, Eddie.

1223
01:21:36,564 --> 01:21:38,298
You did it all yourself.

1224
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:41,435
Well, some of it.

1225
01:21:57,852 --> 01:22:00,421
I really would have liked
to have seen her.

1226
01:22:05,727 --> 01:22:06,828
Who?

1227
01:22:06,994 --> 01:22:08,897
Lady Liberty.

1228
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:11,599
Oh, yeah.

1229
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,902
Oh, yeah.

1230
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:16,738
Yeah, well, we're going.

1231
01:22:16,871 --> 01:22:20,307
We're gonna go
just as soon as we get...

1232
01:22:20,441 --> 01:22:22,209
out of here.

1233
01:22:23,545 --> 01:22:25,914
They're just
going to keep coming.

1234
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:28,048
We'll never leave
this place, friend.

1235
01:22:28,182 --> 01:22:30,284
Oh, God.

1236
01:22:39,861 --> 01:22:41,462
Okay, well, uh...

1237
01:22:44,064 --> 01:22:46,734
I thought we were gonna be
the Lethal Protector.

1238
01:22:50,538 --> 01:22:52,841
We are.

1239
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:54,909
That's what this is.

1240
01:23:05,252 --> 01:23:07,087
Yeah.

1241
01:23:31,846 --> 01:23:33,046
All right.

1242
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:39,052
All right.

1243
01:23:49,831 --> 01:23:51,566
Come and get us.

1244
01:24:55,597 --> 01:24:57,364
-Go.
-Huh?

1245
01:24:57,497 --> 01:24:58,866
Go.

1246
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,602
Go.

1247
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:08,241
Oh, my God.

1248
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:19,921
What are you doing?

1249
01:25:23,091 --> 01:25:25,125
I'll never forget you.

1250
01:25:28,763 --> 01:25:31,866
Don't forget me either, Eddie.

1251
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,166
No.

1252
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,669
Time to go.

1253
01:25:36,771 --> 01:25:38,305
Strickland.

1254
01:25:38,438 --> 01:25:40,440
Strickland authorized.

1255
01:25:41,676 --> 01:25:43,377
No.

1256
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:02,396
Strickland.

1257
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:04,032
Strickland authorized.

1258
01:26:17,377 --> 01:26:19,881
Huh? Huh?

1259
01:26:20,948 --> 01:26:22,315
Huh?

1260
01:26:26,386 --> 01:26:29,189
It's just bye for now.

1261
01:26:48,308 --> 01:26:52,513
No. No. No! No!

1262
01:27:27,548 --> 01:27:28,683
Go!

1263
01:27:56,409 --> 01:27:58,112
No, Eddie!

1264
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,683
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shh.

1265
01:28:51,398 --> 01:28:53,134
Nierika.

1266
01:29:17,925 --> 01:29:19,459
Hey, buddy.

1267
01:29:21,394 --> 01:29:23,363
I just had a crazy dream.

1268
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:31,639
Buddy?

1269
01:29:31,772 --> 01:29:33,741
He's not coming back.

1270
01:29:41,716 --> 01:29:43,885
But I need him back.

1271
01:29:44,018 --> 01:29:46,187
He wasn't meant for this place.

1272
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,856
You couldn't have kept him.

1273
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:52,627
And he couldn't have kept you.

1274
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,263
For your bravery, you both have
the heartfelt thanks

1275
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:57,397
of a grateful nation.

1276
01:29:59,734 --> 01:30:01,769
Eddie, you're free
to start your life again.

1277
01:30:01,903 --> 01:30:04,437
Everything that happened
in San Francisco

1278
01:30:04,572 --> 01:30:06,908
and in the last few days,

1279
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:09,577
consider it expunged.

1280
01:30:14,715 --> 01:30:17,885
Just so you're clear,
of course,

1281
01:30:18,019 --> 01:30:20,755
you ever breathe a word of this
to any living soul,

1282
01:30:20,888 --> 01:30:23,557
you will spend
the rest of that life

1283
01:30:23,691 --> 01:30:27,427
in the coldest,
darkest hole imaginable.

1284
01:30:28,963 --> 01:30:30,463
Good luck, Eddie.
