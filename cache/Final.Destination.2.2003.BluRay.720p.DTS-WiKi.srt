1
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:19,212
Tomorrow marks
the one year anniversary

2
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,048
since Velez Air Flight 180
exploded and crashed

3
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,381
shortly after takeoff
from JFK Airport.

4
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:26,550
It's a disaster
that's affected many.

5
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:29,395
None more so than
Mt Abraham High School,

6
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:33,559
which lost 40 students and four
faculty members in the crash.

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,975
But it was the events
after the crash

8
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,236
that has turned this tragic story
into something even stranger.

9
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:43,106
The survivors who managed
to get off the plane before it crashed

10
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:45,241
died soon thereafter
in a series

11
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:47,736
of mysterious
and bizarre accidents.

12
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:51,199
Now, to some, these deaths
are just tragic coincidences,

13
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,249
but to others,
they're an indication

14
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,909
that there are more
sinister events taking place.

15
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:57,914
That's the contention
of tonight's guest.

16
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,881
Thank you for joining us
this evening.

17
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,545
Thank you for having me.

18
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:03,675
And I appreciate you using
the word sinister.

19
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:06,336
Most people say supernatural
because they think I'm talking

20
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:09,718
about ghosts and witches
and stuff like that.

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,384
Here's your chance
to set the record straight.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,887
Great. Okay.

23
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:18,565
I believe that there's
a sort of force,

24
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:22,566
an unseen malevolent
presence...

25
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:24,565
that's all around us
every day.

26
00:01:24,658 --> 00:01:28,109
And it determines
when we live and die.

27
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:32,574
And some people call
this force the devil,

28
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,239
but I think that
whole religious thing is...

29
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:38,585
so I prefer to call it
Death itself.

30
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:41,245
So I'm surrounded by Death?

31
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:43,417
Absolutely. Absolutely.

32
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,926
Every day, everywhere,
all the time.

33
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:49,587
And that's what I want people
to understand...

34
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:51,592
that Death
has this grand design

35
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,760
that we all fit into.

36
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:56,605
So when Alex Browning
got off that plane

37
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,765
and took the other
survivors with him,

38
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:01,349
he basically screwed up
Death's plan.

39
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:04,196
And that's what I'm trying
to warn people about.

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,364
And the fact that all
of the survivors have died

41
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,608
is your evidence of this?

42
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:14,200
Well, it's not so much
that the survivors died,

43
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,413
but it's the way
that they died.

44
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:19,874
I mean, there were
so many weird,

45
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:22,749
seemingly random things
about the way they died.

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,540
It just didn't
make sense.

47
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:29,553
And that's the proof
there's something out there...

48
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:33,303
Wait, that's not proof.
That is your interpretation

49
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:36,428
of events that can't be proven
in order to support your ideas.

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,559
Kimberly.

51
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:40,889
You should be more
open-minded...

52
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:43,770
What happened after that
was just coincidence.

53
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,853
May I finish?

54
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:48,900
Mere coincidence would have
one or two of these kids die.

55
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,232
But not all of them
including their teachers.

56
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:53,733
Yes, but people die
all the time,

57
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:56,236
so why should this be
any different?

58
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:58,703
It forced people
to question

59
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,329
these so-called
everyday coincidences.

60
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,328
What if they
were something more?

61
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:05,497
What if you could do
something about it?

62
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,341
Please, are you listening
to yourself? This is crazy.

63
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:11,711
You're saying we should be on guard
every morning when we leave the house?

64
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:14,509
That's exactly what
I'm saying.

65
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,840
Exactly it.

66
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:18,725
And in order
to survive...

67
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:21,219
the only way to survive

68
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:23,555
is to look beneath
the visible world.

69
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:27,563
Because in the end no one
can escape death.

70
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,226
And today may be
your day to die.

71
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:44,542
Okay, I'll call you.

72
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:46,704
Kimberly, are you sure
you've got everything?

73
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:48,873
Credit card,
cell phone, Triple-A card?

74
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:51,373
Dad, it's Daytona,
not Somalia.

75
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:55,216
Alright. Fix-a-flat, road flares,
sunblock, mace?

76
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:57,712
Condoms,
whips, chains.

77
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:00,386
Just kidding,
Mr. Corman.

78
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:02,303
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.

79
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:05,016
That makes me feel
a lot better, thanks.

80
00:04:06,524 --> 00:04:08,481
- Okay.
- Alrighty.

81
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:11,734
Can we go get the guys?
I'm getting horny.

82
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,822
Go on.

83
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:18,067
Okay, I'll call you.

84
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,993
Whips and chains.
That's nice.

85
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:25,324
Whatever,
your dad's cool.

86
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:30,456
Buckle up!

87
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:00,525
Watch it!

88
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:03,822
- Oh, easy, Kimmy. First year of driving?
- Sorry.

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,118
- Oh my God.
- Fucking freak.

90
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:15,421
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

91
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:17,382
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

92
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,011
You're not getting any of my weed.
Nothing.

93
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:22,259
Whatever.

94
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:24,673
What are we going to do
in Daytona?

95
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,973
We're going to see lots
of honeys there.

96
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,931
We're gonna get drunk, we're gonna smoke
this big 'El Gagerero,'

97
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:31,813
We're gonna have this
awesome party...

98
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,472
Pileup! Pileup!

99
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:47,659
A candlelight vigil to mark
the one year anniversary

100
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,832
of the crash of Flight 180
will be held at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

101
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,993
at the Mt Abraham
high school auditorium.

102
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,502
# Highway to hell... #

103
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:12,262
Oh my God.

104
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,307
- Hello?
- Hey, Kimberly, it's Dad.

105
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:21,653
- Hey, what's up?
- Your car's leaking transmission fluid.

106
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:24,230
- So I want you to get it checked right away.
- Okay, yeah.

107
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:25,867
I'll do that.

108
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,909
I mean it. Take care of it.

109
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,537
- Is that someone coughing?
- Yeah, okay.

110
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,830
I'll take care of it.
I'll talk to you later.

111
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,709
- I love you.
- Bye, honey.

112
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,452
- What did you do?
- Look at those titties!

113
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:43,041
- Shut up.
- You missed that?!

114
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:47,378
That's too bad.
That's too bad.

115
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,549
Oh, shit!

116
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:53,513
Fuck man, there's a cop behind us!
Pull in the right lane now!

117
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:55,062
Shit.

118
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,278
Seriously, put it out.

119
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:07,441
- Put that thing out.
- Alright.

120
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:09,028
Wait, wait, wait!

121
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,826
- Get rid of it.
- Shit.

122
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:15,869
Hey, it's Kat.

123
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,951
Listen...
what the hell?!

124
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:19,835
Just wait. Not you.

125
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:38,638
I think we better pull over
and check the car, because...

126
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:41,138
Kimberly, the car
is going to be fine.

127
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,483
Your dad's going to be fine,
you're going to be fine.

128
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,361
Okay?

129
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,806
Look at that guy.

130
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:21,021
He's drinking a beer.

131
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:25,516
Oh, yeah,
that's real responsible.

132
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:02,096
You ever hear
of the ozone layer, arsehole?!

133
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:32,793
# When it comes to this drug shit
I was made to play #

134
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:37,177
# Don't come around if
you ain't got no cocaine to bring... #

135
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:47,307
What? I'm wearing
my seatbelt.

136
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:50,067
You're gonna bust me,
bitch?!

137
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:06,828
Aaah!

138
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:08,411
Son of a...

139
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:10,920
bitch.

140
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:25,559
Fuck!

141
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,300
- Oh my God!
- Watch out!

142
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:03,260
- Stop!
- Oh my God!

143
00:11:03,347 --> 00:11:05,173
Watch out!
Aaah!

144
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:51,048
Shaina?

145
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,900
I can't get out of here!

146
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,234
Help me!

147
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:15,077
Oh, easy, Kimmy.
First year of driving?

148
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:31,340
Yo, Dano,
shouldn't we help your mum?

149
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:33,591
Good one, man.
You're hilarious.

150
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,843
Pileup! Pileup!

151
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:39,681
- Oh my God.
- What?

152
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:41,683
There's going to be
a huge accident.

153
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,567
We're all gonna die!
I just saw it.

154
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:45,147
That's it.
My turn to drive.

155
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:47,729
- No, I'm serious.
- Kim, what's wrong?

156
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,697
- What are you doing?
- Oh my God.

157
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:55,704
...of Flight 180 will be held
at 8:00 P.M. Tonight

00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:01,666
'Highway to hell.'
'Highway to hell... '

160
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:03,296
'Highway to hell'?

161
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,752
# I'm on a highway to hell... #

162
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:07,465
Okay, Kimberly,
you're scaring me.

163
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:12,003
- Green means go, Kimmy.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,344
Are you out of your friggin' mind?
What the hell are you doing?

165
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:22,815
What the fuck, Kimberly?

166
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:27,018
What's this?

167
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:34,991
Kimberly, you just got
to breathe.

168
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:37,829
Oh, shit, shit.
Five-O's coming. Let's fucking roll.

169
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:39,705
- What?
- Oh my God.

170
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,617
Do you know how much
fucking weed I have on me? Huh?

171
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:44,283
Okay, Dano, just shut up!
Just stay cool.

172
00:13:51,969 --> 00:13:54,674
Oh, fuck. I'm going to jail.
I'm fucking going to jail.

173
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,985
What's going on here?

174
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,359
I think there's going
to be a huge pileup.

175
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:14,487
I saw it.

176
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:16,484
There were bodies
everywhere.

177
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:18,486
There were logs...
I saw it.

178
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:20,238
It just happened.

179
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,533
Alright, miss, I'd like you to please
step out of the vehicle.

180
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:36,508
Just pull over!

181
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:39,052
I know,
Mummy's hungry, too.

182
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,685
Come on.

183
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:47,143
Come on!

184
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:49,188
Oh, fuck this.

185
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:52,561
I'm going to get this
and we're going to go.

186
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,203
Fuck.

187
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:08,533
What the hell
is going on up there?

188
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:10,086
Excuse me!

189
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,744
Is there any way
that we could drive around?

190
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,757
- I have a delivery...
- You need to get back into your vehicles.

191
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:17,669
- Just move it...
- Now!

192
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:24,683
That's it!

193
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:28,225
That's the truck
that's going to kill everybody.

194
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:30,021
You need to stop
that truck!

195
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,933
I told you again,
you have to calm down!

196
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:34,646
Why won't you listen to me?!

197
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:39,479
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

198
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:49,159
This is unit 13 requesting
medical assistance

199
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,823
and backup for a major
traffic accident...

200
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,126
Kimberly, what's going on?

201
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:20,276
No!

202
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:22,321
No!

203
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:42,629
Listen, sir,
this girl is really freaked out.

204
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:43,917
In fact, all of them are...

205
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:46,135
- scared as you can imagine.
- Scared?!

206
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:49,472
These people are the luckiest
sons of bitches on the planet.

207
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,970
Get this guy,
Evan Lewis...

208
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,804
yesterday the kid
wins the lotto.

209
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,805
Today, some loony bitch
blocks traffic

210
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:56,807
and he avoids the worst
pileup in years.

211
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,643
I should be
so damn 'unlucky.'

212
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,145
Go babysit the rest of them.

213
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:01,944
I'll be done with Lewis
in a minute.

214
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:05,114
Hey, excuse me...

215
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,942
We're trying to do
the best we can.

216
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:09,608
We're going to get you
out of here as soon as possible.

217
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:12,325
I just think it's a bunch
of bullshit.

218
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:20,121
Listen, I know
you've gone over all this

219
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:22,005
with Detective Suby...

220
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,510
but would you mind
telling me what happened?

221
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,173
It was like I was there.

222
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:36,344
I knew something bad was going
to happen even before it did.

223
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:41,898
- I just felt wrong, just like...
- Just like what?

224
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:49,116
Look, I know
this sounds crazy but...

225
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,572
you guys all heard
about Flight 180, right?

226
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:53,700
The kid who got off
the plane?

227
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:55,911
Well, it happened
a year ago, today.

228
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:01,118
My premonition
was just like his.

229
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:08,085
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

230
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:09,837
You must have read
about the kid

231
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:11,838
who had a dream
about a plane blowing up,

232
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:13,840
so he got all his buddies
off the plane

233
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:16,602
and then the thing blew up
just like in his dream?

234
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:19,176
- Yeah.
- But did you hear what happened after?

235
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:22,515
So a month goes by, right?

236
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:24,684
Everything seems cool.

237
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,649
But then all the survivors
start to die one by one.

238
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:31,408
'Cause when your number's up,
your number's up, right?

239
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:38,363
You know, some people even say that
Death itself was stalking them,

240
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:40,698
hunting each one down

241
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:44,327
until they were all...
dead.

242
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:49,966
Please.

243
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:53,759
There was one survivor.

244
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,556
Clear Rivers is
in a padded room

245
00:18:57,642 --> 00:19:00,347
at the Stonybrook Institution.

246
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:02,061
Well, that's encouraging.

247
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:07,519
Okay, you want me
to believe that this is true,

248
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,362
that this is happening
all over again?

249
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:12,569
I don't know why
we're even here.

250
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:15,700
What do you want from me?

251
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:18,536
But if I was never meant
to pull over,

252
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:21,076
we all should have died
in that pileup.

253
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,157
Which means Death
could be coming for us.

254
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,041
Yeah, like, what if

255
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:28,710
we're all getting that 'Different Strokes'
curse or something?

256
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:31,549
I think you're all
are certifiable.

257
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,709
I can't believe I've been listening
to this crap.

258
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:36,554
Let's go.
Let's go, Tim.

259
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:39,425
Mrs. Carpenter, please.

260
00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:46,097
Kimberly!

261
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:49,357
Oh baby!

262
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,066
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

263
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:54,696
Shh, shh.

264
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,153
You can all go now.
Thank you for your patience.

265
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,594
Could I ask you something?

266
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,088
Anything.

267
00:20:22,183 --> 00:20:24,934
Did Mum ever have any...

268
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,601
I don't know,
weird feelings about anything?

269
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:31,439
What do you mean?

270
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:37,651
Like visions or premonitions.

271
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:41,113
Sweetie, are you sure
you're okay?

272
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:43,953
Dad, I know
this sounds crazy,

273
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:46,279
but I'm really scared
for the others.

274
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:50,157
I don't know,
I have this really bad feeling.

275
00:20:51,503 --> 00:20:52,997
What?

276
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:56,670
It's not over yet.

277
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,736
Jesus Christ!

278
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,781
Shit!

279
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,081
Hey, Evan, it's Tawny.

280
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,076
Sorry I haven't called.

281
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,873
Hey, listen, I heard
about your lottery win.

282
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,584
Let's hook up.
Call me.

283
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,046
Yeah.

284
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,878
Hi, Evan, it's Nikki.

285
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,093
We met at Tucker's party
last year?

286
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,754
I know it's been awhile,
but I've been thinking about you.

287
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,554
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

288
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:18,601
So give me a call.

289
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,930
555-0123. Bye.

290
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:24,440
You little bastard.

291
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:26,187
Shit.

292
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:33,951
Come on.
Come on.

293
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:43,333
Fuck. Fuck.

294
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:55,430
Come on!

295
00:23:55,515 --> 00:23:57,175
Come on.

296
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:05,024
Fuck!

297
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:06,483
Jesus!

298
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:15,607
Oh!

299
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,451
Hey, this is Evan.
Leave a message.

300
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:27,035
If you're looking for Rick,
I don't know where he is,

301
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:29,881
and I don't know
when he's coming back. Thanks.

302
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:33,915
Evan, call me when you
get in, you lucky fuck!

303
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:04,579
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

304
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:06,409
Aah!

305
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:38,364
Jesus!

306
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:44,613
Come on.

307
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,290
Aah!

308
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,924
Shit, I'm lucky.

309
00:26:01,346 --> 00:26:03,220
Aah!

310
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:08,260
Jesus Christ!

311
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:36,185
No, Mother,

312
00:27:36,272 --> 00:27:38,941
just turn on any station.

313
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:42,191
Well, I don't know how you missed it,
it's been on all day.

314
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:44,851
Yes, Mother,
Channel 4 is fine.

315
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:48,031
Okay... here it is!
I got to go, okay?

316
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:50,026
I got to go!

317
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:52,869
To recap our top story,

318
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:56,538
Route 23 was backed up
for almost nine hours today.

319
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,709
A record-breaking pileup
killed an estimated 18 people.

320
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:02,831
Emergency crews spent hours
sifting through the wreckage

321
00:28:02,923 --> 00:28:06,007
hoping to recover any survivors
from this tragic collision.

322
00:28:06,093 --> 00:28:09,047
So far police are refusing
to release the names of the victims

323
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:10,845
until the families
are notified.

324
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:12,757
The camera
of a highway patrol car

325
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:14,758
managed to catch
this shocking footage.

326
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:16,891
- A semi comes...
- Oh my God.

327
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:18,852
And smashes
into a red SUV.

328
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:22,521
- The driver of the SUV...
- No, um...

329
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,020
leave it.

330
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,521
...may have
saved her life.

331
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:27,438
He pulled her back
at the last second

332
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,570
just as the semi ploughed
into the vehicle.

333
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:31,401
The passengers inside
the SUV...

334
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:34,279
Oh, oh, oh! You guys see that?!
Shit, I was there, baby!

335
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,320
In other news, a freak accident took
the life of a lotto winner.

336
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,243
- Friends say Evan Lewis...
- Hey, shh.

337
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:44,035
Was on top of the world after
recently winning $250,000.

338
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,799
But in tragic turn of events,
Lewis died today

339
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:49,456
while trying to escape a fire
in his apartment.

340
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:51,295
He managed to make it out
of the building,

341
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:53,545
but somehow the ladder
on the fire escape

342
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,548
slipped and impaled him.

343
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:58,132
Investigators believe Lewis
died instantly.

344
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,360
Come in.

345
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:11,691
Hey, buddy.

346
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,035
I want you to take this
so you can get some sleep.

347
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:21,204
And then tomorrow it's off to the dentist,
which I know you love.

348
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:24,703
Now, get some rest.

349
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:31,837
- Mum.
- Yeah?

350
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:33,966
You think those guys
were BSing us today?

351
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:35,797
Yeah.

352
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:38,296
Some people just need
some rewiring, that's all.

353
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:41,220
Lights out.

354
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:41,757
At the request
of the patient,

355
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:43,837
you'll relinquish
any sharp objects

356
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,255
such as: 'nail files,
pencils, pens,

357
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:49,266
safety pins, bobby pins,
your necklace,

358
00:31:49,352 --> 00:31:51,925
matches, lighters,
belts, belt buckles,

359
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:55,105
earrings, hair clips,
glasses, shoelaces,

360
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:58,227
paper clips, watches, money clip,
pocket knives,

361
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,940
food, drinks, keys,
cell phone... '

362
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,188
You have a cell phone
on you?

363
00:32:03,282 --> 00:32:06,199
'... poisons, pills,
medications.'

364
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,858
Great. And let me see
your nails.

365
00:32:08,954 --> 00:32:11,528
Good. Then I think
we're all done.

366
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:13,533
Wait.

367
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,535
Is she dangerous
or something?

368
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:17,584
No, honey,
she expects you are.

369
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:23,382
No, no, no.

370
00:32:23,468 --> 00:32:26,671
Get him off me.
Get him off me!

371
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:36,802
How long are they gonna keep
her locked up like this?

372
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:39,354
Depends on her, I guess.
She's voluntary.

373
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:10,049
- Clear Rivers?
- Don't come any closer.

374
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:21,854
They told me you had something to do
with the crash on Route 23.

375
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:24,859
Look, I don't know how
to explain it,

376
00:33:24,945 --> 00:33:28,230
but I saw the pileup
before it happened.

377
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,817
And I saved some people.

378
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,235
And now you think Death
is after you.

379
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,078
Nice work.

380
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:41,416
Maybe if you're real lucky,
you'll wind up in here with me.

381
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:44,664
Anything else?

382
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,211
One of the people died
in a freak accident last night.

383
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,376
What if the other people
are in danger, too?

384
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:51,841
If you put them on the list,
they're already dead.

385
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,218
List? What list?

386
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:56,465
Death's list.

387
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,178
The survivors of Flight 180

388
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,514
died in the exact order

389
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,395
they were originally meant
to die in the plane crash.

390
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,562
That was Death's original design.

391
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,572
The list.

392
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:15,114
I was supposed to die
in that crash with my friends.

393
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:16,862
So you're telling me
that I'm next?

394
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,112
You said someone else died
last night.

395
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:21,246
That means someone must
have intervened.

396
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:25,580
Officer Burke pulled me away
from the crash that killed my friends.

397
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:27,544
Congratulations.

398
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:30,204
You'll be the last to go.

399
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,874
But don't worry,
once the others are dead,

400
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,594
it'll come back for you.

401
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:37,970
It always does.

402
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:41,011
This doesn't make sense.

403
00:34:41,102 --> 00:34:45,432
You said that you die in
the order you're originally meant to.

404
00:34:45,523 --> 00:34:49,272
But my friends died last
in my premonition, not first.

405
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,318
Wait.

406
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:54,772
Died last?

407
00:34:56,784 --> 00:34:58,658
Backwards.

408
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:00,784
Are you sure?

409
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:04,498
In my premonition

410
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:06,493
that Nora woman
and her kid died.

411
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:09,705
Then Evan,
then me and my friends.

412
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:14,875
Why is this even
happening to me?

413
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,715
That's what Alex used
to ask himself.

414
00:35:23,394 --> 00:35:25,682
So, what am I
supposed to do?

415
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:27,728
Clear.

416
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:31,191
Watch out for the signs.

417
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:32,984
What?

418
00:35:35,405 --> 00:35:38,442
Have you ever seen anything
creepy or ominous?

419
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:41,238
An in-your-face irony
kind of thing?

420
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,035
The songs on the radio.

421
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:49,078
Yeah, the guy in the beer truck,
everything on the road.

422
00:35:49,169 --> 00:35:51,410
Well, don't ignore it.

423
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:55,122
Recognizing those signs usually means
the difference between life and death.

424
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:57,672
You got to help me.

425
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,385
I don't have
to do anything.

426
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,178
But you beat it.

427
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:03,007
Take a look around.

428
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:05,056
What did I beat, Kimberly?

429
00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:10,645
If you were smart, you'd save yourself
and just forget about the others.

430
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:13,305
How can you say that?
You have a responsibility.

431
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,523
My friends are dead.

432
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:17,568
That's how I can say that.

433
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:22,782
This is what happened to Alex
when I was responsible for him.

434
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:25,868
Get out.

435
00:36:25,954 --> 00:36:28,327
Before you hurt me or yourself.

436
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:35,087
- Alright, you know what?
- What?

437
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:36,547
I think you're a coward.

438
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:38,256
You hide out in here
because you're

439
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:41,545
too damn bitter and selfish
to help any other person.

440
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:43,546
In my opinion,
you're already dead.

441
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,590
I tried calling you
last night,

442
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:25,670
but your father said
you were sleeping.

443
00:37:25,763 --> 00:37:27,471
- Evan Lewis is dead.
- Yeah.

444
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:30,842
I've been getting calls all morning from
everyone who was on the on-ramp.

445
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:33,057
We're meeting tonight
at my apartment.

446
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:36,395
Wait, so...
you believe all this Death stuff?

447
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:40,181
Well, at first,
no, I didn't.

448
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:42,353
Until last year
when I was dispatched

449
00:37:42,446 --> 00:37:44,734
to clean up one
of the Flight 180 survivors.

450
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:46,566
Clean up, I don't...

451
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:53,612
- Did you see that?
- See what?

452
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:56,198
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons?

453
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:58,202
- It's a sign.
- A sign of what?

454
00:37:58,294 --> 00:38:00,038
If Clear's right
about the order,

455
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:03,296
then Nora and Tim are going
to be attacked by pigeons.

456
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:04,877
I'm not following you.

457
00:38:04,968 --> 00:38:06,628
They're next
on Death's list.

458
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,175
If we don't find them,
they're going to die.

459
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:58,886
The doctor's ready
for you, now.

460
00:38:58,978 --> 00:39:00,805
If he gives me the gas

461
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:02,973
and I wake up
with my pants unbuttoned...

462
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:06,600
- we ain't paying.
- Tim.

463
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:17,984
There you are.
What happened to you yesterday, Tim?

464
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,827
We missed you in here.

465
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:21,452
We got hung up by that accident on
Route 23.

466
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:24,211
Good Lord.
How lucky that you're okay.

467
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:28,044
Your mum says you've been
having some pain lately.

468
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,338
Not really.

469
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:57,532
I'm disappointed, Tim.

470
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:58,947
Does your mum know
you've been smoking?

471
00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:02,204
Uh-huh.
Ow.

472
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,413
Yeah, that one's going
to have to be filled.

473
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:07,620
Damn those pigeons.

474
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:11,128
How many times am I going to have to
replace those goddamn windows?

475
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:16,380
We can't do it, boss,
we can't do it!

476
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:19,092
This will only sting for a moment.

477
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:21,388
Open big.

478
00:40:21,475 --> 00:40:23,053
Little bit wider.

479
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:25,053
Wider.

480
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:27,601
Okay.

481
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:30,897
Oh God.

482
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:32,812
How do they
expect me to...

483
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:35,477
Would you rather just have
the laughing gas?

484
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:37,814
- Yeah.
- Okay.

485
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:39,735
Jean, I'm going
to need you in here.

486
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:44,535
You'll have to speak up,
there's too much noise.

487
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:49,579
What?!
I can't hear you!

488
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,746
Excuse me, what?!

489
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:55,836
Yes, the sixth at 2:00 P.M.

490
00:40:55,926 --> 00:40:58,595
Jean! Let me
get this started.

491
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:02,465
Tim, you'll be awake,
a little groggy,

492
00:41:02,557 --> 00:41:04,680
but you're not going
to be able to move much.

493
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:32,284
Okay, great, thanks.
Alright, turn around.

494
00:41:32,378 --> 00:41:35,628
The cleaning lady said they're at
the Ellis Medical Complex off of 14th.

495
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:42,344
God damn it anyway.

496
00:41:49,686 --> 00:41:51,809
- Okay, I got it.
- I can't find a box!

497
00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:55,648
Not again. Careful.

498
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:38,684
There we go.

499
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:50,027
Jean,
how's Tim doing in there?

500
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:56,833
What did he say
about your tooth?

501
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:59,207
- Did he say...
- I can't remember.

502
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:00,956
- Nora!
- The pigeons!

503
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:03,289
What? Pigeons?

504
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:07,086
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Kid, kid!

505
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,888
- No-oo!
- Tim!

506
00:43:10,974 --> 00:43:12,172
Look out!

507
00:43:13,935 --> 00:43:16,343
- Stay back, stay back!
- No! Please, no!

508
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:36,952
Nora's not coming.
She won't leave her son.

509
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:40,991
- No, but she's next...
- Right now I don't think she cares.

510
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:02,263
This is really
happening again, isn't it?

511
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:06,567
I hoped we'd get there

512
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:08,562
and they'd be fine,

513
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:10,897
and Clear Rivers
was just full of shit,

514
00:44:10,991 --> 00:44:14,775
and Evan Lewis' death
was just some freak accident.

515
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:18,946
But we're all going to die,
aren't we?

516
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:25,287
I'm so scared.

517
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:29,252
I know you didn't ask
for any of this...

518
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:33,000
but I don't think you have it
in you to quit either.

519
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,270
A second one just died.

520
00:44:43,356 --> 00:44:45,147
A 15-year-old kid.

521
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,309
I hope you're ready for this.

522
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:02,450
It's this way.

523
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:07,249
How is this guy going
to help us anyway?

524
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,745
He seemed to know
a hell of a lot more

525
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,797
about Death
than he ever told us.

526
00:45:15,971 --> 00:45:17,928
Shouldn't we knock first?

527
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:20,303
He probably already knows
we're coming.

528
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:09,597
Hello, Clear.

529
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:17,355
I've been expecting you.

530
00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:19,404
Oh my God.

531
00:46:20,992 --> 00:46:23,697
- That's Evan Lewis.
- Come to pick my brain?

532
00:46:23,787 --> 00:46:26,953
Just a simple question and we'll leave you
alone with your new friend.

533
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,582
Dead...

534
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:33,455
yet still fresh.

535
00:46:34,881 --> 00:46:36,920
Look, we drove
a long way to get here,

536
00:46:37,008 --> 00:46:39,047
so if you happen to know
how to stop Death,

537
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:40,878
it would be really great
if you told us.

538
00:46:41,971 --> 00:46:43,596
You can't cheat Death.

539
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:46,433
- There are no escapes.
- Bullshit.

540
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:49,388
You told me Death
has a distinct design.

541
00:46:49,478 --> 00:46:52,764
But Alex and I cheated Death,
not once but dozens of times.

542
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:55,312
The design is flawed,
it can be beaten.

543
00:46:55,401 --> 00:46:58,105
Such fire in you now.

544
00:46:58,195 --> 00:47:00,769
People are always
most alive

545
00:47:00,864 --> 00:47:02,572
just before they die.

546
00:47:02,658 --> 00:47:04,401
Don't you think?

547
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:22,540
Look, please...

548
00:47:28,975 --> 00:47:32,261
if you know of anything
that could help us,

549
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:34,311
what harm could it do?

550
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:38,856
Only new life
can defeat Death.

551
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:41,066
What the hell
does that mean?

552
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:45,480
Some people say there's a balance
to everything.

553
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:48,450
For every life
there's a death,

554
00:47:48,536 --> 00:47:50,778
and for every death
there is a life.

555
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:53,623
But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be,

556
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,080
that can
invalidate the list,

557
00:47:56,168 --> 00:47:59,454
force Death
to start anew.

558
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,885
You have to follow
the signs...

559
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:11,800
Kimberly.

560
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:16,095
How do you know my name?

561
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:32,323
- Whoa!
- Wait a second.

562
00:48:32,412 --> 00:48:35,413
'New life defeats death'?
'Follow the signs'?

563
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:37,407
Where did you
find that guy?

564
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,244
I thought he was supposed
to help us,

565
00:48:39,335 --> 00:48:40,746
not freak us out.

566
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,591
What the fuck
are you thinking?!

567
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:52,923
I'm thinking suck on my junk,
bee-atch.

568
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,807
Little punk.

569
00:49:06,904 --> 00:49:08,695
What is it?

570
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:11,153
What did you see?

571
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,794
You have to tell us,
what did you see?

572
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:29,040
Kimberly, look at me!
You have to tell us.

573
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:31,257
What did you see?!

574
00:49:34,431 --> 00:49:36,222
I was driving a white van.

575
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,633
I don't know,
I must have lost control,

576
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:40,553
because I crashed
into a lake.

577
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,768
- And I drowned.
- You were there?

578
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:45,773
I can practically taste
the water in my mouth.

579
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:50,736
Wait, remember, the on-ramp?

580
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:53,491
There was a pregnant woman
in a white delivery van.

581
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,908
He said only new life
can defeat death.

582
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,948
If she gives birth
to a baby

583
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,996
that would've died
in that car crash...

584
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,704
a brand new soul that was never part
of Death's design...

585
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,371
It throws the whole list
out of whack

586
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,668
and we start over
with a clean slate.

587
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,757
- It seems like a reach, don't you think?
- What else could it mean?

588
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,918
We have to find
the pregnant lady's number.

589
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,386
I don't have it.
She never came to the station.

590
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:19,634
We have to warn her about the lake
so she can stay alive to have the baby.

591
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,844
- That'll be an easy conversation to have.
- How are we gonna find her?

592
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,514
There could be thousands
of white vans in the state.

593
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:25,849
Hey!

594
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,731
I'm a cop, remember?

595
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,773
Wait, that's it.

596
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,574
Got it.

597
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,117
With the plate number
I can put out an APB.

598
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,282
Here we go.

599
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,284
The vehicle
is a delivery van

600
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,784
registered to Marcus
and Isabella Hudson.

601
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:53,128
We should pick them up
pretty quickly.

602
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,042
Come on, let's get
to the meeting.

603
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,642
Hey, hold the door!

604
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:14,984
Hey, let go of my shoe!

605
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:16,814
Give me my shoe!

606
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:25,864
I wrote to management two weeks ago
about these friggin' bumpers.

607
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:29,991
Is that dogshit, dude?

608
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:34,915
Eww.

609
00:51:40,178 --> 00:51:42,336
Oh, you got something
on your...

610
00:51:45,475 --> 00:51:48,678
It's still there, bro'.
Here, I can get it for you.

611
00:51:49,812 --> 00:51:51,722
No, it's alright.

612
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:55,849
I'll do it
if you want me to do it.

613
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,071
Just let... I'll...
Let me do it.

614
00:52:03,117 --> 00:52:04,944
What?

615
00:52:06,203 --> 00:52:07,995
Hey, man,
how you doing?

616
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,287
Listen, any word
on that white van yet?

617
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:13,952
Okay, keep checking.

618
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:25,929
Does anybody have a Valium?

619
00:52:26,014 --> 00:52:27,924
Oh, yeah.

620
00:52:28,016 --> 00:52:29,760
Here.

621
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:32,259
You're just going to want to take
half of that.

622
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:33,848
Keep 'em coming.

623
00:52:36,608 --> 00:52:38,268
If what you're saying is true,

624
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,937
that means I'm next.

625
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:42,601
This is crazy, people, come on.

626
00:52:42,697 --> 00:52:44,773
First Death
is stalking us,

627
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:47,238
and now premonitions?
What?

628
00:52:47,327 --> 00:52:48,987
You're not next, Nora.

629
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:52,329
Nobody has to be next.
That's the point.

630
00:52:52,415 --> 00:52:55,582
We need to help each other
in order to get through this.

631
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:57,293
This cannot be happening.

632
00:52:57,378 --> 00:52:59,122
See, because my career
is at a peak

633
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:01,253
and I finally met
a quality guy.

634
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,918
I just bought a house.

635
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:05,048
Maybe if you shut the fuck up,
you'll live.

636
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,463
Like I'm going
to take advice from you.

637
00:53:08,556 --> 00:53:11,261
Okay, look,
if you know what to look for,

638
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,928
you have a fighting chance.

639
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:16,434
If I call and say,
I don't know... subway...

640
00:53:16,522 --> 00:53:18,811
Get to a high-rise fast.

641
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:23,937
A place where no subway
could ever possibly go.

642
00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:25,986
Get it?

643
00:53:28,826 --> 00:53:31,447
Okay, you guys, listen...

644
00:53:31,537 --> 00:53:33,613
just because Kimberly
has these visions,

645
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:35,449
it doesn't mean
we're not all capable

646
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,284
of seeing signs
to some extent.

647
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:39,083
Okay, okay, look.

648
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:40,628
I gotta call bullshit.

649
00:53:40,712 --> 00:53:42,456
I mean, I've sat here
and listened

650
00:53:42,547 --> 00:53:44,456
to all your theories
and all your stories,

651
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:46,589
and I think it's just
all bullshit.

652
00:53:46,676 --> 00:53:48,384
Call it what you want!

653
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:51,305
- It'll keep your arse alive.
- Darlin', my arse is alive!

654
00:53:51,389 --> 00:53:53,298
Has been all day.

655
00:53:54,517 --> 00:53:56,806
There is nobody after us
but you,

656
00:53:56,895 --> 00:53:59,101
trying to make us all crazy.

657
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:14,993
I should have seen that coming.

658
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:16,621
Yeah.

659
00:54:16,706 --> 00:54:18,947
If Death is out to get you,

660
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,081
why don't you get
the hell away from us?

661
00:54:21,168 --> 00:54:23,291
She's the only one that's
dealt with this before.

662
00:54:23,379 --> 00:54:25,418
We need to look out
for each other from now on.

663
00:54:25,506 --> 00:54:27,048
Sleep in shifts.

664
00:54:27,132 --> 00:54:29,504
We need to safe-proof
this death-trap.

665
00:54:38,977 --> 00:54:41,100
Get you to step out
of the van, miss?

666
00:54:41,188 --> 00:54:43,180
Are you kidding me?

667
00:54:43,273 --> 00:54:46,393
- What did I do?
- This vehicle's been reported stolen.

668
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:50,609
Ohh!

669
00:54:50,697 --> 00:54:52,939
Screw this.
I'm going for a smoke.

670
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:55,606
No, no, no,
it's not safe out there.

671
00:54:55,702 --> 00:54:58,275
So, Nora's got
to bite it before me anyhow, huh?

672
00:54:58,371 --> 00:55:01,372
Oh, you people have
no sense of humor.

673
00:55:08,089 --> 00:55:10,414
Nora, you okay?

674
00:55:12,426 --> 00:55:14,715
Four years ago
my husband died.

675
00:55:15,763 --> 00:55:17,886
Now Tim.
There's nothing left for me.

676
00:55:17,974 --> 00:55:19,883
Don't say that, okay?

677
00:55:19,975 --> 00:55:22,549
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

678
00:55:22,645 --> 00:55:25,218
with my family,
I can accept that.

679
00:55:25,314 --> 00:55:29,062
You got to trust me.
We can fight this.

680
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:31,060
If we just stick
together long enough

681
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:32,731
for her
to have her baby...

682
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:35,277
If you'll excuse me,
I have a funeral to plan.

683
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,110
Nora.

684
00:55:40,954 --> 00:55:42,746
What do you think
you're doing?

685
00:55:42,831 --> 00:55:45,404
- I'm finished. I'm out.
- Don't leave, Eugene.

686
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,410
Look, look.

687
00:55:47,502 --> 00:55:49,542
I control my life, alright?

688
00:55:49,629 --> 00:55:52,547
Not some crazy list that
Death has put together.

689
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,958
I'll be sure to carve
that into your tombstone.

690
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,626
Whatever. You may be able
to scare these people,

691
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:01,047
- I'm not buying that shit.
- Be careful, man.

692
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:02,718
- Hey.
- What?

693
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:05,929
Even if you don't believe,
give this to Nora.

694
00:56:16,948 --> 00:56:18,774
I'm just going
to put this in the...

695
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:21,658
closet.

696
00:56:50,897 --> 00:56:52,771
Sorry.

697
00:57:09,123 --> 00:57:11,081
Whoa.

698
00:57:21,093 --> 00:57:23,086
Man with hooks?

699
00:57:24,263 --> 00:57:26,055
Man with hooks.

700
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,548
Hey, I think I see
a man with hooks.

701
00:57:30,352 --> 00:57:31,930
Is that...

702
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,313
- a sign?
- Oh my God.

703
00:57:35,399 --> 00:57:37,059
- Do you guys see that?
- He's right.

704
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:38,561
- The phone.
- Shit.

705
00:57:59,714 --> 00:58:01,588
What the fuck?

706
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:13,679
- Hello?
- Nora!

707
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:16,687
- Who is this?
- Can you hear me?!

708
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:19,477
Officer Burke,
I can't...

709
00:58:19,567 --> 00:58:21,192
I can't hear you!
What?!

710
00:58:21,277 --> 00:58:22,475
What does he...
What?!

711
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,693
A man with hooks
is going to kill you.

712
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,239
- What, what?
- Oh...

713
00:58:26,324 --> 00:58:27,984
What is it, Nora?

714
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:32,036
No!

715
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:34,410
- Wait, wait!
- Let go!

716
00:58:34,498 --> 00:58:36,372
Wait, wait, Nora!

717
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:38,451
- Get me out of here!
- Will you stop it?!

718
00:58:38,544 --> 00:58:39,872
Let me help!

719
00:58:39,962 --> 00:58:41,337
Let me go!

720
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:50,885
Let go of me!

721
00:58:57,813 --> 00:58:59,722
Kat!

722
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:12,818
Help me!

723
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:15,484
- Wait!
- I don't want to die!

724
00:59:28,259 --> 00:59:30,216
Aah!
Let me out of here.

725
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:34,381
I got it, thanks.
They found the van.

726
00:59:34,473 --> 00:59:37,391
Isabella's being held at
the Greenwood Lake sheriff's station.

727
00:59:37,476 --> 00:59:39,718
I'm in control of my life!

728
00:59:39,812 --> 00:59:42,054
- Kiss my arse!
- Eugene, what is it?

729
00:59:42,147 --> 00:59:44,105
- I control my life!
- What happened, Eugene?

730
00:59:44,191 --> 00:59:46,896
- You hear me, you Reaper cocksucker?!
- Calm down.

731
00:59:46,986 --> 00:59:49,311
- What happened? Where's Nora?
- Back the fuck up!

732
00:59:49,405 --> 00:59:52,275
- Whoa, whoa, okay!
- Back the fuck up!

733
00:59:52,366 --> 00:59:54,821
Eugene, what's wrong?
Just tell us what happened.

734
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,949
Alright, give me
the gun, Eugene.

735
00:59:57,037 --> 00:59:59,243
- Give me the gun.
- No! Fuck no!

736
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:02,415
Eugene, you just got
to relax, bro', okay?

737
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:04,540
You just got
to calm down, man.

738
01:00:04,628 --> 01:00:06,454
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Eugene!

739
01:00:06,546 --> 01:00:09,464
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

740
01:00:09,549 --> 01:00:11,625
- I ain't going out like that.
- Hey, Eugene, no!

741
01:00:11,718 --> 01:00:14,423
- On my terms!
- Oh my God!

742
01:00:14,512 --> 01:00:16,339
You hear me!

743
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:19,385
God!

744
01:00:28,234 --> 01:00:30,191
Oh!

745
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:31,688
You don't keep it loaded?

746
01:00:33,155 --> 01:00:35,860
- Maybe they're all duds.
- Six in a row?

747
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:39,116
Never.
That's impossible.

748
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:41,492
It wasn't his turn to die.

749
01:00:42,998 --> 01:00:45,668
Can we find
the pregnant woman, now, please?

750
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,876
Is this safe, guys?

751
01:00:54,968 --> 01:00:57,424
I mean, someone in this car
is about to get whacked.

752
01:00:57,513 --> 01:00:59,968
Do the rest of us really feel
like sitting next to him?

753
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:01,930
Or her?

754
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:04,928
Hopefully her.

755
01:01:06,188 --> 01:01:08,061
Okay, guys,
let's not panic.

756
01:01:08,148 --> 01:01:10,769
- Isabella's safe.
- How do you know?

757
01:01:11,985 --> 01:01:14,227
You said she was going
to drive into a lake.

758
01:01:14,321 --> 01:01:17,156
How can she if she's
in protective custody?

759
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:26,367
Look at me.

760
01:01:26,457 --> 01:01:28,450
Come on.

761
01:01:28,543 --> 01:01:30,582
Does it look like
I'm in the condition

762
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:33,077
to commit grand theft auto?
This is insane.

763
01:01:33,172 --> 01:01:35,081
Look, hopefully
the district judge

764
01:01:35,174 --> 01:01:38,092
will have it all sorted out
by Monday morning, okay?

765
01:01:44,642 --> 01:01:46,599
Marcus.

766
01:01:46,685 --> 01:01:49,259
Marcus, Marcus.

767
01:01:49,355 --> 01:01:51,596
When I get out of here,
I am going to sue his...

768
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:56,568
- Oh my God.
- What, what now?

769
01:01:56,653 --> 01:01:58,611
My water just broke.

770
01:01:58,697 --> 01:02:00,606
- What?
- My water, it just broke.

771
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:03,404
- I'm gonna have my baby.
- No, not here.

772
01:02:03,493 --> 01:02:06,411
- No, you can't do this to me.
- Don't just stand there!

773
01:02:06,496 --> 01:02:09,581
- Get me to a hospital!
- Give me a second to think!

774
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:12,916
I am not going to have my baby
in a jail cell!

775
01:02:13,003 --> 01:02:14,663
Get me to the hospital!

776
01:02:14,754 --> 01:02:16,628
Okay, okay!

777
01:02:16,715 --> 01:02:19,799
Sheriff Perry,
this is Deputy Adams, come back.

778
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:23,674
God, I need the car!
Sheriff Perry, I need the car!

779
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:25,970
My van! My van!
Take my van!

780
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:29,934
Okay. Okay.

781
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:32,095
Yeah, we'll go.
We'll go.

782
01:02:32,188 --> 01:02:34,145
Yeah, we'll go.

783
01:02:37,819 --> 01:02:39,562
Come on,
come on!

784
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:46,816
Y'all want to hear
something crazy?

785
01:02:46,911 --> 01:02:48,987
It's not the first time
I cheated Death.

786
01:02:51,499 --> 01:02:54,452
A kid came to school
with a knife...

787
01:02:54,543 --> 01:02:56,335
killed his teacher.

788
01:02:58,172 --> 01:03:00,295
Teacher would have
been me,

789
01:03:00,382 --> 01:03:04,047
but I was transferred to another
school two days before.

790
01:03:04,136 --> 01:03:06,259
That's fucking weird, man.

791
01:03:06,346 --> 01:03:07,675
You want weird?

792
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:09,840
Last year my partner and I
were heading out

793
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:12,009
when a call came in
about a train wreck.

794
01:03:12,102 --> 01:03:14,344
Frank decided
to let me handle it alone.

795
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,562
He died that night
in a shootout.

796
01:03:19,776 --> 01:03:22,896
If that call had come in
just 10 seconds later,

797
01:03:22,988 --> 01:03:24,695
I'd be dead, too.

798
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:26,904
Oh my God.

799
01:03:26,991 --> 01:03:28,901
I'm sorry.

800
01:03:28,993 --> 01:03:30,618
It's just I got one, too.

801
01:03:30,703 --> 01:03:32,826
Okay, so last May
I'm supposed to go and stay

802
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:35,583
at this cheesy little
bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania.

803
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:38,584
Anyhow, there's this major gas leak
that no one knows about,

804
01:03:38,669 --> 01:03:41,077
and all the guests suffocated
during the night.

805
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:42,452
So what happened?

806
01:03:42,548 --> 01:03:44,126
I don't know.
I never made it.

807
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:46,921
The bus I was on splattered
some girl all over the road.

808
01:03:47,011 --> 01:03:48,422
Was that in Mt Abraham?

809
01:03:48,512 --> 01:03:51,928
Yes. How did you know?

810
01:03:52,016 --> 01:03:54,637
That bus you were on killed
Terry Chaney.

811
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,308
She was supposed to die
on Flight 180.

812
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:04,229
Hey, do you guys remember
that theatre in Paris

813
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,107
that collapsed last year
and killed everybody inside?

814
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:11,238
Well, I had tickets to go.

815
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:13,734
But one night I'm in Paris

816
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:17,079
and I'm just
tripping on acid

817
01:04:17,165 --> 01:04:19,407
and sipping lattes and such.

818
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:21,328
And then all of a sudden

819
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:24,586
this dude out of nowhere

820
01:04:24,673 --> 01:04:27,080
just gets whacked
by this falling sign.

821
01:04:27,175 --> 01:04:29,927
- Carter.
- Wait, wait, wait.

822
01:04:30,011 --> 01:04:32,584
The teacher I replaced,
her name was Val Lewton.

823
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,598
She was from Mt Abraham.
She died in an explosion.

824
01:04:35,683 --> 01:04:38,601
Shit. The call about
the train wreck

825
01:04:38,686 --> 01:04:40,264
that saved my life...

826
01:04:40,355 --> 01:04:42,762
that was the night
I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.

827
01:04:42,857 --> 01:04:45,313
Wait a minute.
Who are these people?

828
01:04:46,819 --> 01:04:48,812
The people who got off
of Flight 180.

829
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:52,648
They were my friends.

830
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,409
Kimberly,
tell us what happened.

831
01:05:01,584 --> 01:05:04,703
About a year ago my mum and I
were at the mall.

832
01:05:04,795 --> 01:05:06,704
I was supposed
to meet her outside,

833
01:05:06,797 --> 01:05:09,370
but I got caught up watching
this news report

834
01:05:09,466 --> 01:05:11,340
about some kid
that committed suicide.

835
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:14,552
I kept thinking,

836
01:05:14,638 --> 01:05:17,010
'How can you strangle yourself
in the bathtub?

837
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:18,925
That's stupid.'

838
01:05:21,603 --> 01:05:23,560
It felt wrong.

839
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:25,438
And yet...

840
01:05:28,443 --> 01:05:31,729
I heard some gunshots
and I ran outside.

841
01:05:33,782 --> 01:05:36,403
Some kids were trying
to steal my mum's car.

842
01:05:36,493 --> 01:05:39,066
She tried to fight them off,
she was a fighter,

843
01:05:39,162 --> 01:05:41,238
and they killed her.

844
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:46,455
After the funeral I kept thinking that
it should have been me.

845
01:05:48,129 --> 01:05:49,956
I guess everyone must
think that.

846
01:05:51,591 --> 01:05:53,630
But I guess I was right.

847
01:06:02,768 --> 01:06:05,852
Get there.
Could you drive a little faster maybe?!

848
01:06:05,938 --> 01:06:07,681
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- God!

849
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,023
When we got off
Flight 180,

850
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:15,028
it didn't just change
our lives.

851
01:06:15,114 --> 01:06:17,521
It affected everyone
and everything

852
01:06:17,616 --> 01:06:19,858
we've come
into contact with since.

853
01:06:19,952 --> 01:06:21,861
I'm not sure
I'm understanding you.

854
01:06:21,953 --> 01:06:24,361
Being alive after
we were supposed to die,

855
01:06:24,456 --> 01:06:26,532
it caused an outward ripple.

856
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:28,498
A rift in Death's design.

857
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:31,586
So if you had never
gotten off the plane...

858
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,212
we wouldn't be alive
in the first place.

859
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,838
Yes, that's why Death
is working backwards!

860
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,050
It's tying up
all the loose ends,

861
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:42,427
Sealing the rift once
and for all.

862
01:07:04,412 --> 01:07:05,822
Oh, shit!

863
01:07:07,915 --> 01:07:09,539
Jesus Christ!

864
01:07:12,169 --> 01:07:14,126
Hang on! Hang on!

865
01:07:34,274 --> 01:07:36,599
- Is everybody alright?
- Oh God.

866
01:07:38,945 --> 01:07:40,653
God, Eugene!

867
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:43,858
- He can't breathe.
- Oh, my legs!

868
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:48,411
No, please.

869
01:07:48,496 --> 01:07:51,283
- It's not going to wait.
- I got to go help those people.

870
01:07:51,374 --> 01:07:53,580
Do you want to deliver
this baby?

871
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:58,004
Those people can help.
Let's go.

872
01:07:59,632 --> 01:08:02,004
Officer Adams reporting
a vehicle collision

873
01:08:02,093 --> 01:08:04,169
off 9-A
at the 180 mile-marker.

874
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:06,088
Send all emergency vehicles
to the scene.

875
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:09,216
- We have to go. Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

876
01:08:09,308 --> 01:08:11,977
Just... okay, okay!
We're going! We're going!

877
01:08:13,729 --> 01:08:16,646
- Easy, easy.
- Here, here, here.

878
01:08:16,732 --> 01:08:18,938
I think he has
a collapsed lung.

879
01:08:19,026 --> 01:08:21,564
- Everyone okay?
- Call an ambulance!

880
01:08:26,742 --> 01:08:28,983
Stay with us.

881
01:08:29,077 --> 01:08:30,453
Hey, hey you!

882
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:34,535
Hey! Come on.
Help me out.

883
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:38,207
You got to get me out of here before
this thing explodes or something, okay?

884
01:08:41,006 --> 01:08:42,500
I think it's okay.

885
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,879
I don't smell any gas
and nothing's dripping.

886
01:08:44,968 --> 01:08:47,719
Alright, get this thing off me.
Just pull. Hurry.

887
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:49,927
Okay. Be careful.
Ready?

888
01:08:51,432 --> 01:08:54,386
Oh God, Jethro!
Jesus Christ!

889
01:08:54,477 --> 01:08:56,719
I got to be able to use
my legs when I'm done.

890
01:08:56,813 --> 01:08:58,889
I'm so... Dad!

891
01:09:05,112 --> 01:09:06,690
Eugene, everything's
going to be okay.

892
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:09,532
If he doesn't get a respirator,
he's not going to make it!

893
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:12,534
We're going to get you to the hospital.
Be careful with that!

894
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:16,071
Check the gauges on the regulator,
and watch out for overdoses!

895
01:09:16,165 --> 01:09:19,249
- And look out for potholes and puddles.
- You can't come in, miss.

896
01:09:20,919 --> 01:09:23,161
And watch out
for power lines!

897
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,582
Watch it!

898
01:09:32,097 --> 01:09:34,553
You trying to get yourself killed,
little boy?

899
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:36,930
You got to use
your head, man.

900
01:09:37,018 --> 01:09:38,726
Get that news van back.

901
01:09:38,812 --> 01:09:40,389
Thanks.

902
01:09:48,113 --> 01:09:49,773
Okay, let's go.

903
01:10:06,088 --> 01:10:08,461
How is she doing?

904
01:10:08,549 --> 01:10:10,625
I think she's going
to be okay.

905
01:10:13,471 --> 01:10:16,140
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

906
01:10:18,142 --> 01:10:20,099
When I die...

907
01:10:20,185 --> 01:10:21,977
is it going to hurt?

908
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,307
I don't know.

909
01:10:26,817 --> 01:10:28,644
You're going to die after me, right?

910
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,647
Yeah, I guess so.

911
01:10:33,657 --> 01:10:35,650
Would you take these?

912
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:43,407
And if I die...

913
01:10:46,169 --> 01:10:47,960
would you throw out
all my drugs

914
01:10:48,046 --> 01:10:51,996
and my paraphernalia
and my porno?

915
01:10:54,344 --> 01:10:55,968
You know...

916
01:10:56,054 --> 01:10:58,509
anything that's going
to break my mum's heart.

917
01:10:59,682 --> 01:11:01,426
Please?

918
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:06,431
Thank you.

919
01:11:10,776 --> 01:11:12,568
This is Cheyenne Jacobson

920
01:11:12,653 --> 01:11:14,562
reporting live
from the Gibbons farm.

921
01:11:14,655 --> 01:11:16,399
Sheriff Perry,
Officer Burke here.

922
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:19,064
I'm trying to get some
information on Isabella...

923
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,069
She did?

924
01:11:21,162 --> 01:11:23,735
Okay. Thanks.
Great.

925
01:11:23,831 --> 01:11:25,290
Kimberly!

926
01:11:25,374 --> 01:11:27,995
Isabella's at Lakeview Hospital.
They're prepping her for delivery.

927
01:11:28,085 --> 01:11:29,994
- We got to go now.
- What about Kat?

928
01:11:30,087 --> 01:11:31,332
I'll go talk to her.

929
01:11:31,422 --> 01:11:34,257
Hi.

930
01:11:34,341 --> 01:11:36,879
Just find Isabella and get this thing
over with, okay?

931
01:11:36,969 --> 01:11:38,712
Go on, I'll be fine.

932
01:11:45,644 --> 01:11:47,636
- Where's Rory?
- I don't know.

933
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:54,562
Could you be a little quieter
with that thing, please?

934
01:11:54,652 --> 01:11:57,523
Yeah, sure.
I'll just put it on quiet mode.

935
01:11:57,614 --> 01:11:58,989
That would be good.

936
01:12:27,184 --> 01:12:28,263
Rory.

937
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:46,615
Oh my God!

938
01:12:46,703 --> 01:12:48,696
Somebody get out there!

939
01:12:48,789 --> 01:12:51,742
- We have to get to the hospital now!
- Well, take my truck!

940
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,292
The keys are in it.

941
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:59,455
Kimberly!

942
01:13:10,643 --> 01:13:12,018
Kimberly!

943
01:13:12,103 --> 01:13:14,226
- Kimberly.
- What do you see?

944
01:13:14,313 --> 01:13:16,769
- What are we looking for?
- It's not here.

945
01:13:18,609 --> 01:13:20,566
This one was different.

946
01:13:20,653 --> 01:13:23,607
It was like the van crashing
into the lake.

947
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:25,737
I was in a hospital,
there was screaming

948
01:13:25,825 --> 01:13:27,533
and a nurse was trying
to choke me.

949
01:13:27,618 --> 01:13:30,191
I couldn't see her,
but I could see her name tag.

950
01:13:30,287 --> 01:13:32,244
It was right in my face.
Kalarjian.

951
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:37,161
I think a nurse named
Kalarjian is going to try and kill Isabella.

952
01:13:41,173 --> 01:13:44,090
Listen to me, Isabella!
I need you to stop pushing!

953
01:13:44,176 --> 01:13:45,670
What's wrong?
Is my baby alright?

954
01:13:45,761 --> 01:13:48,133
The cord's around the neck.
This baby's in trouble.

955
01:13:48,221 --> 01:13:51,092
A bizarre accident
has left two people dead,

956
01:13:51,183 --> 01:13:54,018
one of them killed
by a safety device meant to protect us.

957
01:13:54,102 --> 01:13:56,558
Ironically, the woman
was impaled through the head

958
01:13:56,646 --> 01:13:58,971
after her emergency airbag
deployed.

959
01:13:59,065 --> 01:14:02,648
She was trapped in her vehicle after it
crashed into a field near Greenwood Lake.

960
01:14:02,736 --> 01:14:05,143
Suddenly the airbag went off...

961
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:41,681
Isabella Hudson!
What room is she in?

962
01:14:41,774 --> 01:14:43,850
We may need to do
a stat Caesarean!

963
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:45,769
Get Dr. Kalarjian
up here now!

964
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:48,530
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

965
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:50,024
I'm just going
to wait outside,

966
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:52,072
'cause I'm just really
in the way here.

967
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,068
- Don't you dare leave me!
- Okay, okay.

968
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,904
You guys, get to Isabella!

969
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:57,787
I'm going to find Eugene!

970
01:14:57,873 --> 01:15:01,039
Dr. Kalarjian, code blue.
Delivery room six.

971
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:04,080
Dr. Kalarjian, delivery room six.
Code blue.

972
01:15:19,769 --> 01:15:22,094
Dr. Kalarjian,
in here, hurry!

973
01:15:23,272 --> 01:15:25,395
That's her.

974
01:15:26,442 --> 01:15:28,020
Wait, wait, wait!

975
01:16:05,272 --> 01:16:07,597
Contractions have stopped.

976
01:16:07,691 --> 01:16:10,182
Arrest in descent halfway
through the birth canal.

977
01:16:10,276 --> 01:16:12,352
Bad tracing,
it's losing oxygen.

978
01:16:12,445 --> 01:16:14,521
The cord's compressed!

979
01:16:14,614 --> 01:16:17,899
- Down to 40.
- Oh God! What's happening?!

980
01:16:17,992 --> 01:16:19,700
Where's Kalarjian?!

981
01:16:19,786 --> 01:16:22,455
Dr. Kalarjian!

982
01:16:22,538 --> 01:16:24,697
- Dr. Kalarjian!
- Not now, I'm busy.

983
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:27,994
- Ow! Hey! Hey!
- Police business.

984
01:16:37,261 --> 01:16:39,834
Just push a little more.

985
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:42,255
Oh, no.

986
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:44,093
Isabella, is the baby okay?

987
01:16:45,269 --> 01:16:46,893
I'm sorry.
You can't be here.

988
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:49,552
- I have to ask you to leave.
- I need to know...

989
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:52,519
I need to know if the baby's alright!

990
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:55,938
It's a boy.

991
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:18,673
Thank you.
Congratulations!

992
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,717
Who the hell are they?

993
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,176
Oh my God!

994
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,719
- Clear.
- I can't find Eugene.

995
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,516
- No, don't worry. She had the baby!
- It's okay.

996
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,563
It's over.
It's okay.

997
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:49,487
- Kimberly.
- What did you see?

998
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:52,867
I don't think Isabella
was ever supposed to die in that pileup.

999
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,285
Then what's the premonition
of the lake supposed to mean?

1000
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,206
Try to remember.

1001
01:18:14,564 --> 01:18:17,850
Bloody hands.
Someone with bloody hands.

1002
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:20,312
Eugene.

1003
01:18:24,782 --> 01:18:27,867
Only new life defeats death.
What is that supposed to mean?

1004
01:18:27,952 --> 01:18:29,744
You saw an ECG machine
and what else?

1005
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:33,906
Bloody hands.
What else did you see, Kimberly?

1006
01:18:34,959 --> 01:18:36,418
Wait.

1007
01:18:38,379 --> 01:18:40,206
Eugene.

1008
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:02,268
Oh God, no!

1009
01:19:12,537 --> 01:19:14,245
Bloody hands.

1010
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:18,164
It's me.
The premonitions are about me.

1011
01:19:18,251 --> 01:19:20,327
- What?
- Crash cart.

1012
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:21,879
Let's go! Move it!

1013
01:19:24,174 --> 01:19:26,131
Dr. Kalarjian.

1014
01:19:26,217 --> 01:19:28,009
ECG machine.

1015
01:19:32,515 --> 01:19:34,175
The lake.

1016
01:19:34,267 --> 01:19:36,140
The white van.

1017
01:19:40,898 --> 01:19:42,725
What are you talking about?

1018
01:19:45,403 --> 01:19:47,229
New life.

1019
01:19:49,782 --> 01:19:51,525
What is it?

1020
01:19:51,617 --> 01:19:53,906
I know what I have
to do to save us.

1021
01:19:55,412 --> 01:19:58,366
- I have to die.
- No, that's crazy.

1022
01:19:58,457 --> 01:20:01,577
You can't give up now.
We have to fight this thing.

1023
01:20:06,256 --> 01:20:08,249
Get Kalarjian.

1024
01:22:33,775 --> 01:22:36,859
Only new life can defeat death.

1025
01:22:36,945 --> 01:22:39,696
If it is my time to go
and be in heaven...

1026
01:22:39,781 --> 01:22:42,106
with my family.
I can accept that.

1027
01:22:43,743 --> 01:22:45,403
Flight 180...

1028
01:22:45,495 --> 01:22:47,736
I know what I have to do
to save us.

1029
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:49,906
There are no known survivors.

1030
01:22:49,999 --> 01:22:51,956
I have to die.

1031
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:56,172
Ready and clear!

1032
01:22:57,214 --> 01:22:58,294
Nothing!

1033
01:23:01,218 --> 01:23:03,377
Ready and clear.

1034
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:06,715
Nothing.

1035
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,508
- Come on.
- Ready, clear.

1036
01:23:10,602 --> 01:23:13,639
She's back!

1037
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:16,019
Epinephrine.
Two milligrams, IV push.

1038
01:23:16,108 --> 01:23:18,943
I want her prepped
and stabilized for ICU.

1039
01:23:23,073 --> 01:23:24,733
Welcome back.

1040
01:23:25,909 --> 01:23:27,985
They lost you
for a minute there.

1041
01:23:34,084 --> 01:23:37,334
Hey. We did it.

1042
01:23:38,421 --> 01:23:40,414
Thanks to you,
we cheated Death.

1043
01:24:12,913 --> 01:24:14,621
Would you like some wine?

1044
01:24:14,707 --> 01:24:16,829
I think I'll stick
to our beer, thanks.

1045
01:24:16,917 --> 01:24:18,245
Alright.

1046
01:24:18,335 --> 01:24:20,743
This is really great,
Mrs. Gibbons.

1047
01:24:20,838 --> 01:24:22,996
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

1048
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:24,999
It's our pleasure.

1049
01:24:26,259 --> 01:24:29,675
- How are you doing, Kimberly?
- Good. Yeah.

1050
01:24:29,763 --> 01:24:31,921
I had a fun summer.

1051
01:24:32,015 --> 01:24:35,301
I don't know, I guess things are
pretty much getting back to normal.

1052
01:24:38,063 --> 01:24:41,099
Brian, I think you better
go check that barbecue.

1053
01:24:41,191 --> 01:24:43,812
Hey, careful.
Those things are dangerous.

1054
01:24:43,902 --> 01:24:46,108
Trust me.
I think I've been through closer calls.

1055
01:24:46,196 --> 01:24:49,232
Yeah, me too. Dad, you should tell them
about the news van thing.

1056
01:24:49,324 --> 01:24:51,067
What's that?

1057
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:54,409
Brian was almost hit by that
news van that day in the field.

1058
01:24:54,495 --> 01:24:57,165
And your friend Rory,
he pulled him back at the last second.

1059
01:24:57,248 --> 01:25:00,747
- Saved his life.
- You never told me that, Peter.

1060
01:25:00,835 --> 01:25:02,377
Boy, that was lucky.

1061
01:25:07,216 --> 01:25:09,541
Brian!
