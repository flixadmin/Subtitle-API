1
00:00:06,946 --> 00:00:08,725
Here's my résumé.

2
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:12,246
I mean, technically
it says "curriculum vitae,"

3
00:00:12,353 --> 00:00:15,242
which I think
is more professional, but,

4
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:18,289
you know,
same thing pretty much.

5
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:22,997
Great. But this position truly is
a no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

6
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:26,652
Well, and it doesn't
really say it here,

7
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:30,505
but I have a solid
background in sales.

8
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:33,226
I'm pretty much
a self-starter, so.

9
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:36,120
- That's excellent, but...
- Excellent.

10
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,541
I really feel
I could be a major,

11
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:42,856
major asset
to your sales force.

12
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,949
I'm thinking there's
a little misunderstanding.

13
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,444
This isn't actually
a sales job. I mean,

14
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:52,915
I'd be happy to consider
you for a sales position,

15
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,760
but our agents
need to be licensed,

16
00:00:55,827 --> 00:00:58,455
have at least two years
on-the-job experience,

17
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:00,682
and usually a college degree.

18
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:08,054
What you would be doing
is more like... advertising.

19
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:23,320
Hey, Jesse!

20
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:25,057
Hey, man!

21
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,205
Yo, man! What up?

22
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:29,477
Badger?

23
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:31,848
Where you been
keeping yourself?

24
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:34,045
Nice duds.

25
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:36,338
Yeah. You, too.

26
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:37,698
Thanks.

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,656
Yo, why would you want to do
this lame ass job anyway?

28
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,477
I mean, no offense.

29
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:45,636
Because I'm
on probation, yo.

30
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:48,466
Gotta prove to the man
I'm rehabilitated.

31
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,019
Upstanding citizen.
All that shit.

32
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:54,179
It's really good
exercise, too.

33
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:57,529
Look. You can't just stand there.
You have to spin the arrow.

34
00:01:57,563 --> 00:02:01,285
There's all these moves you have
to learn, like the helicopter.

35
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,063
See?

36
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,307
That one's a bitch.

37
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:10,938
I'm not very good
at it yet.

38
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:14,177
No, you really opened my eyes
to the possibilities.

39
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:16,238
Hey, anyways...

40
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,216
- Thanks for the toke.
- Anytime.

41
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,872
Speaking of which...

42
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,180
You think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

43
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:29,791
Nah, I've been out of the business
for a while actually now.

44
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:33,143
- Thinking about retiring.
- What? No!

45
00:02:33,593 --> 00:02:35,816
That stuff you made
is unbelievable.

46
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:37,658
It was pretty awesome.

47
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,200
Retirement?

48
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:41,714
I can't be hearing this!

49
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:45,081
I had this partner
who was helping me cook.

50
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,450
I mean, I was doing
most of the work, but...

51
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,469
he was an asshole, so...

52
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,584
Anyway, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by.

53
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:59,035
I can hook you up
with some pseudo.

54
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:00,935
Major pseudo.

55
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:02,913
I got channels, bro.

56
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,277
We could partner up.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,006
No pressure.
No pressure.

58
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:11,196
Just think about it,
all right?

59
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:13,799
I gotta go.

60
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:26,043
Yo, this way to savings!

61
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,511
Save your dollars bills, yo!

62
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,472
It's a stupid gift.

63
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:10,485
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

64
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:12,571
I don't know
what I was thinking.

65
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:15,292
Didn't the invitation
even say "no gifts"?

66
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,780
- Walt.
- What?

67
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:18,872
We have to go.

68
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:21,546
I know.
I'm not complaining.

69
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:22,995
Yes, you are.

70
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:26,772
Look, we need this.

71
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:29,946
We've been through
a lot lately, okay?

72
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,246
Guess we didn't get
the beige memo.

73
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:39,026
We're okay.

74
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:42,816
Yes, I look like I'm wearing
a prom dress from 1985.

75
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,525
Honey, you look fine.

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,078
Walt, this is the only thing
I could find that fit me.

77
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:53,246
Would you look at that?
The invitation said "no gifts."

78
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,585
Oh, come on.

79
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:58,099
Sir, I'll take that
for you.

80
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,552
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

81
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,715
Oh, look,
there's Elliott.

82
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,655
Let's go say hello.

83
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,439
Elliott.

84
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:15,782
Walt!
You made it.

85
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:18,821
Happy birthday.

86
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:21,860
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Thank you. Skyler.

87
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,301
Oh, that's right.

88
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:26,896
Great to see you.
You look beautiful as always.

89
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:30,297
Well, these days a little more
big than beautiful, but...

90
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:32,259
Of course!
Congratulations.

91
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:33,760
That was such
great news.

92
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:34,805
Thank you.

93
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,863
Gretchen, look who's here!

94
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:42,973
It's been ages.

95
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:45,461
It's so good to see you.

96
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:48,112
It's... really good.

97
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:50,469
Skyler, welcome.
Congratulations.

98
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:52,924
Thank you.
It's really nice to be here.

99
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,406
When are you due?

100
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:57,033
We're looking at
about ten more weeks.

101
00:05:57,218 --> 00:06:00,002
Actually, we recently
found out that it's a girl.

102
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,840
- Congratulations.
- That's so wonderful.

103
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:05,541
We've been thinking
about it for ourselves.

104
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,454
Yeah, thinking about it.

105
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:11,835
By the way,

106
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:15,037
securing that patent
was just amazing.

107
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:18,221
I mean, the work that
your company is doing...

108
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,006
Congratulations,
to both of you.

109
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:23,135
Hard work
and a lot of luck.

110
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:25,333
- A lot of luck.
- Oh, well, no.

111
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:28,547
Will you excuse us?
We gotta say hi.

112
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,646
Make yourselves at home.
We'll catch up later.

113
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,170
Sure. Okay.

114
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:34,921
- So good you're here.
- Thank you.

115
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,259
Shall we?

116
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,149
Walt?

117
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:00,307
I thought that was you.

118
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:01,330
Farley!

119
00:08:01,516 --> 00:08:02,890
Long time no see.

120
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:05,336
This Walter White.

121
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,551
Back at Cal Tech,
he was...

122
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:10,344
you were just the master
of crystallography.

123
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,076
I remember this one time,
we were stuck on this protein problem...

124
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:16,209
for weeks!

125
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,488
You just breezed right in

126
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:20,976
and you had
one word for us, too.

127
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:23,798
Synchrotrons.
It was synchrotrons, yeah.

128
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:27,823
They generate purer and more
complete patterns than x-ray beams.

129
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,730
Data collection takes
a fraction of the time.

130
00:08:31,164 --> 00:08:33,669
This is the White
in Gray Matter.

131
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,076
Tell 'em, Walt.

132
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:37,537
Okay.

133
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:40,982
Well, back when Elliott
and I were in grad school,

134
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:42,657
we came up
with the name.

135
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:46,043
Schwartz: black.
Walter White.

136
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:49,628
So, together they became
Gray Matter Technologies.

137
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:52,237
- Cute, huh?
- So you run the company with Elliott?

138
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:55,437
Well, no. No, that's
Gretchen and Elliott.

139
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:58,472
I gravitated
toward education.

140
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:00,884
What university?

141
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,290
It's a Stratocaster!

142
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,465
Not just any Strat.

143
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:11,201
That's one of Clapton's.

144
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:12,425
No way.

145
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:14,226
"To Elliott.

146
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:17,880
"Sorry about the buckle rash.
Eric Clapton."

147
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:20,743
Thank you.
This is beautiful.

148
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:22,766
Why is he doing this?

149
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:25,102
What is he,
like eight years old?

150
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,262
Here, honey.

151
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,158
Thanks.

152
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,844
Oh, this is from Walt.

153
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:34,724
- God.
- It's okay!

154
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:48,244
Yum-Good Ramen.

155
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,087
This is what Walt and I...

156
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:06,990
lived on for
10 months straight

157
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,835
while we were working
on our thesis.

158
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:13,204
They sold them down at Ralsto's
in the hardware aisle,

159
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,235
right next to the...
the what was it?

160
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,173
- Sterno.
- The Sterno.

161
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:19,804
Yeah, 10 for $1.99.

162
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:22,038
To this day,
I am convinced

163
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:25,234
these noodles were responsible
for our success.

164
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,329
This was our lifeblood.

165
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,249
Where'd you find these?

166
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,970
I thought they'd been
outlawed years ago.

167
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,750
I love it.

168
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:38,810
Thank you, Walt.

169
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,302
For the man
who has everything.

170
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:45,526
- No, no.
- It was.

171
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,838
You remember the fat guy,
the fat guy.

172
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,530
We used to call him
"Snot Trough"

173
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,612
because he had
that thing under his n...

174
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,109
- What do you call that thing?
- That was Dobkins!

175
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:57,127
That was the same guy who always
smelled like chocolate milk.

176
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,202
- It was!
- No, no, no, no.

177
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,377
It wasn't Dobkins.
It was...

178
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:05,444
Anyway, I swear to Christ
he used to iron those patches

179
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:09,230
onto the elbows of his
Members Only jacket because

180
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:11,296
he thought it made him
look more distinguished.

181
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,339
- Didn't it?
- No.

182
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:18,019
- Well, here's to Snot Trough.
- To Snot Trough.

183
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:20,572
- Wherever you may be.
- God bless him.

184
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:24,797
And you remember
the professor

185
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:27,442
who used to hate
Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

186
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:28,690
Yes.

187
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,378
All you had to do was mention
the Bunsen burner

188
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:33,383
and he was off on a rant.

189
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:36,590
"No, he didn't invent it."
You remember the waving?

190
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,920
"He just improved it!"
You know.

191
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:42,172
It was easy to kill
15 minutes anyway.

192
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:46,848
Oh God, I miss this, Walt.

193
00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:49,724
Yeah. Me, too.

194
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:53,374
Listen, we ought to
get together more often.

195
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:57,219
Skyler and I would love to have you
and Gretchen over for dinner sometime.

196
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:59,522
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

197
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,939
But what I mean is

198
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,716
that you and I should
work together again.

199
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:10,254
- Are you going to teach high school?
- No, no. Seriously.

200
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,037
What's stopping us?

201
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:17,808
Wait a minute.
Elliott, what are you...

202
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,017
Are you asking me to come
work for you at Gray Matter?

203
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,165
Yeah. Why not?
You'd fit right in.

204
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,360
You're brilliant,
you've got a ton of experience.

205
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:27,911
Well, I...

206
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:31,511
I wouldn't really know
where to begin. I mean...

207
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:34,382
God. You have no idea.

208
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,413
I spend my days just drawing out
atoms on the chalkboard

209
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:41,593
and trying to get these kids
to learn the periodic table.

210
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:43,194
Look, I understand.

211
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:47,056
You're a little rusty,
but you're not seeing the upside here.

212
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:50,719
We could really benefit
from a new set of eyes.

213
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:54,656
You know what it is when you been trying
to crack some problem for months on end.

214
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,196
You get tunnel vision.

215
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:58,289
One guy thinking
outside of the box...

216
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,673
You may be exactly
what we need.

217
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,707
Well, listen, Elliott...

218
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:24,030
Your offer is very appealing.
It really is. I thank you. But...

219
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:29,812
There's something
you should know.

220
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:33,462
I have some...

221
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:35,886
personal issues.

222
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:38,957
Look, there's nothing
we can't work out.

223
00:13:39,414 --> 00:13:43,275
Well, yeah,
but it's complicated.

224
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:46,589
We can help you.

225
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:49,557
We have excellent
health insurance.

226
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:53,651
The best.

227
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,714
Hey, did you try those prosciutto
wrapped figs? They were, like, wow!

228
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:22,348
They were just... I must have had
about 30 of those suckers.

229
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:24,486
And the seafood table.
Did you see that?

230
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:28,373
They had lobster tail, they had
crab legs, there was, like, shrimp...

231
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:33,159
Walt?

232
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,652
What the hell
did you say to Elliott?

233
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,579
You told him about
the cancer, didn't you?

234
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:39,727
Didn't you?

235
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:42,704
I can't believe it.

236
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,663
Okay, we were talking.

237
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,313
He asked how you were doing,
and I am sorry,

238
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,825
but I don't have
the best poker face these days

239
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:52,570
where that's concerned.

240
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:56,227
He knew something was wrong
with you and he pressed me.

241
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,041
He pressed you.
Come on.

242
00:14:58,054 --> 00:14:58,967
Walt!

243
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:01,056
When it came
right down to it,

244
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:03,482
I didn't know what else to do
but tell him the truth.

245
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:06,969
The truth? How about
you just said "he's fine, " huh?

246
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,156
Maybe you could've just
have said that?

247
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:12,601
"He's fine, " and done.

248
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:14,582
I don't like the way
you're talking to me.

249
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:17,806
I don't like the way you talk
about my private affairs

250
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:21,052
to people who are not
even in our lives anymore.

251
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:25,222
- What exactly did he say to you?
- He offered me a job.

252
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:26,814
- What?
- Yes.

253
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:29,304
Kind of like some
fig leaf, you know?

254
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:32,242
Some face-saving bullshit

255
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,506
that allowed me to generously
accept his charity.

256
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:38,307
And then, when I turned
that down, he flat-out

257
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,411
offered
to pay for my treatment.

258
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:43,693
Which is exactly what you
expected him to do, didn't you?

259
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,582
- Didn't you?
- No.

260
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,464
- Please. Come on.
- I did not put him up...

261
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,176
Okay, what did you say?

262
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,009
Walt?

263
00:15:58,142 --> 00:16:00,026
What do you think I said?

264
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:02,681
Why? Walt...

265
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:55,053
- You ready to go?
- I'm taking the bus.

266
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,115
Okay...

267
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:03,176
Bye, honey.

268
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:44,175
Hey, dude, are these
bullet holes?

269
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,742
No, man. Those are for,
like, you know,

270
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,418
ventilation.

271
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:53,279
Cool.

272
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:57,235
Nice set-up, huh?

273
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:00,868
- Man.
- This is nothing, man.

274
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,861
I used to have, like,
twice as much glassware

275
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,279
until my dumbass ex-partner
drove us into a ditch

276
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,345
and wrecked most of it.

277
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,226
Big ass beaker, huh?

278
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:16,656
Wait, wait. No, that's a...
Yeah, that's a boiling flask.

279
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,776
This is a beaker.

280
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:22,353
Here's a Griffin beaker,
here's a volumetric beaker.

281
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:26,655
Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.

282
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,307
You got...

283
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:31,310
You really know your shit.

284
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,158
Well, it's just
basic chemistry, yo.

285
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:38,511
So... you got
something for me?

286
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,404
Oh, hells, yeah!

287
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:55,139
Okay. We're in business.

288
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:58,844
- Right on, Badger.
- Dude, check this out.

289
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:02,682
Jesus, what the hell
are you bringing that for?

290
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:04,502
Hunting.

291
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:07,240
We might see javelinas.

292
00:19:37,326 --> 00:19:39,304
Are you going
to help me or what?

293
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,963
Badger!

294
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:52,297
Let me see the money.

295
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,701
Nah, I need five each.
Come on, two more.

296
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:57,662
Here.

297
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:00,425
What about him?

298
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:03,759
Are you kidding?
He looks younger than us.

299
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:04,970
Whatever.

300
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:07,725
What about that guy?

301
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:10,741
- Nah, he looks like a businessman.
- So what?

302
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:13,802
So, businessmen
are always in a hurry.

303
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:17,279
They're always, like,
going to some meeting or something.

304
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,954
Seriously, he's just
going to say no.

305
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,029
This guy.

306
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,398
This is our guy.

307
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:25,722
You're up.

308
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:27,914
Why do I have to do it?

309
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,555
Give me the crutches
and I'll go do it.

310
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:37,505
Excuse me, hey.

311
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:40,515
We forgot our IDs
and we were wondering

312
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:43,740
if you could do us a favor
and buy us a six-pack.

313
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:46,998
You know, what you're
asking is illegal.

314
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,798
No, it's not?

315
00:21:50,194 --> 00:21:51,795
Yeah, it is.

316
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:58,659
Guess you win the jackpot.

317
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:03,281
This is not how I wanted
to spend my night off.

318
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:05,690
Consider this your
first and last warning.

319
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:06,741
Yes, sir.

320
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,243
You're lucky you got
a good dad here.

321
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:19,554
If the other guys
hadn't run,

322
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,178
I could've talked
my way out of it.

323
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:24,535
Not cool, man.
Not cool.

324
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:28,359
What, you never tried to buy beer
when you were my age?

325
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:31,752
No, I'm talking about you calling me
and not your father.

326
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:34,532
How do you think
that will make him feel?

327
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:46,732
I don't even know
what to say to you.

328
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:50,135
Just go.

329
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:53,517
I'll deal with you later.

330
00:23:00,542 --> 00:23:01,898
Where's Walt?

331
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:04,680
I haven't seen him
since this morning.

332
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:06,947
Your guess
is as good as mine.

333
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:09,476
Listen, do me a favor,
all right?

334
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:11,478
Don't tell him
about the kid.

335
00:23:11,538 --> 00:23:14,856
Just a teenager trying
to score some beer, you know?

336
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:18,416
You know.
Just growing pains.

337
00:23:19,907 --> 00:23:23,494
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick,
he starts acting out, you know?

338
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,071
First the pot,
and then this.

339
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:27,906
The pot?

340
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:33,605
- You told me he was smoking reefer.
- That's what Skyler told me.

341
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,409
I mean, you may as well have.

342
00:23:35,437 --> 00:23:38,123
I wasn't talking
about Walter, Jr.

343
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:40,825
I was talking about Walt.

344
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:44,814
Excuse me?

345
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:47,459
He admitted it.

346
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:51,133
He said he liked it.

347
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:53,543
Walt?

348
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,285
I didn't think
he had it in him.

349
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,509
It's like he's not
himself lately.

350
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,606
I mean, why would anyone
in their right mind

351
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:13,389
choose not to do treatment?

352
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:16,121
Especially when
it's completely paid for?

353
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,325
Why is he doing this?

354
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,450
You know what
we need to do?

355
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,852
What we really need to do
is sit him down, all of us,

356
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:27,256
and get everything
out on the table.

357
00:24:27,294 --> 00:24:29,339
Talk it all through.

358
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:31,807
You mean an intervention?

359
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,151
No, no.

360
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:36,016
Just a family meeting...

361
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:40,056
where everyone can
voice their concerns and...

362
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:41,883
be heard.

363
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:52,134
You are a genius, bro!

364
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:54,451
This cankenstein
is unreal!

365
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,160
When we get back,
I'm gonna burn that dollar bill suit

366
00:24:57,174 --> 00:24:59,885
'cause we're gonna
make some mad dough!

367
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,778
It's not right.

368
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:05,467
What do you mean
it's not right?

369
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:08,731
It's... cloudy.

370
00:25:08,735 --> 00:25:10,299
It's not supposed
to be cloudy.

371
00:25:10,357 --> 00:25:12,674
That last time,
it was glass.

372
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,572
So what?

373
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:18,117
Cloudy, not cloudy,
it looks good enough to me.

374
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:21,677
"Good enough."

375
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:28,244
Yo, what are you doing?

376
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:35,533
Are you out of your mind?
I totally would've smoked that!

377
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:37,574
It's not for you,
it's for our customers.

378
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:40,099
They're gonna demand
a certain standard.

379
00:25:40,197 --> 00:25:41,083
What?

380
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:44,053
What are you...
What?

381
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,280
We'll just do it again...

382
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,145
until we get it right.

383
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,040
Walt...

384
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:20,220
Please have a seat
and join us.

385
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,840
We can do better.

386
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:15,154
Don't you fucking
think about it!

387
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:20,866
Three entire pounds
of pseudo wasted!

388
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:23,202
You know how long I had
to spin that stupid sign?

389
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:24,672
Get off me, psycho!

390
00:27:24,682 --> 00:27:26,291
Helicopter, bitch!

391
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:47,643
Open the door!

392
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,796
Come back here, you bitch!

393
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:13,815
I'm gonna mess you up!

394
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:29,394
I really need to understand
your thought

395
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:31,937
process because clearly I don't.

396
00:28:32,136 --> 00:28:33,643
I feel

397
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:37,052
that this decision
you've made

398
00:28:37,112 --> 00:28:39,518
is not only not
in your best interest,

399
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:43,110
it's not in the best interest
of our entire family.

400
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:45,931
- Look, Skyler...
- Not yet. Please.

401
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:48,644
I have the Talking Pillow.

402
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:53,763
Everybody gets to speak
their minds, remember?

403
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:56,121
And then, you'll get
your chance.

404
00:28:57,434 --> 00:29:01,318
Money has always been an issue for us,
I'll give you that.

405
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:04,361
But now that Elliott is more
than willing to pitch in,

406
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:07,894
I know, I understand that it's hard
for you to accept help.

407
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,183
Maybe it's the way
you were raised.

408
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,543
But, honey...

409
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,895
it's okay to lean
on people now and again.

410
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:18,916
You need this treatment,

411
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,880
and nothing can stop you
from getting it,

412
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:23,517
except you.

413
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:33,285
Am I allowed to respond?

414
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:34,714
In a minute.

415
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:37,778
I think we need to go
around the circle first.

416
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:42,776
Hank, would you
like to start?

417
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:48,455
Yeah.
Okay.

418
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:52,831
- Well, what I'll say is...
- No, take the Talking Pillow.

419
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:01,281
All right, look, buddy.

420
00:30:02,572 --> 00:30:06,095
I know I don't get to
tell you this enough, but...

421
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:10,458
I care...
about you...

422
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,809
a hell of a lot.

423
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:14,957
This cancer thing...

424
00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:18,038
Let's just...
Let's face it.

425
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:20,468
You know, you were
dealt a shit hand.

426
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:21,617
But...

427
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,801
sometimes your
luck can change.

428
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:28,235
I mean, I can't tell you how
many times I was, you know,

429
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:32,181
I started with a shit hand
and I ended up with a full house.

430
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:33,407
Okay?

431
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,541
I mean, the key is,
you gotta hang in there.

432
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:40,073
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets.
Keep placing your bets.

433
00:30:42,112 --> 00:30:45,319
Hank... what the hell
are you saying?

434
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:48,565
Please, Marie, let him talk.
That's what we're here to do.

435
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,750
Please.

436
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:52,476
Go on, Hank.

437
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,307
Right, well...

438
00:30:56,075 --> 00:30:58,043
Look at it this way, okay?

439
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,259
It's the bottom of the 9th.
Bases are loaded.

440
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,923
You're up.

441
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:05,857
But you got a bum arm.
Right?

442
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:09,394
There's no frickin' way
you're gonna hit a homer.

443
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:13,116
So you can either let
the pinch hitter take the bat,

444
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:17,020
or you can hold on to your pride
and lose the game.

445
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:19,529
Get what I'm saying?

446
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:21,842
No.

447
00:31:25,165 --> 00:31:28,291
You got your pride, man.
I get it. Okay? I get it.

448
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:32,275
If this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in,
I'm with your old lady on this one.

449
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:34,703
I say take the money
and run, you know.

450
00:31:38,517 --> 00:31:40,632
Somebody want to take this thing?
Here.

451
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:42,280
Yes, Walter...

452
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:45,850
Walter Jr.,
I'm sure you have about

453
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:50,222
a million things to say, probably,
and now is your chance.

454
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,362
Go ahead.
Just let it all out.

455
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:59,891
- This is bullshit.
- Hey, come on.

456
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:01,228
It's all right.

457
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:06,868
Talk.

458
00:32:08,023 --> 00:32:10,034
Tell your dad
how you feel.

459
00:32:13,455 --> 00:32:15,686
- I'm pissed off.
- Tell him.

460
00:32:17,045 --> 00:32:18,758
I'm pissed off,

461
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:21,452
'cause you're being...

462
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:23,956
You're...

463
00:32:26,315 --> 00:32:28,035
You're a pussy.

464
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:32,555
You're, like,
ready to give up.

465
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,016
God. What if you gave
up on me, huh?

466
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:51,524
This here? All the stuff
I've been through,

467
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:55,828
and you're scared
of a little chemotherapy?

468
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:12,656
Me, personally?

469
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:18,531
I think you should do
whatever you want to do.

470
00:33:19,986 --> 00:33:20,816
What?

471
00:33:22,225 --> 00:33:24,643
You told us to be
honest about our feelings.

472
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:27,087
Walt's the one with cancer.
It's his decision.

473
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:29,178
It's not up
to any of us.

474
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:32,140
Why in the hell
would you do this?

475
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,067
I wasn't planning
on agreeing with Walt.

476
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,493
But after sitting here
and listening to you all

477
00:33:39,502 --> 00:33:41,833
talk about his future
like he has no say in it.

478
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:44,029
He's not gonna
have a future

479
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,993
if he doesn't
get treatment.

480
00:33:46,005 --> 00:33:49,033
I am a medical
professional.

481
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:53,290
I x-ray people
in treatment every day.

482
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,021
I see them every day,
and you know what?

483
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:59,704
Some of them are
absolutely miserable.

484
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,398
- Marie...
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

485
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:05,094
And some of them
don't wanna spend

486
00:34:05,106 --> 00:34:07,757
their last weeks or months

487
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:10,150
being picked at by doctors.

488
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:12,994
But they got talked into it
by their families.

489
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:15,579
Could I get the pillow back?
I agree with Marie on that.

490
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,391
What? Maybe Walt wants
to die like a man.

491
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:20,902
I don't want him
to die at all!

492
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:25,289
That's the whole point of this.
So either help, or leave!

493
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,318
Skyler, I just wanted
to do you the courtesy

494
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:30,829
of giving you
my honest opinion.

495
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,397
You know, Marie,
this is not debate club.

496
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,286
This is my husband's life.

497
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,216
- I make one simple observation...
- My husband's life we're talking about!

498
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:43,444
- Ladies. Come on.
- How dare you...

499
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:49,723
This is so stupid.

500
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:58,224
All right, I've got
the Talking Pillow now.

501
00:34:58,767 --> 00:34:59,701
Okay?

502
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,673
We all, in this room,

503
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:15,696
we love each other.

504
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,060
We want what's best
for each other, and I know that.

505
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:22,876
I am very thankful for that.

506
00:35:24,395 --> 00:35:25,329
But...

507
00:35:26,395 --> 00:35:27,757
what I want...

508
00:35:30,455 --> 00:35:32,803
What I want,
what I need,

509
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:36,658
is a choice.

510
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:41,118
What does that... mean?

511
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:48,149
Sometimes, I feel like
I never actually

512
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:51,637
make any of my own.

513
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,211
Choices, I mean.

514
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,690
My entire life,

515
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:06,037
it just seems I never...

516
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:12,820
you know, had a real say
about any of it.

517
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,155
Now this last one,
cancer...

518
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:25,288
all I have left is how I choose
to approach this.

519
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:28,539
Then make the
right choice, Walt.

520
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:32,515
You're not the only
one it affects.

521
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:35,858
What about your son?

522
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,523
Don't you wanna see your
daughter grow up? I just...

523
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,813
Of course, I do.

524
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,810
Skyler, you've read
the statistics.

525
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:01,750
These doctors...

526
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,137
talking about surviving.

527
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:07,113
One year, two years,

528
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:09,694
like it's the only
thing that matters.

529
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,676
But what good is it,
to just survive

530
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:15,916
if I am too sick to work,

531
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,560
to enjoy a meal,

532
00:37:22,638 --> 00:37:24,130
to make love?

533
00:37:31,494 --> 00:37:33,505
For what time I have left,

534
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,962
I want to live
in my own house.

535
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:41,980
I want to sleep
in my own bed.

536
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:45,762
I don't wanna choke down 30
or 40 pills every single day,

537
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,071
lose my hair,
and lie around,

538
00:37:49,597 --> 00:37:51,426
too tired to get up...

539
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:57,474
and so nauseated that
I can't even move my head.

540
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:04,026
And you
cleaning up after me?

541
00:38:07,164 --> 00:38:08,578
Me, with...

542
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:15,576
some dead man,
some artificially alive,

543
00:38:17,248 --> 00:38:19,726
just marking time?

544
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:23,253
No. No.

545
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:30,504
And that's how
you would remember me.

546
00:38:36,986 --> 00:38:38,893
That's the worst part.

547
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:43,429
So...

548
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,048
that is my thought
process, Skyler.

549
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:51,106
I'm sorry.

550
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,061
I just...

551
00:38:56,866 --> 00:38:59,072
I choose not to do it.

552
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,964
All right.

553
00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:01,386
All right what?

554
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:06,996
I'll do the treatment.

555
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:40,253
It's gonna be okay.

556
00:42:08,638 --> 00:42:10,979
The lady from
the billing office said

557
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,602
they usually bill
the insurance company directly,

558
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,346
but since our HMO
is not paying for it,

559
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:18,945
we can pay up front
with a credit card.

560
00:42:19,295 --> 00:42:20,180
Good.

561
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:25,038
And then Elliott
will send a check.

562
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:28,437
I will take care of it.

563
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:35,566
Walter White?

564
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:37,288
Yes.

565
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:41,318
Okay.

566
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:46,084
See you in a minute.

567
00:44:18,135 --> 00:44:19,133
Elliott.

568
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:21,482
Walt, it's Gretchen.

569
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:24,565
Oh, hey.

570
00:44:25,226 --> 00:44:27,072
Hey, Gretchen.
How are you?

571
00:44:27,092 --> 00:44:30,688
You know, it was really great
seeing you two the other day.

572
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:33,255
What a party.

573
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:37,258
Elliott told me
about the cancer.

574
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:40,531
I'm so sorry.

575
00:44:43,316 --> 00:44:46,896
Well, you know,
it is what it is, I guess.

576
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:50,414
I don't know what
to say except

577
00:44:50,961 --> 00:44:53,184
I'm always here for you.

578
00:44:53,383 --> 00:44:56,341
Both of us are.
We wanted you to know that.

579
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,102
Yeah, well, thank you.

580
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:04,904
Walt, Elliott's told me

581
00:45:04,922 --> 00:45:07,224
he had offered to pay
for the treatment.

582
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:08,676
You have to accept.

583
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:11,368
That money, as far
as we're both concerned,

584
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:13,393
that belongs to you.

585
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:16,551
Even the name of our company,
it's half yours.

586
00:45:19,526 --> 00:45:20,393
Walt...

587
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:25,904
Is this about
you and me?

588
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,127
Gretchen, I really
appreciate the offer. I do.

589
00:45:43,045 --> 00:45:44,531
But we're fine.

590
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:49,771
As it turns out, the insurance
came through after all.

591
00:45:49,812 --> 00:45:53,052
So... I am covered.

592
00:45:55,696 --> 00:45:59,446
Well, anyway,
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

593
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:03,280
Good, that's good news.

594
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:08,291
You know, that really
was a great party.

595
00:46:11,683 --> 00:46:13,341
Keep in touch, okay?

596
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:15,000
Sure. Sure.

597
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,337
Thank you for calling.

598
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:19,131
You wanna cook?
