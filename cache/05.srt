1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
After defeating Zoom
and saving the multiverse,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I ran back in time and created

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I restored the timeline to how it was,

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
only to find things weren't as I left them.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I brought new threats to our world,

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,732
Previously on “The Flash”...

28
00:00:01,742 --> 00:00:01,734
&nbsp

29
00:00:01,744 --> 00:00:03,634
We have to think
about getting back to our Earth.

30
00:00:03,644 --> 00:00:03,636
&nbsp

31
00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:05,069
We've been here long enough.

32
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:05,071
&nbsp

33
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:06,637
A whole multiverse
of Harrison Wells out there.

34
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:06,639
&nbsp

35
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:09,139
You want one? Let's go get one.

36
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:09,141
&nbsp

37
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:10,808
Wells with a sense of humor.

38
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:10,810
&nbsp

39
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,810
- Harrison.
- Call me H.R.

40
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:12,812
&nbsp

41
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:14,611
Out with the old, in with the new.

42
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:14,613
&nbsp

43
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:15,980
What are you doing here?

44
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:15,982
&nbsp

45
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:18,782
"“Julian Albert, meta-human CSI specialist”"

46
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:18,784
&nbsp

47
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:21,819
I don't trust you, and I don't
like things that I don't trust.

48
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:21,821
&nbsp

49
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:23,887
How have I worked
with this guy for the past year?

50
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:23,889
&nbsp

51
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,422
You say that all the time.

52
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:25,424
&nbsp

53
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:26,957
Do you maybe want to grab
some dinner tonight?

54
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:26,959
&nbsp

55
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,026
I got movie night with my kids
tonight. Rain check?

56
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:29,028
&nbsp

57
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:30,694
You were the only one who wasn't affected

58
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:30,696
&nbsp

59
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:32,029
when I messed with the timeline.

60
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:49,715
&nbsp

61
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,181
- Yo!
- You know you don't

62
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:51,183
&nbsp

63
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:52,983
need to do this every morning, right?

64
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:52,985
&nbsp

65
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:54,184
Oh, come on, it's the least I can do.

66
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:54,186
&nbsp

67
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:55,786
I mean, I love Joe, but at some point,

68
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:55,788
&nbsp

69
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,321
man needs his own space,

70
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:57,323
&nbsp

71
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,590
and until I find my own space,
that means your space.

72
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,592
&nbsp

73
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:01,959
So as a token of my appreciation,

74
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:01,961
&nbsp

75
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:04,294
two eggs over easy, bacon, toast...

76
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:04,296
&nbsp

77
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:06,163
I can't remember, do you
like it buttered or not?

78
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:06,165
&nbsp

79
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:09,600
Barry, sometimes a man just
wants to butter his own bread.

80
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:09,602
&nbsp

81
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:11,702
Okay, sorry. I was just...

82
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:11,704
&nbsp

83
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:12,970
Yeah, no, you're right, I...

84
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:12,972
&nbsp

85
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:14,872
Look, don't get it twisted, okay?

86
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:14,874
&nbsp

87
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:17,174
I love having you here.
You're a great guest.

88
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:17,176
&nbsp

89
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:19,676
I'm not sure how I feel
about our other visitor, though.

90
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:19,678
&nbsp

91
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:20,644
Wells?

92
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:20,646
&nbsp

93
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:21,912
“Please, call me H.R.”

94
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:21,914
&nbsp

95
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:23,480
So you don't like him?

96
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:23,482
&nbsp

97
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:25,215
Oh, it's not so much that I don't like him.

98
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:25,217
&nbsp

99
00:01:25,227 --> 00:01:29,153
I just... the way he says things,
there's something about him.

100
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:29,155
&nbsp

101
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:30,921
I don't know what it is.

102
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:30,923
&nbsp

103
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,123
Dude, he's only been here
a few days; let him settle in.

104
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:33,125
&nbsp

105
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,626
I know we've had
our Wells issues in the past,

106
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:35,628
&nbsp

107
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,795
but you can't just stop trusting everybody

108
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:37,797
&nbsp

109
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:39,129
or giving them chances.

110
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:39,131
&nbsp

111
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,564
You know? You can't live like that.

112
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:40,566
&nbsp

113
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:43,400
This is true. Wise words from a wise man.

114
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,402
&nbsp

115
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:44,568
Joe Knowledge.

116
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:44,570
&nbsp

117
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,437
I'm gonna take this to go.

118
00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:46,439
&nbsp

119
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:48,505
- Okay. All right.
- Uh, I'll see you there.

120
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:48,507
&nbsp

121
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:49,706
Yeah. Oh, I can take you.

122
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:49,708
&nbsp

123
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:52,342
No. No.

124
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:52,344
&nbsp

125
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:55,045
I'm gonna drive myself today.

126
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:55,047
&nbsp

127
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:58,015
Yeah, cool. Cool.

128
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:16,235
&nbsp

129
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:18,702
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Dr. Tannhauser.

130
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:18,704
&nbsp

131
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:20,237
Do you have an appointment?

132
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:20,239
&nbsp

133
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:22,439
No, but I'm pretty sure she'll see me.

134
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:22,441
&nbsp

135
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:24,174
You can just tell her Caitlin Snow is here.

136
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:24,176
&nbsp

137
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,076
Dr. Tannhauser's a very busy woman.

138
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:26,078
&nbsp

139
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:27,511
I'm sure you can understand.

140
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:27,513
&nbsp

141
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,279
I appreciate the diligence, Jackie,

142
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:29,281
&nbsp

143
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,281
but Caitlin's always welcome here,

144
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:31,283
&nbsp

145
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:33,617
even if I wish she'd call first.

146
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:33,619
&nbsp

147
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,220
Nice to see you too, Mom.

148
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,991
&nbsp

149
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,125
So what brings you here?

150
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:41,127
&nbsp

151
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,793
I didn't forget your birthday, did I?

152
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:42,795
&nbsp

153
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:43,927
I'm pretty sure I sent a card.

154
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:43,929
&nbsp

155
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,630
You did... in April.

156
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:46,632
&nbsp

157
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,132
Thank you.

158
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:48,134
&nbsp

159
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:50,334
Look, I read your new paper on applications

160
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:50,336
&nbsp

161
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:53,537
in cryo-medicine, and I think
you might be able to help.

162
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:53,539
&nbsp

163
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,439
I had no idea you kept up on the literature

164
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:55,441
&nbsp

165
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:56,773
over at S.T.A.R. Labs.

166
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:56,775
&nbsp

167
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:58,342
That's still what it's called, right?

168
00:02:58,352 --> 00:02:58,344
&nbsp

169
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:01,945
Yes, and I have a patient
who could use your help.

170
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:01,947
&nbsp

171
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:03,547
Well, if you want to send over the file,

172
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:03,549
&nbsp

173
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,415
I'll be happy to take a look
when I have a chance,

174
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:05,417
&nbsp

175
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:06,683
but right now, I have a shareholder meeting

176
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:06,685
&nbsp

177
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:08,785
- to prepare for and...
- Mom!

178
00:03:08,795 --> 00:03:15,761
&nbsp

179
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:18,195
I'm the patient.

180
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:20,699
&nbsp

181
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,132
Cancel my appointments,

182
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:22,134
&nbsp

183
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:25,335
and have Nigel meet me in the bio-lab.

184
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:25,337
&nbsp

185
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:27,104
We have work to do.

186
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:28,856

&nbsp

189
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:41,718
Sumptuous day.

190
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:41,720
&nbsp

191
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,454
Oh, no, on this Earth, I believe you say...

192
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:44,456
&nbsp

193
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:46,290
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

194
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,292
&nbsp

195
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:48,892
And it is, isn't it? I mean...

196
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:50,763
&nbsp

197
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,996
The music on your Earth,
well, it strikes a chord,

198
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:52,998
&nbsp

199
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:54,331
no pun intended.

200
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:54,333
&nbsp

201
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:56,099
Please, help yourself.

202
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:56,101
&nbsp

203
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,568
I find a crew works best

204
00:03:57,578 --> 00:03:57,570
&nbsp

205
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,136
when it's well-fed and well-rested.

206
00:03:59,146 --> 00:03:59,138
&nbsp

207
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:00,904
Are those coffees for us too?

208
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:00,906
&nbsp

209
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,507
Yes indeed, Miss West.

210
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:03,509
&nbsp

211
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,777
I took the liberty of reading
through your ledgers last night.

212
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:06,779
&nbsp

213
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,479
A lot of information to absorb,
but let's see how I did.

214
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:09,481
&nbsp

215
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:11,949
Skim milk chai latte.

216
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:11,951
&nbsp

217
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,550
- Okay.
- Okay.

218
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,552
&nbsp

219
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:17,888
And an iced Americano with two... no,

220
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:17,890
&nbsp

221
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,158
- three shots of espresso.
- Boom.

222
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:21,160
&nbsp

223
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,826
That happened, Walter.

224
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:22,828
&nbsp

225
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:24,661
- Wally.
- Wally.

226
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:24,663
&nbsp

227
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:27,764
Now, for my fleet-of-foot friend...

228
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:27,766
&nbsp

229
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:30,234
oh, you'd best stick to decaf.

230
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:30,236
&nbsp

231
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:32,603
Probably for the best, yeah.

232
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:34,173
&nbsp

233
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:36,106
San Francisco.

234
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:36,108
&nbsp

235
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:39,543
I have “prepar-e”" a French roast

236
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:39,545
&nbsp

237
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:41,445
with a touch of creamer.

238
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:41,447
&nbsp

239
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:44,114
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

240
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:44,116
&nbsp

241
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:46,817
Did you know, on my Earth,

242
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:46,819
&nbsp

243
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,419
coffee crop was wiped out by blight?

244
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:49,421
&nbsp

245
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:53,357
I mean, that's one more reason
to stay on this Earth,

246
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:53,359
&nbsp

247
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:55,425
for the coffee alone.

248
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:55,427
&nbsp

249
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:56,994
Yeah, though that's if you stay.

250
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:56,996
&nbsp

251
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,862
If I stay. Time is of the essence.

252
00:04:58,872 --> 00:04:58,864
&nbsp

253
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:01,231
Here's what I propose, a series
of team-building exercises.

254
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:01,233
&nbsp

255
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:02,733
Now, I've hidden a series of clues

256
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:02,735
&nbsp

257
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:04,001
all around the facility.

258
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:04,003
&nbsp

259
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,269
What I propose is,

260
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,271
&nbsp

261
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:07,170
we break into two groups, all right,

262
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,172
&nbsp

263
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,672
and you can pick a partner; you're...

264
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:08,674
&nbsp

265
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,040
Okay, okay.

266
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,042
&nbsp

267
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:13,543
I have to stop you, H.R.
I am not feeling this.

268
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:13,545
&nbsp

269
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:15,545
It's the roast, isn't it?
I should have gone with a dark...

270
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:15,547
&nbsp

271
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:19,082
No, it's not the roast. The roast is fine.

272
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:19,084
&nbsp

273
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:20,517
Our trust isn't something

274
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:20,519
&nbsp

275
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,219
that you can just build with games.

276
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:22,221
&nbsp

277
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:23,820
- Okay?
- No.

278
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,822
&nbsp

279
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:25,789
This is something
that goes back three years.

280
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:25,791
&nbsp

281
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,591
It's something that's been forged in fire,

282
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:27,593
&nbsp

283
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,792
sometimes literally,

284
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:28,794
&nbsp

285
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:31,762
so maybe you should just step back

286
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:31,764
&nbsp

287
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:33,830
and observe, see what we do here,

288
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:33,832
&nbsp

289
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:35,365
how we operate. Did you get that?

290
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:35,367
&nbsp

291
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,367
Excellent note. I'm gonna run with that.

292
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:37,369
&nbsp

293
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,602
Where's Caitlin, by the way? Have you...

294
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:38,604
&nbsp

295
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:40,537
- Yes. So she was here.
- She was?

296
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:40,539
&nbsp

297
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,172
All right, yeah, you know,
we talked, and she...

298
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:42,174
&nbsp

299
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:43,307
What?

300
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:43,309
&nbsp

301
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,741
Knocked back a triple-shot latte,

302
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:44,743
&nbsp

303
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:48,745
and she left you a message, so I'm gonna...

304
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:48,747
&nbsp

305
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:51,048
Uh, I... yeah, let me just play it for you.

306
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:51,050
&nbsp

307
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,849
This is not the same as my Earth's.

308
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:52,851
&nbsp

309
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:54,751
This is a different...

310
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:54,753
&nbsp

311
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:55,786
There it is.

312
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:55,788
&nbsp

313
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:57,354
Hey, it's me.

314
00:05:57,364 --> 00:05:57,356
&nbsp

315
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,022
I've got some things I need to take care of.

316
00:05:59,032 --> 00:05:59,024
&nbsp

317
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,458
I shouldn't be gone more than a few days.

318
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:01,460
&nbsp

319
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,260
See if you can get along without me.

320
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,262
&nbsp

321
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:06,930
Make sure Cisco doesn't touch
my pizza pockets.

322
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:06,932
&nbsp

323
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:08,198
Wasn't labeled.

324
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:08,200
&nbsp

325
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,533
Okay, you know what, guys?

326
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:09,535
&nbsp

327
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:11,068
I got to go to work. I'm running late.

328
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:11,070
&nbsp

329
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,302
Ooh, yeah. I got to do that too.

330
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:12,304
&nbsp

331
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:13,503
- Yeah, let's go.
- I got to bail.

332
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:13,505
&nbsp

333
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:14,871
Oh. You know, we'll do

334
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:14,873
&nbsp

335
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:16,340
the team-building exercises another...

336
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,342
&nbsp

337
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:17,974
I'll leave the clues hidden in the facility.

338
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:17,976
&nbsp

339
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,609
Cool. How do you guys say
“see you later” over there?

340
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:19,611
&nbsp

341
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:22,279
Ah. “Until next communion.”

342
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:22,281
&nbsp

343
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,614
- All right, see you later.
- See you later.

344
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:24,616
&nbsp

345
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:26,149
So weird.

346
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:28,687
&nbsp

347
00:06:28,697 --> 00:06:29,786
Come.

348
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:29,788
&nbsp

349
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:30,921
Hey, sorry I'm late.

350
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:30,923
&nbsp

351
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,889
I had to meet somebody and...

352
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,126
&nbsp

353
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:36,193
You can add tardiness to the list, Captain.

354
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:36,195
&nbsp

355
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:38,362
Allen, it's been brought to my attention

356
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:38,364
&nbsp

357
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:40,630
that you've been giving yourself
unauthorized access

358
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:40,632
&nbsp

359
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:42,065
to your colleagues' case files.

360
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:42,067
&nbsp

361
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:43,266
Excuse me?

362
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:43,268
&nbsp

363
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,868
Along with multiple infractions,

364
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:44,870
&nbsp

365
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,236
repeated absences,

366
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:46,238
&nbsp

367
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:47,738
disappearing throughout the day,

368
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:47,740
&nbsp

369
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,906
phone call interruptions, guests in the lab.

370
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:49,908
&nbsp

371
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,576
The list is pretty extensive, Captain.

372
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:52,578
&nbsp

373
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:54,611
I'm sorry, with all due respect,

374
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:54,613
&nbsp

375
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,179
I do my job here.

376
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:56,181
&nbsp

377
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:58,315
You do good work here, Allen.

378
00:06:58,325 --> 00:06:58,317
&nbsp

379
00:06:58,327 --> 00:06:59,716
Don't put that in jeopardy by thinking

380
00:06:59,726 --> 00:06:59,718
&nbsp

381
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,351
the rules don't apply to you.

382
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:01,353
&nbsp

383
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:02,386
Understood?

384
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:02,388
&nbsp

385
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:04,087
Yes, sir.

386
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:04,089
&nbsp

387
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,757
Sorry, Captain, that's it?

388
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:06,759
&nbsp

389
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,592
Sir, I document eight different...

390
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:08,594
&nbsp

391
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:09,960
Nine.

392
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:09,962
&nbsp

393
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,628
Nine different violations of regulations,

394
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:11,630
&nbsp

395
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,398
and he gets a 15 second talking to?

396
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:14,400
&nbsp

397
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,866
Must be nice.

398
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:15,868
&nbsp

399
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,869
We are done here. You can go.

400
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,807
&nbsp

401
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,440
Captain.

402
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,713
&nbsp

403
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:29,546
Were you really just being a tattletale?

404
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:29,548
&nbsp

405
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:32,015
- That's bush league, man.
- You know what? You're right.

406
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:32,017
&nbsp

407
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:34,117
Silly me to think the rules actually apply

408
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:34,119
&nbsp

409
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,920
to the golden boy of CCPD's crime lab.

410
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:36,922
&nbsp

411
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:38,789
Detective.

412
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:38,791
&nbsp

413
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,424
- He's unbelievable.
- You know what?

414
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:40,426
&nbsp

415
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:43,026
I wish you two could be
a little less oil and water

416
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:43,028
&nbsp

417
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:44,628
and a little bit more oil and vinegar.

418
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:44,630
&nbsp

419
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,962
You guys have been at each other's throats

420
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:45,964
&nbsp

421
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:47,364
- for a year now.
- That's just it.

422
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:47,366
&nbsp

423
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:48,999
From my perspective, it's been two weeks.

424
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:49,001
&nbsp

425
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,001
So you're saying that before two weeks ago,

426
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:51,003
&nbsp

427
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,602
you weren't Julian's enemy?

428
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:52,604
&nbsp

429
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,471
I'm saying before two weeks ago,

430
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:54,473
&nbsp

431
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,839
Julian didn't even exist.

432
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:55,841
&nbsp

433
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,374
It's because of your Flashpoint.

434
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:57,376
&nbsp

435
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:58,742
I know it's because of the Flashpoint.

436
00:07:58,752 --> 00:07:59,945
&nbsp

437
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:01,211
Cisco.

438
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:01,213
&nbsp

439
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,546
Hey, is this important?

440
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:02,548
&nbsp

441
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:03,680
I don't know; does 30 hits downtown

442
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:03,682
&nbsp

443
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,315
on the meta-human app count?

444
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:05,317
&nbsp

445
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:06,917
- What are we looking at?
- Well, nothing really.

446
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:06,919
&nbsp

447
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:08,585
Every traffic cam in a ten-block radius

448
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:08,587
&nbsp

449
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:10,187
suddenly went down, so we're flying blind,

450
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:10,189
&nbsp

451
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,621
and the hits are all over the map.

452
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:11,623
&nbsp

453
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:12,856
All right, well, there's one way to see

454
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:12,858
&nbsp

455
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,724
what's going on. I got to go.

456
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:14,726
&nbsp

457
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:17,227
Most of the chatter's coming
from the harbor district.

458
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:19,698
&nbsp

459
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,265
All right, I'm here. It's a bad scene, man.

460
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:23,702
&nbsp

461
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,168
You should be right on top of it, Barry.

462
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:25,170
&nbsp

463
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,203
What is it?

464
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:26,205
&nbsp

465
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,839
It's a... monster?

466
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:40,334
&nbsp

467
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:41,566
Guys, did you hear me?

468
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:41,568
&nbsp

469
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:43,935
There is a monster in Central City.

470
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:43,937
&nbsp

471
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:45,236
What are we talking?

472
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:45,238
&nbsp

473
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,571
Yao Ming size or Andre the Giant?

474
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:46,573
&nbsp

475
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,374
No, it's, like, an actual monster.

476
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:49,376
&nbsp

477
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:51,576
- What even makes that?
- I don't even know that.

478
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:51,578
&nbsp

479
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:53,878
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite, show me something.

480
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:53,880
&nbsp

481
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,180
Whoa.

482
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,182
&nbsp

483
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:56,848
You ever see anything like that on Earth-19?

484
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:56,850
&nbsp

485
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,719
You want me to observe. I'll just observe.

486
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:20,107
&nbsp

487
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:21,673
Iris, what are you doing here?

488
00:09:21,683 --> 00:09:21,675
&nbsp

489
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:23,108
Working on a story,

490
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:23,110
&nbsp

491
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,542
and last time I checked, you don't need

492
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:24,544
&nbsp

493
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:25,677
super-speed and a red suit to help people.

494
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:27,347
&nbsp

495
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:28,546
All right, get out of here.

496
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:28,548
&nbsp

497
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:29,981
I'm gonna try to stop that thing.

498
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:29,983
&nbsp

499
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:31,816
Come on, come on, come on.

500
00:09:31,826 --> 00:09:31,818
&nbsp

501
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:33,385
Cisco, where'd it go?

502
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:33,387
&nbsp

503
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:34,953
Can't track it if I can't see it.

504
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:34,955
&nbsp

505
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,821
Know what you could do? Could use your ears.

506
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:36,823
&nbsp

507
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,922
My ears?

508
00:09:37,932 --> 00:09:37,924
&nbsp

509
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:39,424
What's that sound?

510
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:39,426
&nbsp

511
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:41,059
It's a car alarm; I can use the car alarms

512
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:41,061
&nbsp

513
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,994
to track the direction
the monster's heading in.

514
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:44,031
&nbsp

515
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,064
We got him. Head north three blocks.

516
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:50,704
&nbsp

517
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,103
I lost him.

518
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,106
&nbsp

519
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:54,606
Yeah, me too.

520
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:59,379
&nbsp

521
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:00,745
I don't get it. I don't get it.

522
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:00,747
&nbsp

523
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:02,013
Every meta-human we've encountered

524
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:02,015
&nbsp

525
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,848
has been exactly that, meta-human,

526
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:03,850
&nbsp

527
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,684
so where did this thing come from?

528
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:05,686
&nbsp

529
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:07,385
I don't know where it came from, man.

530
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:07,387
&nbsp

531
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:09,287
I just... it just vanished.
That's all I know. It was gone.

532
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:09,289
&nbsp

533
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:13,458
Yeah, but in my experience,
things are always different.

534
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:13,460
&nbsp

535
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,826
- What?
- Than they appear.

536
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:14,828
&nbsp

537
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:16,294
There must be a reason the darn thing

538
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:16,296
&nbsp

539
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:18,196
can just disappear like that.

540
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:18,198
&nbsp

541
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,231
Maybe the darn thing's got
some kind of cloaking mechanism.

542
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:20,233
&nbsp

543
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:22,267
That's a good idea,
but right now, I would settle

544
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:22,269
&nbsp

545
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,169
- for “how can we stop it?”
- Yes, obviously.

546
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:24,171
&nbsp

547
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:25,537
- Just how?
- I don't know.

548
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:25,539
&nbsp

549
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:27,605
We don't have a magic monster lasso.

550
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:27,607
&nbsp

551
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,674
But you know what we could...

552
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:29,676
&nbsp

553
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:32,977
Oh, sorry. I forgot.
I'm just... I'm just observing.

554
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:32,979
&nbsp

555
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:34,179
No, H.R., please.

556
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:34,181
&nbsp

557
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:35,747
We're open to any idea right now.

558
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:35,749
&nbsp

559
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,982
On my Earth, we have ropes
made out of carbon fiber.

560
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:37,984
&nbsp

561
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:40,118
They are ultralight but strong enough

562
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:40,120
&nbsp

563
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,887
to pull a battleship;
we could restrain it with that.

564
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:42,889
&nbsp

565
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,422
Right? What do you think?

566
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:44,424
&nbsp

567
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,458
- Okay, I think it's...
- Okay.

568
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:46,460
&nbsp

569
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,859
I think it's worth a shot; we can spin it

570
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:47,861
&nbsp

571
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:49,961
- down in my workshop.
- Yes. Good.

572
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:49,963
&nbsp

573
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:52,063
Yeah, there was something else
that was weird, though.

574
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:52,065
&nbsp

575
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:55,567
I... I saw a transformer explode
as this thing passed by it.

576
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:55,569
&nbsp

577
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,268
- That is weird.
- What's weird about that?

578
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:57,270
&nbsp

579
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,703
Monster didn't even lay a finger on it.

580
00:10:58,713 --> 00:10:58,705
&nbsp

581
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:00,371
It exploded before it got to it.

582
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:00,373
&nbsp

583
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:01,973
Kind of reminds me of that Hitchcock movie

584
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:01,975
&nbsp

585
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,209
where the extra covers his ears
before the gun goes off.

586
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:04,211
&nbsp

587
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:05,410
You have Hitchcock on this Earth?

588
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,412
&nbsp

589
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:06,845
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, brilliant.

590
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:06,847
&nbsp

591
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:08,213
“Murder on the Titanic”!

592
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:08,215
&nbsp

593
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:10,048
"“Who did it? Who cares?
We're drowning”"

594
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:10,050
&nbsp

595
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,417
The beast must emit
some kind of electrical pulse.

596
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:12,419
&nbsp

597
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,452
Is there a way I could get
a look at that transformer?

598
00:11:14,462 --> 00:11:14,454
&nbsp

599
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,254
No. It's... the whole place
is a crime scene now

600
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:16,256
&nbsp

601
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,555
with Julian in charge of it.

602
00:11:17,565 --> 00:11:17,557
&nbsp

603
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,724
Ah, Julian. Who's that?

604
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:19,726
&nbsp

605
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:23,027
That's the CSI guy you don't like, right?

606
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:23,029
&nbsp

607
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,696
I mean...

608
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:25,532
&nbsp

609
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:26,965
Yeah, all right.

610
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:31,271
&nbsp

611
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,271
He's great.

612
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:36,042
&nbsp

613
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:37,509
Sorry, cold hands.

614
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:37,511
&nbsp

615
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,911
I didn't even notice.

616
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:39,913
&nbsp

617
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:41,179
I'm Nigel, by the way.

618
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:41,181
&nbsp

619
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:42,647
Nice to meet you.

620
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:44,084
&nbsp

621
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:46,584
We're gonna help you
figure this out, Caitlin.

622
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:46,586
&nbsp

623
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:48,653
Let's get you to the lab.

624
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:51,992
&nbsp

625
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,792
What's this?

626
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:53,794
&nbsp

627
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:56,628
It's to test how your ability
affects molecular motion.

628
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:56,630
&nbsp

629
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,363
That shaft is solid tungsten,

630
00:11:58,373 --> 00:11:58,365
&nbsp

631
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,532
and it's heated to
over 2,000 degrees centigrade.

632
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:00,534
&nbsp

633
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:02,066
I want you to cool it down,

634
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:02,068
&nbsp

635
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:04,235
and when we determine how you can do that,

636
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:04,237
&nbsp

637
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,037
we can figure out the best way to help you.

638
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:06,039
&nbsp

639
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:07,939
Best we could do in such little time.

640
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:07,941
&nbsp

641
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:10,608
So this is where you've been
for the last hour.

642
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:10,610
&nbsp

643
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,111
I had to reschedule my day
for this, Caitlin.

644
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:13,113
&nbsp

645
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,547
A lot of things around here
require my attention.

646
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:15,549
&nbsp

647
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,981
I remember.

648
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:16,983
&nbsp

649
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:20,118
Whenever you're ready.

650
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:24,724
&nbsp

651
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,591
Don't hold back.

652
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:48,515
&nbsp

653
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,648
Hey, Julian.

654
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:50,650
&nbsp

655
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,483
Hmm. You seen this?

656
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:52,485
&nbsp

657
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,652
It's bad enough we have
the metas destroying the city.

658
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:54,654
&nbsp

659
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:56,087
Now we have this thing to worry about.

660
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:56,089
&nbsp

661
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:57,789
- Mm-hmm.
- Is there any point

662
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:57,791
&nbsp

663
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,190
in me asking where you've been
for the last hour?

664
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,192
&nbsp

665
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:00,458
Or should I just assume the rules

666
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:00,460
&nbsp

667
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,860
still don't apply to you?

668
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:01,862
&nbsp

669
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:04,529
I was... I...

670
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:04,531
&nbsp

671
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,897
Yes, okay.

672
00:13:05,907 --> 00:13:05,899
&nbsp

673
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:08,600
Look, hey, man, so I know that...

674
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:08,602
&nbsp

675
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:10,068
you and I, we got off on the wrong foot.

676
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:10,070
&nbsp

677
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,704
We never managed to find the right one,

678
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:12,706
&nbsp

679
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:14,072
and I'll take that.

680
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:14,074
&nbsp

681
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,241
That's probably my fault, but I just...

682
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:16,243
&nbsp

683
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,210
I don't want things to be
like that anymore, you know?

684
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,212
&nbsp

685
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:22,013
I... I'd... like it if things changed.

686
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:22,015
&nbsp

687
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,615
It's funny, 'cause I remember you saying

688
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:23,617
&nbsp

689
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:24,816
something similar to that
right before you stole

690
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:24,818
&nbsp

691
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,918
the case from underneath me.

692
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:26,920
&nbsp

693
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,086
Do you have idea what it's like

694
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:28,088
&nbsp

695
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,487
to work side by side with someone

696
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:29,489
&nbsp

697
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:31,422
with such little regard for the rules?

698
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:31,424
&nbsp

699
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:34,626
You may very well be contaminating my work.

700
00:13:34,636 --> 00:13:34,628
&nbsp

701
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:39,197
That's exactly why I want to learn from you.

702
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:39,199
&nbsp

703
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,632
I don't follow.

704
00:13:40,642 --> 00:13:40,634
&nbsp

705
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:43,268
I just... you know,
whenever I read your reports,

706
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:43,270
&nbsp

707
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,504
it's clear that your
evidence collection techniques

708
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:46,506
&nbsp

709
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:50,174
are far superior to mine.

710
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:51,878
&nbsp

711
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:53,945
Go on.

712
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:53,947
&nbsp

713
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,281
I don't know; I mean,
if I could just shadow you

714
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:56,283
&nbsp

715
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:00,051
for a day, maybe ask a few questions,

716
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:00,053
&nbsp

717
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:02,287
I think that you could
really help bring my skills

718
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:02,289
&nbsp

719
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,522
up to... snuff.

720
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:04,524
&nbsp

721
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:07,425
What do you say?

722
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:07,427
&nbsp

723
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:10,161
Sorry.

724
00:14:10,171 --> 00:14:10,163
&nbsp

725
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,630
What if I gave up the lab?

726
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:12,632
&nbsp

727
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:15,300
There's a storeroom downstairs
that I could convert,

728
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,302
&nbsp

729
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,971
so if you let me follow you
on this case, lab's yours.

730
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:19,973
&nbsp

731
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:22,340
Lab's mine?

732
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:22,342
&nbsp

733
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,475
Okay. Deal.

734
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:24,477
&nbsp

735
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:26,077
You can't slow me down, though.

736
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:26,079
&nbsp

737
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,314
- I would never.
- All right. I'll call you.

738
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:33,353
&nbsp

739
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:34,953
How long have you had these abilities?

740
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:34,955
&nbsp

741
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:37,622
They started manifesting a few months ago,

742
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:37,624
&nbsp

743
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:39,023
but I'm assuming I got them

744
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:39,025
&nbsp

745
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:40,491
when the particle accelerator exploded,

746
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:40,493
&nbsp

747
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:42,093
just like all the other metas.

748
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:42,095
&nbsp

749
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:43,328
And you haven't told anyone?

750
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:43,330
&nbsp

751
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,629
Just you.

752
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:44,631
&nbsp

753
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:46,197
I told you, you never should have taken

754
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:46,199
&nbsp

755
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,865
that job at S.T.A.R. Labs.

756
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:47,867
&nbsp

757
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:49,133
You could have stayed here,

758
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:49,135
&nbsp

759
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,235
had access to world-class facilities.

760
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:51,237
&nbsp

761
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:52,704
And have all of my work be

762
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:52,706
&nbsp

763
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:55,006
in the shadow of your reputation.

764
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:55,008
&nbsp

765
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:57,241
Of course, the only time
you need your mother

766
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:57,243
&nbsp

767
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:58,476
is when you're in trouble.

768
00:14:58,486 --> 00:14:58,478
&nbsp

769
00:14:58,488 --> 00:15:00,178
What's that supposed to mean?

770
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:00,180
&nbsp

771
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,312
Oh, come on, darling.

772
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:01,314
&nbsp

773
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:02,814
You ran off to Central City

774
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:02,816
&nbsp

775
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:05,316
to play scientist with that disgraced quack.

776
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:05,318
&nbsp

777
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:07,485
I was trying to make a name for myself.

778
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:07,487
&nbsp

779
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:09,821
For three years, barely a word,

780
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:09,823
&nbsp

781
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,923
until trouble hits, and then here you come,

782
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:11,925
&nbsp

783
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:13,558
walking through the door and expecting Mommy

784
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:13,560
&nbsp

785
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,027
to drop everything in her life
to try to fix it.

786
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:16,029
&nbsp

787
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,496
You have no idea what I've been through...

788
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:18,498
&nbsp

789
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:21,165
Dr. Tannhauser, look at this.

790
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:28,141
&nbsp

791
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:31,109
She's absorbed all that energy?

792
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:31,111
&nbsp

793
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:32,643
How?

794
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:32,645
&nbsp

795
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,712
I'm not sure yet,
but if we can figure that out,

796
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:34,714
&nbsp

797
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:36,881
this could change
everything we're doing here.

798
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:42,255
&nbsp

799
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,756
So then The Flash... my Flash,
again, not your Flash...

800
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:44,758
&nbsp

801
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:47,892
we hatched a plan to gather
all the remaining meta-humans

802
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:47,894
&nbsp

803
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:50,461
into one place for a final showdown.

804
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:50,463
&nbsp

805
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:53,064
They called it “World War M.”
It was glorious.

806
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:53,066
&nbsp

807
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:55,733
Two forces on opposing sides of the stadium.

808
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:55,735
&nbsp

809
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:57,035
The tension built. No.

810
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:57,037
&nbsp

811
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,903
It was like that movie

812
00:15:58,913 --> 00:15:58,905
&nbsp

813
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:01,205
where the gladiator was the lead gladiator.

814
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:01,207
&nbsp

815
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:02,507
What was that called?

816
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:02,509
&nbsp

817
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,108
“Gladiator.”

818
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:04,110
&nbsp

819
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,610
That's better; on my Earth,

820
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:05,612
&nbsp

821
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:07,512
it was called “Sweaty Men, ”
and that didn't take.

822
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:07,514
&nbsp

823
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:10,214
So the two forces charge
into battle, and when they do...

824
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:10,216
&nbsp

825
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,016
- I need to take a five.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

826
00:16:12,026 --> 00:16:12,018
&nbsp

827
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:13,584
- Let's take a break.
- By myself.

828
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:13,586
&nbsp

829
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:16,654
Yeah, you go ahead.
I'll keep working on this.

830
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:22,062
&nbsp

831
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:26,431
So entry AAA:2.

832
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:26,433
&nbsp

833
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,000
Plan is proceeding. Characters are in place.

834
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,002
&nbsp

835
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:32,270
Nobody seems the wiser as to why I'm here.

836
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,869
&nbsp

837
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,002
- Hey.
- I had to give

838
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:39,004
&nbsp

839
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:40,470
a witness report on the attack,

840
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,472
&nbsp

841
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,005
and I thought I would make it a lunch date.

842
00:16:42,015 --> 00:16:42,007
&nbsp

843
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:43,673
Yeah, cool. Clear a spot.

844
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:43,675
&nbsp

845
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:46,376
- Let's do this. Ahh.
- Yeah.

846
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:46,378
&nbsp

847
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:48,144
Are things any better with Julian?

848
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:48,146
&nbsp

849
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:49,746
Oh, my God, it's like, every time

850
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:49,748
&nbsp

851
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,614
I try to get to know the guy,
he does something

852
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:51,616
&nbsp

853
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,483
that makes it really hard to.

854
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:53,485
&nbsp

855
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:55,451
All I know now is that
he dislikes meta-humans

856
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:55,453
&nbsp

857
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:57,420
about as much as he dislikes me.

858
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,422
&nbsp

859
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,856
Maybe you should try and
see things from his perspective.

860
00:16:59,866 --> 00:16:59,858
&nbsp

861
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,691
He might have a reason
to dislike both of you

862
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:01,693
&nbsp

863
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:03,126
that you don't know anything about.

864
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:03,128
&nbsp

865
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:04,994
Did you just hit me with a Joe-ism?

866
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:04,996
&nbsp

867
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:06,996
Well, sometimes he's right.
Sometimes he's not.

868
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:06,998
&nbsp

869
00:17:07,008 --> 00:17:08,031
Yeah.

870
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:08,033
&nbsp

871
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:09,032
Oh, speaking of which,

872
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:09,034
&nbsp

873
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:09,999
I just saw him downstairs,

874
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:10,001
&nbsp

875
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:11,901
and he was talking to the DA.

876
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:11,903
&nbsp

877
00:17:11,913 --> 00:17:13,503
He blew off a date with her.

878
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:13,505
&nbsp

879
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,738
I saw him do the same thing last week.

880
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:15,740
&nbsp

881
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,607
I don't know. Maybe he's not into her.

882
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:17,609
&nbsp

883
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,708
No, he's into her.

884
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:18,710
&nbsp

885
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,909
I mean, when I asked him about her,

886
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:19,911
&nbsp

887
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:21,411
he basically told me to buzz off.

888
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:21,413
&nbsp

889
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:23,079
You're not too good at buzzing off, are you?

890
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:23,081
&nbsp

891
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:24,714
Nope. When it comes to my dad, no.

892
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:26,551
&nbsp

893
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:29,018
Well, look who it is.

894
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:29,020
&nbsp

895
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,453
Looks like I have an opportunity
to see things

896
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:30,455
&nbsp

897
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:31,387
from Julian's perspective....

898
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:31,389
&nbsp

899
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:33,156
- Hmm.
- Right now.

900
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:33,158
&nbsp

901
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,824
Sorry about lunch. I got to go.

902
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:34,826
&nbsp

903
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:35,925
Mm.

904
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:35,927
&nbsp

905
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:38,561
See you later. Oh, I need that.

906
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:40,332
&nbsp

907
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:42,866
If you don't stop squirming,
I'll never find a vein.

908
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:42,868
&nbsp

909
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:45,034
What exactly are you testing for now?

910
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:45,036
&nbsp

911
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:47,237
Any polymorphism
that could help us understand

912
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:47,239
&nbsp

913
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:49,239
how you're able to absorb that much energy

914
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:49,241
&nbsp

915
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,041
from molecules to create gelid surroundings.

916
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:52,043
&nbsp

917
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,077
You realize I've run
all of these tests already?

918
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:54,079
&nbsp

919
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,979
Then what was the point of coming here?

920
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:55,981
&nbsp

921
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,147
Seriously, Mom?

922
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:58,149
&nbsp

923
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,850
I'm terrified of what I'm becoming.

924
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:00,852
&nbsp

925
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,219
You realize you haven't
asked me once how I'm feeling?

926
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:03,221
&nbsp

927
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:05,488
I'm trying to keep emotion out of this.

928
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:05,490
&nbsp

929
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,391
Believe me, it's for your
benefit as much as it is mine.

930
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:08,393
&nbsp

931
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:09,826
Right, because that's
your specialty, isn't it?

932
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:09,828
&nbsp

933
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,428
Being cold, just like after...

934
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:12,430
&nbsp

935
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,163
After what?

936
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:15,333
&nbsp

937
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:17,133
After Dad died.

938
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:18,570
&nbsp

939
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,670
I did everything I could
to save your father.

940
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:20,672
&nbsp

941
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,505
Well, you lost your daughter
at the same time.

942
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:22,507
&nbsp

943
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:23,740
You're the one who went away, Caitlin.

944
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,742
&nbsp

945
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:25,208
Because I had to.

946
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:25,210
&nbsp

947
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,510
You realize you never acted
like my mother again

948
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:27,512
&nbsp

949
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:29,279
after Dad got sick?

950
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:29,281
&nbsp

951
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,980
You would barely even look at me.

952
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,217
&nbsp

953
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:36,152
I... couldn't handle the pain.

954
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:36,154
&nbsp

955
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:37,787
My work got me through it.

956
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:37,789
&nbsp

957
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,189
Losing someone like that,

958
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:40,191
&nbsp

959
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:42,492
you have no idea what that feels like.

960
00:18:42,502 --> 00:18:42,494
&nbsp

961
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:44,994
Actually, I do.

962
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:44,996
&nbsp

963
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:48,498
My husband died over a year ago.

964
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:48,500
&nbsp

965
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,033
I'm sorry.

966
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:55,640
&nbsp

967
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,040
Okay.

968
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,042
&nbsp

969
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,841
What do you got?

970
00:18:58,851 --> 00:18:58,843
&nbsp

971
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:01,644
I said get here quick, but that was...

972
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:01,646
&nbsp

973
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:02,645
quicker than I expected.

974
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:02,647
&nbsp

975
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:04,147
Oh, no, yeah, it was a...

976
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:04,149
&nbsp

977
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:05,815
crazy Uber driver.

978
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:05,817
&nbsp

979
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:06,849
Hmm.

980
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:06,851
&nbsp

981
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,151
Well, the blast pattern

982
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:08,153
&nbsp

983
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:10,219
and the scoring on the insulation suggests

984
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:10,221
&nbsp

985
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:12,488
that it was a power surge that blew it out.

986
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:12,490
&nbsp

987
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,990
So it's a coincidence?

988
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:13,992
&nbsp

989
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:16,726
I highly doubt it. But I'll figure it out.

990
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:16,728
&nbsp

991
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,929
Someone in this city has to do
something about these metas.

992
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:19,931
&nbsp

993
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:20,930
What do you mean?

994
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:20,932
&nbsp

995
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:22,131
We have a whole police force

996
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:22,133
&nbsp

997
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:23,633
working to stop these metas.

998
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:23,635
&nbsp

999
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:26,903
No, you have The Flash.

1000
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:26,905
&nbsp

1001
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,706
So it's not just bad metas you don't like.

1002
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:29,708
&nbsp

1003
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:31,107
It's all the metas.

1004
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:31,109
&nbsp

1005
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,475
I'm just saying that because of him,

1006
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:32,477
&nbsp

1007
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:34,510
the police department has got lethargic.

1008
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:34,512
&nbsp

1009
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,112
I mean, why do anything at all

1010
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:36,114
&nbsp

1011
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:38,147
if The Flash is gonna
save the day every time?

1012
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:38,149
&nbsp

1013
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,149
It's a bit like you with rule breaking...

1014
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,151
&nbsp

1015
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:43,353
a momentary fix,
and now you're lazy, sloppy.

1016
00:19:43,363 --> 00:19:43,355
&nbsp

1017
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:44,721
Cool. Thanks.

1018
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:44,723
&nbsp

1019
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,522
I think The Flash is actually

1020
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:46,524
&nbsp

1021
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:48,891
a source of inspiration for the city.

1022
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:48,893
&nbsp

1023
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:50,927
I think he kind of provides hope.

1024
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:50,929
&nbsp

1025
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,362
Yes, well, that's one of many things

1026
00:19:52,372 --> 00:19:52,364
&nbsp

1027
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:55,598
that we'll have to disagree on, Allen.

1028
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:55,600
&nbsp

1029
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,867
What? You see something?

1030
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:01,873
&nbsp

1031
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:03,506
A pattern.

1032
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:03,508
&nbsp

1033
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:06,275
The creature's movements,
they seemed random at first,

1034
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:06,277
&nbsp

1035
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,745
but they were contained
to a prescribed area.

1036
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:08,747
&nbsp

1037
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:12,582
You know, like the creature was
stuck in an invisible fence.

1038
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:12,584
&nbsp

1039
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:14,183
Traffic cameras were down, right?

1040
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:14,185
&nbsp

1041
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:18,388
Maybe it was being watched
or controlled by somebody

1042
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:18,390
&nbsp

1043
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,690
that needed to keep it
in visual range the entire time?

1044
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:20,692
&nbsp

1045
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:24,093
Constricting the creature's
movements to the line of sight.

1046
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:24,929
&nbsp

1047
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:27,030
That actually makes sense.

1048
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,032
&nbsp

1049
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,998
Maybe there is a brain in there
after all, Allen.

1050
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:36,975
&nbsp

1051
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,207
Dispatch, this is CSI.

1052
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:38,209
&nbsp

1053
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:39,942
I'm requesting immediate backup.

1054
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:39,944
&nbsp

1055
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:42,545
The monster has been sighted by the harbor.

1056
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:42,547
&nbsp

1057
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,881
- Hey, maybe we should split up.
- That's a terrible idea.

1058
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:44,883
&nbsp

1059
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:47,116
Yeah, but we got to do
something, right? Whoa.

1060
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:47,118
&nbsp

1061
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:49,385
Don't worry, I have four
years' training in the military.

1062
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:49,387
&nbsp

1063
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:52,121
Uh, even still, since when
does a CSI carry a gun?

1064
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:52,123
&nbsp

1065
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:53,723
Since there were monsters in our city.

1066
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:53,725
&nbsp

1067
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,092
All right, Jul...

1068
00:20:56,102 --> 00:21:05,837
&nbsp

1069
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,437
Cheers.

1070
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:14,847
&nbsp

1071
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,347
You're leaving us?

1072
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:16,349
&nbsp

1073
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,648
Yeah.

1074
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:17,650
&nbsp

1075
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,184
Things between my mother and me are...

1076
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:20,186
&nbsp

1077
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,385
complicated.

1078
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:21,387
&nbsp

1079
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:22,786
We can help you.

1080
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:22,788
&nbsp

1081
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,588
I don't need your help with the science.

1082
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:24,590
&nbsp

1083
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,224
I can do that on my own.

1084
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:27,226
&nbsp

1085
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,159
I came here to get something from my mother

1086
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:29,161
&nbsp

1087
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:33,030
that I realize now I'll never get.

1088
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,103
&nbsp

1089
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:38,402
What are you doing?

1090
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:38,404
&nbsp

1091
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:40,471
Sorry, Frosty,

1092
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:40,473
&nbsp

1093
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:43,407
but you're not going anywhere.

1094
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:43,409
&nbsp

1095
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:45,376
Let me out of here.

1096
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:45,378
&nbsp

1097
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,744
Open these doors.

1098
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:46,746
&nbsp

1099
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:48,712
I said no!

1100
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:48,714
&nbsp

1101
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,349
I am sick of working day after day,

1102
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:52,351
&nbsp

1103
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:55,819
night after night, only to have
my work benefit your mother.

1104
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:55,821
&nbsp

1105
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:57,654
With the information I can get from you,

1106
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:57,656
&nbsp

1107
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,290
I can finally get out of this place,

1108
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,292
&nbsp

1109
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:02,326
so you're gonna stay here

1110
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:02,328
&nbsp

1111
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,294
until I get everything that I need.

1112
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:05,765
&nbsp

1113
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:08,565
You are not going to test me.

1114
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:08,567
&nbsp

1115
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,833
Yes, I am.

1116
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:11,070
&nbsp

1117
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,302
No, Nigel.

1118
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:12,304
&nbsp

1119
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:15,839
You are not going to test me, now or ever.

1120
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:15,841
&nbsp

1121
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,941
Wait, let go! Let go! Ah!

1122
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:17,943
&nbsp

1123
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:21,078
Caitlin! Don't do this!

1124
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:21,080
&nbsp

1125
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,479
This isn't you!

1126
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:22,481
&nbsp

1127
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:24,982
You don't know anything about me, Mother.

1128
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:24,984
&nbsp

1129
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:28,252
I... I know I wasn't much of a mother,

1130
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:28,254
&nbsp

1131
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,587
and I know I have a lot to make up for,

1132
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:30,589
&nbsp

1133
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,457
but I know I didn't raise a killer.

1134
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:35,394
&nbsp

1135
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:38,495
For whatever it's worth, I am so sorry.

1136
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:41,801
&nbsp

1137
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:44,701
It's worth a lot.

1138
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:48,674
&nbsp

1139
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:50,274
Now go.

1140
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:50,276
&nbsp

1141
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,775
- What about...
- I... I'll take care of him.

1142
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:51,777
&nbsp

1143
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,446
No one will ever know about this. I promise.

1144
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:55,448
&nbsp

1145
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,981
- Thank you.
- Just go.

1146
00:22:57,991 --> 00:23:02,154
&nbsp

1147
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:04,455
Every time there's been
a sighting of the monster,

1148
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:04,457
&nbsp

1149
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,323
multiple transformers have blown.

1150
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:06,325
&nbsp

1151
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:08,325
Hmm, so it's definitely
feeding off electricity.

1152
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:08,327
&nbsp

1153
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:09,927
Mm-hmm, and see, I mapped out

1154
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:09,929
&nbsp

1155
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:11,962
all the streets
that it's been spotted around.

1156
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:11,964
&nbsp

1157
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,597
Never leaves a ten-block radius.

1158
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:13,599
&nbsp

1159
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:15,532
You know, this is exactly
what I was talking about.

1160
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:15,534
&nbsp

1161
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:18,035
Some meta's been gifted
this incredible power,

1162
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:18,037
&nbsp

1163
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:20,637
and this is the very best thing
they can do with it...

1164
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:20,639
&nbsp

1165
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,872
terrorize a city.

1166
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:21,874
&nbsp

1167
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,807
It's pathetic.

1168
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:23,809
&nbsp

1169
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,810
Why exactly do you hate metas so much?

1170
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:26,812
&nbsp

1171
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,445
If you think I'm gonna break down now

1172
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:28,447
&nbsp

1173
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:30,114
and tell you that one killed my parents

1174
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:30,116
&nbsp

1175
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:32,549
and that's why I have to do this job,

1176
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:32,551
&nbsp

1177
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,318
I'm not, okay?

1178
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:34,320
&nbsp

1179
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,687
I don't need a deep, personal
reason to hate metas, Allen.

1180
00:23:36,697 --> 00:23:36,689
&nbsp

1181
00:23:36,699 --> 00:23:40,190
I just need to see
person after person transformed,

1182
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,192
&nbsp

1183
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:42,993
given these extraordinary abilities,

1184
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:42,995
&nbsp

1185
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,129
and watch them be squandered.

1186
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:45,131
&nbsp

1187
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:48,132
Robbing banks, hurting people,
spreading fear.

1188
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:48,134
&nbsp

1189
00:23:48,144 --> 00:23:51,502
It's just... well, it's not just a crime.

1190
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:51,504
&nbsp

1191
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,370
It's an absolute waste.

1192
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:53,372
&nbsp

1193
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:55,639
I mean, can you imagine

1194
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:55,641
&nbsp

1195
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,741
what it would be like to have those powers?

1196
00:23:57,751 --> 00:23:57,743
&nbsp

1197
00:23:57,753 --> 00:23:59,710
I mean, I would be helping people.

1198
00:23:59,720 --> 00:23:59,712
&nbsp

1199
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:02,446
I would be improving the world.

1200
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:04,383
&nbsp

1201
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:07,851
I guess I wasn't one
of the chosen few, was I?

1202
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:07,853
&nbsp

1203
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,353
That's it?

1204
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:09,355
&nbsp

1205
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,322
You're mad at them
because you weren't chosen?

1206
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:12,324
&nbsp

1207
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,857
Sorry, I mean, I'm just saying,

1208
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:13,859
&nbsp

1209
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,727
it can't be easy being a meta-human,

1210
00:24:16,737 --> 00:24:16,729
&nbsp

1211
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:20,664
having your life... their lives
change in ways that,

1212
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:20,666
&nbsp

1213
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:23,734
you know, neither one of us
could possibly imagine.

1214
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:23,736
&nbsp

1215
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:26,036
It's got to take some adjusting.

1216
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:26,038
&nbsp

1217
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,672
Right. So now you're defending them?

1218
00:24:28,682 --> 00:24:28,674
&nbsp

1219
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:30,440
Well, no, I mean, I'm...
I don't think that...

1220
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:30,442
&nbsp

1221
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:34,711
This internship thing
we're doing is completely over.

1222
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:37,082
&nbsp

1223
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,549
Whatever.

1224
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,322
&nbsp

1225
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:45,055
- Transformers are the key.
- No, I agree...

1226
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:45,057
&nbsp

1227
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,890
Anytime the monster's shown up,

1228
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:46,892
&nbsp

1229
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,959
- any nearby have exploded.
- They blow up.

1230
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:48,961
&nbsp

1231
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:50,894
Car alarms keep malfunctioning too.

1232
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:50,896
&nbsp

1233
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,631
Car alarms, transformers.
What is the connection?

1234
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:54,633
&nbsp

1235
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:56,500
Yeah, we'll get there, fellas.
We'll get there.

1236
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:56,502
&nbsp

1237
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,235
We just got to keep trying.

1238
00:24:58,245 --> 00:24:58,237
&nbsp

1239
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,338
Maybe someone's pulling power
out of the transformers

1240
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:01,340
&nbsp

1241
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,240
and using it to power the monster.

1242
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:03,242
&nbsp

1243
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,075
Power... yes, the monster.

1244
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:05,077
&nbsp

1245
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:09,112
That's... ah, you just beat me
to it, San Francisco.

1246
00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:09,114
&nbsp

1247
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:11,181
See, that can't be it, H.R.

1248
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:11,183
&nbsp

1249
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:12,549
- Can't be it...
- 'Cause we would have detected

1250
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:12,551
&nbsp

1251
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:14,251
- a surge in the power grid.
- We did not.

1252
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:14,253
&nbsp

1253
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,586
Not if it was broadcast power

1254
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:15,588
&nbsp

1255
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,187
or something like a portable Tesla tower.

1256
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:17,189
&nbsp

1257
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,856
A portable Tesla power.

1258
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:19,858
&nbsp

1259
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:21,558
- Tower.
- Tower. That's what it is.

1260
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:21,560
&nbsp

1261
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,328
Nice. Mm, mm. Teamwork, hmm?

1262
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:24,330
&nbsp

1263
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,797
So PS, where I'm from, on my Earth,

1264
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:26,799
&nbsp

1265
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,498
we call that a problem solved.

1266
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:28,500
&nbsp

1267
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm gonna go for coffee.

1268
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:29,902
&nbsp

1269
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:32,269
On my Earth, the coffee
was wiped out by blight.

1270
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:32,271
&nbsp

1271
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,504
- Blight, yeah.
- Can you imagine?

1272
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:35,774
&nbsp

1273
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,408
He didn't really do anything, did he?

1274
00:25:38,418 --> 00:25:38,410
&nbsp

1275
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,610
Thank you.

1276
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:39,612
&nbsp

1277
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,944
Took me a while to realize it,

1278
00:25:40,954 --> 00:25:40,946
&nbsp

1279
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,746
but he's just resaying everything

1280
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:42,748
&nbsp

1281
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,615
that we're saying in a different way.

1282
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:44,617
&nbsp

1283
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,850
No, he did have the idea for the rope.

1284
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:46,852
&nbsp

1285
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,452
Ah, ah, reverse inception.

1286
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:48,454
&nbsp

1287
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,220
He made you think he had
the idea for the rope,

1288
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,222
&nbsp

1289
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:51,989
but he didn't even tell us how to use it.

1290
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:51,991
&nbsp

1291
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:54,992
Okay, well, we're not gonna be
caught off guard again.

1292
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:54,994
&nbsp

1293
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:56,526
We should vibe him.

1294
00:25:56,536 --> 00:25:56,528
&nbsp

1295
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:58,662
It'd be my pleasure.

1296
00:25:58,672 --> 00:26:00,933
&nbsp

1297
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,299
Hey-oh.

1298
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:02,301
&nbsp

1299
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,368
- Hey, baby girl.
- Hey.

1300
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:04,370
&nbsp

1301
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,103
You've been hanging out here a lot lately.

1302
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:06,105
&nbsp

1303
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,671
Yeah, well, there's a lot of scared people

1304
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:07,673
&nbsp

1305
00:26:07,683 --> 00:26:09,673
with this monster running around the city.

1306
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:09,675
&nbsp

1307
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:11,408
Oh, we'll get him. We always do.

1308
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:11,410
&nbsp

1309
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,510
Oh, yeah? Is that a quote
I can use for my article?

1310
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:13,512
&nbsp

1311
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:14,678
No.

1312
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:14,680
&nbsp

1313
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,313
All right. It was worth a try.

1314
00:26:16,323 --> 00:26:16,315
&nbsp

1315
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:20,284
Dad, you know Wally and I
are all right, right?

1316
00:26:20,294 --> 00:26:20,286
&nbsp

1317
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:22,019
What is that supposed to mean?

1318
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:22,021
&nbsp

1319
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:27,057
We just don't want you
to not do things because of us.

1320
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:27,059
&nbsp

1321
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:31,194
You know, we just want you
to... find someone.

1322
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:31,196
&nbsp

1323
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:32,863
I'm not having this conversation with you.

1324
00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:32,865
&nbsp

1325
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,399
Dad, that DA is totally into you.

1326
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:35,401
&nbsp

1327
00:26:35,411 --> 00:26:37,167
You should go out with her.

1328
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:37,169
&nbsp

1329
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,405
Iris, I don't need you to be Cupid.

1330
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:41,407
&nbsp

1331
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:42,572
I got my job.

1332
00:26:42,582 --> 00:26:42,574
&nbsp

1333
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,975
I got you, Barry, Wally. I'm good.

1334
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:44,977
&nbsp

1335
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:48,211
I know, Dad, and that's great. I just...

1336
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:48,213
&nbsp

1337
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:49,980
Now that I'm falling in love with someone,

1338
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:49,982
&nbsp

1339
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:52,683
I just want you to have the same thing.

1340
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:52,685
&nbsp

1341
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,319
Joe? Alert every task force and sniper unit.

1342
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:55,321
&nbsp

1343
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:57,020
Tell 'em to load up.

1344
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,022
&nbsp

1345
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,122
I should get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

1346
00:26:59,132 --> 00:26:59,124
&nbsp

1347
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:00,724
- What's up?
- Albert thinks

1348
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:00,726
&nbsp

1349
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,159
he's figured out the creature's next target.

1350
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:02,161
&nbsp

1351
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:03,527
Well, if there's ever an opportunity

1352
00:27:03,537 --> 00:27:03,529
&nbsp

1353
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,829
for a 40-foot monster to wreak havoc,

1354
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:05,831
&nbsp

1355
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:08,065
it's gonna be where people like to gather.

1356
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:08,067
&nbsp

1357
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:09,566
2nd Street Promenade.

1358
00:27:09,576 --> 00:27:09,568
&nbsp

1359
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:10,568
Well, let's end this.

1360
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:10,641
&nbsp

1361
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:12,541
That's what I intend to do, Detective.

1362
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:14,812
&nbsp

1363
00:27:14,822 --> 00:27:16,545
- Where'd he go?
- Doesn't matter.

1364
00:27:16,555 --> 00:27:16,547
&nbsp

1365
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:17,879
I don't need him.

1366
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:17,881
&nbsp

1367
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,714
What do you mean? What do you... hey, dude.

1368
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:19,716
&nbsp

1369
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,616
Come on, you can't just go
through his stuff; that's not...

1370
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:21,618
&nbsp

1371
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:23,618
I'm not going through his stuff.

1372
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:23,620
&nbsp

1373
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,620
See, this is what I'm talking about.

1374
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:25,622
&nbsp

1375
00:27:25,632 --> 00:27:27,556
What even is this?

1376
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:27,558
&nbsp

1377
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:29,524
Now I seem to have won
most of the team's trust,

1378
00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:29,526
&nbsp

1379
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:31,226
except Francisco's.

1380
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:32,729
&nbsp

1381
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:35,130
Those are my things.

1382
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,132
&nbsp

1383
00:27:35,142 --> 00:27:36,832
What are you doing?

1384
00:27:36,842 --> 00:27:36,834
&nbsp

1385
00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:38,133
What are you doing?

1386
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:38,135
&nbsp

1387
00:27:38,145 --> 00:27:40,435
- What?
- Who are you really?

1388
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:40,437
&nbsp

1389
00:27:40,447 --> 00:27:42,537
We know you're hiding something.

1390
00:27:42,547 --> 00:27:42,539
&nbsp

1391
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:46,641
You've been burned, twice...

1392
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:46,643
&nbsp

1393
00:27:46,653 --> 00:27:48,677
by a man with the same face as me.

1394
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:48,679
&nbsp

1395
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:52,047
I imagine it's hard to trust
after something like that.

1396
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:52,049
&nbsp

1397
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:53,882
- You think?
- I do think.

1398
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:53,884
&nbsp

1399
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:56,751
So play... the rest of it.

1400
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,388
&nbsp

1401
00:27:58,398 --> 00:27:59,621
I've read his journals.

1402
00:27:59,631 --> 00:27:59,623
&nbsp

1403
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:01,423
I found nothing that can tell me

1404
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:01,425
&nbsp

1405
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:03,825
why Francisco feels the way he does,

1406
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:03,827
&nbsp

1407
00:28:03,837 --> 00:28:07,462
but I do hope I can change
his opinion of Harrison Wells

1408
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:07,464
&nbsp

1409
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:09,464
and the two of us can
rebuild that friendship.

1410
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:09,466
&nbsp

1411
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:12,734
What a fantastic C-story
to weave within the narrative.

1412
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:14,104
&nbsp

1413
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:15,103
What?

1414
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:15,105
&nbsp

1415
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:17,105
What narrative?

1416
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:17,107
&nbsp

1417
00:28:17,117 --> 00:28:19,274
Narrative.

1418
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:20,110
&nbsp

1419
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,843
I'm writing a novel.

1420
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:21,845
&nbsp

1421
00:28:21,855 --> 00:28:23,712
“The Tales of H.R. Wells.”

1422
00:28:23,722 --> 00:28:23,714
&nbsp

1423
00:28:23,724 --> 00:28:25,413
Catchy, I know.

1424
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:25,415
&nbsp

1425
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:29,417
Wait, I'm sorry, you're
a scientist and a novelist?

1426
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:29,419
&nbsp

1427
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:32,020
- Yes.
- Wow. That's perfect.

1428
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:32,022
&nbsp

1429
00:28:32,032 --> 00:28:33,722
Thank you. That's exactly right.

1430
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:33,724
&nbsp

1431
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:35,690
I'm a scientist and a novelist;
I run S.T.A.R. Labs,

1432
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:35,692
&nbsp

1433
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,525
and also I'm an author of science-romance.

1434
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:37,527
&nbsp

1435
00:28:37,537 --> 00:28:38,960
That's my niche. Write what you know.

1436
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:38,962
&nbsp

1437
00:28:38,972 --> 00:28:40,929
And I thought,
“Well, what better opportunity

1438
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:40,931
&nbsp

1439
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:42,831
“than to come to another Earth and pen

1440
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:42,833
&nbsp

1441
00:28:42,843 --> 00:28:46,468
yet another best seller
about my adventures here?”

1442
00:28:46,478 --> 00:28:46,470
&nbsp

1443
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,703
Why didn't you just tell us
this in the first place?

1444
00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:48,705
&nbsp

1445
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:50,505
I guess it didn't seem relevant,

1446
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:50,507
&nbsp

1447
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:52,173
and also, I didn't think

1448
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:52,175
&nbsp

1449
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:54,809
you guys were gonna
rifle through my belongings.

1450
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:56,480
&nbsp

1451
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,246
That's all it is.

1452
00:28:58,256 --> 00:28:58,248
&nbsp

1453
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,581
I'm a scientist and a novelist.

1454
00:28:59,591 --> 00:28:59,583
&nbsp

1455
00:28:59,593 --> 00:29:01,116
Do you think you can trust me now,

1456
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:01,118
&nbsp

1457
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:02,517
or is that not something

1458
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:02,519
&nbsp

1459
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:05,086
that you have on this Earth, trust?

1460
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:05,088
&nbsp

1461
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:07,122
- Trust?
- Oh!

1462
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:07,124
&nbsp

1463
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:09,157
You scared the dickens out of...

1464
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:09,159
&nbsp

1465
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:10,525
Trust who?

1466
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:12,362
&nbsp

1467
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:13,695
It's the app.

1468
00:29:13,705 --> 00:29:13,697
&nbsp

1469
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:15,263
It's the monster. It's back.

1470
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:15,265
&nbsp

1471
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,132
- Monster?
- Yeah, you've missed a lot.

1472
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:17,134
&nbsp

1473
00:29:17,144 --> 00:29:18,800
I'll explain upstairs.

1474
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:18,802
&nbsp

1475
00:29:18,812 --> 00:29:21,002
Well, I'll just stay here, then.

1476
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:22,139
&nbsp

1477
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:24,906
Come on. We need you.

1478
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:33,801
&nbsp

1479
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:35,134
All right, guys. I'm here.

1480
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:35,215
&nbsp

1481
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:37,715
Tell us everything that you see right now.

1482
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:38,685
&nbsp

1483
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,451
Mayhem.

1484
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:40,453
&nbsp

1485
00:29:40,463 --> 00:29:41,586
And the monster.

1486
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:43,924
&nbsp

1487
00:29:43,934 --> 00:29:45,323
Okay, so what's the plan?

1488
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:45,325
&nbsp

1489
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:46,791
Great question, Miss West.

1490
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:46,793
&nbsp

1491
00:29:46,803 --> 00:29:49,961
So we fashioned just a carbon fiber rope,

1492
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:49,963
&nbsp

1493
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:51,129
but correct me if I'm wrong,

1494
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:51,131
&nbsp

1495
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:52,530
we never actually discussed

1496
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:52,532
&nbsp

1497
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,266
how he was gonna use that rope, did we?

1498
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:55,268
&nbsp

1499
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:56,501
Guys.

1500
00:29:56,511 --> 00:29:57,904
&nbsp

1501
00:29:57,914 --> 00:29:59,604
Barry, we're gonna do “Empire.”

1502
00:29:59,614 --> 00:29:59,606
&nbsp

1503
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:00,872
“Empire of the Sun”" Barry.

1504
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:00,874
&nbsp

1505
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,640
- What? “Empire Strikes Back.”
- What?

1506
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:02,642
&nbsp

1507
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:04,409
“Empire Strikes Back”" Barry.

1508
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:04,411
&nbsp

1509
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:05,777
Just take it down like it was an AT-AT.

1510
00:30:05,787 --> 00:30:05,779
&nbsp

1511
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:07,111
Just like an AT-AT.

1512
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:07,113
&nbsp

1513
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:08,947
"“Bigger they are, the harder they fall”"

1514
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:08,949
&nbsp

1515
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,081
Even I've seen “Empire.”

1516
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:10,083
&nbsp

1517
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,249
- I like that.
- I like you.

1518
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,653
&nbsp

1519
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:15,520
All right, here we go.

1520
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:15,522
&nbsp

1521
00:30:15,532 --> 00:30:17,555
I always wanted to be a Jedi.

1522
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:26,499
&nbsp

1523
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:28,499
Guys? Rope went right through it.

1524
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:28,501
&nbsp

1525
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:29,834
It's a hologram.

1526
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:31,271
&nbsp

1527
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:32,570
That explains everything...

1528
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:32,572
&nbsp

1529
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,239
the ten-block radius, the transformers.

1530
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:34,241
&nbsp

1531
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:35,740
It takes that much power to render.

1532
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:35,742
&nbsp

1533
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,709
Wait, CCPD sent snipers there.

1534
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:37,711
&nbsp

1535
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,110
If it's not real...

1536
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,112
&nbsp

1537
00:30:39,122 --> 00:30:40,511
Then the bullets will pass right through it.

1538
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:40,513
&nbsp

1539
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:41,779
Guys, it's gone. Where is it?

1540
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:41,781
&nbsp

1541
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,114
Hold on. Give me a sec, Bar.

1542
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:43,116
&nbsp

1543
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,882
Okay, we don't have a second!

1544
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:44,884
&nbsp

1545
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:46,985
H.R., triangulate the signal
being sent to the monster.

1546
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:46,987
&nbsp

1547
00:30:46,997 --> 00:30:49,020
We have to disrupt it
before anyone gets hurt.

1548
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,022
&nbsp

1549
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:53,625
Okay, let's do that now.
Let's... let's just triangulate.

1550
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:53,627
&nbsp

1551
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:54,726
The computer doesn't triangulate...

1552
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:54,728
&nbsp

1553
00:30:54,738 --> 00:30:55,994
- What?
- The signal the way...

1554
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:55,996
&nbsp

1555
00:30:56,006 --> 00:30:57,128
not the way I'm used to... this is

1556
00:30:57,138 --> 00:30:57,130
&nbsp

1557
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,563
a different size computer for...

1558
00:30:58,573 --> 00:30:58,565
&nbsp

1559
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:00,198
Oh, my God. I knew it.

1560
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:00,200
&nbsp

1561
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,699
What?

1562
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:01,701
&nbsp

1563
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:03,835
You're a fake.

1564
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:03,837
&nbsp

1565
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:04,836
What?

1566
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:04,838
&nbsp

1567
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:06,571
- What?
- What?

1568
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:06,573
&nbsp

1569
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,339
This whole time, he's been
acting like he can help us,

1570
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:08,341
&nbsp

1571
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:10,441
but he can't because
he doesn't now how, does he?

1572
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:10,443
&nbsp

1573
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:12,176
How? Triangulate!

1574
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:12,178
&nbsp

1575
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:13,578
Guys, which way?

1576
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:13,580
&nbsp

1577
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,079
- Get the...
- All right, you take over.

1578
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:17,484
&nbsp

1579
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:19,484
Found it. It's at 2nd and Fulton.

1580
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:29,596
&nbsp

1581
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:31,229
I have a lock on the target.

1582
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:31,231
&nbsp

1583
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:32,730
Fire when ready.

1584
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:44,544
&nbsp

1585
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:45,710
Stop!

1586
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,712
&nbsp

1587
00:31:45,722 --> 00:31:49,180
Stop firing! It's a hologram!

1588
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,182
&nbsp

1589
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:50,748
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1590
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:52,452
&nbsp

1591
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:54,652
A hologram? Where'd it go?

1592
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:54,654
&nbsp

1593
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:58,356
Detective West, where's Julian?

1594
00:31:58,366 --> 00:31:58,358
&nbsp

1595
00:31:58,368 --> 00:32:00,058
He was here!

1596
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:00,060
&nbsp

1597
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,926
Cisco, I need that location.

1598
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:03,129
&nbsp

1599
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:04,495
Hamilton building, 25th floor.

1600
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:04,497
&nbsp

1601
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:05,997
There's more power going there

1602
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:05,999
&nbsp

1603
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,799
than anywhere else in the building combined.

1604
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:11,071
&nbsp

1605
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,937
Line of sight to all the attacks.

1606
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:12,939
&nbsp

1607
00:32:12,949 --> 00:32:14,405
That's where he is.

1608
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:14,407
&nbsp

1609
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:16,874
I said put your hands up!

1610
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:16,876
&nbsp

1611
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:20,111
This is CCPD! Freeze!

1612
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:20,113
&nbsp

1613
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:22,080
Stop what you're doing!

1614
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,082
&nbsp

1615
00:32:22,092 --> 00:32:23,314
I said put your hands up!

1616
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:35,495
&nbsp

1617
00:32:35,505 --> 00:32:36,661
You're just a kid.

1618
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:36,741
&nbsp

1619
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:38,507
Yeah, a kid you almost killed!

1620
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:38,509
&nbsp

1621
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,276
You're gonna pay for that one,
buddy. You're gonna...

1622
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:40,278
&nbsp

1623
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:41,711
Yeah, I don't think so, man;
I think you're the one

1624
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:41,736
&nbsp

1625
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:43,135
that's gonna be paying
for all the damage you did

1626
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:43,137
&nbsp

1627
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:45,171
to this city... for a very long time.

1628
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:49,744
&nbsp

1629
00:32:49,754 --> 00:32:51,177
Hey, Flash.

1630
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:52,246
&nbsp

1631
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:53,946
Thank you.

1632
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:53,948
&nbsp

1633
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:55,714
You're welcome.

1634
00:32:55,724 --> 00:33:04,564
&nbsp

1635
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:07,265
Do you realize how many innocent people

1636
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:07,267
&nbsp

1637
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,901
could have been hurt, or worse?

1638
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:09,903
&nbsp

1639
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:12,771
What made you do something like this?

1640
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:12,773
&nbsp

1641
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,407
I just wanted to feel powerful for a change.

1642
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:15,409
&nbsp

1643
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,143
And that did it? Scaring people?

1644
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:18,145
&nbsp

1645
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:20,912
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it did.

1646
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:20,914
&nbsp

1647
00:33:20,924 --> 00:33:25,350
You know, the kids at my school,
they tease me every day.

1648
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,352
&nbsp

1649
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:27,485
I'm a weirdo there.

1650
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:27,487
&nbsp

1651
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:30,956
And I'm just sick of feeling
scared all the time.

1652
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:30,958
&nbsp

1653
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:34,326
I just wanted someone else
to feel that way for a change.

1654
00:33:34,336 --> 00:33:39,933
&nbsp

1655
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:44,502
Look, I know sometimes

1656
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:44,504
&nbsp

1657
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:49,541
things are hard at your age.

1658
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:49,543
&nbsp

1659
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:53,144
But trust me, it does get better.

1660
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:55,582
&nbsp

1661
00:33:55,592 --> 00:33:58,483
So what happens now?

1662
00:33:58,493 --> 00:33:58,485
&nbsp

1663
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,485
Well, there are severe
consequences for what you did,

1664
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:00,487
&nbsp

1665
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,055
and you're just gonna have to accept that,

1666
00:34:04,065 --> 00:34:04,057
&nbsp

1667
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:07,092
but listen, you're young.

1668
00:34:07,102 --> 00:34:07,094
&nbsp

1669
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:11,730
You can turn all of this around.

1670
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,867
&nbsp

1671
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:16,668
All right. Come on.

1672
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:20,774
&nbsp

1673
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:23,675
You were named Entrepreneur of the Decade

1674
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:23,677
&nbsp

1675
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,377
by “Tech Magazine”?

1676
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:25,379
&nbsp

1677
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:28,747
- That's right.
- Is any of what's on here true?

1678
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:28,749
&nbsp

1679
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:30,115
- All of it.
- How?

1680
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:30,117
&nbsp

1681
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:32,317
You can barely turn on a computer.

1682
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:32,319
&nbsp

1683
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:33,585
There are two parts to every idea.

1684
00:34:33,595 --> 00:34:33,587
&nbsp

1685
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:36,021
There is the inception and the execution.

1686
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:36,023
&nbsp

1687
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,756
I provide the former.

1688
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:37,758
&nbsp

1689
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:39,858
So you come up with the ideas?

1690
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:39,860
&nbsp

1691
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,292
Yeah, I don't know how to implement them.

1692
00:34:41,302 --> 00:34:41,294
&nbsp

1693
00:34:41,304 --> 00:34:43,128
I'm the idea man.

1694
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:43,130
&nbsp

1695
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,230
So you didn't actually solve
the cryptogram that we sent you?

1696
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:45,232
&nbsp

1697
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:48,700
No, that was my partner
at S.T.A.R. Labs on my Earth.

1698
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,702
&nbsp

1699
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,869
I'm the face of the company.

1700
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:50,871
&nbsp

1701
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,606
I'm more of the inspiration
behind the company.

1702
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:54,608
&nbsp

1703
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:56,374
Then I was exposed.

1704
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,376
&nbsp

1705
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,576
Well, people thought that I was something

1706
00:34:58,586 --> 00:34:58,578
&nbsp

1707
00:34:58,588 --> 00:34:59,878
that I... I guess I wasn't.

1708
00:34:59,888 --> 00:34:59,880
&nbsp

1709
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:05,917
Anyway, it... it kind of all
fell apart for me.

1710
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:05,919
&nbsp

1711
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:07,519
But then I got your message.

1712
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:07,521
&nbsp

1713
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:09,788
My partner brought me your message.

1714
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:09,790
&nbsp

1715
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,891
I realized he's bringing me an opportunity

1716
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:12,893
&nbsp

1717
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,527
to come to this Earth to write this book.

1718
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:15,529
&nbsp

1719
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:17,629
So many planets in the multiverse,

1720
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:17,631
&nbsp

1721
00:35:17,641 --> 00:35:19,364
and we happen to pick

1722
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:19,366
&nbsp

1723
00:35:19,376 --> 00:35:23,001
the one Wells who's not a scientist.

1724
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:23,003
&nbsp

1725
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:25,370
You're right.

1726
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,372
&nbsp

1727
00:35:25,382 --> 00:35:26,971
I wasn't completely honest with you...

1728
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:26,973
&nbsp

1729
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:28,139
with all of you.

1730
00:35:28,149 --> 00:35:28,141
&nbsp

1731
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:29,941
I feel badly about that. I regret that.

1732
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:29,943
&nbsp

1733
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:31,976
But let me ask you a question.

1734
00:35:31,986 --> 00:35:31,978
&nbsp

1735
00:35:31,988 --> 00:35:36,214
Has there been none amongst you
that has ever shaded the truth

1736
00:35:36,224 --> 00:35:36,216
&nbsp

1737
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:39,017
for what you believe to be the greater good?

1738
00:35:39,027 --> 00:35:40,387
&nbsp

1739
00:35:40,397 --> 00:35:42,053
It sounds to me like you're a con man.

1740
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:42,055
&nbsp

1741
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:43,254
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1742
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:43,256
&nbsp

1743
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,989
Was I a con man

1744
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:44,991
&nbsp

1745
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,391
when I showed San Francisco here

1746
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:46,393
&nbsp

1747
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:48,960
how to track the beast using car alarms?

1748
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:48,962
&nbsp

1749
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,261
Was I a con man when I showed him

1750
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:50,263
&nbsp

1751
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,664
how to fashion a rope using carbon fiber?

1752
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:52,666
&nbsp

1753
00:35:52,676 --> 00:35:54,432
I came up with those ideas!

1754
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:54,434
&nbsp

1755
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,934
You were prompted by my suggestions.

1756
00:35:55,944 --> 00:35:55,936
&nbsp

1757
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,470
- Oh.
- That is how ideas work!

1758
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:58,472
&nbsp

1759
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:00,638
People, you need a muse!

1760
00:36:00,648 --> 00:36:00,640
&nbsp

1761
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,207
I can be your muse.

1762
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:02,209
&nbsp

1763
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:05,176
What about stopping
all the metas on your Earth?

1764
00:36:05,186 --> 00:36:05,178
&nbsp

1765
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:07,245
More of an advisory role
for me, but I was there.

1766
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:07,247
&nbsp

1767
00:36:07,257 --> 00:36:10,081
I remembered how we... you don't
think that's something?

1768
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:10,083
&nbsp

1769
00:36:10,093 --> 00:36:11,616
Let me present you with a scenario.

1770
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:11,618
&nbsp

1771
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,951
You're confronted with something,

1772
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:12,953
&nbsp

1773
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,285
a threat that you've never seen before.

1774
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:14,287
&nbsp

1775
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,354
You don't know how to stop it. Who does?

1776
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:16,356
&nbsp

1777
00:36:16,366 --> 00:36:20,125
That's value to you.
Let me prove my worth to you.

1778
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:20,127
&nbsp

1779
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:23,595
If I fail, I will “pfft”
right back to my Earth,

1780
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:23,597
&nbsp

1781
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:25,163
but if I succeed, I will have succeeded

1782
00:36:25,173 --> 00:36:25,165
&nbsp

1783
00:36:25,175 --> 00:36:29,367
not just in redeeming myself but also...

1784
00:36:29,377 --> 00:36:29,369
&nbsp

1785
00:36:29,379 --> 00:36:31,769
will have done some good with my life.

1786
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:31,771
&nbsp

1787
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:33,404
You know, you're lucky we're pretty big

1788
00:36:33,414 --> 00:36:33,406
&nbsp

1789
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,106
on redemption and doing good here,

1790
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:35,108
&nbsp

1791
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:37,408
so I think you can... I don't know...

1792
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:37,410
&nbsp

1793
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,544
stay for a few weeks, try to prove yourself,

1794
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:39,546
&nbsp

1795
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:43,314
but if not, “fyoo, ” back to your Earth.

1796
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:43,316
&nbsp

1797
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,883
- Thank you.
- Hey,

1798
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:44,885
&nbsp

1799
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:46,818
no more repackaging.

1800
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:46,820
&nbsp

1801
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,286
Word is bond.

1802
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:48,288
&nbsp

1803
00:36:48,298 --> 00:36:51,222
That... just no more that.

1804
00:36:51,232 --> 00:36:53,126
&nbsp

1805
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:55,326
- All right, H.R.
- Okay.

1806
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:58,832
&nbsp

1807
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,031
Where you been?

1808
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:00,033
&nbsp

1809
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:03,568
I actually went to visit my mother.

1810
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:03,570
&nbsp

1811
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,636
Your mother?

1812
00:37:04,646 --> 00:37:04,638
&nbsp

1813
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:06,704
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, boy.

1814
00:37:06,714 --> 00:37:06,706
&nbsp

1815
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:08,506
Why?

1816
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:08,508
&nbsp

1817
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:13,845
To see if we could work
through some of our issues.

1818
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:13,847
&nbsp

1819
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,681
And I think we might actually be
on the road to recovery.

1820
00:37:16,691 --> 00:37:18,084
&nbsp

1821
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:21,352
When it comes to family,
you got to do whatever it takes,

1822
00:37:21,362 --> 00:37:21,354
&nbsp

1823
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:25,456
'cause one day, you might not
be able to do that anymore.

1824
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:26,793
&nbsp

1825
00:37:26,803 --> 00:37:29,494
Glad you're back.

1826
00:37:29,504 --> 00:37:29,496
&nbsp

1827
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:31,396
This is home.

1828
00:37:31,406 --> 00:37:43,843
&nbsp

1829
00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:46,044
I nearly killed a kid tonight.

1830
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:48,882
&nbsp

1831
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,215
The monster we were chasing,

1832
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:50,217
&nbsp

1833
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,183
it turns out it was just a hologram,

1834
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:52,185
&nbsp

1835
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:55,353
operated by a 15-year-old boy.

1836
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:55,355
&nbsp

1837
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:58,156
Flash came to save the day.

1838
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,627
&nbsp

1839
00:38:00,637 --> 00:38:04,262
And he saved me from doing something...

1840
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:04,264
&nbsp

1841
00:38:04,274 --> 00:38:05,430
I heard.

1842
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:05,432
&nbsp

1843
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:07,599
You know what's sad?

1844
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:07,601
&nbsp

1845
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:11,669
That kid, he's just acting
'cause he's scared, you know?

1846
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:11,671
&nbsp

1847
00:38:11,681 --> 00:38:13,304
He wants everyone to be terrified

1848
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:13,306
&nbsp

1849
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:17,108
and to run away from the monster
so he can feel powerful.

1850
00:38:17,118 --> 00:38:19,145
&nbsp

1851
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:21,179
I know what that's like.

1852
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:21,181
&nbsp

1853
00:38:21,191 --> 00:38:22,547
How do you mean?

1854
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:22,549
&nbsp

1855
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:24,449
I come from a pretty wealthy family...

1856
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:24,451
&nbsp

1857
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:27,785
Back in England.

1858
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:27,787
&nbsp

1859
00:38:27,797 --> 00:38:30,922
It's a long line
of generations of old money,

1860
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:30,924
&nbsp

1861
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,924
tradition... nonsense, really.

1862
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:32,926
&nbsp

1863
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,893
And I was the heir.
I was their firstborn son.

1864
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:35,895
&nbsp

1865
00:38:35,905 --> 00:38:37,395
I was supposed to inherit the lot.

1866
00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:37,397
&nbsp

1867
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:40,164
But I was the odd duck...

1868
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:40,166
&nbsp

1869
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:41,399
Who would rather go in the garden

1870
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:41,401
&nbsp

1871
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:45,570
and collect samples of insects....

1872
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:45,572
&nbsp

1873
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:50,141
Rather than learn how to tie

1874
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:50,143
&nbsp

1875
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:51,442
a Windsor knot

1876
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:51,444
&nbsp

1877
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,812
or which fork to use first at dinner.

1878
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:54,814
&nbsp

1879
00:38:54,824 --> 00:38:57,448
Yeah. No, I wanted more.

1880
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:57,450
&nbsp

1881
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,183
You know?

1882
00:38:59,193 --> 00:38:59,185
&nbsp

1883
00:38:59,195 --> 00:39:00,685
I came here to do the one thing

1884
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:00,687
&nbsp

1885
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:02,553
that they couldn't stop me from doing.

1886
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:02,555
&nbsp

1887
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:06,190
Becoming a scientist...
becoming a great scientist.

1888
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,192
&nbsp

1889
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:08,259
And then just as I got
to the top of my field,

1890
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:08,261
&nbsp

1891
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:12,497
poof, the world changes overnight.

1892
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:14,067
&nbsp

1893
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:15,600
Meta-humans.

1894
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:15,602
&nbsp

1895
00:39:15,612 --> 00:39:17,902
I don't know a single thing
about meta-humans.

1896
00:39:17,912 --> 00:39:17,904
&nbsp

1897
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:20,405
I don't know how they talk.
I don't know how they walk.

1898
00:39:20,415 --> 00:39:20,407
&nbsp

1899
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,873
I certainly don't know the first thing

1900
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:21,875
&nbsp

1901
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:25,743
about stopping them, so... rendered useless.

1902
00:39:25,753 --> 00:39:25,745
&nbsp

1903
00:39:25,755 --> 00:39:29,013
I suppose that's the monster
that I'm running from now,

1904
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:29,015
&nbsp

1905
00:39:29,025 --> 00:39:32,784
just feeling powerless.

1906
00:39:32,794 --> 00:39:32,786
&nbsp

1907
00:39:32,796 --> 00:39:35,987
Yeah, I feel the same way some days, Julian.

1908
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:37,891
&nbsp

1909
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:39,991
I lost my mom when I was a kid.

1910
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:39,993
&nbsp

1911
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,459
Lost my dad recently.

1912
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:41,461
&nbsp

1913
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:43,861
It's a scary world. People die.

1914
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:43,863
&nbsp

1915
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:48,566
Trusts are betrayed. Things change.

1916
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:48,568
&nbsp

1917
00:39:48,578 --> 00:39:51,202
But change can be a good thing, you know?

1918
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:51,204
&nbsp

1919
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:56,307
It can bring new experiences,
new opportunities, people.

1920
00:39:56,317 --> 00:39:56,309
&nbsp

1921
00:39:56,319 --> 00:39:58,443
You can treat 'em like a potential enemy

1922
00:39:58,453 --> 00:39:58,445
&nbsp

1923
00:39:58,455 --> 00:40:01,713
or like a new friend.

1924
00:40:01,723 --> 00:40:01,715
&nbsp

1925
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:06,184
Just trust that everything's gonna be okay.

1926
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:06,186
&nbsp

1927
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,619
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1928
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:15,261
&nbsp

1929
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:17,428
You can stop.

1930
00:40:17,438 --> 00:40:17,430
&nbsp

1931
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,030
You can stay.

1932
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,032
&nbsp

1933
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:22,367
I was really wrong about The Flash,

1934
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:22,369
&nbsp

1935
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,802
so I could be wrong about you too.

1936
00:40:24,812 --> 00:40:28,341
&nbsp

1937
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:30,441
Good night, mate.

1938
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:30,443
&nbsp

1939
00:40:30,453 --> 00:40:31,876
Julian?

1940
00:40:31,886 --> 00:40:34,714
&nbsp

1941
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:37,515
You want to get a drink?

1942
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:37,517
&nbsp

1943
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:40,852
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

1944
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:40,854
&nbsp

1945
00:40:40,864 --> 00:40:44,822
All right. Let's do it.

1946
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:52,599
&nbsp

1947
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:55,500
Caitlin, I've been going
over the data we collected,

1948
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:55,502
&nbsp

1949
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:58,269
and I found some disconcerting results.

1950
00:40:58,279 --> 00:40:58,271
&nbsp

1951
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,772
Your body's chemistry is changing in ways

1952
00:41:00,782 --> 00:41:00,774
&nbsp

1953
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:03,975
that I don't fully understand,
but one thing is clear.

1954
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:03,977
&nbsp

1955
00:41:03,987 --> 00:41:07,145
These powers you have,
the more you use them,

1956
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:07,147
&nbsp

1957
00:41:07,157 --> 00:41:10,848
the more difficult
they're going to be to reverse.

1958
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:10,850
&nbsp

1959
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,519
I'm sorry, honey, but listen to me.

1960
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:14,521
&nbsp

1961
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:18,356
You must not use these powers
under any circumstances.

1962
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:29,159
