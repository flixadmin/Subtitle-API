GOT MARRIED,

TO WORK.

773
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,484
MAYBE I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL
THAT I CAN FINALLY

774
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,986
GET TO SEE EMIKO
FOR WHO SHE REALLY IS.

775
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,194
MAYBE.

776
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,280
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT
HURT ANY LESS.

777
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,991
JOHN: HEY, I, UM, AHEM,

778
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,993
WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU.

779
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,537
I KNOW THIS...

780
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,123
I KNOW I HAVEN'T MADE
IT EASY FOR YOU.

781
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,875
THIS IS THE MOST TIME
WE'VE SPENT TOGETHER

782
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,460
SINCE YOU TURNED 18.

783
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,462
AS HARD AS IT MAY BE
TO BELIEVE,

784
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,547
I'M GRATEFUL FOR IT.

785
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,092
YEAH, I'D PREFER
A ROUND OF GOLF

786
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:21,304
TO KIDNAPPING AND...
AND TORTURE.

787
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,891
I KNOW YOU MIGHT NOT
FEEL THE SAME WAY,

788
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:29,104
BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE A SON TO ME.

789
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:33,274
OLIVER TOLD ME THE TRUTH
ABOUT VLATAVA,

790
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,778
ABOUT MY FATHER.

791
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,947
WHY DID YOU LET ME
BELIEVE A LIE?

792
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,992
YOU LET ME HATE YOU.

793
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,455
EVERY CHILD
DESERVES TO BELIEVE

794
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,332
THAT HIS FATHER
IS A HERO.

795
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,418
AND BELIEVING IT,
YOU BECAME ONE.

796
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,131
IF HE COULD SEE YOU TODAY,

797
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,383
I KNOW HE WOULD BE
SO PROUD OF YOU.

798
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,893
IF I'M A HERO...

799
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,189
IT WAS ALL BECAUSE
OF YOU...

800
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,984
SIR.

801
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,171
-JOHN.
-YES, SIR.

802
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,297
CALL YOUR MOTHER.

803
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,386
FELICITY: I FIGURED OUT
THE SILVER LINING

804
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,932
TO THE WHOLE TORPEDOING
OUR ONLY VIABLE PRODUCT IS

805
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,892
THAT WE ARE GONNA SAVE
SO MUCH MONEY ON SERVERS

806
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,393
BECAUSE ARCHER WAS
A POWER SUCK.

807
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,521
NOT EVEN A CHUCKLE.

808
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:55,107
I GUESS I'M NOT
REALLY IN THE MOOD

809
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,233
FOR THE WHOLE
DARK HUMOR THING,

810
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,525
WHAT WITH OUR ONLY
VIABLE PRODUCT

811
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,610
BEING
DESTROYED AND ALL.

812
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,071
I'M SORRY I DESTROYED
OUR GOLDEN GOOSE.

813
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:04,074
GOLDEN EGG. GOOSE?

814
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,867
YOU KNOW, WE COULD REBUILD.

815
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:10,038
MAKE IT BETTER,
LESS STEALABLE.

816
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,624
HEH.

817
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:16,044
WHEN YOU WERE UPLOADING
THE SELF-DESTRUCT CODE,

818
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:19,422
I COPIED ARCHER'S ROOT CODE.

819
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:25,845
BUT WITH THAT AND YOUR
NOTES, WE COULD START OVER.

820
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,931
NO. I APPRECIATE THAT.

821
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,975
BUT AS LONG AS ARCHER'S
OUT THERE,

822
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,727
IT COULD FALL INTO
THE WRONG HANDS. AND...

823
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,063
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY
LEGACY'S GOING TO BE,

824
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,940
BUT IT CAN'T BE THAT.

825
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,150
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE SOMEONE

826
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,651
WHO HASN'T HEARD
DOC MAGNUS' OFFER.

827
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,194
[LOW WHISTLE]

828
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,030
RELAX. I KNOW.

829
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,824
LEGACY TRUMPS PAYDAY.

830
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,034
OH, I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE
THE CTO AND NOT THE CFO,

831
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,327
BECAUSE THE CFO WOULDN'T
BE SO CHILL

832
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,038
ABOUT ME DELETING OUR
ONLY, ONLY ASSET.

833
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,291
I HAVE A QUESTION.
DO WE HAVE A CFO?

834
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,251
NO. QUICK QUESTION,
DO WE NEED ONE?

835
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,044
HMM, I THINK WE SHOULD
PROBABLY FOCUS

836
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,879
ON COMING UP
WITH OUR NEXT PROJECT,

837
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,756
ONE THAT MAKES US
A LOT OF MONEY.

838
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,758
YES. ONE THAT
CAN HELP PEOPLE

839
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,511
BUT ALSO NOT LEAD TO
MASS DESTRUCTION.

840
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,263
OHH, IF WE HAVE TO.

841
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,389
YES, WE DO. WE MUST.

842
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,310
HEY, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
BEING OVERWATCH

843
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,061
WON'T BE YOUR ONLY LEGACY.

844
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:19,232
IT'LL BE WHATEVER YOU DO
NEXT HERE AT SMOAK TECH.

845
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:23,528
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ARCHER
THAT WAS DESTINED
TO CHANGE THE WORLD.

846
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,572
IT'S YOU...FELICITY SMOAK.

847
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,866
THANK YOU.

848

ALENA: HEH.

849
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,795
ALL RIGHT,
MADAME HELMET,

850
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,006
LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU'RE HIDING.

851
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,258
HERE GOES NOTHING.

852
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,471
IT SEEMS LIKE IT WORKED.

853
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,973
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

854
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:52,849
WHAT IS IT?

855
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:53,933
THIS HELMET
IS A SATELLITE

856
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,310
TO A MUCH LARGER
NETWORK.

857
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:56,936
GALAXY ONE WAS ABLE
TO EXPAND ARCHER.

858
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,980
HOLD ON. I KNOW BIG BROTHER
GETTING BIGGER

859
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:02,359
ISN'T EXACTLY GREAT,
BUT ISN'T ARCHER JUST
A SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM?

860
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,776
NO, NOT IF YOU
WEAPONIZE IT.

861
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,278
WEARING ONE OF THESE
WOULD BE LIKE

862
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,612
WEARING AN A.I.-POWERED
SIXTH SENSE.

863
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,324
PAIR THAT
WITH TECH-ENHANCED
STRENGTH AND AGILITY.

864
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,284
ONE OF THOSE TROOPERS
WAS ABLE TO TAKE OUT

865
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,744
HALF THE CANARIES.

866
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:16,455
A WHOLE ARMY OF THEM,
THEY'LL BE UNSTOPPABLE.

867
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,009
ACQUIRING THAT WEAPON
WAS A GREAT VICTORY,

868
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,345
BUT OLIVER QUEEN IS
STILL A THREAT.

869
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,264
YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH
YOUR BROTHER BEFORE HE
JEOPARDIZES

THE PLAN.

I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE.

872
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,688
BUT FIRST THINGS
FIRST.

873
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,278
YOU LIED TO ME,
YOU BETRAYED ME,

874
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,780
AND YOU KILLED
MY MOTHER.

875

[COUGHS AND GROANS]

877
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:54,369

DON'T UNDERSTAND.

878
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:57,163
STOP LYING...

879
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,333
-UH!
-AND TELL ME WHY.

SHE WAS THE LAST REMINDER
OF YOUR FORMER LIFE.

881
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,380
YOUR MOTHER WAS MAKING
YOU WEAK

882
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,173
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER DID.

883
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,801
AND I NEEDED YOU STRONG

TO LEAD THE NINTH CIRCLE.

FAMILY I HAD.

NO, WE ARE

887
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,145
DON'T YOU SEE?
I DID IT FOR YOU.
