1
00:00:02,195 --> 00:00:03,497
If the answers that we need

2
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:03,522
&nbsp

3
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:06,041
to stop Savitar and save
you are in the future,

4
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:06,066
&nbsp

5
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:07,224
then that's where I need to go.

6
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:07,249
&nbsp

7
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,138
You're from before she dies, aren't you?

8
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:09,163
&nbsp

9
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:11,208
You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.

10
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:11,232
&nbsp

11
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:12,732
Just tell me how you did it.

12
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:12,734
&nbsp

13
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:14,350
I had help. Her name's Tracy Brown.

14
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,352
&nbsp

15
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:15,982
She made the Speed Force trap for me.

16
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:16,007
&nbsp

17
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,996
You're telling me my ideas
about the Speed Force...

18
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:18,021
&nbsp

19
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:19,572
- I'm right?
- In the future.

20
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:19,597
&nbsp

21
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:21,724
We need you to build this trap now.

22
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:21,749
&nbsp

23
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:23,025
Caitlin's after Tracy.

24
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:23,027
&nbsp

25
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:24,279
That means she's working with Savitar.

26
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:24,304
&nbsp

27
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:26,162
- So you talked to Cecile?
- Told her everything.

28
00:00:26,172 --> 00:00:26,164
&nbsp

29
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:29,031
Told her I love her. I told
her that you're The Flash.

30
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,982
&nbsp

31
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:33,369
Like I told you from the beginning...

32
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:33,371
&nbsp

33
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:36,325
I am the future Flash.

34
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:40,694
&nbsp

35
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,511
It's like looking in a mirror.

36
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:43,536
&nbsp

37
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:46,786
Well... not quite.

38
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,333
&nbsp

39
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:50,222
You're not so scary without your armor.

40
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:50,247
&nbsp

41
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:52,240
What can I say?

42
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,265
&nbsp

43
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:53,848
I outgrew red.

44
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:53,873
&nbsp

45
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:55,653
I know what you are.

46
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:56,361
&nbsp

47
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:57,871
You're a time remnant.

48
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:57,896
&nbsp

49
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:00,324
A temporal duplicate...

50
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:00,349
&nbsp

51
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,565
created when you run back in time

52
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:02,567
&nbsp

53
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:04,263
and meet yourself.

54
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:04,591
&nbsp

55
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:08,417
You brought a remnant to
life last year to defeat Zoom.

56
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:08,419
&nbsp

57
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:11,884
Your duplicate died,
saving the multiverse,

58
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:11,909
&nbsp

59
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:14,744
and you continued
your happy little life.

60
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:14,746
&nbsp

61
00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:17,496
And it would've stayed that way,

62
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:17,498
&nbsp

63
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:20,216
but then you decided to play God.

64
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:20,218
&nbsp

65
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:23,919
You created Flashpoint
and changed everything.

66
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:23,921
&nbsp

67
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:25,838
I went to the future.

68
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:25,840
&nbsp

69
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,090
My future self told me that

70
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,092
&nbsp

71
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:30,939
he created time remnants to stop you.

72
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:30,964
&nbsp

73
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,062
But you slaughtered them all.

74
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:33,064
&nbsp

75
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:34,643
All but one.

76
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:34,668
&nbsp

77
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,265
Me.

78
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:36,267
&nbsp

79
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:38,189
I lived.

80
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:38,214
&nbsp

81
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:41,020
But a funny thing happened

82
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,022
&nbsp

83
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:42,738
when I did.

84
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:42,740
&nbsp

85
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,191
You. Joe.

86
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:45,193
&nbsp

87
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:47,360
Wally, Cisco.

88
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:47,777
&nbsp

89
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:52,191
You all shunned me because I
wasn't the true Barry Allen.

90
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:52,253
&nbsp

91
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:54,333
I was an aberration.

92
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:54,335
&nbsp

93
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:57,252
A disposable hero.

94
00:01:57,262 --> 00:01:57,277
&nbsp

95
00:01:57,287 --> 00:02:00,478
Future you failed to
mention that, didn't he?

96
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:00,503
&nbsp

97
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:03,292
How did you become Savitar?

98
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:03,317
&nbsp

99
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,011
I was broken...

100
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:05,013
&nbsp

101
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:06,629
and alone.

102
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:06,631
&nbsp

103
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:09,131
I wanted the pain to end.

104
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:09,133
&nbsp

105
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:12,681
And that's when I
realized the truth, Barry.

106
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:12,706
&nbsp

107
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,770
God feels no pain.

108
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:14,772
&nbsp

109
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:17,556
All I had to do was become one.

110
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:17,558
&nbsp

111
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:20,699
And I only need two more things:

112
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:21,173
&nbsp

113
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,806
for Iris to die

114
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:22,831
&nbsp

115
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:26,525
so that you are driven
so far into the dark

116
00:02:26,535 --> 00:02:26,550
&nbsp

117
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,451
that I can be born.

118
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:28,453
&nbsp

119
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:30,152
And the other?

120
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,894
&nbsp

121
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:35,384
It may sound ironic
given who I'm talking to,

122
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:35,409
&nbsp

123
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:37,862
but I'll keep that one to myself.

124
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:37,887
&nbsp

125
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:40,104
What happens if I kill myself?

126
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:40,106
&nbsp

127
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:43,847
If I die, then you'll never be created.

128
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:43,872
&nbsp

129
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:45,925
Cause and effect's a tricky thing.

130
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:45,965
&nbsp

131
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,765
Didn't work so well for Eddie, did it?

132
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:47,767
&nbsp

133
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,550
Shot himself in the chest...

134
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:49,552
&nbsp

135
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:51,302
Thawne's still kicking around.

136
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:51,304
&nbsp

137
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:54,188
See, that's the thing
about time travel, Barry.

138
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:54,190
&nbsp

139
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,691
The more you do it, the
less the rules apply to you.

140
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:57,693
&nbsp

141
00:02:57,703 --> 00:02:59,393
But us having this conversation now...

142
00:02:59,403 --> 00:02:59,395
&nbsp

143
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:01,028
we're changing the future.

144
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:01,030
&nbsp

145
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,916
Are we?

146
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:03,783
&nbsp

147
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:06,817
My ascendancy is nearing.

148
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:06,819
&nbsp

149
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:09,799
When I have control of all of time,

150
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:09,824
&nbsp

151
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:14,650
it will be you who is
abandoned and forgotten.

152
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:23,917
&nbsp

153
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:25,503
You're gonna die right here!

154
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:25,505
&nbsp

155
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:27,713
I forgot to tell you...

156
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:27,738
&nbsp

157
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:30,307
my suit's cooler than yours.

158
00:03:30,317 --> 00:04:04,883

&nbsp

161
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,883
It's impossible.

162
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:11,908
&nbsp

163
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,414
I don't understand. How
could Savitar be you?

164
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:14,461
&nbsp

165
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,904
He's not me. Not really.

166
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:16,929
&nbsp

167
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,547
He's all the worst parts of you.

168
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:18,549
&nbsp

169
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
It's like in "Star Trek"
when the transporter

170
00:04:20,617 --> 00:04:20,632
&nbsp

171
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:23,920
splits Kirk into good Kirk and bad Kirk.

172
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:23,945
&nbsp

173
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:26,600
Please tell me you at least
have "Star Trek" on your Earth.

174
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:26,625
&nbsp

175
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:29,014
- "Voyager."
- I hate spinoffs.

176
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:29,039
&nbsp

177
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,362
That explains why Caitlin
was willing to follow him.

178
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:31,364
&nbsp

179
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,906
- He has a face that she trusts.
- Half of one anyway.

180
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:33,931
&nbsp

181
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,645
So when the Legends found
that message in the Waverider

182
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:36,669
&nbsp

183
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:39,154
from old you saying
"Don't trust Barry Allen,"

184
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:39,179
&nbsp

185
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,693
it was talking about
Savitar Barry Allen.

186
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:41,718
&nbsp

187
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:44,008
It's all coming together...

188
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:44,010
&nbsp

189
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,460
in the worst way.

190
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:45,462
&nbsp

191
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:47,628
You said you made Savitar?

192
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:47,630
&nbsp

193
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,836
- How?
- Peep this.

194
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:50,648
&nbsp

195
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,404
Four years from now,

196
00:04:52,414 --> 00:04:52,429
&nbsp

197
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,154
future Flash creates...

198
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:55,179
&nbsp

199
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,221
a time remnant to fight Savitar.

200
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:57,223
&nbsp

201
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:59,756
But Savitar lets that remnant live

202
00:04:59,766 --> 00:04:59,781
&nbsp

203
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,045
so that it can later become Savitar.

204
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:02,070
&nbsp

205
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,896
So once Savitar is
imprisoned in the Speed Force,

206
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:04,898
&nbsp

207
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:07,186
this remnant starts to go crazy.

208
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:07,218
&nbsp

209
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:10,712
And he goes back in time to the past...

210
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:10,737
&nbsp

211
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:12,653
and becomes Savitar.

212
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:12,655
&nbsp

213
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:15,154
Creating the lie that he
was the first speedster,

214
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:15,179
&nbsp

215
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,576
spreading the myth and recruiting
acolytes throughout the ages.

216
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:18,578
&nbsp

217
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:19,961
That doesn't make any sense.

218
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:19,986
&nbsp

219
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:22,964
Which came first, Savitar
or the time remnant?

220
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:22,966
&nbsp

221
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:25,482
It's a closed loop.
No beginning, no end.

222
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:25,507
&nbsp

223
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:26,990
It's just one endless cycle.

224
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,015
&nbsp

225
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,350
Classic chicken and the
egg scenario, I think, eh?

226
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,375
&nbsp

227
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:30,638
A time remnant, it's, um...

228
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:30,640
&nbsp

229
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,026
it's like a duplicate of you, right?

230
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:32,051
&nbsp

231
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:34,225
So it has your feelings, your memories.

232
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:34,250
&nbsp

233
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,364
So why would he want to hurt us?

234
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:36,390
&nbsp

235
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,357
Why would he want to kill Iris?

236
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:43,432
&nbsp

237
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:46,440
H.R., how's Tracy coming
with the Speed Force trap?

238
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:46,465
&nbsp

239
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:48,406
Good, yeah, good. Slow.

240
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:48,408
&nbsp

241
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:50,173
Get her to speed up, all right?

242
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:50,198
&nbsp

243
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,782
I'll do that now. Can do.

244
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:51,807
&nbsp

245
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,050
If Savitar is a version
of Barry from the future

246
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,075
&nbsp

247
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:56,864
and he remembers
everything that Barry does,

248
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:56,866
&nbsp

249
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:59,392
how are we ever going to come
up with a plan to stop him?

250
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:11,979
&nbsp

251
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:13,713
What was he like?

252
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:13,738
&nbsp

253
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,635
Broken.

254
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:17,401
&nbsp

255
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:18,706
You know...

256
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:19,846
&nbsp

257
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:23,244
all this time I thought
that Savitar is this...

258
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:23,534
&nbsp

259
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:24,995
monster.

260
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:28,191
&nbsp

261
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:31,048
It's hard to picture
what might happen, and...

262
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:31,073
&nbsp

263
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,499
it being you that...

264
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:34,445
&nbsp

265
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:37,163
I... I know it's not you. I'm...

266
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:38,422
&nbsp

267
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,338
Part of him is.

268
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:42,804
&nbsp

269
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:45,456
He said it was like looking
in a mirror, and he was right.

270
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:45,458
&nbsp

271
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:46,976
But not just the way that he looked.

272
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:47,001
&nbsp

273
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:48,359
It was...

274
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:49,351
&nbsp

275
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:51,545
it was his eyes.

276
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:51,547
&nbsp

277
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:54,392
The pain that was inside them.

278
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:54,417
&nbsp

279
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:56,773
I've seen that in myself.

280
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,887
&nbsp

281
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:00,031
When I think about...

282
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,056
&nbsp

283
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:03,062
how my parents died so violently...

284
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:04,343
&nbsp

285
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:07,074
sometimes I want to repay that
violence with more violence.

286
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:07,099
&nbsp

287
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:09,260
I want to make someone else...

288
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,285
&nbsp

289
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,399
hurt as much as I do.

290
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:11,401
&nbsp

291
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,699
But you don't ever do that.

292
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:14,723
&nbsp

293
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,792
You're not him. You're a good person.

294
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:16,794
&nbsp

295
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:19,634
But it's in there,
you know. That's in me.

296
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:19,659
&nbsp

297
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,526
That power, that pain,

298
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:22,528
&nbsp

299
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:25,663
that's where Savitar
comes from. From loss.

300
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:26,691
&nbsp

301
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,437
From losing you.

302
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,578
&nbsp

303
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:32,029
You're not going to lose me.

304
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:32,054
&nbsp

305
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:33,671
Do you hear me?

306
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,424
&nbsp

307
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,843
And we are going to stop Savitar.

308
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:37,367
&nbsp

309
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:40,029
You are not alone. He is.

310
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:40,054
&nbsp

311
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:42,320
And he is not a god.

312
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,601
&nbsp

313
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:48,386
Jay told me that we're not gods.

314
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:49,011
&nbsp

315
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,888
He was wrong.

316
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:50,890
&nbsp

317
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,027
We could be.

318
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:52,052
&nbsp

319
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:55,119
Any speedster, and
it wouldn't take much.

320
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:55,144
&nbsp

321
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:57,293
When the love that we feel in our hearts

322
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:57,318
&nbsp

323
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:59,396
is drowned in anger...

324
00:07:59,406 --> 00:07:59,398
&nbsp

325
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:02,566
when the bad memories
outweigh the good ones.

326
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:04,160
&nbsp

327
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,215
What am I going to have
to become to stop him?

328
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:10,972
&nbsp

329
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,377
Hey! Oh, bad time?

330
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:13,379
&nbsp

331
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,912
No, man, what's up?

332
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:14,914
&nbsp

333
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:17,248
I just came up with the best idea ever.

334
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:17,250
&nbsp

335
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,416
Either that or it's the worst idea ever.

336
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:19,418
&nbsp

337
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:20,551
- But...
- It's an idea.

338
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:20,576
&nbsp

339
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:22,023
It's an idea!

340
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:23,172
&nbsp

341
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:24,922
You want to give me a perm?

342
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:24,924
&nbsp

343
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:26,938
It's not for your hair, Steel Magnolia.

344
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:26,963
&nbsp

345
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,759
This is for your brain, okay?

346
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:28,761
&nbsp

347
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:31,896
I want to stop you from
making new memories.

348
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:31,898
&nbsp

349
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,610
What are you talking about?

350
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:33,635
&nbsp

351
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,255
Savitar knows everything we're gonna do

352
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:35,280
&nbsp

353
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,857
because he remembers doing it.

354
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:36,882
&nbsp

355
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,841
He's a future Barry. So...

356
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:38,866
&nbsp

357
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:42,255
what if Barry can't remember
what we're doing now?

358
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:42,280
&nbsp

359
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,140
You want to mess with his brain?

360
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,164
&nbsp

361
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,881
Just a little bit.

362
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:45,883
&nbsp

363
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,666
It's a minimal procedure.

364
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:47,667
&nbsp

365
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,601
It'll still be the same
Barry you know and love,

366
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:49,626
&nbsp

367
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:51,969
except he just won't be able
to retain new information.

368
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:51,971
&nbsp

369
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,404
There's two types of memory,
Allen. Short-term and long-term.

370
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:54,429
&nbsp

371
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:56,841
- Long-term is where you...
- Okay, Julian, just stop.

372
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:56,843
&nbsp

373
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:59,222
This is my presentation;
I'm the expert here.

374
00:08:59,232 --> 00:08:59,247
&nbsp

375
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:01,429
This is the part of your brain
that retains new information

376
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,461
&nbsp

377
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,716
before sending it to the
cortex to be stored forever.

378
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:03,741
&nbsp

379
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,503
So what if we block that chain...

380
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:06,528
&nbsp

381
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:08,269
with a magnetic disruption?

382
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:08,271
&nbsp

383
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,284
So Savitar won't be able to remember

384
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:10,309
&nbsp

385
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:12,581
whatever strategy we come
up with to defeat him.

386
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:12,606
&nbsp

387
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,742
Which means he can't be two
steps ahead of us anymore.

388
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:14,744
&nbsp

389
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,078
With any luck, we'll actually
put him one step behind.

390
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:17,080
&nbsp

391
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,329
Beautiful.

392
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:18,331
&nbsp

393
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,056
Cause and effect.

394
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:20,081
&nbsp

395
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:22,013
Barry, what do you think?

396
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:25,459
&nbsp

397
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:27,114
Let's do it.

398
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:27,139
&nbsp

399
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,259
Wait, wasn't Caitlin the
expert on brains around here?

400
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,261
&nbsp

401
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,881
She was.

402
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:32,906
&nbsp

403
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,029
But this is something we'll
have to do without her.

404
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,053
&nbsp

405
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:37,719
I trust you.

406
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:39,636
&nbsp

407
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,102
You won't feel a thing.

408
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:41,104
&nbsp

409
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,529
Okay, let's get this show on the road.

410
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:43,554
&nbsp

411
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,959
The disrupter is attached
to your hippocampus.

412
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:45,984
&nbsp

413
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:47,608
So, it's ready.

414
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:47,610
&nbsp

415
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,310
Okay, ready for zapping.

416
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,335
&nbsp

417
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:51,195
Can we not call it "zapping"?

418
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:51,197
&nbsp

419
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:53,693
Ready to activate.

420
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:53,718
&nbsp

421
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:54,982
In three...

422
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:54,984
&nbsp

423
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,033
two...

424
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:56,035
&nbsp

425
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,234
one.

426
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:59,921
&nbsp

427
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:02,491
- Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.
- Way to go, slugger.

428
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:02,517
&nbsp

429
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:03,669
Run, Barry, run!

430
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:03,693
&nbsp

431
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,010
I have watched you be
in love with Iris...

432
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,035
&nbsp

433
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:08,210
Maybe we were meant to be together.

434
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,273
&nbsp

435
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:10,782
Okay, that should do it.

436
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:10,784
&nbsp

437
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,234
All right.

438
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,051
&nbsp

439
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:16,101
Right. How do you feel?

440
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:16,421
&nbsp

441
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:18,062
I feel fine.

442
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:18,087
&nbsp

443
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,898
You see? He feels fine.

444
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,246
&nbsp

445
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,577
Barry...

446
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:24,592
&nbsp

447
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:25,968
Barry?

448
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:26,967
&nbsp

449
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:28,203
Barry.

450
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:28,726
&nbsp

451
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,375
Who's Barry?

452
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:30,793
&nbsp

453
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:32,328
Not fine.

454
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:33,393
&nbsp

455
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:34,898
Who are all of you?

456
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:41,756
&nbsp

457
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,621
What's going on?

458
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:43,646
&nbsp

459
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,184
Seriously, who are you guys?

460
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:45,209
&nbsp

461
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:46,903
- Okay, Barry, stay calm.
- Who's Barry?

462
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:46,928
&nbsp

463
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,584
- Cisco!
- Slight miscalculation.

464
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:48,609
&nbsp

465
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:50,020
Slight wouldn't be a word I'd use.

466
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,045
&nbsp

467
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:51,224
Where the hell am I?

468
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:51,225
&nbsp

469
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,615
Is this a dentist office?

470
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:52,640
&nbsp

471
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,560
No, no. This is S.T.A.R. Labs.

472
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:54,562
&nbsp

473
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,822
St... Labs? A laboratory?

474
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:56,847
&nbsp

475
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,797
St... a laboratory? What are you?

476
00:10:58,807 --> 00:10:58,799
&nbsp

477
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:01,139
- Are you guys experimenting on me?
- No one is ex...

478
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:01,164
&nbsp

479
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,639
Well, yes, technically, yes.

480
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:02,664
&nbsp

481
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:03,670
But... but it was consensual.

482
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:03,695
&nbsp

483
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,240
- You were? You...
- Yes.

484
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:05,265
&nbsp

485
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,801
Why can't I remember anything?

486
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:06,826
&nbsp

487
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:08,053
Why can't I remember my name?

488
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:08,078
&nbsp

489
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:09,475
Your name is Barry.

490
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:09,500
&nbsp

491
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,014
My name's not Barry.

492
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:11,039
&nbsp

493
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,747
I don't know what my
name is, but my name's...

494
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:12,772
&nbsp

495
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:15,327
"Bartholomew Henry Allen."

496
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:15,352
&nbsp

497
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:17,256
- That's not a good name.
- Look, Barry...

498
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:17,281
&nbsp

499
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,528
Are you sure I don't
go by "Bart"? Can...

500
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:19,553
&nbsp

501
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:21,410
"Bart" feels more natural to me.

502
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:21,435
&nbsp

503
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:23,463
- Can we go with Bart?
- Bart's kinda cool.

504
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:23,465
&nbsp

505
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,577
- Okay.
- Wally!

506
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:24,602
&nbsp

507
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:26,913
Okay, hey. Let's just
get you back in the chair.

508
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:26,938
&nbsp

509
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:28,507
No! No, no, no. I'm not...

510
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:28,531
&nbsp

511
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,912
- I'm not getting in the chair.
- Just get in the chair...

512
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:29,937
&nbsp

513
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:31,717
No, how do I know you
didn't kidnap me here

514
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:31,742
&nbsp

515
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:33,674
to do some weird brain surgery on me?

516
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:33,699
&nbsp

517
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,032
Or maybe you're like those criminals

518
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:35,034
&nbsp

519
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:36,367
who trick people into hotel rooms

520
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:36,369
&nbsp

521
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,751
so they can steal their kidneys.

522
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:37,776
&nbsp

523
00:11:37,786 --> 00:11:38,890
Do I still have my kidneys?

524
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:38,915
&nbsp

525
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:40,110
We don't want your kidneys.

526
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,135
&nbsp

527
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:41,232
Okay, Barry...

528
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:41,257
&nbsp

529
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,218
look at these photographs.

530
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:43,626
&nbsp

531
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,265
We're your friends.

532
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:45,290
&nbsp

533
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,960
Your family.

534
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,998
&nbsp

535
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,265
We just want to help you, okay?

536
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:58,291
&nbsp

537
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,200
That's a nice ring.

538
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,226
&nbsp

539
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,938
Who's the lucky guy?

540
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:04,383
&nbsp

541
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:06,383
You are, Barry.

542
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,622
&nbsp

543
00:12:07,632 --> 00:12:09,200
Look, I know you're scared, okay?

544
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:09,225
&nbsp

545
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:11,169
You can trust us.

546
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:12,403
&nbsp

547
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:13,612
Cisco.

548
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:13,637
&nbsp

549
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,395
- A minute.
- Yes, sir.

550
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:15,420
&nbsp

551
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,635
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

552
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:17,660
&nbsp

553
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,224
- Wally, stay with him, okay?
- Me?

554
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:22,255
&nbsp

555
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:24,962
So how do we know each other?

556
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:24,987
&nbsp

557
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:27,216
Oh, I'm your brother.

558
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:32,133
&nbsp

559
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:34,436
There is no sign of any...

560
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:34,461
&nbsp

561
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,419
permanent structural damage.

562
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:36,444
&nbsp

563
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:38,911
Then why can't he remember anything?

564
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:39,682
&nbsp

565
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,919
Julian?

566
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:40,944
&nbsp

567
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:42,816
He appears to be suffering
from some sort of...

568
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:42,818
&nbsp

569
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,520
- psychogenic retrograde amnesia.
- ... Amnesia.

570
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:45,537
&nbsp

571
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:48,552
What if we didn't account for
Barry's increase neural velocity,

572
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:48,577
&nbsp

573
00:12:48,587 --> 00:12:50,074
due to his super speed?

574
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:50,099
&nbsp

575
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:52,681
Wait, do we think he
knows he's The Flash?

576
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:52,706
&nbsp

577
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:54,208
That he has super speed?

578
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:55,071
&nbsp

579
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:57,036
Hey, Barry. Catch.

580
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:59,457
&nbsp

581
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:00,864
Sorry.

582
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:01,802
&nbsp

583
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:02,833
Oh, my Lord.

584
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:02,858
&nbsp

585
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,583
- He's, like, god-awful.
- He's pathetic.

586
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:04,585
&nbsp

587
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,550
Can't we flip a switch... undo it?

588
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:06,575
&nbsp

589
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,387
Okay, we are not
flipping any more switches

590
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:08,389
&nbsp

591
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,614
until we figure this thing out.

592
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,357
&nbsp

593
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,722
It's Cecile. Hey, babe.

594
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:14,747
&nbsp

595
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:16,762
An emergency?

596
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:16,764
&nbsp

597
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:18,685
All right, bye.

598
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:19,400
&nbsp

599
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,867
Okay, Cecile needs Barry at CCPD,

600
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:21,869
&nbsp

601
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,602
like, right now. She says it's urgent.

602
00:13:23,612 --> 00:13:23,604
&nbsp

603
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:25,671
He can't possibly go
out in that condition.

604
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:25,673
&nbsp

605
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:29,975
Okay, um, my dad and I
will take Barry to Cecile.

606
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:29,977
&nbsp

607
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:33,078
You and Cisco figure out a
way to get Barry's memory back.

608
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:33,080
&nbsp

609
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,112
And fast.

610
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:34,114
&nbsp

611
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,180
Yeah?

612
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,182
&nbsp

613
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:36,646
Okay.

614
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:38,039
&nbsp

615
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:39,383
Okay.

616
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:39,413
&nbsp

617
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:41,513
You don't want to work?

618
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:41,538
&nbsp

619
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:43,404
Well then, I don't need you!

620
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:45,025
&nbsp

621
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,138
Um, am I to infer then... that, uh,

622
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:48,163
&nbsp

623
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:49,568
you've hit a little speed bump

624
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:49,593
&nbsp

625
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:50,765
in your quest to build a device

626
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:50,790
&nbsp

627
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,055
to trap Savitar in the
Speed Force? The... the...

628
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:53,080
&nbsp

629
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,207
Accelerated matter
microgenerator projectile.

630
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:55,232
&nbsp

631
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:57,218
No, I know. It doesn't
exactly roll off the tongue.

632
00:13:57,228 --> 00:13:57,243
&nbsp

633
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,298
No, it doesn't.

634
00:13:58,308 --> 00:13:58,323
&nbsp

635
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,401
How about...

636
00:13:59,411 --> 00:13:59,403
&nbsp

637
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:02,124
we call this fancy device of yours...

638
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:02,149
&nbsp

639
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,632
- You know, you probably shouldn't...
- ... call it the...

640
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:03,657
&nbsp

641
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,882
Speed Force Cannon.

642
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:04,907
&nbsp

643
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,007
Speed Force Bazooka.

644
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:07,032
&nbsp

645
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:08,859
Speed Force Gun.

646
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:09,226
&nbsp

647
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:11,171
Speed Force Bazooka. Is better, yeah.

648
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:11,195
&nbsp

649
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:13,962
But if the Speed Force Bazooka
doesn't start working soon,

650
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:13,964
&nbsp

651
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:15,130
we're gonna have to start calling it

652
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,132
&nbsp

653
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:16,332
the Speed Force Epic Fail.

654
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:16,334
&nbsp

655
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:18,425
- Why? What's the problem?
- Okay. The accelerometer.

656
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:18,450
&nbsp

657
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,769
It sucks a hell of a lot of air watts,

658
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:19,794
&nbsp

659
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:22,481
- which is measured...
- Alright. Stop talking science!

660
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:22,506
&nbsp

661
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:24,861
You need to take a step back...

662
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:24,886
&nbsp

663
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,208
from the Speed Force Bazooka.

664
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:26,210
&nbsp

665
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,754
- There's not time.
- There's always time!

666
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:28,779
&nbsp

667
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:31,480
Because sometimes, to move forward,

668
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:31,482
&nbsp

669
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:33,182
you have to take a step back.

670
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:33,184
&nbsp

671
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:35,184
Step... back.

672
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:35,186
&nbsp

673
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:36,418
You see? Yes.

674
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:36,420
&nbsp

675
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,753
Shake a little...

676
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:37,755
&nbsp

677
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:39,503
Shake out those
shoulders. I feel like...

678
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:39,528
&nbsp

679
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:40,675
Oh, oh, my gosh.

680
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:40,700
&nbsp

681
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,909
The tension in your shoulders...

682
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:42,934
&nbsp

683
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:45,327
Think of something that calms you.

684
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:45,329
&nbsp

685
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,292
- Coffee.
- Co...

686
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:47,317
&nbsp

687
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:50,198
Oh, yes.

688
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:50,200
&nbsp

689
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,191
But not just any coffee. Piping hot...

690
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:52,193
&nbsp

691
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:53,446
- Indonesian dark roast with...
- Yep.

692
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:53,471
&nbsp

693
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:55,070
Raspberry and coriander...

694
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,054
&nbsp

695
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,042
I've never met another person

696
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:00,044
&nbsp

697
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:02,511
who uses copious amounts
of caffeine to chill out.

698
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:02,513
&nbsp

699
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:05,350
I've never met another person either.

700
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:13,575
&nbsp

701
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:16,589
I... I-I-I'm relaxed.

702
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:16,614
&nbsp

703
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,849
Are you relaxed?

704
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:17,874
&nbsp

705
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,011
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

706
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:19,036
&nbsp

707
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:20,963
You, uh...

708
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:20,965
&nbsp

709
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:22,664
- And I'll... okay.
- Yeah.

710
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:22,666
&nbsp

711
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:24,400
I mean... okay.

712
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:24,402
&nbsp

713
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:25,834
Yeah.

714
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:29,617
&nbsp

715
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:30,781
Good morning, people.

716
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:30,806
&nbsp

717
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:32,251
Hi. I'm Barry Allen.

718
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:32,276
&nbsp

719
00:15:32,286 --> 00:15:34,743
- You can call me Bart.
- O... kay.

720
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:34,745
&nbsp

721
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:37,179
So you said there was an
emergency. Where's the fire?

722
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,204
&nbsp

723
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:38,609
Ah, it's funny you
should put it like that.

724
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:38,634
&nbsp

725
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:40,389
- Lucious Coolidge.
- Who?

726
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:40,414
&nbsp

727
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:42,851
- Heat Monger.
- The worst arsonist Central City's seen

728
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:42,876
&nbsp

729
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:45,364
since Mick Rory went off the grid.

730
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:45,882
&nbsp

731
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:48,615
That is, until Flash here stopped him.

732
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:48,640
&nbsp

733
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,898
What's Flash?

734
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:49,923
&nbsp

735
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:52,451
Uh, ah, so what... what is the problem?

736
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:52,476
&nbsp

737
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,664
Judge Hankerson. He's got
an opening in his docket,

738
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:54,689
&nbsp

739
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,617
so he moved Coolidge's
probable cause hearing

740
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:56,642
&nbsp

741
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:57,975
up to this afternoon.

742
00:15:57,985 --> 00:15:58,000
&nbsp

743
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,301
Barry was the CSI on the case.

744
00:15:59,311 --> 00:15:59,303
&nbsp

745
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:00,803
So I need him to testify

746
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:00,805
&nbsp

747
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:02,937
in order to hold
Coolidge over for trial.

748
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:02,962
&nbsp

749
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:04,640
Uh, yeah, no.

750
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:04,642
&nbsp

751
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:06,221
Barry can't do that.

752
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:06,246
&nbsp

753
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,579
Why not?

754
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,909
&nbsp

755
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,375
Uh...

756
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:11,775
&nbsp

757
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:13,726
What do you mean he has amnesia?

758
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:13,751
&nbsp

759
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,298
Bar, what's her name?

760
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:15,323
&nbsp

761
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,890
Um... Felicia?

762
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,989
&nbsp

763
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,322
Oh, my God.

764
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:20,324
&nbsp

765
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,024
Is this... is this like a...

766
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:22,026
&nbsp

767
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:23,517
like a Flash thing?

768
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:23,542
&nbsp

769
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:24,745
Was he battling a super villain

770
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:24,770
&nbsp

771
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,783
who used his evil powers
to steal Barry's memory?

772
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:26,808
&nbsp

773
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:27,885
Um...

774
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:27,910
&nbsp

775
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,246
no, we sort of accidentally did this

776
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:30,271
&nbsp

777
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,911
to him ourselves.

778
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:31,936
&nbsp

779
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:33,402
Why?

780
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:33,404
&nbsp

781
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:34,970
That doesn't matter. What does matter...

782
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:34,972
&nbsp

783
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:37,005
is you stalling that judge.

784
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:37,007
&nbsp

785
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:39,241
Barry is in no condition
to testify in court.

786
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:39,243
&nbsp

787
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:41,343
Joe, if Barry can't testify,

788
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:41,345
&nbsp

789
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:42,711
Coolidge walks.

790
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:42,713
&nbsp

791
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:44,480
And then God help us all.

792
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:44,482
&nbsp

793
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:46,381
Okay. We'll figure out something.

794
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:46,383
&nbsp

795
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,683
Please do.

796
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,553
&nbsp

797
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:51,242
It was nice meeting you.

798
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:51,267
&nbsp

799
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,939
Oh. Yeah.

800
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,964
&nbsp

801
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:55,491
You too... Bart.

802
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:59,002
&nbsp

803
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:01,421
I got some friends
down at the courthouse.

804
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:01,446
&nbsp

805
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:02,698
I'm gonna go down there
and see if we can delay

806
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:02,700
&nbsp

807
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,079
this whole Coolidge
situation, all right?

808
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:13,331
&nbsp

809
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:14,897
I'm sorry.

810
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:14,922
&nbsp

811
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:16,557
For what?

812
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:17,204
&nbsp

813
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:19,815
I don't know. It just
seems like everybody's upset

814
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:19,817
&nbsp

815
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:21,717
and it feels like it's my fault.

816
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:21,719
&nbsp

817
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:24,290
No. No, not at all.

818
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,751
&nbsp

819
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:26,321
Look, we just want you
to get back to normal.

820
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:26,323
&nbsp

821
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,946
That's it, okay?

822
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:28,352
&nbsp

823
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:32,147
Well, I would, if I could
remember what normal is.

824
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:32,172
&nbsp

825
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:34,696
I mean, what have you
and I been doing lately?

826
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:34,698
&nbsp

827
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,147
Are we planning the wedding?

828
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:37,172
&nbsp

829
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,040
Like, are we sending
out wedding invitations

830
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,065
&nbsp

831
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,489
or picked a honeymoon destination, or...

832
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:41,514
&nbsp

833
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:44,274
Am I a warm weather guy
or a cold weather guy?

834
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:46,443
&nbsp

835
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:49,104
Actually, we've been a
little busy lately, so...

836
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:50,856
&nbsp

837
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,354
With what?

838
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,585
&nbsp

839
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,924
Um, nothing that you
need to worry about, okay?

840
00:17:57,934 --> 00:17:58,526
&nbsp

841
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,988
Okay. You know what's weird?

842
00:17:59,998 --> 00:17:59,990
&nbsp

843
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,190
I know we just ate, but
I'm already feeling hungry.

844
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,192
&nbsp

845
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:03,425
Yeah, let's get some food in you.

846
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:03,450
&nbsp

847
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,854
- All right.
- Okay.

848
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:05,908
&nbsp

849
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,297
What's that saying?

850
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:08,299
&nbsp

851
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:11,443
"Man plans and God laughs?"

852
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:11,468
&nbsp

853
00:18:11,478 --> 00:18:13,302
Well, men are planning.

854
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:13,304
&nbsp

855
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:15,815
And what's the God of Speed doing?

856
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:16,252
&nbsp

857
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,868
Kneeling.

858
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:17,893
&nbsp

859
00:18:17,903 --> 00:18:19,808
Brooding time is over.

860
00:18:19,818 --> 00:18:19,810
&nbsp

861
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,651
You revealed yourself.

862
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:21,676
&nbsp

863
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,186
Now what?

864
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:23,211
&nbsp

865
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:26,079
Any idea what to do
with Flash and Friends?

866
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:26,104
&nbsp

867
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:27,983
Because we are getting pretty close

868
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:27,985
&nbsp

869
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:29,651
to your big becoming,

870
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:29,653
&nbsp

871
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:31,219
and if we don't take them down,

872
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:31,221
&nbsp

873
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,689
neither one of us gets what we want.

874
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:36,036
&nbsp

875
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:37,808
Hello? Anybody home?

876
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:41,057
&nbsp

877
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,441
What are you doing?

878
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:42,466
&nbsp

879
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:43,932
Who are you?

880
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:43,934
&nbsp

881
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,873
What's wrong with you?

882
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:45,898
&nbsp

883
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:49,499
Who... am... I?

884
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:53,584
&nbsp

885
00:18:53,594 --> 00:18:55,570
- Science club.
- Yeah.

886
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:55,615
&nbsp

887
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,748
- Key Club...
- Mm-hmm.

888
00:18:56,758 --> 00:18:56,773
&nbsp

889
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:58,310
- Astronomy Club...
- Yup.

890
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,335
&nbsp

891
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,357
- Yearbook?
- Yeah.

892
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:00,412
&nbsp

893
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:02,651
- And anime club?
- Oh, yeah.

894
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:02,676
&nbsp

895
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:05,485
You loved... loved... "Dragon Ball Z."

896
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:05,510
&nbsp

897
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,508
I don't know what that is.

898
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:07,533
&nbsp

899
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:09,057
Yeah, I couldn't
explain that show to you

900
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:09,082
&nbsp

901
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:11,032
- even if I wanted to, so...
- Okay.

902
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:11,057
&nbsp

903
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,909
- Sorry.
- I definitely had...

904
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:12,934
&nbsp

905
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,696
quite the nerd thing going on, huh?

906
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:14,721
&nbsp

907
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:16,184
Yeah, a little bit.

908
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:16,186
&nbsp

909
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,123
I thought you said we were
best friends in high school.

910
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:18,148
&nbsp

911
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,303
Yeah, we were.

912
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:19,328
&nbsp

913
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:21,465
Then why didn't you give
me some advice, help me out?

914
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:21,490
&nbsp

915
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,558
Oh, believe me, okay? I tried.

916
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:23,560
&nbsp

917
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,826
- Really? You did?
- Yes.

918
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:24,828
&nbsp

919
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:26,561
Okay, because I have evidence

920
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:26,586
&nbsp

921
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,100
that you did not.

922
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,125
&nbsp

923
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:29,610
Um, I don't remember any of this,

924
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:29,635
&nbsp

925
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:32,812
but even I can see how
wrong that look was.

926
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,041
&nbsp

927
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:35,125
This is visual terrorism.

928
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:35,150
&nbsp

929
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,976
I won't look at it anymore.

930
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,390
&nbsp

931
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,843
What?

932
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:41,906
&nbsp

933
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,062
Uh, you just...

934
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:44,087
&nbsp

935
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:46,383
You're so different. You're so light.

936
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:46,385
&nbsp

937
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,000
What do you mean?

938
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,025
&nbsp

939
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:50,489
I don't know, it's
like you're not carrying

940
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:50,514
&nbsp

941
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,090
the weight of the
world on your shoulders.

942
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,562
&nbsp

943
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:56,393
So, what, I was like...

944
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:56,395
&nbsp

945
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,796
brooding all the time before?

946
00:19:58,806 --> 00:19:58,798
&nbsp

947
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,257
- Sometimes.
- Yeah?

948
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:00,282
&nbsp

949
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,467
- Yeah.
- Really?

950
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:03,400
&nbsp

951
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,031
I don't know, it's just...

952
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:05,056
&nbsp

953
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:08,500
it's really nice to
see you smiling so much.

954
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,390
&nbsp

955
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,937
I mean...

956
00:20:10,947 --> 00:20:11,867
&nbsp

957
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,703
how could I not,

958
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:13,728
&nbsp

959
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:16,575
knowing I'm gonna be with
you for the rest of my life?

960
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:23,664
&nbsp

961
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:25,222
- Uh-oh.
- What?

962
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:25,224
&nbsp

963
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:26,957
I got to get to the courthouse.

964
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:26,959
&nbsp

965
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:27,969
Oh, yeah, of course.

966
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:27,994
&nbsp

967
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:29,203
- Yeah, I got to...
- Hey, yeah.

968
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:29,228
&nbsp

969
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:30,477
Um...

970
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:30,866
&nbsp

971
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:32,881
I'll... yeah, later. Okay.

972
00:20:32,891 --> 00:20:32,906
&nbsp

973
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,298
Okay.

974
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:40,423
&nbsp

975
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:44,014
Docket number CC-15-204.

976
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:44,016
&nbsp

977
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:48,030
Evidentiary hearing for Central
City versus the defendant,

978
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,055
&nbsp

979
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:50,297
Lucious Coolidge.

980
00:20:50,307 --> 00:20:50,322
&nbsp

981
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,217
- I see the city wishes to file...
- Cutting it real close, guys..

982
00:20:53,227 --> 00:20:53,219
&nbsp

983
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:55,258
- ... felony charges...
- You ready to testify?

984
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:55,283
&nbsp

985
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:56,594
No. No, I'm not.

986
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:56,619
&nbsp

987
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:58,866
Yes, he is. He just
needs one minute, please.

988
00:20:58,876 --> 00:20:58,891
&nbsp

989
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:00,367
The prosecution may proceed.

990
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:00,392
&nbsp

991
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:01,959
Too late. He's up.

992
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:01,961
&nbsp

993
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:03,477
Here. Just take these.

994
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:03,502
&nbsp

995
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,844
I wear glasses?

996
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:04,869
&nbsp

997
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,475
You will now. Just put 'em on.

998
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:06,500
&nbsp

999
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,523
- You'll be okay.
- Just don't get them wet.

1000
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:08,555
&nbsp

1001
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,148
- Your Honor, I, uh...
- What? Wh...

1002
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:10,173
&nbsp

1003
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:12,726
I call Barry Allen to the stand.

1004
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:17,576
&nbsp

1005
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:19,653
Raise your right hand, please.

1006
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:20,055
&nbsp

1007
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:21,598
You swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

1008
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:21,623
&nbsp

1009
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:23,080
and nothing but the truth?

1010
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,082
&nbsp

1011
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:24,414
I do, yes.

1012
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:24,416
&nbsp

1013
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,383
Thank you. Miss Horton?

1014
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:26,385
&nbsp

1015
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:27,807
- Mr. Allen...
- Can I sit?

1016
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:27,832
&nbsp

1017
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:29,219
Please, just...

1018
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:29,221
&nbsp

1019
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:31,088
You are a crime scene investigator

1020
00:21:31,098 --> 00:21:31,090
&nbsp

1021
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,323
for the Central City
police department, correct?

1022
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:33,325
&nbsp

1023
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,092
Uh...

1024
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:35,543
&nbsp

1025
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:37,551
oh, this is so cool.

1026
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:37,576
&nbsp

1027
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:39,730
Well, I'm so glad you enjoy testifying,

1028
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:39,732
&nbsp

1029
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:41,698
but please just answer the question.

1030
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:41,700
&nbsp

1031
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,886
Of course.

1032
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:43,911
&nbsp

1033
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:47,171
Uh, yes, I am a CSI

1034
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:47,173
&nbsp

1035
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:51,059
at the CCPD under the expert
direction of Julian Albert.

1036
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:51,084
&nbsp

1037
00:21:51,094 --> 00:21:52,582
Smiley face.

1038
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:53,814
&nbsp

1039
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:55,761
Want to cut it out with the emojis?

1040
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:55,786
&nbsp

1041
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:57,181
Mr. Allen,

1042
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:57,183
&nbsp

1043
00:21:57,193 --> 00:21:59,049
can you tell me...

1044
00:21:59,059 --> 00:21:59,356
&nbsp

1045
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:01,661
in your expert opinion,

1046
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:01,686
&nbsp

1047
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,136
what substance do you
see in this photograph?

1048
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:04,161
&nbsp

1049
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:06,854
Uh, shellac flakes.

1050
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:06,879
&nbsp

1051
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:10,776
Shellac is a resin
secreted by female lac bugs

1052
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:10,801
&nbsp

1053
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:12,599
found in large quantities
of the trees in Thailand...

1054
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:12,624
&nbsp

1055
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,290
that's too fast, that's too...

1056
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,292
&nbsp

1057
00:22:14,302 --> 00:22:17,034
Mr. Allen, are you all right?

1058
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:17,059
&nbsp

1059
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,464
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm fine.

1060
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:19,489
&nbsp

1061
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:21,030
I just, um...

1062
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,539
&nbsp

1063
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,448
it's getting hot in here.

1064
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:23,488
&nbsp

1065
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:27,315
What else is unique
about shellac flakes?

1066
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:27,340
&nbsp

1067
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,071
It's the fire accelerant
used in all of the arson cases

1068
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:31,096
&nbsp

1069
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:33,497
associated with Heat Monger.

1070
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:33,522
&nbsp

1071
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:36,766
Such an embarrassing name.

1072
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:38,115
&nbsp

1073
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,591
I like it. I think it's great.

1074
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:40,617
&nbsp

1075
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:44,500
And how would you know when
shellac flakes have been used?

1076
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,525
&nbsp

1077
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:47,926
We calculate flame
temperature and burn patterns,

1078
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:47,997
&nbsp

1079
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:50,142
and a telltale sign is
when shellac is burned

1080
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:50,167
&nbsp

1081
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:52,833
into potassium perk-er-lorate

1082
00:22:52,843 --> 00:22:52,858
&nbsp

1083
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:54,474
or ammonium perchlorate,

1084
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:54,476
&nbsp

1085
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:57,356
which is considered a
high-temperature accelerant fire.

1086
00:22:57,366 --> 00:22:57,381
&nbsp

1087
00:22:57,391 --> 00:23:00,186
Hmm. So, then...

1088
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:00,638
&nbsp

1089
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:03,105
would you say the fires in these photos

1090
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:03,130
&nbsp

1091
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,931
would be considered high-temperature

1092
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:05,964
&nbsp

1093
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:08,098
accelerant fires?

1094
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:08,123
&nbsp

1095
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,411
Uh, yes,

1096
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:10,436
&nbsp

1097
00:23:10,446 --> 00:23:11,591
because...

1098
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:11,593
&nbsp

1099
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,725
Ow!

1100
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:12,727
&nbsp

1101
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:13,892
Uh-oh.

1102
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:15,265
&nbsp

1103
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:17,165
- Um...
- Mr. Allen?

1104
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:17,190
&nbsp

1105
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,790
Can you continue?

1106
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:18,815
&nbsp

1107
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:21,315
Yes, I can... I can continue.

1108
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:21,636
&nbsp

1109
00:23:21,646 --> 00:23:26,206
The... uh, yes, the fires were...

1110
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:26,208
&nbsp

1111
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:28,198
high-temperature accelerant fires,

1112
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:28,223
&nbsp

1113
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:32,058
because the flames...

1114
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:32,083
&nbsp

1115
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:34,958
were, were...

1116
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:34,983
&nbsp

1117
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:36,653
very yellow.

1118
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:36,678
&nbsp

1119
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:38,178
Very yellow?

1120
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:38,204
&nbsp

1121
00:23:38,214 --> 00:23:41,105
And that's your expert
opinion on accelerant fires?

1122
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:41,556
&nbsp

1123
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:43,337
Mr. Allen?

1124
00:23:43,347 --> 00:23:46,808
&nbsp

1125
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:50,689
Ms. Horton, if Mr. Allen
is unable to elaborate,

1126
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:50,714
&nbsp

1127
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:53,710
I'll have no choice but to dismiss.

1128
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:53,735
&nbsp

1129
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:55,151
Mr. Allen?

1130
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:55,176
&nbsp

1131
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:57,294
That's... um...

1132
00:23:57,304 --> 00:24:02,611
&nbsp

1133
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:04,100
Dismissed.

1134
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,577
&nbsp

1135
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:08,976
How'd it go?

1136
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:09,001
&nbsp

1137
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:11,335
Marvelous. They let the pyro go.

1138
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:11,360
&nbsp

1139
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,535
- What went wrong?
- Everything.

1140
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:13,560
&nbsp

1141
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,849
Barry's memory loss is
starting to become a problem.

1142
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:15,874
&nbsp

1143
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,607
It sure is.

1144
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:17,632
&nbsp

1145
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:19,265
For more than just him.

1146
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:20,629
&nbsp

1147
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:22,385
I don't have my speed.

1148
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:22,410
&nbsp

1149
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,729
Not anymore. And I know why.

1150
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:24,754
&nbsp

1151
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:27,046
If you want to fix this and help Barry,

1152
00:24:27,056 --> 00:24:27,071
&nbsp

1153
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:30,059
you are gonna do exactly as I say.

1154
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:34,092
&nbsp

1155
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:36,656
Now this Heat Monger's
gonna go free because of me,

1156
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:36,681
&nbsp

1157
00:24:36,691 --> 00:24:38,087
and I feel awful.

1158
00:24:38,097 --> 00:24:38,112
&nbsp

1159
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:39,468
Barry, it's not your fault.

1160
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:39,493
&nbsp

1161
00:24:39,503 --> 00:24:41,867
It's just that now there's
a bad guy on the streets,

1162
00:24:41,877 --> 00:24:41,892
&nbsp

1163
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:44,266
and I can't do anything about it.

1164
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,554
&nbsp

1165
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:49,977
What? Is that not something
I would've said before?

1166
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:50,002
&nbsp

1167
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:52,842
That is exactly something
you would've said before.

1168
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:52,867
&nbsp

1169
00:24:52,877 --> 00:24:57,173
There's just something about
you that always wants to help.

1170
00:24:57,183 --> 00:25:00,509
&nbsp

1171
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,670
This is our place?

1172
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:02,876
&nbsp

1173
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:06,003
How do we afford to live here?

1174
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:06,681
&nbsp

1175
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:08,148
Wow.

1176
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:08,150
&nbsp

1177
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,423
You have great taste.

1178
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:09,448
&nbsp

1179
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,552
Uh, actually, this is all you.

1180
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:12,554
&nbsp

1181
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:14,354
I find that hard to believe.

1182
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:16,159
&nbsp

1183
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:17,756
Is that me?

1184
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:17,781
&nbsp

1185
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,302
Yeah.

1186
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:21,725
&nbsp

1187
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,607
Who are these people?

1188
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:24,241
&nbsp

1189
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:26,515
They're your parents.

1190
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,035
&nbsp

1191
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:29,402
You don't remember anything

1192
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:29,404
&nbsp

1193
00:25:29,414 --> 00:25:30,804
about what happened?

1194
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:30,806
&nbsp

1195
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:32,839
Why, did something bad happen?

1196
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:34,873
&nbsp

1197
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:36,599
They died.

1198
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:36,624
&nbsp

1199
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:40,249
It was unexpected, but...
they died peacefully.

1200
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:40,274
&nbsp

1201
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:43,421
That's why you came to
live with Joe and me.

1202
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:45,821
&nbsp

1203
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:47,065
And that's when we met?

1204
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:47,090
&nbsp

1205
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,330
Uh, no, actually, we
were friends before then.

1206
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,355
&nbsp

1207
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:52,722
I remember the first
time that I saw you.

1208
00:25:52,732 --> 00:25:52,747
&nbsp

1209
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:56,153
You were the happiest
boy that I'd ever met.

1210
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:56,178
&nbsp

1211
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:59,164
I have a feeling that's
because you entered my life.

1212
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:07,604
&nbsp

1213
00:26:07,614 --> 00:26:09,036
It's okay.

1214
00:26:09,046 --> 00:26:20,602
&nbsp

1215
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,068
What the...

1216
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:32,450
&nbsp

1217
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,486
Barry! Are you okay?

1218
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:34,511
&nbsp

1219
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:36,270
What just happened to me?!

1220
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:42,157
&nbsp

1221
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,222
These powers are so cool.

1222
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:44,247
&nbsp

1223
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:45,980
I can literally feel electricity

1224
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:45,982
&nbsp

1225
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:47,215
coursing through my body.

1226
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:47,217
&nbsp

1227
00:26:47,227 --> 00:26:49,976
I mean, is it always like
this? This is amazing.

1228
00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:50,705
&nbsp

1229
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:52,597
We just walked into a buzzkill.

1230
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:52,622
&nbsp

1231
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:54,889
My presence usually dampens the mood.

1232
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:54,891
&nbsp

1233
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,329
- Joe, don't.
- You fire, I'll fire.

1234
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:57,354
&nbsp

1235
00:26:57,364 --> 00:26:58,740
What the hell is she doing here?

1236
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:58,765
&nbsp

1237
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:00,198
- She wants to help.
- Help?

1238
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:00,200
&nbsp

1239
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,483
- With what?
- With the fact that I lost my powers.

1240
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:04,410
&nbsp

1241
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,177
Barry, why don't you give us a minute?

1242
00:27:07,187 --> 00:27:07,202
&nbsp

1243
00:27:07,212 --> 00:27:09,864
Sure, yeah. Are you
like a super villain?

1244
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:09,889
&nbsp

1245
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:12,450
Just asking. Okay.

1246
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,347
&nbsp

1247
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:15,020
How did this happen?

1248
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,045
&nbsp

1249
00:27:15,055 --> 00:27:17,182
You got rid of Barry's memories.

1250
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:17,184
&nbsp

1251
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:19,525
What Barry remembers, Savitar remembers.

1252
00:27:19,535 --> 00:27:19,550
&nbsp

1253
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,453
So Savitar's lost his memories too?

1254
00:27:21,463 --> 00:27:21,455
&nbsp

1255
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,578
Savitar loses his memory,
he doesn't go along

1256
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:23,603
&nbsp

1257
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:25,203
with the plan to give Wally powers.

1258
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:25,228
&nbsp

1259
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:26,677
Cause and effect.

1260
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:26,704
&nbsp

1261
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:28,858
But if you let me help you figure out

1262
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:28,883
&nbsp

1263
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:30,383
how to get Barry's memories back,

1264
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:30,385
&nbsp

1265
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:32,068
everything goes back to the way it was.

1266
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:32,093
&nbsp

1267
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:35,154
- Kid Flash runs again.
- And Savitar survives.

1268
00:27:35,164 --> 00:27:35,156
&nbsp

1269
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,660
And Iris dies.

1270
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:36,685
&nbsp

1271
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,591
Life's full of difficult choices.

1272
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:38,593
&nbsp

1273
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:39,792
Or it isn't.

1274
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:39,794
&nbsp

1275
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:42,486
If Savitar gets his memory
back, what's in it for you?

1276
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:42,511
&nbsp

1277
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:44,563
That's my business.

1278
00:27:44,573 --> 00:27:44,565
&nbsp

1279
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:47,233
You think that Barry
can become The Flash?

1280
00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:47,268
&nbsp

1281
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:49,394
Yeah. He can learn.

1282
00:27:49,404 --> 00:27:49,419
&nbsp

1283
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:51,737
I still know how to do
everything. I can teach him.

1284
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:51,739
&nbsp

1285
00:27:51,749 --> 00:27:53,205
Okay.

1286
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:53,207
&nbsp

1287
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:55,307
Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.

1288
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:55,332
&nbsp

1289
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:59,118
But there's still a lot
of villains in this city,

1290
00:27:59,128 --> 00:27:59,160
&nbsp

1291
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,894
and no Flashes to protect it.

1292
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:02,190
&nbsp

1293
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,993
Is that really a chance
you're willing to take?

1294
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:07,588
&nbsp

1295
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:08,981
- Hi.
- Ah!

1296
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:09,006
&nbsp

1297
00:28:09,016 --> 00:28:10,556
- I'm still here.
- Yeah, you are.

1298
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:10,558
&nbsp

1299
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:12,763
Because when you left, I stayed.

1300
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:12,788
&nbsp

1301
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:15,795
We gotta talk about the
elephant in the room.

1302
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:15,797
&nbsp

1303
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:17,979
But you know what,
I... I have a job to do.

1304
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:18,004
&nbsp

1305
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:19,942
We have to build that device.

1306
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:19,967
&nbsp

1307
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:22,651
We've got to focus on the task at hand.

1308
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:22,676
&nbsp

1309
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:23,969
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1310
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:23,971
&nbsp

1311
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,005
- I totally understand.
- From here on out,

1312
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:26,007
&nbsp

1313
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:29,175
whenever I look into your azure eyes,

1314
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:29,177
&nbsp

1315
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:32,011
flecked with gray,
like a summer rainstorm

1316
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:32,013
&nbsp

1317
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:34,947
coming to kiss my lips,

1318
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:34,949
&nbsp

1319
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,416
the only thing I'm
gonna be thinking about

1320
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:37,441
&nbsp

1321
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:39,768
is how I can best inspire that...

1322
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:39,793
&nbsp

1323
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:43,535
beautiful, sexy brain.

1324
00:28:43,545 --> 00:28:49,019
&nbsp

1325
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,741
Sparks.

1326
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:50,766
&nbsp

1327
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:52,131
Sparks.

1328
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:52,156
&nbsp

1329
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,632
You felt them too.

1330
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:53,634
&nbsp

1331
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:55,100
- No.
- No?

1332
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,102
&nbsp

1333
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:56,956
- No, I mean yes, obviously.
- Oh, okay.

1334
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:56,981
&nbsp

1335
00:28:56,991 --> 00:29:00,125
Sparks. Jumping between
two parallel wires...

1336
00:29:00,135 --> 00:29:00,150
&nbsp

1337
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,558
a modified high-voltage climbing arc.

1338
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:02,583
&nbsp

1339
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:04,907
I guess my work here is done.

1340
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,730
&nbsp

1341
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,577
You should never have
tried this without Caitlin.

1342
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:10,685
&nbsp

1343
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:13,352
Well, we didn't really have
much of choice, now, did we?

1344
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:13,354
&nbsp

1345
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:15,621
Also, don't refer to
yourself in the third person.

1346
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:15,623
&nbsp

1347
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:17,589
It's Caitlin. It's you.
It's the same person.

1348
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:17,614
&nbsp

1349
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:19,225
It's just confusing.

1350
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:19,227
&nbsp

1351
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:20,861
Hand me the girard processor.

1352
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:20,886
&nbsp

1353
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:24,689
It'll help me prime his neocortical
and medial frontal lobes.

1354
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:28,232
&nbsp

1355
00:29:28,242 --> 00:29:29,611
What?

1356
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:29,636
&nbsp

1357
00:29:29,646 --> 00:29:31,001
Nothing.

1358
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:33,441
&nbsp

1359
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:36,627
Oh, golly. Look at us.

1360
00:29:36,637 --> 00:29:36,652
&nbsp

1361
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:40,385
Just three musketeers working away.

1362
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:40,410
&nbsp

1363
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,681
Just like old times, huh?

1364
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:42,683
&nbsp

1365
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:45,004
Hey, Julian, did Caitlin
ever tell you about our time

1366
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:45,029
&nbsp

1367
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,905
working on the Particle
Accelerator with Ronnie?

1368
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:46,930
&nbsp

1369
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,232
No. No, she did not.

1370
00:29:48,242 --> 00:29:48,257
&nbsp

1371
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:49,413
There was this one time

1372
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:49,438
&nbsp

1373
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:50,907
we had this very strict deadline,

1374
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:50,932
&nbsp

1375
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:52,798
and Dr. Wells was super hard on us.

1376
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:52,823
&nbsp

1377
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,524
- All of us, even Hartley.
- Who's... who's Hartley?

1378
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:55,549
&nbsp

1379
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,198
Oh, he was this guy we used
to work with. Such a dick.

1380
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:58,223
&nbsp

1381
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:00,802
You actually reminded me a lot of
him when you first came onboard.

1382
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:00,827
&nbsp

1383
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:02,113
Anyway, so we were working

1384
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:02,138
&nbsp

1385
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:04,570
on the iridium plating for the, um...

1386
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:04,572
&nbsp

1387
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:06,374
What was it called again?

1388
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:07,017
&nbsp

1389
00:30:07,027 --> 00:30:09,986
The synchrotron, that's what it was.

1390
00:30:09,996 --> 00:30:10,011
&nbsp

1391
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:11,461
So anyway, we were struggling,

1392
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:11,486
&nbsp

1393
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:13,059
and we were burning the midnight oil,

1394
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:13,084
&nbsp

1395
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:16,149
and we could not get
the dubnium capacitor

1396
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:16,174
&nbsp

1397
00:30:16,184 --> 00:30:17,507
to hold a single charge.

1398
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:17,532
&nbsp

1399
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,251
And so all of a sudden...

1400
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:19,276
&nbsp

1401
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:20,679
Ronnie just loses all his chill.

1402
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:20,704
&nbsp

1403
00:30:20,714 --> 00:30:22,033
He turns beet red,

1404
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:22,058
&nbsp

1405
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:23,791
and he starts yelling at the thing like,

1406
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:23,816
&nbsp

1407
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:26,340
"Come on, you dumb-nium capacitor!"

1408
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,365
&nbsp

1409
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,988
"Take charge."

1410
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:28,013
&nbsp

1411
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:29,594
Yes!

1412
00:30:29,604 --> 00:30:29,619
&nbsp

1413
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:31,497
Yes.

1414
00:30:31,507 --> 00:30:31,811
&nbsp

1415
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:33,960
Oh, my God.

1416
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,688
&nbsp

1417
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:39,976
I think about all the
memories I cherish most, and...

1418
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:40,001
&nbsp

1419
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:42,546
and you're in every single
one of them, Caitlin.

1420
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:48,701
&nbsp

1421
00:30:48,711 --> 00:30:50,616
Let's figure this out.

1422
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:50,618
&nbsp

1423
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:53,597
I don't want to be here
any longer than I have to.

1424
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:54,564
&nbsp

1425
00:30:54,574 --> 00:30:56,514
Suit yourself.

1426
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:59,170
&nbsp

1427
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,436
Okay!

1428
00:31:00,446 --> 00:31:00,461
&nbsp

1429
00:31:00,471 --> 00:31:02,428
Guys, I still can't
believe I have these powers.

1430
00:31:02,438 --> 00:31:02,430
&nbsp

1431
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,762
They're amazing.

1432
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:03,764
&nbsp

1433
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:05,212
I mean...

1434
00:31:05,222 --> 00:31:06,367
&nbsp

1435
00:31:06,377 --> 00:31:08,364
I think that I could be a superhero.

1436
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:09,798
&nbsp

1437
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:11,297
All right, well is it
cool if I run some more?

1438
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:11,322
&nbsp

1439
00:31:11,332 --> 00:31:13,222
- Have at it.
- All right.

1440
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:18,022
&nbsp

1441
00:31:18,032 --> 00:31:21,124
I haven't seen him this
happy in a long time.

1442
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:21,149
&nbsp

1443
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:22,617
Try ever.

1444
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:22,642
&nbsp

1445
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:24,383
It's the first time he
hasn't been weighed down

1446
00:31:24,393 --> 00:31:24,385
&nbsp

1447
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:26,883
by the tragedies of his past, you know?

1448
00:31:26,893 --> 00:31:26,908
&nbsp

1449
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,437
First time he's actually
been free of them.

1450
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:31,974
&nbsp

1451
00:31:31,984 --> 00:31:35,090
You don't want his
memory restored, do you?

1452
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,384
&nbsp

1453
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,330
Dad, I...

1454
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:38,332
&nbsp

1455
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:40,680
I can't say that seeing
him happy and light

1456
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:40,705
&nbsp

1457
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,472
isn't something I have wished for him,

1458
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:42,497
&nbsp

1459
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:45,543
because... yeah, it is.

1460
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:45,568
&nbsp

1461
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,235
Sweetheart,

1462
00:31:47,245 --> 00:31:47,260
&nbsp

1463
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,883
I wish that for him, too. But you
didn't fall in love with The Flash.

1464
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:49,908
&nbsp

1465
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:51,332
You fell in love with Barry Allen.

1466
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:51,357
&nbsp

1467
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,278
Dad, I know this is a
different version of him,

1468
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:53,280
&nbsp

1469
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,856
but he's...

1470
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:55,616
&nbsp

1471
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:57,149
he's still Barry.

1472
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:57,151
&nbsp

1473
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:58,851
No, he's not, honey.

1474
00:31:58,861 --> 00:31:58,853
&nbsp

1475
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:01,186
Look, until yesterday,

1476
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:01,188
&nbsp

1477
00:32:01,198 --> 00:32:04,527
Barry had 28 years of
experiences to define him,

1478
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:04,552
&nbsp

1479
00:32:04,562 --> 00:32:07,259
and some of those memories were
bad, but some were good, too.

1480
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,261
&nbsp

1481
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:08,458
But without those memories,

1482
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:08,483
&nbsp

1483
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,446
the Barry Allen we know and love...

1484
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:10,471
&nbsp

1485
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:11,741
is gone.

1486
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:11,766
&nbsp

1487
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,599
Whoo-hoo!

1488
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:13,844
&nbsp

1489
00:32:13,854 --> 00:32:15,377
I don't know, Dad.

1490
00:32:15,387 --> 00:32:16,725
&nbsp

1491
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,426
You know, part of me can't help but...

1492
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:19,451
&nbsp

1493
00:32:19,461 --> 00:32:21,175
think that this is some
sort of gift, you know...

1494
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:21,200
&nbsp

1495
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,176
that this is the life that
he was supposed to have.

1496
00:32:24,186 --> 00:32:24,178
&nbsp

1497
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:27,012
Maybe the city doesn't need The Flash.

1498
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:34,601
&nbsp

1499
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:36,401
Hey, everybody!

1500
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:37,224
&nbsp

1501
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:39,040
Happy Friday!

1502
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:47,016
&nbsp

1503
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:49,308
So I am a superhero?

1504
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:49,333
&nbsp

1505
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,488
Yeah.

1506
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:50,513
&nbsp

1507
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:52,407
- A real good one.
- Huh.

1508
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:52,432
&nbsp

1509
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:53,966
You're The Flash.

1510
00:32:53,976 --> 00:32:53,991
&nbsp

1511
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:56,826
You sure The Streak isn't
a better name, maybe?

1512
00:32:56,836 --> 00:32:58,039
&nbsp

1513
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,328
Turn on the TV.

1514
00:32:59,338 --> 00:32:59,330
&nbsp

1515
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,356
Uh, okay. Yeah.

1516
00:33:01,366 --> 00:33:02,244
&nbsp

1517
00:33:02,254 --> 00:33:05,202
Eyewitnesses say the man who
set the fire to the offices

1518
00:33:05,212 --> 00:33:05,227
&nbsp

1519
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:08,240
is none other than Lucious
Coolidge, AKA Heat Monger.

1520
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:08,265
&nbsp

1521
00:33:08,275 --> 00:33:10,005
That's the guy that
went free because of me.

1522
00:33:10,015 --> 00:33:10,007
&nbsp

1523
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:12,406
At this rate, it won't be long
before the whole thing burns down.

1524
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:12,431
&nbsp

1525
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:14,360
There's hundreds of
people who work in there.

1526
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:14,385
&nbsp

1527
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:15,744
We need to stop it.

1528
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:15,746
&nbsp

1529
00:33:15,756 --> 00:33:17,947
How? I mean, you can't right now.

1530
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:17,949
&nbsp

1531
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,385
No, but I can.

1532
00:33:19,395 --> 00:33:19,410
&nbsp

1533
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,087
Barry, you don't know
how to use your powers.

1534
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:21,112
&nbsp

1535
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:23,006
- Bar...
- You just said I'm a superhero.

1536
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:23,031
&nbsp

1537
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,379
And a good one, right?

1538
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,404
&nbsp

1539
00:33:24,414 --> 00:33:26,365
I mean, memories or
not... I can't stand by,

1540
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:26,415
&nbsp

1541
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:29,150
and watch people die
if I can prevent it.

1542
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,265
&nbsp

1543
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:34,116
Um, forgot the suit.

1544
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:47,742
&nbsp

1545
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:49,211
Barry? You okay?

1546
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:49,213
&nbsp

1547
00:33:49,223 --> 00:33:51,382
Uh, yeah, I'm good.

1548
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:51,912
&nbsp

1549
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:53,717
Stopping's hard.

1550
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:54,012
&nbsp

1551
00:33:54,022 --> 00:33:55,985
How do I save everybody inside?

1552
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:55,987
&nbsp

1553
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:58,020
You just run them out of there.

1554
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,022
&nbsp

1555
00:33:58,032 --> 00:33:59,622
I barely got here myself.

1556
00:33:59,632 --> 00:33:59,624
&nbsp

1557
00:33:59,634 --> 00:34:01,323
How am I supposed to
run with someone else?

1558
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:01,325
&nbsp

1559
00:34:01,335 --> 00:34:03,058
There's gotta be something we can do.

1560
00:34:03,068 --> 00:34:03,083
&nbsp

1561
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:04,342
There is something we can do:

1562
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:04,367
&nbsp

1563
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,028
jump-start his brain using that thing.

1564
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:06,030
&nbsp

1565
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,563
We have not done a test run.

1566
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:07,565
&nbsp

1567
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:10,090
- There's no time to test it now.
- What is that thing?

1568
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,115
&nbsp

1569
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:13,137
This can send electrical charges
through the transmitters in his suit

1570
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:13,162
&nbsp

1571
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:15,585
and theoretically,
should jolt his memory.

1572
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:15,610
&nbsp

1573
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,406
You want to electroshock his brain?

1574
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:17,408
&nbsp

1575
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:18,907
Won't that fry it even more?

1576
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:18,932
&nbsp

1577
00:34:18,942 --> 00:34:21,297
If we don't do that, all
those people are gonna die.

1578
00:34:21,307 --> 00:34:23,368
&nbsp

1579
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:25,567
Life's a game of chance.

1580
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:25,646
&nbsp

1581
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:28,113
Okay, Barry, you're
gonna feel something.

1582
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:28,138
&nbsp

1583
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:30,563
Might hurt, might sting, might suck.

1584
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:30,588
&nbsp

1585
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:32,113
- Wait, what?
- Probably all three.

1586
00:34:32,123 --> 00:34:32,138
&nbsp

1587
00:34:32,148 --> 00:34:33,571
Okay, here we go.

1588
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:41,913
&nbsp

1589
00:34:41,923 --> 00:34:43,265
Barry?

1590
00:34:43,275 --> 00:34:45,102
&nbsp

1591
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:46,602
Barry?

1592
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:46,604
&nbsp

1593
00:34:46,614 --> 00:34:49,171
Uh, yeah, I still don't remember.

1594
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:49,196
&nbsp

1595
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:51,132
Why didn't that work?
That was supposed to work.

1596
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:51,157
&nbsp

1597
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,708
We kick-started his temporal lobe.

1598
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:52,710
&nbsp

1599
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,710
Now he just needs to access it.

1600
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:54,712
&nbsp

1601
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:56,887
Gas is in the tank, we just
need to turn the ignition.

1602
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:56,912
&nbsp

1603
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:59,491
We need a visceral
memory to spark his brain.

1604
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:02,587
&nbsp

1605
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:04,031
Okay...

1606
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:04,739
&nbsp

1607
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,331
okay.

1608
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:07,963
&nbsp

1609
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,396
Barry?

1610
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:09,421
&nbsp

1611
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:11,392
I need you to remember.

1612
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:11,417
&nbsp

1613
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:14,726
- I can't!
- Yes, yes, you can. Okay?

1614
00:35:14,736 --> 00:35:14,751
&nbsp

1615
00:35:14,761 --> 00:35:16,666
Okay, listen to me.

1616
00:35:16,676 --> 00:35:16,691
&nbsp

1617
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:18,667
The night that your mom died,

1618
00:35:18,677 --> 00:35:18,669
&nbsp

1619
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,135
I didn't want to tell you how,

1620
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:20,137
&nbsp

1621
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:22,191
but she didn't die peacefully.

1622
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:22,216
&nbsp

1623
00:35:22,226 --> 00:35:24,630
- She was murdered.
- What?

1624
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:24,655
&nbsp

1625
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:27,919
And you came to live with us.

1626
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:27,944
&nbsp

1627
00:35:27,954 --> 00:35:30,749
My dad brought you inside, and...

1628
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:31,557
&nbsp

1629
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:34,213
you were in shock...
you weren't even crying.

1630
00:35:34,223 --> 00:35:35,437
&nbsp

1631
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:38,544
And later that night, a sound woke me,

1632
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:38,569
&nbsp

1633
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,033
and I crawled out of my bed,

1634
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:41,058
&nbsp

1635
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:45,194
and I realized that the sound
was coming from downstairs.

1636
00:35:45,204 --> 00:35:45,196
&nbsp

1637
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:48,364
I peered over the banister, and...

1638
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:48,366
&nbsp

1639
00:35:48,376 --> 00:35:50,854
I found you crying alone.

1640
00:35:50,864 --> 00:35:51,335
&nbsp

1641
00:35:51,345 --> 00:35:53,869
I knew I had to go to you.

1642
00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:53,871
&nbsp

1643
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:56,036
I sat next to you, and...

1644
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:56,061
&nbsp

1645
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,736
you put your head in my lap,

1646
00:35:58,746 --> 00:35:58,761
&nbsp

1647
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:01,043
and I held you while you cried.

1648
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:01,045
&nbsp

1649
00:36:01,055 --> 00:36:04,100
And I didn't know it
then, but now looking back,

1650
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,125
&nbsp

1651
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:07,516
I realize that that was the
night that we fell in love.

1652
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:07,518
&nbsp

1653
00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:10,715
That was the night that we realized

1654
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:10,740
&nbsp

1655
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,987
how much we needed each other.

1656
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:13,518
&nbsp

1657
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:15,421
And look...

1658
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:15,446
&nbsp

1659
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:17,590
I so wish...

1660
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:17,615
&nbsp

1661
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,812
that I could take your
dark memories away.

1662
00:36:19,822 --> 00:36:19,837
&nbsp

1663
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,054
I wish...

1664
00:36:21,064 --> 00:36:21,079
&nbsp

1665
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:22,804
that I could make all
of that pain go away,

1666
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:22,829
&nbsp

1667
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:24,566
but I can't.

1668
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:24,568
&nbsp

1669
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:27,747
Okay? But what I do know, what I know,

1670
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:27,772
&nbsp

1671
00:36:27,782 --> 00:36:29,905
is that for every bad memory,

1672
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:29,907
&nbsp

1673
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,601
there is a good one...

1674
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:31,626
&nbsp

1675
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:33,342
that will get you through it.

1676
00:36:33,352 --> 00:36:38,816
&nbsp

1677
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:40,836
Run, Barry, run!

1678
00:36:40,846 --> 00:36:50,958
&nbsp

1679
00:36:50,968 --> 00:36:52,402
Barry?

1680
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:53,597
&nbsp

1681
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:55,064
I remember...

1682
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:55,066
&nbsp

1683
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:56,735
I remember.

1684
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:56,760
&nbsp

1685
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,349
I remember everything.

1686
00:36:58,359 --> 00:36:58,374
&nbsp

1687
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,502
I remember everything!

1688
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:01,596
&nbsp

1689
00:37:01,606 --> 00:37:03,698
Now for this fire.

1690
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:07,541
&nbsp

1691
00:37:07,551 --> 00:37:10,675
I don't think I can
put this fire out alone.

1692
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:10,700
&nbsp

1693
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,872
You don't have to.

1694
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:28,769
&nbsp

1695
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,202
Yes!

1696
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:37,078
&nbsp

1697
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,588
Looks like you remembered
how to save the day.

1698
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:40,009
&nbsp

1699
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:41,675
Like riding a bike.

1700
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:44,417
&nbsp

1701
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:46,215
- Your mother's maiden name.
- Thompson.

1702
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:46,240
&nbsp

1703
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,138
CODIS is an acronym for what?

1704
00:37:49,148 --> 00:37:49,163
&nbsp

1705
00:37:49,173 --> 00:37:51,960
Combined DNA Index System.

1706
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,976
&nbsp

1707
00:37:52,986 --> 00:37:54,599
Okay.

1708
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:54,624
&nbsp

1709
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:57,134
In the third grade, you
renamed the class hamster to...

1710
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,218
&nbsp

1711
00:37:58,228 --> 00:37:59,819
Alexander Ham Bell.

1712
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:01,126
&nbsp

1713
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:02,378
I was eight years old.

1714
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:02,380
&nbsp

1715
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,213
So you got your memories back.

1716
00:38:04,223 --> 00:38:04,215
&nbsp

1717
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:06,917
Now we can all focus our attention on...

1718
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:06,942
&nbsp

1719
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,651
stopping Savitar.

1720
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,241
&nbsp

1721
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:12,455
Good luck with that.

1722
00:38:12,465 --> 00:38:14,411
&nbsp

1723
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:17,145
Please tell me we're not gonna
just let her walk out of here.

1724
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:20,487
&nbsp

1725
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:23,118
- Now you want to fight?
- We don't want to fight you.

1726
00:38:23,128 --> 00:38:23,143
&nbsp

1727
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:25,412
Can't really avoid that now, can we?

1728
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:25,437
&nbsp

1729
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:27,557
Yeah, we can. You can stay here with us.

1730
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:27,582
&nbsp

1731
00:38:27,592 --> 00:38:30,335
We're your friends. Your family.

1732
00:38:30,345 --> 00:38:31,740
&nbsp

1733
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,938
Caitlin, I can fix you.

1734
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:34,311
&nbsp

1735
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:35,930
You already tried.

1736
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:35,955
&nbsp

1737
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,367
Well then, I'll try harder.

1738
00:38:37,377 --> 00:38:37,392
&nbsp

1739
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:38,703
I don't care what it takes.

1740
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:38,728
&nbsp

1741
00:38:38,738 --> 00:38:40,726
I don't care what I have to do.

1742
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:40,751
&nbsp

1743
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:44,285
I swear to you, I will find you a cure.

1744
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:47,193
&nbsp

1745
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:49,337
Caitlin, I love you.

1746
00:38:49,347 --> 00:38:51,146
&nbsp

1747
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:53,495
I don't love you, Julian.

1748
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:54,650
&nbsp

1749
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,383
I never did.

1750
00:38:56,393 --> 00:38:58,310
&nbsp

1751
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,737
I never loved any of you.

1752
00:39:00,747 --> 00:39:22,547
&nbsp

1753
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:24,413
She's gone?

1754
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:24,438
&nbsp

1755
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:25,871
Yeah.

1756
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:26,393
&nbsp

1757
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:28,793
Maybe too far gone now.

1758
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:30,675
&nbsp

1759
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:33,205
We'll figure out a way to get her back.

1760
00:39:33,215 --> 00:39:33,926
&nbsp

1761
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:36,764
Just like we figured
out how to get you back.

1762
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:36,789
&nbsp

1763
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:38,589
You sure this is the me you want?

1764
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:38,614
&nbsp

1765
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:40,586
With all the baggage?

1766
00:39:40,596 --> 00:39:40,588
&nbsp

1767
00:39:40,598 --> 00:39:43,658
Seeing you without the weight
of everything that's happened,

1768
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:43,683
&nbsp

1769
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:46,825
seeing you happy, like you were
before your mother was killed?

1770
00:39:46,835 --> 00:39:46,827
&nbsp

1771
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:49,561
Without all of that
darkness haunting you,

1772
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:49,563
&nbsp

1773
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:51,630
you were finally free.

1774
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,218
&nbsp

1775
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:55,351
It was nice.

1776
00:39:55,361 --> 00:39:56,322
&nbsp

1777
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:58,987
I did the same thing months ago.

1778
00:39:58,997 --> 00:39:59,637
&nbsp

1779
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,696
What do you mean?

1780
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:02,023
&nbsp

1781
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,691
That freedom? I had that.

1782
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:04,716
&nbsp

1783
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:06,578
When I was with my mom and
dad again in Flashpoint,

1784
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:06,580
&nbsp

1785
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,614
and I could've let it stay like that.

1786
00:40:08,624 --> 00:40:08,616
&nbsp

1787
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:11,783
I could've let the memories
of this timeline fade, but...

1788
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:11,825
&nbsp

1789
00:40:11,835 --> 00:40:13,606
if I'd done that, I would've lost Joe,

1790
00:40:13,616 --> 00:40:13,631
&nbsp

1791
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:17,268
and Cisco, and Wally,
and Caitlin, and you.

1792
00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:18,524
&nbsp

1793
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:21,624
Pain and darkness... it's a part of me.

1794
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:21,649
&nbsp

1795
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:23,472
You know, I need it to fuel me,

1796
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:23,497
&nbsp

1797
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:24,630
to push me to be a better person,

1798
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:24,632
&nbsp

1799
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:26,484
to be a better hero.

1800
00:40:26,494 --> 00:40:27,631
&nbsp

1801
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:30,298
To keep me from ever
forgetting who I am.

1802
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:31,472
&nbsp

1803
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:33,629
Now that...

1804
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:33,654
&nbsp

1805
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,108
is the Barry Allen I know and love.

1806
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:42,750
&nbsp

1807
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,409
Hey, you guys... okay!

1808
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:45,434
&nbsp

1809
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,831
You guys, you got to come see this.

1810
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:47,856
&nbsp

1811
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,888
Y-you got to come see this.

1812
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:52,882
&nbsp

1813
00:40:52,892 --> 00:40:54,359
What is that?

1814
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:54,384
&nbsp

1815
00:40:54,394 --> 00:40:57,362
This is the Speed Force Bazooka.

1816
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:57,387
&nbsp

1817
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:59,670
- Good, right?
- And that's gonna trap Savitar?

1818
00:40:59,680 --> 00:40:59,695
&nbsp

1819
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:01,762
There is a tiny little problem.

1820
00:41:01,772 --> 00:41:01,764
&nbsp

1821
00:41:01,774 --> 00:41:03,863
- What's that?
- It's, uh...

1822
00:41:03,873 --> 00:41:03,888
&nbsp

1823
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:06,451
In order to generate enough power...

1824
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:06,476
&nbsp

1825
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:08,277
to magnetize Savitar's radial field

1826
00:41:08,287 --> 00:41:08,302
&nbsp

1827
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:11,104
and keep him in a state
of perpetual stasis...

1828
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:11,106
&nbsp

1829
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:12,739
- Stasis.
- ... inside the Speed Force,

1830
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:12,741
&nbsp

1831
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:14,690
- we need by my calculations...
- By calculations...

1832
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:14,715
&nbsp

1833
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:18,174
3.86 terajoules of energy.

1834
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:18,199
&nbsp

1835
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,648
I'm guessing that's more
energy than in a AAA battery.

1836
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:21,650
&nbsp

1837
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,040
Yes. That's more energy than in the sun.

1838
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:25,065
&nbsp

1839
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:28,147
Guys, where are we gonna
find something like that?

1840
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:33,157
&nbsp
