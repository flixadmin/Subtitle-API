1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,735
<i>Free Pike! Free Pike! Free Pike!</i>

2
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,522
This is Joe Kline, live from the steps
of the city courthouse.

3
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,128
Moments ago we received the news
that Judge Julius Reindell...

4
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,458
...has overturned the murder conviction
of Nicholas Pike.

5
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:36,932
It's been less than a year since Central City
was held hostage by Pike and his gang...

6
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,834
...motorcycle hoods called the Dark Riders.
That reign of terror finally ended...

7
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,374
...when Pike was captured by
the mysterious vigilante called the Flash...

8
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,412
...and subsequently convicted
of the brutal slaying of policeman Jay Allen.

9
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,277
Now, however,
because of legal technicalities...

10
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,544
...the court has overturned
that conviction...

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,484
...and once again Pike is a free man.

12
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,831
Listen to them. They belong to you.

13
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:10,129
- How does it feel to be a free man?
- My client has no statement today.

14
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,703
He's been through an ordeal
and he needs rest.

15
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,203
However, as his attorney...

16
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,434
...l'd like to say that the judge's
decision today only confirms...

17
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,101
...what we've been saying all along.
- And that is?

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,308
That Mr. Pike is an innocent victim,
framed for a crime he didn't commit.

19
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,018
Then who did kill Officer Jay Allen?

20
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:33,923
The real criminal here is the psychopath
who calls himself the Flash.

21
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,155
He murdered Jay Allen
and then tried to pin it on my client.

22
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,893
Barry Allen, brother of the murder victim,
what do you think of the decision?

23
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,367
- No comment.
- What about his lawyer's assertion...

24
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,768
...that your brother was killed
by the Flash?

25
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,236
- No comment.
- Over here! Turn and smile!

26
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,709
Has anyone ever told you...

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,907
...that you have the sensitivity of a rock?
- Yeah, my mother.

28
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,917
- This isn't finished. I swear...
- Stay away from my client!

29
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:04,215
- This is not finished!
- There are laws against harassment.

30
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,722
Thank God that's over.

31
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,761
Over?

32
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,394
No, it's just beginning.

33
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,205
I'm gonna make Central City pay
for what it's done to me.

34
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,108
But first...

35
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,043
...l've got a score to settle.

36
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,149
With whom?

37
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,425
The Flash.

38
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,385
Uncle Barry, is it true?

39
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,720
Did the Flash really kill my dad?

40
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,496
No, Shawn, he didn't.

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,166
Then why did they let Pike go?

42
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,538
Sometimes the law...

43
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,676
...makes mistakes.

44
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,574
But if Pike is guilty
and they let him go free...

45
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,581
...then what's the use
of arresting criminals in the first place?

46
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,323
Come on, Shawn, that's your mom.
Time to go.

47
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,291
Remember, baseball on Saturday,
right?

48
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,327
- Okay.
- All right.

49
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,164
See you later.

50
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,510
Right this way to your table.

51
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,314
Oh, terrific.

52
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,896
Hello, Allen.

53
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,535
- You mind if I sit down?
- Yes.

54
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,109
I have nothing to say to you, Pike.

55
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,075
I think it's time that the two of us
made peace, what do you say?

56
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,278
You know...

57
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,516
...I really like this city.

58
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,584
And I am going to enjoy destroying it.

59
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,858
And there's not a thing
you can do about it.

60
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,961
I mean, I can get away
with anything, right?

61
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,934
After all...

62
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,698
...I killed your brother.

63
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,445
I mean, you should have heard him
beg for his life. Oh, it was pathetic.

64
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,978
But then I guess cowardice
is a family trait.

65
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,722
- Get up, Pike! Get up!
- Leave him alone.

66
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,224
You think just because you're a cop
you can assault my client in public?

67
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,056
There are laws, Allen.

68
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,599
It was a dumb move, Allen.
In a restaurant.

69
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,743
In front of witnesses.

70
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,209
- You're a cop, for God's sakes.
- He provoked me, sir.

71
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,544
According to the witnesses,
you hit him for absolutely no reason.

72
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,348
- That's not what happened.
- Maybe not. But that's how it looks.

73
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,859
Pike's lawyer is playing this
for all the publicity she can get.

74
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,761
Look, if it was my brother,
I'd feel the same way...

75
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,798
...but I don't have a choice.
You know department regulations.

76
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,803
Thirty days' suspension pending
a professional-responsibility hearing.

77
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,635
Get out of here.

78
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,346
Okay. Come on, keep it in line.

79
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,183
And hold it.

80
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,655
Okay, unhook it. Get rid of the truck.

81
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:12,025
There's a ravine just north
of the reservoir, I'll dump it there.

82
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,098
Your obsession with the Flash
is going to get you killed.

83
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,602
Look, we're two sides of the same coin...

84
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,765
...forged from the same fire.
One has to defeat the other.

85
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,572
But this time he can't win.

86
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,945
What is it?

87
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,544
A very special present.

88
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:38,990
Maybe the Flash can outrun bullets
and bombs, but let him try to outrun this.

89
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,228
I've had it! I'm through with it!

90
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,732
- Barry, calm down.
- I'm sick of the whole business.

91
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,097
I want to live a normal life...

92
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,729
...without life-and-death emergencies
happening every time I turn around.

93
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,934
But you can't just leave town.
I mean, where would you go?

94
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,742
I don't know.

95
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,109
I'd travel around.

96
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,411
Who knows, if I find a place I like,
maybe I won't come back at all.

97
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,914
You're just gonna turn your back
on Central City and its problems?

98
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,854
Well, according to Joe Kline,
I am the problem.

99
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,960
Barry, Joe Kline is just one man.

100
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,120
I never wanted these powers
in the first place.

101
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,825
And now, because you feel unappreciated,
you're just going to quit.

102
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:28,397
You know, sometimes I get really tired
of you critiquing my entire life...

103
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,338
...like you were my therapist
or my mother!

104
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,436
I mean, you're not exactly
the easiest person to get along with.

105
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,846
I never realized my friendship
was such a burden!

106
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,612
Maybe it would be better
for both of us if you left town.

107
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,551
Look, this is not about appreciation!

108
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,225
The man who murdered my brother
has been set free.

109
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:55,058
The system I have believed in
my entire life has blown up in my face...

110
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:59,694
...and now someone is actually
accusing me of murdering Jay!

111
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,675
You don't understand.

112
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,145
You can't understand.

113
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,515
Look, I gotta go. I...

114
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,243
Look, I...

115
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,920
I've gotta pack, all right? I gotta go.

116
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,688
Take care of yourself.

117
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,793
And good luck.

118
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,568
I hope you find what you're looking for.

119
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,310
Take care, buddy.

120
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:43,311
And remember, no howling at the moon.

121
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,042
No sleeping in Julio's bed, huh?

122
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,252
And go easy on those doggy treats,
okay?

123
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,690
Here you go.

124
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,328
I'm gonna miss you, man.

125
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,465
- You and your goofy food.
- You never ate so good, man.

126
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,897
Tell that to my stomach.

127
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,472
Well, I'll call you in a week.

128
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,533
You drive safe, huh?

129
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,558
I've planted a bomb
at the old Devil's Gate reservoir dam.

130
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:37,465
Unless the city pays me $ 10 million
by midnight tonight...

131
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,300
...l'll blow the dam
and flood the city.

132
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,167
Bring the money.

133
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,944
I'm telling you, Bellows,
this is our big chance, man.

134
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,013
Listen to this idea.
We open up a storefront, okay?

135
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,582
We sell all the latest fads and gimmicks,
all the electronic stuff.

136
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,812
The yuppies will love this, man.
I've even got a name for it:

137
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,355
The Cutting Edge.
Is that brilliant, or what?

138
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,822
I don't know, Murph.

139
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,120
- You don't know?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,695
Look, why couldn't we do
something more practical...

141
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,891
...you know? Like a bowling alley.
- A bowling alley?

142
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,231
Why didn't I think of that?
Where is your imagination?

143
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,203
Look, we're not businessmen,
we're cops.

144
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,070
You wanna spend the rest of your life
getting shot at, man?

145
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,939
Not me. Let me tell you something.

146
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,512
When I leave this department,
I'm gonna leave rich.

147
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,809
- You could be going...
- Barry, where you going?

148
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,016
I've gotta get some stuff
out of my desk.

149
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,586
- You really are leaving.
- The car's all packed.

150
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,349
Things will be different in
a couple weeks, wait and see.

151
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,016
Murphy, Bellows!
There's an "all units" at the dam.

152
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,186
Some nut is threatening to blow it
and flood the city. Come on!

153
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,130
Oh, boy. Where do they find
these lint heads? Barry, take it easy.

154
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,098
See you later, Barry.

155
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,033
For crying out loud...

156
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,537
...I can't even get out of the city.

157
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,352
<i>What took you so long?</i>

158
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,792
<i>It's time we finish this little game</i>
<i>between us.</i>

159
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,403
<i>I have plans for Central City,</i>
<i>and you just don't fit into them.</i>

160
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,772
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

161
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,810
<i>That is an error I don't intend to make.</i>

162
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,914
<i>Now let's see just how fast</i>
<i>you can really run.</i>

163
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,134
Look at how fast he's going.

164
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,549
- He's trying to lose it.
- He can't.

165
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,517
It's locked into his heat signature.

166
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,529
This is getting boring.

167
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,683
Now...

168
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,655
...Central City belongs to me.

169
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,445
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

170
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,674
<i>This is a reminder that all citizens</i>
<i>with red passes...</i>

171
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,149
<i>... should be off the streets by 11:00.</i>

172
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,983
<i>Only citizens with blue passes</i>
<i>may still be out.</i>

173
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,352
- <i>Any citizens with red passes...</i>
- Where am I?

174
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,188
<i>... are subject to arrest.</i>

175
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,435
March 3rd...

176
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,773
...2001?

177
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,975
What is this? We haven't done anything
wrong. What's the matter with you?

178
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,477
You're under arrest for selling
illegal contraband.

179
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,877
- What contraband?
- This.

180
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,641
Boy, now we're in big trouble.

181
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:56,254
I told you 10 years ago, "A nostalgia shop,
how about a bowling alley?"

182
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,289
- But no.
- This was not my idea.

183
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,426
You're gonna blame it on me?

184
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,153
- Hey!
- Get him!

185
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,893
Hey!

186
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,340
Oh, my...! Stop it!

187
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,405
Who are you?

188
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,345
Where did you get the suit?

189
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,284
I happen to like red.

190
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,822
- You're a funny guy, huh?
- Thank you.

191
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,687
Well, let's just see who you are,
funny guy.

192
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,529
Give me the scanner.

193
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,796
<i>Scanning fingerprints.</i>

194
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:48,030
<i>Subject identified as Barry Allen,</i>
<i>former head of police forensics lab...</i>

195
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,902
<i>... missing for 10 years.</i>

196
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,044
<i>Detain for questioning</i>
<i>and inform Mayor Pike immediately.</i>

197
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,804
Well...

198
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,538
...looks like we got ourselves a VIP, huh?

199
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,114
This could mean a promotion.

200
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,187
Follow him!

201
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,781
Barry?

202
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,785
- It's Julio.
- Julio?

203
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,726
Is that you?

204
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,036
Hey, man, the cops are after me.

205
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,729
All right, come on.

206
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,502
It'll stink like hell, but you'll be safe.

207
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,922
Did you see a guy in a red suit?

208
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,121
- That way.
- Let's go!

209
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,336
Come on, Barry.

210
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,544
Put these on.

211
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,552
Hey, this is my old street.

212
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:46,248
Yeah, when you disappeared,
Sabrina and I kind of took over the place.

213
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,689
You and Sabrina?
You move in together?

214
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,557
Worse. We're married.

215
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,869
Close the door behind you,
will you, Bar?

216
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,506
What if the police come here
looking for him, Julio?

217
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,768
- They'll arrest us too.
- The guy's my friend.

218
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,377
You want me to kick him out?

219
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,915
What kind of friend disappears for 10 years
and never even bothers to write or call?

220
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,347
Great. Now the baby's awake.

221
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,256
You have a baby?

222
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:23,489
- Congratulations. Boy or girl?
- Yep.

223
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,356
Yep?

224
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,793
Twins.

225
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,397
Earl!

226
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,031
Hey.

227
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,544
- He's forgotten me.
- Actually this is Earl Jr.

228
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,483
- You sure have changed.
- Well, you sure haven't.

229
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,679
You look exactly the same
as you did 10 years ago.

230
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,622
Where did you disappear
to all this time?

231
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,392
Well, it's a long story.

232
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,854
Does it have anything to do
with that red suit?

233
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,631
- I guess I owe you an explanation.
- Lf it makes it any easier...

234
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,203
...I figured out you were the Flash
a long time ago.

235
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,863
- You did?
- Well, I had my suspicions.

236
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,307
But when you both disappeared
at the same time, I put it all together.

237
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,574
You don't know how long
I wanted to tell you.

238
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,281
I'm glad you finally know.

239
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,354
But what has happened to this city?

240
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,083
I mean, how did Pike
become the mayor?

241
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,489
- You really don't know?
- No.

242
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,691
Well, after the Flash disappeared...

243
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:36,333
...Pike took over the city's
criminal organizations...

244
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,492
...slowly corrupted
the police department.

245
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:42,035
All the honest cops quit or were fired.

246
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,176
Crime got out of control.
Hard times hit like never before.

247
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,676
Next thing you know,
he buys himself an election...

248
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,473
...and he's in the mayor's office.

249
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,916
Where did all these factories
come from?

250
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,215
This is Pike's revitalization plan.
You see, this is supposed to create jobs.

251
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,186
Instead it gave us pollution and slums.

252
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,724
What about the people?
Why do you put up with this?

253
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:05,385
The rich never had it so good.
Who's gonna listen to the poor?

254
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,022
Anybody stands up to Pike, they end up
in the Police Rehabilitation Center.

255
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,500
- The what?
- It's in the old Star Labs building.

256
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,969
They've got this machine
that fries your brain.

257
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,075
Gives you an electronic lobotomy
and turns you into a vegetable.

258
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,074
Julio, where are my parents?

259
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,840
They're okay. They moved to California
back in the beginning.

260
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,984
Your dad figured
it would only get worse.

261
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,379
And Shawn and Eve?

262
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,112
Last I heard, Shawn was
with the Liberation Underground.

263
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,019
- The cops were looking for him.
- Liberation Underground?

264
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:37,093
Yeah, they're like a resistance movement.
They cause as much trouble as they can.

265
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,492
Nobody knows who they are
or where they hide out.

266
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,798
Why do you stay?

267
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,797
I guess because this is my city...

268
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,461
...and I like to hope it'll get better.

269
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,899
All we need is somebody
like the Flash to help us get started.

270
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:55,239
Oh, Julio, I can't help anybody.

271
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,406
I'm not the Flash anymore.

272
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,651
I've lost it.

273
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,317
I see.

274
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,851
I have to talk to Tina.
Where can I find her?

275
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,755
With cops looking for you,
we gotta stay off the streets.

276
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,759
I have to find out what's happened.

277
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,556
All right.

278
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,000
After the police took over Star Labs
a couple of years ago...

279
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,203
...Tina started up this place.

280
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,314
I'll wait out here.

281
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,510
Right.

282
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:52,694
Make sure she takes those pills three
times a day, and I'll see you next week.

283
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,696
Tina.

284
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,802
I don't know why you're here,
but I want you to get out!

285
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,503
- Why? What have I done?
- What have you done?

286
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,172
Take a look around.
Have you seen this city?

287
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,013
- I didn't do that. Pike did.
- Yes, and you just walked away and let him.

288
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,382
If you'd just listen to me,
I'd explain to you.

289
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,023
I don't want to listen to you...

290
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,421
...and I don't wanna see you again.
Now get out!

291
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,858
- Tina!
- Get out!

292
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:32,042
She blames me for what happened.

293
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,045
She thinks maybe
I could have stopped it.

294
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:39,479
- Maybe she's right.
- Julio, I didn't just walk away.

295
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:45,283
Something happened. One minute
I was in 1991, and the next I was here.

296
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,818
Well, look at me. Come on, man.
You said yourself, I haven't changed at all.

297
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,988
You're telling me you traveled
through time.

298
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,964
Pike tried to blow up the Flash
with a heat-seeking missile.

299
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,660
Now, I don't know,
maybe the combination of my speed...

300
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,863
...and the explosion
caused me to travel...

301
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,134
...faster than the speed of light
for just a second.

302
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,438
All I know is that somehow...

303
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,709
...I jumped 10 years into the future.

304
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,784
That's the craziest story
I've ever heard.

305
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,251
If it were anybody else...

306
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,253
- Oh, man.
- What?

307
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:21,324
Keep walking. Keep walking.

308
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,792
Those are Pike's shadow men,
the secret police.

309
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,427
All right, let's start running.

310
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,173
- Hold it! You're both under arrest.
- Hands behind your back!

311
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,142
- Let's go. Come on.
- For what?

312
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,707
You're making a big mistake.
I know Pike personally.

313
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:50,150
- You're gonna be in big trouble, man.
- Put him in!

314
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,814
Hey, what are you, cops from hell?

315
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,529
Eastern mystics believe life is a circle.

316
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,436
And that everything
must have a completion.

317
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,845
I always knew
that we would meet again...

318
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,212
...Barry.

319
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,354
<i>All we need is somebody</i>
<i>like the Flash to help get us started.</i>

320
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,251
<i>Oh, Julio, I can't help anyone.</i>

321
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,896
<i>I'm not the Flash anymore.</i>

322
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,759
<i>I've lost it.</i>

323
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:39,730
Your friend Mendez has been
under surveillance for quite some time.

324
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,133
Damn you!

325
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,898
So...

326
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,966
...the Flash wasn't killed after all.

327
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,871
Instead...

328
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,115
...he lost his power
and hid for 10 years.

329
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,113
What do you think
of the new Central City?

330
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,654
You're insane.

331
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,120
Barry Allen...

332
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,923
...having considered
the evidence carefully...

333
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:10,495
...we find you guilty of conspiracy
and sedition.

334
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,402
You are hereby sentenced
to rehabilitation treatment.

335
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,904
Proceed.

336
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,666
You're not a judge.

337
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,834
This isn't a trial. You won't get away
with this, you hear me?

338
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,480
- There is such a thing as justice!
- In Central City...

339
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,981
...justice is whatever I say it is.

340
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,720
If you fight it,
it will only be more painful.

341
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,083
Maximum power.

342
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,127
Shut it off!

343
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:14,190
It must have been
some kind of freak feedback.

344
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,395
Is he dead?

345
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,434
Stop him!

346
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,913
- How does it look from this angle, Pike?
- You can't do this. I'm the mayor!

347
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,525
I say let's give you a dose
of your own medicine.

348
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:56,236
- Barry! Barry! You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm dizzy.

349
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,917
Get me out of here!

350
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,056
How are you feeling?

351
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,098
Like somebody used me
for a basketball.

352
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,095
Julio told me what happened.

353
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,564
Yeah, the electric shock.

354
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:35,504
It must have recharged my metabolism
for a few seconds.

355
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,170
But it didn't last.

356
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,349
Julio also told me
why you disappeared.

357
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,817
- I guess I owe you an apology.
- No.

358
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,418
That night...

359
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,522
...I tried to leave town,
but I couldn't.

360
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,458
It was partly because of the Flash...

361
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,599
...and it was partly because of you.

362
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,969
Stop it. I can't handle it.

363
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,936
I've prayed for years
for you to come back...

364
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,406
...until finally I gave up.

365
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,175
- On everything.
- I don't believe that.

366
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,610
For God's sake, Barry, grow up.

367
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,809
Maybe nothing's changed for you,
but everything's changed for me.

368
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:20,555
I no longer believe that love conquers all
or the good guy always wins.

369
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,886
I'm not sure I believe anything
anymore.

370
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,590
But I don't want you
complicating my life.

371
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,259
Once you're feeling okay,
I'd like you to leave.

372
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,765
Tina...

373
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,534
...I need your help...

374
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,139
...to become the Flash again.

375
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,340
There must be something you can do.

376
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,809
While you were unconscious,
I ran some tests.

377
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,383
Your metabolism's
in a very dangerous state.

378
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,180
Any attempt to revive your powers
could kill you.

379
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,913
The cops are headed this way.

380
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,115
- You gotta get out of here.
- You better come.

381
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,556
- Come on.
- This way.

382
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,252
This way.

383
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,195
Where are we going?

384
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,433
Trust me.

385
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,980
Welcome to the headquarters
of the Liberation Underground.

386
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,145
Julio! Julio!

387
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:25,119
Oh, God! Oh, baby, thank God
you're safe. I was so afraid.

388
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,882
- Where are the twins?
- They're here.

389
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,151
Come on, there's someone
I want you to see.

390
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,660
- Julio, where are we?
- The old Devil's Gate reservoir.

391
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,322
- Pike's old hideout?
- He'd never look for us here.

392
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,230
Wait a minute,
why are all these people staring at us?

393
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,735
It's because they know
you're the Flash.

394
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,867
Lieutenant Garfield?

395
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,305
Good to see you, Barry.

396
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,311
Or should I say, the Flash?

397
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:55,177
It was on the news this morning. According
to the mayor, you're the outlaw...

398
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,151
...who caused Central City
so much trouble 10 years ago.

399
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,723
He's offering a big reward
for your capture.

400
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,686
I always knew there was something
strange about you, Allen.

401
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,797
- Thank you, sir.
- Hey, Barry.

402
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,433
Come on, you gotta come
check this out.

403
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,172
What is this place?

404
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:21,779
It's a museum.
In memory of the Flash.

405
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,573
Where did all this stuff come from?

406
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,739
People have been hoarding it
over the years.

407
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,910
Telling stories,
keeping the legend alive.

408
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,789
Somebody even made the suit.

409
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,921
But this is crazy.

410
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,559
The Flash was just a man.

411
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,496
Not to these people.
Especially the younger ones.

412
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,465
- He's a hero.
- Excuse me.

413
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,335
Don't you recognize me?

414
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,569
I'm Shawn.

415
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,912
Shawn?

416
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,507
Hey.

417
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,414
But you're all grown up.

418
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,056
Is it true? Are you really the Flash?

419
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,993
- Well...
- Are you gonna save Central City...

420
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,754
...from Pike like you did before?

421
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,522
Shawn, I can't.

422
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,630
I...

423
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,996
I don't have the powers anymore.

424
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,933
I'm just like anyone else.

425
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,968
I'm sorry.

426
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,010
<i>There's no sign of them.</i>

427
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,312
<i>We think they may have made contact</i>
<i>with the Liberation Underground.</i>

428
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,079
I want them found!

429
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:43,858
- <i>We are doing our best.</i>
- That's not good enough!

430
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:49,531
I suggest you get the situation
under control.

431
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,604
Unless you wanna be
rehabilitated yourself.

432
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,008
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

433
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,676
Here.

434
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,718
- What is this?
- Synthetic food.

435
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,080
Real stuff is too expensive nowadays.

436
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,950
Here, have a hamburger.

437
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,756
Garfield, I was just in the city.
The word is out.

438
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,396
Pike's gonna execute all members
of the Underground...

439
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,499
...that he has in police custody
at noon tomorrow...

440
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,363
...unless the Flash turns himself in.

441
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,903
- What about a rescue?
- We don't have enough people.

442
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,506
Or enough weapons. The police...

443
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,872
- The police will tear us to ribbons.
- Then I've gotta turn myself in.

444
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,309
What makes you think
Pike will keep his word?

445
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:39,382
- He'll execute the prisoners.
- Lf Pike destroys Flash, he wins.

446
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,110
I'm not the Flash anymore, all right?
There is no Flash.

447
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,311
To the people, the Flash is a legend.

448
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,014
If you take that away,
they'll just give up.

449
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,756
Look, there could be another way.

450
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,727
How?

451
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,154
Barry's here because of an accident.

452
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,493
A tear in the space-time continuum.

453
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:00,228
If he could get back through that tear,
he could keep this from happening.

454
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:04,432
You mean, go back in the past
and stop Pike from taking over Central City.

455
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,543
- Yes.
- Is that possible?

456
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,038
- Theoretically.
- How do we do it?

457
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,779
There's only one way.
We've got to break into Star Labs.

458
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,078
- That would be suicide.
- No, not necessarily.

459
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:20,884
If they're using the same security system,
I can override it and get us all inside.

460
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,963
I guess we don't have a choice.

461
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:53,716
Someone once told me the Flash
would be forgotten in a few years.

462
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,460
I never thought he'd end up
in a museum.

463
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,729
All those people out there...

464
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,432
...waiting for me to save them.

465
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,206
I don't know if I can be...

466
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,405
...what they want me to be.

467
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,978
I believe in you.

468
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,964
It's time.

469
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,566
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

470
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:22,076
<i>All personnel evacuate</i>
<i>the building immediately.</i>

471
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,044
<i>All personnel evacuate</i>
<i>the building immediately.</i>

472
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,081
- Move it!
- Let's go!

473
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,583
Keep going, move it!

474
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,421
All I have to do
is change the entrance codes.

475
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,928
That should keep them out for a while.

476
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,001
Barry!

477
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,505
Julio!

478
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,747
- What happened?
- Oh, man.

479
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,544
Hang on, man. Hang on.

480
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,620
What?

481
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,191
Julio!

482
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,189
Oh, no. No.

483
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,259
No!

484
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:14,459
Oh, no.

485
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,733
Barry, I'm sorry.

486
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,136
Leave me alone with him. All right?

487
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,640
I need your help in the lab.

488
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,274
We haven't much time.

489
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,283
Barry, if we don't stop Pike,
Julio will have died for nothing.

490
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,320
<i>They've blockaded themselves</i>
<i>inside the Police Rehabilitation Center.</i>

491
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,928
<i>We've got the building surrounded,</i>
<i>but we can't get in.</i>

492
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,361
<i>They've changed</i>
<i>the security access codes.</i>

493
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,759
I'll be there in five minutes.

494
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,803
I've synthesized the booster injection
to accelerate your metabolism.

495
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,209
It should last about 10 minutes.

496
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:05,273
Your metabolism is so fragile,
I don't know how you're gonna react.

497
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,113
Your body could literally
tear itself to pieces.

498
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,949
Well, it's a little late
to change my mind now, isn't it?

499
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,856
How do you feel?

500
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,464
I...

501
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,259
Barry!

502
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,365
I feel like I'm on fire.

503
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,300
I'm back.

504
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,409
We should be able to bypass
the access codes in 15 minutes.

505
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,550
Bypass? To hell with that.
Break it down!

506
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:17,176
It's 2-inch titanium.
That will take all night.

507
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,283
Then blow it! Do it!

508
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,153
Now!

509
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,860
We have to duplicate the accident
that caused you to jump through time.

510
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,057
To do that, we have to create
a massive explosion.

511
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,661
The lab is powered
by a small underground reactor.

512
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,466
If the atomic core melts down...

513
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,939
...Star Labs will turn
into a miniature nuclear warhead.

514
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,312
But that will destroy the lab...

515
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,141
...and anyone inside.

516
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,805
If my theory proves correct...

517
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,111
...the space-time continuum
will snap you back through the tear.

518
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,187
You could get back before
all this happened and change it all.

519
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,521
And if you're wrong...

520
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,461
...we'll both die.

521
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,118
Yes.

522
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,759
Here goes.

523
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:08,934
<i>Warning, reactor control rods</i>
<i>have been withdrawn from reactor core.</i>

524
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,233
<i>Reactor is in imminent danger</i>
<i>of meltdown.</i>

525
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,243
- Move!
- Get out of here!

526
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,473
<i>Reactor is in imminent danger</i>
<i>of meltdown.</i>

527
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:22,483
<i>The time to reinsert rods to avoid</i>
<i>a meltdown will expire in 30 seconds.</i>

528
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:26,384
They're going to blow it up.

529
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,822
I can't predict what might happen to you
when you go back through time.

530
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,656
You could pass yourself
or meet yourself at the other end.

531
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,628
<i>You have 10 seconds</i>
<i>to reinsert the rods.</i>

532
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,661
<i>Warning, five seconds</i>
<i>till reactor reaches critical mass.</i>

533
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:46,140
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>
<i>Critical mass has been reached.</i>

534
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,177
<i>Reactor will now explode</i>
<i>in 15 seconds.</i>

535
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:54,750
<i>Fifteen, 14, 13, 12, 11...</i>

536
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,616
<i>... ten, nine, eight, seven...</i>

537
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:04,056
<i>... six, five, four, three, two, one.</i>

538
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,735
<i>Now let's see how fast</i>
<i>you can really run.</i>

539
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,614
It's not working.

540
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,806
- What is it?
- I don't know.

541
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,637
Some kind of equipment failure.

542
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,847
You're the failure, Pike. Again.

543
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:25,538
- Now tell me about the murder of Jay Allen.
- Go to hell!

544
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,971
I've got a better idea. You'll both go.

545
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,715
I changed the launch frequency
and homing signal.

546
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,256
Your missile is headed straight
for this van.

547
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,621
Unless I redirect it, we all go.

548
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,392
- You'll die too.
- I don't think he's bluffing.

549
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,534
You've got 20 seconds.

550
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:59,301
- For God's sakes, he means it. Tell him!
- You want me to say I killed Jay Allen?

551
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,810
- I killed him!
- Not good enough.

552
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,641
- Forced confession is worth nothing.
- What is it you want?

553
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,579
Police never found the weapon
you used to murder Jay Allen.

554
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,776
Where is it?

555
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,685
You've got 10 seconds, nine seconds.

556
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,585
- Tell him!
- Oh, shut up!

557
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,060
- Seven seconds. Six...
- Tell him!

558
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,321
- Tell him!
- I dropped it down the drain...

559
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,522
...at the reservoir just inside the gate.

560
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,476
The future is starting to look...

561
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,779
...a lot brighter.

562
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:09,103
That's what I call a city.

563
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,376
Hey, big guy. How you doing?

564
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,987
How you doing, Earl? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

565
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,918
There you are, you mangy hairball.

566
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,719
Julio!

567
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,492
I've been looking for this guy
all over Central City.

568
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,892
He ran away from me this morning.

569
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,091
- What are you doing back?
- I decided not to go.

570
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,338
Yeah, I figured you'd change your mind.
Welcome back.

571
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,267
- Oh, man, it is good to see you.
- Barry, Barry.

572
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,038
- What?
- Somebody might be looking, man.

573
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,113
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

574
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,112
<i>So it would appear that I owe</i>
<i>a big apology to a certain mystery man...</i>

575
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,881
<i>... whom I suggested might be</i>
<i>the real culprit in this crime.</i>

576
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:56,584
<i>Now, when this reporter makes a mistake,</i>
<i>he's big enough to admit it.</i>

577
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,322
<i>So here's a personal message,</i>
<i>yours truly to the scarlet speedster.</i>

578
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:04,831
<i>Whoever you are, Mr. Flash,</i>
<i>this is Joe Kline saying:</i>

579
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,469
<i>Sorry, babe.</i>

580
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,597
Well, it looks like
you're one of the good guys again.

581
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:17,938
Barry, you never explained to me...

582
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,879
...why you changed your mind
about leaving Central City.

583
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,747
Well, sometimes...

584
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,548
...things happen, you know...

585
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,624
...and suddenly you see the world
very differently.

586
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,829
And you realize that what you have...

587
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,633
...is more valuable than you thought.

588
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,065
