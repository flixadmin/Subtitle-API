Triangulate and determine
a point of origin

are operating out of, yes.

00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,934
All right, here's a list
of all their heists and attacks.

309
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,894
-That was fast.
-Yeah.

310
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:03,355
Yeah, like, um, riding a bike.

311
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,107
First spot they hit
was the Larson Credit Union?

312
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,942
-No, no, no, it was Starling National.
-Really?

313
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,860
-Mmm-hmm.
-How'd you know that?

314
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,905
Same way you knew about Larson.

315
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,075
-Felicity. Wanna play again?
-Mmm?

316
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,534
Mmm, what game are we playing?

317
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,911
We're playing "the reason that you know
so much about the Ghosts

318
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:22,208
"is because you've been helping the team
behind my back" game.

319
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,047
These guys have got cluster bombs now?
You've got to be kidding me.

320
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,757
Well, that's why I'm here, to see
if you're aware of any potential targets.

321
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,094
The only thing I'm aware of is that
I want you to stay as far away

322
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,679
-from this mess as possible.
-Dad, I thought we'd moved past this.

323
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,265
We moved past a lot of things.
And I am glad, really.

324
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,851
But I don't want you mixing it up
with these psychos.

325
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,145
Even after what happened
to city leadership?

326
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,232
I mean, honestly, I thought that
you would be happy to have our help.

327
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,566
Do I look happy?

328
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,818
Dad, the Ghosts were dangerous

329
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,488
before they got their hands
on experimental explosives.

330
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,490
How are you gonna feel
when they take out a city block,

331
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,907
knowing you didn't do anything to stop it?

332
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,076
(SIGHS)

333
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,664
Have you heard of anything going on
that's a potential target?

334
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,167
Landmarks, Starling General, et cetera.

335
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,836
What about city events?
Any dignitaries coming to town?

336
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,881
A few ball games, concerts.
Not that there's anyone to buy a ticket.

337
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,509
Train station's getting reopened
tomorrow night for the new rail line,

338
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,303
and Starling General's
having a canned food drive.

339
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,099
People don't come to
Star City anymore, Laurel.

340
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,434
They wanna leave.

341
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:28,399
Who is the cutest?
Who is the cutest ever, ever?

342
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,152
Playing with her like that,
I'm pretty sure it's you.

343
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,656
It's amazing how everything else
can just melt away except for her.

344
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,907
(BABY COOING)

345
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,285
What's melting tonight?

346
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,328
I know it's been a rough few months.

347
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,830
These men you're dealing with.

348
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:47,376
Tonight, it's just one man.
Oliver's back.

349
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,253
That didn't take long.

350
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,380
You knew he was coming back,
why didn't you warn me?

351
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,758
(CHUCKLES) What's the saying?
"Only the dead have seen the end of war."

352
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:57,511
-Please, Oliver's not a soldier.
-Isn't he?

353
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,307
That's pretty forgiving, considering
he kidnapped you six months ago.

354
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,186
You know why he did.
You have to let go of it sometime.

355
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,979
-I have.
-It's because you're better than me.

356
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,981
It's one of the reasons why I love you.

357
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,155
It was war, Johnny. Maybe not against
a country, but it was war.

358
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,158
And in times of war,
we do what we have to do.

359
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,701
Really, Lyla?

360
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,455
I mean, that includes lying to me?
Lying to Felicity?

361
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,249
Come on, what's the point?

362
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,001
Oliver did what he thought he had to do
to defeat Ra's.

363
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,296
I'm not saying he made the right choice.

364
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,006
But if Oliver Queen
always made the right choice,

365
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,508
he wouldn't need you.

366
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,348
I used to think
that yelling Oliver was scary.

367
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm starting to think that
silent Oliver is a lot worse.

368
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,684
I'm just going over
the past five months

369
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,810
-in my head.
-Okay.

370
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:49,104
When you got food poisoning
when we were in Thailand...

371
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,106
Yes. I might've been secretly
working with the team,

372
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,817
but I didn't exactly lie
about the food poisoning.

373
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,236
Laab Moo is extremely hard to digest.

374
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,864
What about when you missed our boat?
"Missed," in Positano.

375
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,658
Okay, that one was a little fib.

376
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,619
-Bali?
-Mmm...

377
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,829
Oh, Felicity, you said there wasn't
even email involved!

378
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:08,415
I know, but we both know
I'm just that good.

379
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,916
I don't understand.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,419
The whole point of starting over
was to get away from all of this.

381
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,296
And we were both right there together
leading that charge.

382
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,007
I know. And I thought
that's what we needed.

383
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,174
And the first few months were great,

384
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,301
-really great.
-Okay.

385
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,137
But then when you and Laura Hoffman
started exchanging cooking tips,

386
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,014
I secretly wanted to gouge out my eyes.

387
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,891
-I thought you were happy.
-I was.

388
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:30,646
Deliriously happy with you,
but bored with everything else.

389
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:35,317
Look, I miss this.
I miss saving the city and helping people.

390
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,236
It gives my life purpose.

391
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,490
And I wish I got the same thrill
from choosing between

392
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,286
the dimpled flatware and the scalloped,
but I just don't.

393
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:49,665
Hey, I don't care that you lied to me.
I don't care.

394
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:54,670
I care that the entire time
we were supposed to be away, together,

395
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,463
part of you was still here.

396
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:01,260
I love every moment that I'm with you,
no matter where we are.

397
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,344
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

398
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,555
What's that?

399
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,474
I hacked Kord Industries to check out
the design schematics for their bombs.

400
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,017
Turns out they have
a GPS tracker built in.

401
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,520
-Can you find out where it is?
-At least where they've been.

402
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,897
GPS is offline now,
but their last location was...

403
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,066
<i>Admiral Transport Interchange.</i>

404
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,778
It's a truck depot outside Pennytown.
Closed up shop months ago.

405
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,988
I'll call Thea. You get Laurel and Dig.

406
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:24,741
This may be a good time to tell you that
Cisco worked up a little something

407
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,369
before he knew you were leaving.
A new suit.

408
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,746
I'm not staying long enough
for a new suit.

409
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,170
I heard about places like this.

410
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,131
Owners must've left
when the city started tanking.

411
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,802
Well, our new friends
seem to have found a use for it.

412
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,180
Gentlemen, the world's a funny place.

413
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,392
It resists change, it fights progress.

414
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:55,188
And so the only way to move things forward
is to fight back.

415
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,400
And you men are here today
because you understand that.

416
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,237
But our cause is only as strong
as our weakest man.

417
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,825
Mr. Alvarez, please step forward.

418
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,663
You commanded the hijacking
the other night.

419
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,749
The cluster bombs from Kord Industries.

420
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,794
Yes, sir. We encountered
some resistance, but we handled it.

421
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,547
MR. X: (CHUCKLES) Han... Handled...

422
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,468
Well, I guess my definition of "handled"
is a little different than yours.

423
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:28,930
You see, when I handle a problem,
the problem dies.

424

-Sir, we got away with the bombs, so...

You know, I love this town in the fall.

426
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,273
I mean, yes, it looks pretty much the same
as it does in the three other seasons,

427
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,901
but I admire consistency.

428
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,862
I respect dependability.

429
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:50,411
And you've shown me neither.
So, now, allow me to show you something.

430
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,913
It's another kind of beauty.

431
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,458
It's the manipulation
of primordial energies.

No? Over your head? Yeah.

Tell me!

They're gonna destroy Star City Station.

That is not a good look.

We found out
what they have planned at least.

451

They're gonna use the explosives
on the new train station.

452
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,305
Yeah, pretty sure
I had that one in the office pool.

Too soon?

454

for tomorrow night,

to celebrate the reopening
of the new rail line.

what just happened?

by touching him.

He wasn't a metahuman.

460
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,072
Oliver, what that man did was not natural.

461
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,324
I know. It was mystical.

462
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,076
DIGGLE: How can you be so sure?

463
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,329
Because I've seen things.

464
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,001
There are things that can't be explained,
even by science.

465
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,629
I suppose you aren't gonna tell us
about these things you've seen, Oliver?

466
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,756
We need to focus
on finding the cluster bombs.

467
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,257
Can you reactivate the GPS?

468
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,636
Yeah, eventually, but I'm pretty sure the
train station's gonna be blown up by then.

469
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,764
Fine. So we do this the old-fashioned way.

470
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,809
THEA: So, this is the old fashioned way?

471
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,144
OLIVER: Can we maybe discuss last night?

472
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,022
It's pretty amazing, right?

473
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,775
How could you ever
wanna give up that rush?

474
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,359
Extremely easily.

475
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,822
It's not what I'm talking about.
You seemed a little out of control.

476
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,201
This coming from the guy who used
to use criminals as target practice?

477
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,495
(SCOFFS) I'm amazed by how far you've come
in five months,

478

that this isn't a violent life.

479
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:48,088
I just want you to remember that
it's restraint separating us and them.

480
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,636
Well, you've managed to be back, what,
24 hours before giving me a lecture.

481
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,680
Think I owe Laurel 50 bucks.

482
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,973
I'm being serious.

483
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,726
How long has this been going on for?

484
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,480
Nothing is going on, okay?
I've just become a better fighter.

485
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,941
A better fighter remains in control
when they fight.

486
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,236
Is everything okay?

487
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,404
It's not okay.

488
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,449
My brother
can't seem to stay out of my business.

-Any luck?
-No.

491
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,793
Does Thea seem a little off to you?

492
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,631
No, she's fine.
Just a little too aggressive, maybe.

493
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,050
But I remember you were same way
when you started out.

494
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,053
I saw that you took my advice
on the identity concealment.

495
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,014
Oliver, man, what are we doing?

496
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:41,933
Pretending everything's normal?
That we are normal?

497
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,309
I'm looking for a way in.

498
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,730
I was furious to think that you trusted
Malcolm Merlyn more than you trusted me,

499
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,899
but then I realized
that I'm not angry at you.

500
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,819
I'm angry at myself for thinking
you're someone that you clearly aren't.

501
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,612
I don't know what that means.

502
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,032
Oliver, after everything
we've been through, man.

503
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,450
I couldn't fathom why you didn't trust me.

504
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:03,579
But then I realized you couldn't.
It's not who you are.

505
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,876
You don't trust. You don't love.

506
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,211
You were able to fool Ra's
and join the League

507
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,006
because inside you were
every bit as dark as they are.

508
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:18,762
LAUREL: Thank you for coming.

509
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,514
Responding to a bomb threat's
kind of in the SCPD job description.

510
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:24,059
You know what I mean.
I'm glad we're working together.

511
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,477
Well, it seems like you're working
with a lot of people these days.

512
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,271
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Excuse me.

513
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,982
-Dad.
-Prodigal Arrow returns.

514
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,235
-Captain Lance.
-I thought that was you last night.

515
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,112
Some mask over your head.
Felt like old times.

516
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,363
Only trying to help.

517
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:39,532
If that were true,
you wouldn't have come back.

518
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,993
This town started going to crap
the moment you put on that hood.

519
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,619
You brought madness into all our lives,

520
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,581
and the monster you were
inspired monsters.

521
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,042
Maybe.

522
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,627
But I'm not a monster anymore.

523
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,339
Then what are you?

524
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,145
Nice nap?

525
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,109
I wasn't napping, I was drugged.
Where's Waller?

526
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,694
Back in Coast City,
sleeping off the scotch.

527
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,405
Wake her up.
I wanna know what I'm doing here.

528
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,576
Director Waller's asked me to thank you
for agreeing to take on this mission.

529
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,163
Okay, look, I didn't agree to take on...

530
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,082
Sorry, we're on a bit of a clock here.

531
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,541
Now, you're getting out of this plane.

532
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,586
You can do that with a chute on your back
or a bullet in your head. Your call.

533
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,180
Why is Waller doing this?

534
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,142
I guess she likes you. And I didn't think
Waller could like anybody.

535
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,228
-Plus, you know the terrain.
-What terrain?

536
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,858
Your job is to infiltrate the area,
assess the threat and report back.

537
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,236
You have AES-encrypted communication gear
in your pack.

538
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:04,826
Now, according to our intel,
your target may be radar-capable,

539
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,162
so you'll have to HALO in!

540
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:12,417
So when you think you're about to splat,
only then do you pull the chute.

541
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,925
Wait. Is that...

542
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,515
Uh-oh. You have mopey face.

543
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:29,642
Were you worried
after five months of happiness

544
00:29:29,725 --> 00:29:31,561
that you weren't gonna be able to
make it anymore?

545
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,313
I ran into Lance.

546
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:36,066
And he gave you a hug
because he missed you?

547
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,609
Yeah, well, it's not just Lance.

548
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,988
Thea, there is something wrong with Thea.

549
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,990
She doesn't want my help.
Neither does Diggle.

550
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,785
We should never have come back here.

551
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,370
Well, let's go. Let's go home.

552
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,164
You don't wanna go home.

553
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,958
I love our new home.

554
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,710
And I love you.

555
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,589
But I also love it here, and you can't
honestly tell me that you don't.

556
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,383
Yeah, no, of course, I miss aspects of it.

557
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:07,555
The sense of purpose, the idea of
helping people, but Lance was right.

558
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:09,015
About what?

559
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,896
A few months ago, he told me that
all I brought back from the island

560
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,397
was pain,

561
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,984
misery and darkness.

562
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,904
And of course,
I knew that the moment we came back here

563
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,865
that darkness would be waiting for me.

564
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,574
Well, he's wrong, dead wrong.

565
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:29,077
You didn't bring the darkness back
with you from Lian Yu.

566
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,579
But, Felicity, I'm telling you
that the only way I know

567
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:34,665
how to fight the darkness
is to be darkness.

568
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,791
That is why I left.

569
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,462
And I don't wanna be
that type of person anymore.

570
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,091
Then maybe you just need to be
a different kind of person.

571
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,177
And you're not doing this alone anymore.

572
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,430
Train station was a bust.

573
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,725
No incendiaries on the platform,
on the tracks or inside any of the trains.

574
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,269
Yeah, but if there's no bomb
in the station,

575
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,396
then how do they expect to blow it up?

576
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,900

00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,832
Is that all you got?

613
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,002
(GRUNTING)

614
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,298
(GROANING)

615
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,719
It seems you've much in common
with the Arrow. You're both dead.

616
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,232
Thank you.

617
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,861
We need to stop the train.

618
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,572
-You got any ideas?
-Yeah. Blow it up.

619
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:52,923
Whoa.

620
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,100
So what're you gonna call yourself now?
Everybody thinks Roy was the Arrow.

621
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,935
Well, he won't need a code name
if he's headed back to Ivy Town.

622
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,317
Well, then I guess I need a code name.

623
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:14,862
Felicity and I, we have missed this.

624
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,447
We've missed all of you.

625
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,659
And this city is far worse off
than we thought.

626
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,785
What are you talking about?

627
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,620
The man leading the Ghosts
is Damien Darhk.

628
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,748
Darhk left Star City months ago.
Why would he come back?

629
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:28,751
Did Ra's tell you anything about Darhk
that'd give us any idea about his agenda?

630
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:33,839
He said that Damien Darhk
had a hive of operatives at his disposal.

631
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,967
"Hive." That was the exact word he used?

632
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,845
Yes. Why? Does it mean something to you?

633
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,807
Who would wanna kill Andy?

634
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:45,143
Don't know their names. Just an alias.

635
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,020
Hive.

636
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,315
No.

637
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:53,401
-No, nothing.
-You all right?

638
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,445
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, man. I'm just beat.

639
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,281
Plus, I have a little girl to tuck in.

640
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,284
John. John!

641
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:06,497
Listen, I'm not quite there yet, Oliver,
so let's not do this right now.

642
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,583
No, I know. I get it.

643
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,336
But there is something we do need to do.

644
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,755
{\an8}-Captain, new problem.
-Seriously?

645
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,966
Someone's hacked into
the Emergency Broadcast System.

646
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,634
They've taken over all the networks.

647
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,970
<i>Six months ago, the Arrow died.</i>

648
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,723
<i>But what he stood for didn't.</i>

649
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:29,354
It lived on in the heroes
who took up his mantle.

650
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:34,484
<i>People who believe that this city
should never descend into hopelessness.</i>

651
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,363
<i>Who believe, although life
is full of darkness,</i>

652
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,865
<i>that darkness can be defeated by light.</i>

653
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:46,996
<i>And tonight, I am declaring my intention
to stand with them.</i>

654
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,707
To fight for this city.

655
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:54,462
To be the symbol of hope
that the Arrow never was.

656
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,008
I am

657
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,970
the Green Arrow.

658
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:13,063
(GROANS)

659
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,739
Who are you?

660
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,741
Answer me.

661
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,775
(GASPING)

662
00:37:57,983 --> 00:37:59,527
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

663
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:04,907
(GRUNTING)

664
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:17,420
You have a visitor.

665
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,298
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

666
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,595
(CHUCKLES)

667
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,097
Sorry about the arm.

668
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,765
A necessary subterfuge

669
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,810
to prevent anyone from suspecting
your involvement with HIVE.

670
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,103
What do you want?

671
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:37,982
Well, I'm a little disappointed the train
station isn't a smoldering pile of ash.

672
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,236
I'm not. Mass murder? Killing innocents?
I didn't sign up for this.

673
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:45,698
You signed up to follow my instructions,
to do my will.

674
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,408
I wanna know everything
about this Green Arrow,

675
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,868
where he lives, and who he loves.

676
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,203
And I want him off the boards
by the time my associates arrive.

677
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:53,914
And if I don't help you?

678
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,375
Well, then I would be surprised.

679
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,712
'Cause I think I made it abundantly clear.
You don't have a choice.

680
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:09,179
So my guilt over displacing Thea is
only slightly outweighed

681
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,642
by how amazing this place is.

682
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,480
Thea's actually been living with Laurel
for the past few months.

683
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,066
-Oh.
-Ra's stabbed her right over there.

684
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:23,653
-Oh.
-We can get a rug.

685
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:29,241
You know, I'd hate to disappoint you.
That speech is pretty hopeful.

686
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,452
Why would that disappoint me?

687
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,455
Well, you know how you said that
you didn't know how to be a hero

688
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,624
-without the darkness.
-Mmm.

689
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,378
And I know how you hate being wrong.

690
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,027
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.

691
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,197
-Zoom?
-Yeah.

692
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,408
There was a time
I would've thought this was my fault,

693
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,494
that I'd brought this darkness upon us.

694
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,247
But now I know it's not my fault.
It's my responsibility.

695
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,500
Responsibility to do what?

696
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,126
To end it.

697
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,754
I'm gonna kill him.

698
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,673
Is there anything I can do?

699
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,425
I wanna be left alone.

700
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,427
Okay.
