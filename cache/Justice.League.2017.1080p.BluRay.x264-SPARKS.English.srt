or long overlooked.</i>

1459
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:50,950
<i>It shows us new possibilities
and challenges us to pursue them.</i>

1460
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,358
THIEF: Yeah, and Jerry Monasco
runs the whole kit.

1461
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,431
I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

1462
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,318
Yeah, he has it all in storage
in Croydon.

1463
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,232
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1464
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,518
LOIS: <i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i>

1465
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:07,310
<i>coming out of the shadows
to tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

1466
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:14,111
<i>Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

1467
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:17,639
<i>But these heroes
were here the whole time</i>

1468
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:23,600
<i>to remind us that hope is real,
that you can see it.</i>

1469
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,515
<i>All you have to do is look,</i>

1470
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,354
<i>up in the sky.</i>

1471
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,875
(SONIC BOOM)

1472
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:35,150
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1473
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,280
Not at all, Barry.

1474
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:39,030
Curious myself.

1475
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,077
Yeah, and it's not
like a competition, you know?

1476
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:43,350
Well, it is a competition.

1477
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,353
But, you know, it's not like
a macho, uh, measuring thing.

1478
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:47,954
But if I win, you're off the team.

1479
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:52,918
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1480
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:55,275
- No...
- Oof.

1481
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,553
If I win...

1482
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:01,673
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch.

1483
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,235
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1484
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,353
I feel stung by that.

1485
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:09,514
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1486
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:10,670
Deal.

1487
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:12,590
Which coast?

1488
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,272
Uh, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1489
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,869
Which is that way.

1490
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,993
Because the sun, and it's...

1491
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:03,713
(DOOR BUZZES)

1492
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:05,711
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

1493
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:08,269
GUARD 1: All right,
let's keep it moving.

1494
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,511
GUARD 2: (ON RADIO)
<i>Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1495
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:12,790
<i>Luthor!</i>

1496
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:25,431
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1497
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,997
(LAUGHING)

1498
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:00,470
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1499
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:02,392
Care for a glass of Goût de Diamants?

1500
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:06,800
I was just celebrating God's return out
of the ground and back up into the sky.

1501
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,717
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1502
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:12,160
DEATHSTROKE: You better not
be wasting my time.

1503
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:16,149
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1504
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:18,954
<i>We have to level the playing field,
Mr. Wilson.</i>

1505
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,274
To put it plainly,

1506
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:26,357
shouldn't we have a league of our own?

1507
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:56,470
