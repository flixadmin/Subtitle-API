1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,250
There are some things we need
to discuss.

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:06,161
Our friend Jimmy McCavern has asked
for control of the racecourses

3
00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:09,158
north of Wincanton. I said yes.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,000
-In return for what?
-No return.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,398
None.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,838
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,118
It would have been a kindness.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,838
Now get out.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,400
This is a cheque guarantee.
Signed by Mosley...

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,720
..on behalf of a man called
Jimmy McCavern.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,558
The consequence of good intentions.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,600
My good intentions.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,838
Push the button.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,960
Unlock the door and come home to me.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,600
I've a job for you.

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,598
I'll come for you...

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,678
..after midnight on Wednesday.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,238
Barney Thomason...

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,798
..is going to kill Oswald Mosley.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,638
While he's on stage.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,200
While I'm stood next to him.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,278
And then I will take over
as leader of the party.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,360
It's going to be a busy few
weeks, brother.

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,400
You prefer Irish to Scotch?

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,240
Yes, Mr Churchill.

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,118
Irish over Scotch.

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,838
Cigarettes over Havana cigars.

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,560
And your mother was probably born
in a tent.

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,598
Grandmother in a tent.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,760
My mother on a narrow boat.

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,318
And always happy to give smart
answers to men born better than you.

32
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,998
A man needs to prove he is better
than me

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,438
rather than show me his
birth certificate.

34
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,118
You see, I don't have one,
so they mean very little to me.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,198
You speak beautifully in
the House...

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,880
-Thank you.
-..and believe not a word of what you are saying.

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,038
Conviction introduces emotion,
which is the enemy of oratory.

38
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,638
You read Greek literature.

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,280
I have trouble sleeping.

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,880
Is there a reason for your visit,
Mr Churchill?

41
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,798
You are forming an alliance
with a fascist.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,958
So I made some enquiries amongst the
worst people in Whitehall,

43
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,198
and I found out that you are not
forming an alliance with him at all.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,358
You are spying on him.

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,278
Yes.

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,760
Why?

47
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,200
The honest answer is...

48
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,798
..I'm no longer sure.

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Do you dig your own garden,
Mr Shelby?

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,838
I have a gardener.

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,840
In fact, I have three gardeners.

52
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,720
Three generations of
men with no ambition...

53
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,238
..who are happier than I will
ever be.

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,198
Well, if you ask them, they will
tell you

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,838
that there are certain species
of weed

56
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,798
that no matter how much you tug
at them, poison them,

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,198
they continue to grow back.

58
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,198
In the end, the only solution
is to plough up the top soil,

59
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,998
create a field of mud

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,880
and blow up and burn
the exposed tap roots.

61
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,518
That's what you and I did in France.

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,798
But when I hear that man
Mosley speak,

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,600
I see the green shoots of another
war growing up around his feet.

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,598
And you see exactly the same thing
I do.

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,360
That's why you oppose him.

66
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,998
Yeah.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,440
Your mystery solved.

68
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,480
What is your strategy?

69
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,278
I won't burden you with it.

70
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,440
You're going to break the law.

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,278
I need to sleep.

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,398
You said you don't sleep.

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,318
I said I have trouble sleeping.

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,960
As do I.

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,038
As do I.

76
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,398
Mr Shelby,

77
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,398
I have no doubt that there was once
a time in Flanders

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,518
when you were under the ground
and I was above it,

79
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,600
both working to the same end.

80
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,080
We are in the same exact situation
here, in Westminster.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,080
Do what you have to do, Mr Shelby.

82
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,840
And if you need anything, call me.

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
There are some times, some nights...

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,118
..when I don't see the point
of carrying on with any of it.

85
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,558
Oh.

86
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,958
That old dance routine.

87
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,120
I put out a cigar, and an hour later
I want another.

88
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,720
Sometimes, the bridge between hours
is a fragile as that.

89
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
But use it anyway.

90
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,438
A tent.

91
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,838
Then a boat.

92
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,478
Then a house.

93
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,918
Now a mansion.

94
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,720
That's something. Isn't it?

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,040
Yeah, that is something.

96
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,600
By the way...

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,758
..was it you who killed
that Ulsterman intelligence officer?

98
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,518
I forget his name.

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,998
Major Campbell.

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,638
Yes, Campbell.

101
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,398
No.

102
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,838
It was my aunt.

103
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,478
I really must come up to Birmingham
some day

104
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,320
and spend an evening with
your family.

105
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,598
They sound interesting.

106
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,198
Yes.

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,120
We'd like that.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,798
I got to Harold French, refereeing
Liverpool. He just wants cash.

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,158
Tom the tatter, reffing Sheffield
Wednesday, wants cash

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,638
and a beating for a bloke who's
screwing his wife.

111
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,238
The clap doctor said go easy
on the whiskey, yeah?

112
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,158
Finn.

113
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,558
You don't knock?

114
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,798
No, Finn.

115
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,680
I don't knock.

116
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,798
Right.

117
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,118
Hello, Billy.

118
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,998
How are you, mate?

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,518
Good, Mr Shelby.

120
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,438
Yeah, you look good.

121
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,278
That's a nice suit.

122
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,998
Thank you, Mr Shelby.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,558
He earned that suit.

124
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,718
We made more on the matches than we
did on the races last Saturday.

125
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,838
He's a good man.

126
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,598
Yeah, I know that. Mm.

127
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
You're coming up in the world, I
like it.

128
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,838
How's the missus, hmm?

129
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,998
The old trouble and strife,
as the cockneys like to call it.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,278
She moved out.

131
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,998
Oh, that's a shame.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,958
Mind if I join you, eh?

133
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,080
Mind if I join the party? Look at
this, having some fun. Hmm?

134
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,520
You're a good man, Billy.

135
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,160
You're a good man, eh?

136
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,278
You could sing like a bird in
a cage.

137
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,398
And what did we do, eh?

138
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,558
We opened that cage,
and the real man flies out,

139
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,118
reveals himself.

140
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,558
The truth is young, Billy boy...

141
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,118
Yeah.

142
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,678
Here, look.

143
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,278
What have we got here? Oh, look.

144
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,438
Look at that, Billy boy, eh?

145
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,358
Then there's some snow there, look.

146
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,158
Oh, there's more. Look,
snowflakes, Billy.

147
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,438
Now, I know you like that, hmm?
Well, I do too.

148
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,558
So, I'll tell you what, why don't we
have a little line together.

149
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,198
Eh? Why don't we do a little bit of
snow together?

150
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,838
Oh, spilt it all down you an' all.

151
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,238
It's the eyes. Sorry, mate.

152
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,838
Hey, what can I do?
I'm messy, aren't I, Billy?

153
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,318
I do apologise.

154
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,158
And you. Hmm?

155
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,678
Look at you.

156
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,238
Sitting here with your mate, eh?
Your best mate.

157
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,358
Well, while you're sitting here,
talking about our business,

158
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,398
drinking whiskey, smoking
and sniffing...

159
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,318
-Hmm?
-And working.

160
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,838
You remember, you tell this man

161
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,360
about our family business...

162
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,038
..and it's his life you're risking.
Cos people talk, Finn.

163
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,920
We...we only ever talk about
football and women, Mr Shelby.

164
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,798
Football and women, we
only ever...

165
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,958
We only ever talk about football
and women.

166
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,680
-Oh, do you?
-Yeah.

167
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,398
Hmm.

168
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,960
Yeah.

169
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,918
Come on.

170
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,480
Family meeting, let's go.

171
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,878
You're not eating right.
You're not eating right.

172
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,118
You're not getting the natural
things in you, boy,

173
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
that's what it is, always.

174
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,838
You bearing up, Arthur?

175
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,440
Bearing up for what?

176
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,880
Bearing up to being free, Pol.

177
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,918
Another glass, eh?

178
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,960
Another glass of so what.

179
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,680
Are you all right, Charlie?

180
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,118
Mad bastard Barney kicked me
in the shin when I woke him up.

181
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,638
Where is the mad bastard?

182
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,598
He's tied to a lamp post outside
with three Lee boys,

183
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,640
shitting themselves.

184
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,080
Have a drink.

185
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,238
First of all, an apology
from Lizzie - she can't be here.

186
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,560
Charles has a violin concert.

187
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,400
Also, a welcome to Mr Aberama Gold.

188
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,078
He and Polly are to be married
in three weeks, with my blessing.

189
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,638
From now on, Aberama will be welcome
at our meetings.

190
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,080
First item of business,
a bereavement.

191
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,118
Colonel Ben Younger,

192
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,678
who may perhaps have become
a member of this family,

193
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,518
was taken from us,
four days ago,

194
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,558
by dark forces.

195
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,758
We've made some investigations,

196
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,838
and we think we know
who planted the bomb.

197
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,958
In the meantime,
our thoughts are with Ada

198
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,478
and the baby inside of her,

199
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,998
who may one day sit at
these meetings,

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,878
but hopefully under
happier circumstances.

201
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,238
Let's drink to
happier circumstances.

202
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,640
Yeah.

203
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,398
To Ada.

204
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,840
-To Ada.
-To Ada.

205
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,518
Item number two.

206
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,878
An announcement, regarding Michael.

207
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,358
Before you go on, Tommy,

208
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,318
there's something I'd like to say
to the whole family directly,

209
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,438
regarding finances and the future of
this company.

210
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,038
According to your own estimations,

211
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,838
this new venture of the delivery
and shipment of opium

212
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,238
will bring into the company
around £2 million per year.

213
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,598
Therefore, due to the
amounts involved,

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,078
I think this company
should be restructured.

215
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,398
Michael, I think this can wait
till outside the family meeting.

216
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,078
Restructured in what way?

217
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,158
Because of the amounts of
money involved,

218
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,118
shipment and dispatch will become

219
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,718
the primary source of income
to the company.

220
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,078
It's simple mathematics.

221
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,998
And with the help of my wife,

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,678
I will organise an expansion
into America,

223
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,878
where the narcotics business
is just beginning to grow.

224
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,758
See, I have very good contacts
in Detroit,

225
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,518
New York, Boston, who I've already
spoken to about this.

226
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,918
And Gina has family who are very
experienced in this kind of business.

227
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,558
According to the conversations
I've had with them,

228
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,838
with a regular supply
of pure opium from China,

229
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,238
within a short space of time,

230
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,118
the American narcotics business
will bring in 20 million per annum.

231
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,918
Enough money for you to all enjoy an
easing of the burden

232
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,678
you all now feel.

233
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,438
See, I know that the scars
and the wounds,

234
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,638
they're on the inside,
not on the outside.

235
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,358
And as a member of the
new generation,

236
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,800
I'm able to take that great burden
off your weary shoulders.

237
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,518
A new decade is coming.

238
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,718
There'll be new opportunities
in new territories.

239
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,800
More money than we've ever
had before.

240
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,798
Tommy,

241
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,080
you can still do the good work
that deep down you want to do.

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,718
Mum, you can get married
and live in that big house.

243
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,238
Arthur, you can be the man
that Linda wants you to be.

244
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,040
Fuck Linda.

245
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,078
Finn.

246
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
You've proved yourself.

247
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,600
You're part of the new generation.

248
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,560
You could come to New York, with me.

249
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,320
Here is my proposal.

250
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,718
A full restructuring of the company.

251
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,078
I will be managing director...

252
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,558
..and you can be
nonexecutive chairman,

253
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,278
but under an assumed name,
to protect your reputation.

254
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,398
I've found the name of a dead man.

255
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,440
You will be registered as Mr Jones.

256
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,878
You will each receive a percentage
of the profits as an annuity,

257
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,598
and you will no longer have
to engage

258
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,480
in any of the
associated activities.

259
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,240
Take a look at the future, Tommy.

260
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
At least read it with an open mind.

261
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,120
It's cold in here, Michael.

262
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,118
Tommy, the Americans want to deal
with me.

263
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,438
Item number three.

264
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,838
Tell him the truth.

265
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,918
Go on.

266
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,840
He can take it.

267
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,760
Tell me the truth, Michael.

268
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,998
The Americans don't want to deal

269
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,478
with an old-fashioned,
backstreet razor gang.

270
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Those days are done.

271
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,998
Tommy. He's bitten through the
fucking rope.

272
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,158
They've got him cornered,
but they need help.

273
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,200
Go and get him!

274
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,600
Fuck the Americans.

275
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,278
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

276
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,998
It's time.

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,640
And you know it.

278
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,678
Tommy, Mum's leaving,

279
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,998
John's dead, Arthur needs help,

280
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,600
Ada's man was killed in your own
back yard because you fucked up.

281
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,518
Go on, Tom. Go on, cut me.

282
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,480
Like the good old days.

283
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,118
Or...

284
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,880
..see this for what it is.

285
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,718
A natural succession...

286
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,040
..that someday must happen.

287
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,918
I gave you an opportunity, Michael,
you've betrayed me.

288
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,918
Don't be here when I get back.

289
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,438
You...

290
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,638
-You can tell your family...
-Let me guess.

291
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,800
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

292
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,600
Right?

293
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,918
Well...

294
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,880
..guess we're going to be forced
to take the second option.

295
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,038
They're not fucking voices!

296
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,278
Whoa! Whoa! Calm down.

297
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,078
-Put the gun down.
-They're not fucking voices!

298
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,078
Barney!

299
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,678
Barney.

300
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,400
Put down the gun. At ease.

301
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,478
Finn.

302
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,158
At ease, soldier. At ease.
Look at me. You're on our side.

303
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,478
You're at home. You're at home.

304
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,838
Yeah? Yeah.

305
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,158
Here. Take this, Barney. Jeremiah.

306
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,758
Yeah.

307
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,238
Take him to Charlie's yard
before he falls over.

308
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,838
The devil will now be an angel.
Isiah, Curly, you go with him.

309
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,758
Come, brother. Let me give you the
good news.

310
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,638
Jesus loves you.

311
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,598
So, where the fuck is he?

312
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,958
All right, boys. A
subsidiary meeting of the generation

313
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,880
that actually do the work.

314
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,838
Right.
Let's have the good stuff.

315
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,518
None of that shit ponces drink.

316
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,318
Here we go, look.

317
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,078
All right, so item number three.

318
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,038
An introduction.

319
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,278
Except now you've already met the
man I was going to introduce.

320
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,238
In France, he was a comrade.

321
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,158
What the fuck is he now, Tom?

322
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,238
He's a man we can use, Johnny.

323
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,438
For what? Put him in a ring with a
bear and take bets on the outcome.

324
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,280
I tell you, I wouldn't put much
money on the fucking bear.

325
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,118
Aberama,

326
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,438
that man is a trained
Royal Marine sniper.

327
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,038
Furthermore, he has a
criminal profile

328
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,398
which will make his actions
explicable to the police.

329
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,958
What actions?

330
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,958
A killing.

331
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,760
And since when
did you worry about the police?

332
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,078
Barney Thomason...

333
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,838
..is going to kill an MP.

334
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,438
Possibly the future prime minister
of Great Britain.

335
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,480
What the fuck, Tom?

336
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,678
After the killing,

337
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,318
there will be an investigation
by Special Branch

338
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,520
and intelligence forces.

339
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,518
There will be a lot of powerful
people as angry as fucking hornets.

340
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,278
We need there to be no connection
to us.

341
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,678
Barney Thomason is registered
as criminally insane.

342
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,198
He broke out. He's an old soldier.

343
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,158
He has known grievances.

344
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,238
No-one will question that the
assassination was carried out

345
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,718
by a single gunman acting alone.

346
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,038
And you'd sacrifice an old comrade?

347
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,398
If they catch him, they won't hang
him on grounds of insanity,

348
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,118
just send him back to where I
found him.

349
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,358
He'll have had a very
eventful holiday

350
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,838
that he'll probably believe
never really happened.

351
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,840
And where will this killing
take place?

352
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,720
There you go.

353
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,198
He'll be on stage.

354
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,678
With lots...

355
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,358
..of witnesses.

356
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,318
During the rally,

357
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,518
there will be an
anti-fascist demonstration.

358
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,038
Amidst the confusion,
a shot will be fired.

359
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,198
And we're organising
this demonstration?

360
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,960
-Yeah.
-And where will you be, Tom?

361
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,598
I'll be down on one knee,
cradling his head...

362
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,040
..while the life drains from him.

363
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,318
Then I'll make a speech...

364
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,840
..saying how the cause he died for
must continue...

365
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,318
..continue safe in my hands.

366
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,758
Holy fuck.

367
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,518
Tommy...

368
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,320
..does your ambition have no limits?

369
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,440
Jimmy McCavern will be running
security at this event.

370
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,200
He'll probably be in the wings.

371
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,000
You can take his life
in whichever manner you choose.

372
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,078
What do you want us to do, Tom?

373
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,198
You and Arthur
and a couple of the Lee boys,

374
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,878
you'll be in charge
of getting Barney into position.

375
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,238
He'll be up in the lighting gantry.

376
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,838
We'll need chains and a twitch, Tom.

377
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,198
No. I will medicate him.

378
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,918
So he's going to be cross-eyed
when he takes the shot?

379
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,758
In France, he never missed...

380
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,480
..no matter what they gave him.

381
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,318
He'll have had plenty of
target practise.

382
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,158
Before he takes the shot,

383
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,318
Arthur here will give him some
cocaine to sharpen him up.

384
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,038
So just...

385
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,838
You're going to be up on the stage

386
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,078
while this criminally insane gunman
filled with cocaine

387
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,400
takes aim at a man
just a yard away from you?

388
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,478
Welcome to the family, Aberama.

389
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,840
What about me, Thomas? The man with
the broken fucking leg.

390
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,038
After the killing,

391
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,558
every copper in Birmingham
will be sent to Bingley Hall.

392
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,838
Use that opportunity

393
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,718
to get that boat full of opium
up to Stourbridge locks.

394
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,358
There, you'll be met
by some Chinese gentlemen.

395
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,798
They will have two suitcases full
of cash.

396
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,760
£250,000.

397
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,478
Every man in this room
will receive 30,000 in cash,

398
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,478
in recognition of extra services.

399
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,600
Holy Mary, Mother of God, Tom!

400
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Anyone who want to leave, leave now.

401
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,198
Anyone who is tired
of this old-fashioned,

402
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,118
backstreet fucking razor gang
can leave.

403
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,560
Anyone who's tired can fucking stop.

404
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,118
Good.

405
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,158
Charlie, go to the yard and light
a fire.

406
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,478
Johnny, bring the van around.

407
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,000
What's the fire for, Tom?

408
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,200
There is an item number four.

409
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,240
It's time.

410
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,238
Jeez, Mr Shelby.

411
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,040
If I'd have known, I'd have come in
early and served ye drinks, huh?

412
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,720
Here, Micky.

413
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,560
Sit down there.

414
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,520
Sure, I'll have a drink, will I?

415
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,720
Here you go, have a drink.

416
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,160
A few days ago, I went to
London, Micky...

417
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,200
..to collect some cargo.

418
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,800
I was met by the Titanic boys.

419
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,040
They knew I was coming.

420
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,198
Yeah. When, where, what time.

421
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,240
They even knew...

422
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,438
-..the cargo I was picking up.
-Jesus.

423
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,118
Four days ago, Micky...

424
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,558
..a soldier was killed

425
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,198
outside my office...

426
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,398
..by a bomb.

427
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,878
Yeah, erm, the papers said that
was IRA.

428
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,558
No, it wasn't the IRA, Micky.

429
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,280
No. It weren't the IRA, Micky.

430
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,278
I spoke to the girls who work
at the Digbeth telephone exchange.

431
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,920
They're friends of mine.

432
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,640
I asked them what calls were made
around the time of the explosion.

433
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,040
They told me that...

434
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,518
..30 minutes before the explosion a
call was made to a man in Sparkhill

435
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,998
who has connections
to the Ulster Volunteer Force.

436
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,480
He now offers his services for cash.

437
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,320
Paddy Rose.

438
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,638
Yeah, me and my brother,
we spoke to Paddy.

439
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,038
At length.

440
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,000
He told us it was him
that planted the bomb.

441
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Yeah, we spoke to him.

442
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,040
We killed him, Micky.

443
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,518
Paddy Rose is dead.

444
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,758
We weighted him down,

445
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,878
we sunk him,

446
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,080
to the bottom of the
Grand Union Canal.

447
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,518
The girls at the exchange
gave me the number

448
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,358
of the man that called, Micky,
before the explosion.

449
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,920
That was your number.

450
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,638
Micky, it was you who called him.

451
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,240
You tipped him off.

452
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,198
You were told to call him if a black
man of a certain description

453
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,000
ever came to Small Heath.

454
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,278
We know you've...

455
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,758
..you've been giving the
Titanic boys information as well.

456
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,478
We know that.

457
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,118
Yeah.

458
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,198
You've been working behind the
bar, hmm?

459
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,798
Seeing what goes on,
listening, taking notes,

460
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,720
and selling your stories
to the highest bidder. Hmm?

461
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,038
Yeah.

462
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,720
Come on.

463
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,320
Come on, man.

464
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,560
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

465
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,040
I'm sorry, Mr Shelby.

466
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,240
Don't look at Tommy.

467
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,958
The ceiling would be
cheaper, brother.

468
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,120
Micky!

469
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,918
Look at that, Arthur.

470
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,278
Eh?

471
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,320
Shaking like the hand of a
normal man.

472
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,398
What about item five, Tom?

473
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,800
Huh?

474
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,520
There is an item five, right, Tommy?

475
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,960
I'm fucking sinking
here, man.

476
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,158
I'm fucking sinking, Tom.

477
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,918
You...you...you said there's an
item five. Say it, Tommy.

478
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,718
Item five could start now, Tommy.

479
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,958
It could start this year, a
new decade.

480
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,758
M-M-Michael...

481
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,278
Michael could be right -
we could go, Tommy.

482
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,278
We could go.

483
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,038
We could fucking leave this place.
We could leave it to the kids.

484
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,598
Michael's... He might be right.

485
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,598
He might be fucking right.

486
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Arthur! There is no item
number five!

487
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,678
Go and check that Polly is still
on our side.

488
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,358
I have to go to Margate.

489
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,280
All right, Tom.

490
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,520
All right, brother!

491
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,040
Oh, God. Jesus Christ.

492
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,320
You out there, Tommy?

493
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,558
Yeah. I'm here.

494
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,998
I was just having some oil rubbed
into the bits

495
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,720
that really hurt, mate.

496
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,318
What do you think of that view, eh?

497
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,800
It's Margate. What can you do?

498
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,278
I'll tell you something,
Tommy, right?

499
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,678
I sit all day every day in
that chair,

500
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,118
on that balcony,
contemplating the fact, right,

501
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,080
that life is so much easier to deal
with when you are dead!

502
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,638
-Hello, Alfie.
-Yeah.

503
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,278
Did you...did you look
through the binoculars?

504
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,358
-Yeah.
-I watch ships. No two are the same.

505
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,318
Yeah.

506
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,878
That is how God sees us both, in
his eyes.

507
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,358
God, eh?

508
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,958
Yeah, sort of. I mean, you know.

509
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,800
Someone who's responsible
for all this fucking mess.

510
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,318
Now, how soon did you know
that I was not dead?

511
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,958
You wrote me a letter, Alfie.

512
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,278
Did I?

513
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,078
Yeah, you asked about your dog.

514
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,838
They gave me a lot of drugs
at first.

515
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,518
Hmm. Yeah, all right.

516
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,598
I was lying out there,

517
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,158
and the tide had come in,
and it woke me up.

518
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,040
I remember looking around
and thinking, you know...

519
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,158
"Fuck. If this is hell...

520
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,118
"..it looks a lot like Margate."

521
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,798
Maybe that's just what hell looks
like, eh?

522
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,638
No, no. Not according to this
holy book right here, yeah?

523
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,878
It gives a very, very
vivid description.

524
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,040
You and I are both fucked, mate.

525
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,518
Do you read the papers, Alfie?

526
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,480
No, don't be silly.

527
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,078
But you've heard.

528
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,760
What, fascism, yeah?

529
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,878
Three,

530
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,718
two,

531
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,558
one,

532
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,278
bang.

533
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,960
No?

534
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,718
Fine.

535
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,598
Good Lord, your fucking condition
has got worse, mate.

536
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,478
Mine, on the other hand,

537
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,238
I've been living the dream.

538
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,358
Sometimes, I will shoot
at the side of a ship.

539
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,478
And sometimes I'll sit here,
I may shoot at the old seagull.

540
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,360
Alfie...

541
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,998
..I'm going to shoot Oswald Mosley.

542
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,238
Right, well...

543
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,280
..I hope you do a better job on him
than the one you done on me, yeah?

544
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,958
I mean, what...

545
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,400
..what were you thinking? Was your
mind somewhere else, Tommy?

546
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,918
Yes, it was actually.

547
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,438
Yeah, all right.

548
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,038
Oh, look.

549
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,720
A ship.

550
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,158
Why do you want to shoot him?

551
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,238
I need to organise a riot, Alfie.

552
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,398
-Right.
-And I hear you still have some...standing

553
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,838
in the Jewish community.

554
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,318
Let me be clear, right?

555
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,798
Since my resurrection,

556
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,718
I am considered to be a God,
all right?

557
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,078
In the Holy Land,
someone has made an image of me

558
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,558
out of rock embedded in the sand,
so I'm told,

559
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,638
and I am planning to make
a pilgrimage

560
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,320
to stand in my own shadow.

561
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,518
Are you going to shoot him
because this man is evil?

562
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,278
I need men who can fight.

563
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,798
Mosley uses men from Glasgow.

564
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,158
So if the men causing the trouble
are Jewish it will be...explicable.

565
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,918
Since when did you need
explanations, Tommy?

566
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,918
Since I entered politics.

567
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,598
Oh, that's right, yeah.

568
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,518
Oh, yeah. And how has that been
for you, Tom?

569
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,078
Gangs, wars, truces...

570
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,160
Nothing I didn't already know.

571
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,038
So you think if you kill him,
you...you will kill the message,

572
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,518
yeah?

573
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,758
I will kill the man,

574
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,560
then I will kill the message.

575
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,958
How much you paying?

576
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,918
I thought you might do it for the
cause, Alfie.

577
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,758
Fuck off.

578
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,678
Each man will get £20.

579
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,678
You'll get £5,000.

580
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,358
You know, as a god, Tommy, right,

581
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:58,638
I am now able to just rise
above those kinds of insults, mate.

582
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
Ten?

583
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,678
How is my dog?

584
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,400
Your dog is fine.

585
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,678
In that case, ten should be enough.
Where do you want the men?

586
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,918
-Birmingham.
-No. No.

587
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,798
20 will not be enough

588
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,318
for my lads to step inside
that fucking shit hole.

589
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,200
It will have to be 25 at least.

590
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,998
25 it is. You can take your dog
back, then, eh?

591
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,438
No, it's better for him
to think that I am still dead.

592
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,120
As it is also with the police.

593
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,318
Right.

594
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,318
So you're still at it, eh, Tommy?

595
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,238
Hmm.

596
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,558
You ain't got no Margate to go to.

597
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,000
No.

598
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,278
And I have no interest
in shooting seagulls.

599
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,238
Oh, you have in shooting
cabinet ministers?

600
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,438
Yeah.

601
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,680
-And their paid informants.
-Mm.

602
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,278
I was on a lot of drugs at first,
right, due to the pain, you know,

603
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,878
on account of it...

604
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:13,518
Well, you know, being shot in the
face by...some cunt.

605
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,518
I won't bore you with the details,
it'dchill ya.

606
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,800
Nonetheless, I had a
recurring dream.

607
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,998
I saw you in a field, right?

608
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,718
With a big black horse.

609
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,158
And you said goodbye,

610
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,680
and then...bang.

611
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,160
All right, then. Well, what now?

612
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,040
I will continue...

613
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,880
..till I find a man that I
can't defeat.

614
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,680
Hmm.

615
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,080
Arthur asked whose side I was on.

616
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,638
There will be a war...

617
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,398
..and one of you will die.

618
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,840
But which one, I cannot tell.

619
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,960
Hmm.

620
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,680
He's going to do it anyway.

621
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,798
-Yeah.
-You should know,

622
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,520
if Aberama takes his side,
I will kill him.

623
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What about me?

624
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,280
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

625
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,800
Kill...and kill...

626
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,480
It's the only way to make
people listen.

627
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,400
Soon you'll have a stage to
stand on.

628
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,480
Millions of people will listen
to you.

629
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,758
And you will run the country
like you run this family.

630
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,920
It appears to be what people want.

631
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,358
But not me.

632
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,718
Not any more.

633
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,640
My resignation.

634
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,118
If it's Barney you're worried about,
he's sleeping.

635
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,520
But I can't sleep because my fucking
leg is cracked.

636
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,760
Tell me how my mother went, Charlie.

637
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,558
You know.

638
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,920
She drowned.

639
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,640
I know it wasn't by accident.

640
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,278
Tell me the truth, Charlie.

641
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,998
The truth, Tommy, yeah?

642
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,560
The fucking truth.

643
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,640
Fuck's sake.

644
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,080
She just stepped into the canal.

645
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,760
Your dad was no use.

646
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,880
It was me trying to stop her,
for three days.

647
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,440
In the end, she did it anyway.

648
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,480
-Did she say why?
-Nothing that made sense.

649
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,800
Tell me the things
that didn't make sense.

650
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,838
She said it were the Gypsies
made the nails for Jesus's cross.

651
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,960
That's why we're cursed
and restless.

652
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,318
Yeah, go on.

653
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,960
You have to move around or the guilt
catches up with you.

654
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,280
I said, "Well, why not go on the
road for a bit?"

655
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,238
She went to Worcester.

656
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,320
She came back with a white pony.

657
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,560
That one she gave to you.

658
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,560
You used to ride it round, remember?

659
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,760
She seemed happy for a bit,
watching you ride it.

660
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,520
And then she was gone.

661
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,400
None of it made any sense.

662
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,520
Afterwards, whenever I looked
at that white pony, I saw her.

663
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,520
You see, I was in love with
her, Tom.

664
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,080
No-one knew but me.

665
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,680
Broke my fucking heart
to pull her from the cut.

666
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,958
You know, your grandfather,
he went the same way.

667
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,038
Suicide.

668
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,240
Sometimes, these things run in
the family.

669
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,918
Fuck family, Tom.

670
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,878
You just have to get on with it.

671
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,318
You're a Gypsy.

672
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,600
You have to move around,
or it all catches up with you.

673
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,398
You didn't need all them tablets,

674
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,880
you just needed another fucking
war, eh?

675
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,278
Perish Judah.

676
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,200
Perish Judah.

677
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,918
Shalom, my friends. Shalom.

678
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,600
-Shalom.
-Shalom.

679
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,360
In you come, eh?

680
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,640
Show these fascist bastards no
mercy, brothers.

681
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,118
The Jew and the Gypsy united.

682
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,598
Look, I have got to go, yeah?
I have to go.

683
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,958
Go where?

684
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,758
They're shooting a fascist tonight.

685
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,360
-You're going to do what?
-Sh.

686
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,958
Mosley's in town.

687
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,398
Really?

688
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,078
Look, go into town,

689
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,678
get some drink and some girl

690
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,200
and listen to the radio.

691
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,598
We will not stand by and let this
scum have free rein in our city!

692
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,240
Fascism must not be allowed to voice
its creed of hatred.

693
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,680
Out the fucking way!

694
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,478
We have a right to protest!

695
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,678
Get back!

696
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,600
Anybody heckles you,
beat the fuck out of them.

697
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,718
We have a right to protest!

698
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,238
We got another one. Let's go.
Get, get!

699
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,558
Calm yourself down.

700
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,880
It's not against the law to protest.

701
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,078
Out of the way. Out of
the way.

702
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,118
Let her go.

703
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,438
-I don't need the help of a fascist.
-Yes, you do.

704
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,198
At Steelhouse Lane, they will do
whatever they want to you.

705
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,358
Let her go.

706
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,600
I'm Tommy Shelby, and I'm ordering
you to let her fucking go. Go on.

707
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,798
Fuck you.

708
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,718
Jessie, you can do more damage
from the inside.

709
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,838
Do you understand?

710
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,440
You can do more damage from
the inside.

711
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,358
Come on.

712
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,638
Come on.

713
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,638
Out of the way. Out of the way.

714
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,000
Shut up!

715
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,358
Here, look.

716
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,960
There, look.

717
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,480
I'll join yer.

718
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,198
Going to play, eh?

719
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,038
Now, you know what you're doing,
don't you?

720
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,238
Yeah. Tommy checks his pocket watch,
I count ten,

721
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,998
then I blow the other bloke's
head off.

722
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,958
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

723
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,398
There, that's for after.

724
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,398
Thank you. Thank you.

725
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,558
-See you later, Arthur.
-Oh, soldier...

726
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,118
Soldier, you do that, you run
like fuck.

727
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,958
-Don't stop.
-Run like fuck.

728
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,560
-Yeah.
-Run like fuck.

729
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,320
In here.

730
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,518
Here, for your face.

731
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,678
At least I have only one face.

732
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,318
What did you mean,
"damage from the inside"?

733
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,198
-I have a strategy.
-You always have a strategy.

734
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,518
But it's dangerous,

735
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,078
and it cannot be shared
without sharing the danger.

736
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,598
You think I'm afraid?

737
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,998
No, but it's only going to put you
in more danger.

738
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,238
Jessie, before the speeches start,
just go home.

739
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,998
There's going to be lots
of arrests.

740
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,918
-You have a mark against your name.
-Why?

741
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,880
What's going to happen?

742
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,280
I'm going to do a good thing.

743
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,478
Whenever I do a good thing,

744
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,638
innocent people get hurt.

745
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,958
So go home.

746
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,358
After this evening, we can meet,
discuss strategy.

747
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,678
That beast out there, he's just
a beast.

748
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,598
It's like a horse.

749
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,560
It's the rider that decides
what direction it takes.

750
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,278
And who will be the rider?

751
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,320
Just go home.

752
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,638
Full?

753
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,198
To the fucking brim.

754
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,718
Trouble?

755
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,598
So far, a few communists.

756
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,318
Bullers helped our boys clear
them away.

757
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,758
Well, a few hecklers are a
good thing.

758
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,718
We can illustrate
how we deal with opposition.

759
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,558
There's a rumour of a gang of
Jews were coming up from Digbeth.

760
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,238
No sign of them yet.

761
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,118
Well, let them come.

762
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,760
Welcome them appropriately.

763
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,200
There are a few Peaky boys around.

764
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,718
They are your allies. There'll be no
rifts between us.

765
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,480
Keep your powder dry.

766
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,800
Mr McCavern?

767
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,760
Perish Judah.

768
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,920
No joke, Mr McCavern.

769
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,640
Perish Judah.

770
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,678
You turn the radio on
and turn up the volume.

771
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,440
I want to listen the news.

772
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,878
Ladies and gentlemen,

773
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,040
Mr Oswald Mosley.

774
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,318
Perish Judah!

775
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,118
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

776
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,478
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

777
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,958
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah!

778
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,278
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

779
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,438
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

780
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,678
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

781
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,758
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

782
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,400
Perish Judah!

783
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,838
Welcome, men and women
of Birmingham.

784
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,398
Thank you for coming here
on this cold, dark night,

785
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,120
in spite of the obstruction
and provocation of our enemies.

786
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:26,398
Our enemies deal in bricks
and stones and bottles.

787
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,400
We deal in reasoned principle,
argument and fact.

788
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,798
Among those enemies, we can number
Mr Winston Churchill,

789
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,240
who last night condemned me in the
House as a threat to democracy.

790
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,600
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.

791
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:00,638
But then Mr Churchill has never been
a friend of the common people.

792
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,998
Faced with the alternative

793
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,598
of saying goodbye to the
gold standard,

794
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,998
and therefore to his own employment,

795
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,478
he characteristically selected
the latter,

796
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,078
but of course....

797
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,878
..not all attending tonight

798
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,358
will be convinced of our cause.

799
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,678
Some will have come here tonight
to find out for themselves

800
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,158
what we stand for.

801
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,038
Whenever you're ready, Tom.

802
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,598
So here are our guiding principles.

803
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,158
Every citizen shall serve the state.

804
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,478
Not the banks, not factions...

805
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,800
..not the Jews!

806
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,320
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

807
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,158
The barriers of class will
be abolished

808
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,238
and a greater Britain will be born

809
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,040
of the national socialist
and fascist creed.

810
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,598
It is useless to hide from ourselves
the fact that ever since 1918,

811
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,118
when our heroes returned
from France,

812
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,038
our empire has shown all the signs
of disintegration,

813
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,480
and our people are threatened
by gathering disaster.

814
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,558
Get out of my way!

815
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,320
Out of the way!

816
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,480
Go. Go.

817
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,598
Ten.

818
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,440
Nine.

819
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,200
Eight.

820
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,760
Seven.

821
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,040
Six.

822
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,758
Five.

823
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,238
Four.

824
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,918
Three.

825
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,360
Two apple crumble...

826
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,198
I think it's about time
we got off the stage, old man,

827
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,920
until this thing is sorted.

828
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,640
The coppers are here, Arthur.
You gotta get away from the body.

829
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,198
What the fuck are you doing here?

830
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,798
-What happened?
-I don't know what happened.

831
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,758
I don't know what fucking happened.
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

832
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,520
Wait. Fuck, it's us.

833
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,278
Aberama's dead, he's gone.

834
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,800
He's gone, and they came for
me, too.

835
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,478
What the fuck is she doing here?

836
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,318
Arthur, they got to Barney.

837
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,598
They knew everything. They knew
fucking everything.

838
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,678
Who? Who knew, Tom?

839
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,478
Johnny, get this woman out of here.

840
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,760
-I want to know.
-Yeah. Get her out of here. Get her out!

841
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,800
It doesn't make sense.

842
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,078
Doesn't make fucking sense.

843
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,278
Who? Who? Who?

844
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,480
The Chinese, the Italians...

845
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,838
..the Branch, Intelligence,
McCavern, Mosley...

846
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,438
Mosley knew nothing!

847
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,320
He knew nothing!

848
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,878
WHO?!

849
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,718
Jesus fucking Christ.

850
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,358
You're fucking frightening me, Tom.

851
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,840
It doesn't make sense.

852
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,480
Who?

853
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,798
Who? Who?

854
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,118
Who?

855
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,878
Who? You know, Tom, you
must know.

856
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,400
You're fucking scaring me.
What are you doing?

857
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,878
Talk to me.

858
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,360
Maybe I've found him, Arthur,
the man I can't defeat.

859
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,360
-Mosley?
-I don't know. I don't fucking know.

860
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,880
Doesn't make sense.

861
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,558
Let's...

862
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,040
Let's go inside.

863
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,800
We'll work it out...

864
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,080
-..have a drink.
-I need to walk.

865
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,998
The work's all done, Tommy.

866
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,798
It's all done.

867
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,918
We can walk away from all of this.

868
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,478
It's so easy. It's so soft.

869
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,480
Such a small change.
