1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,561
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,103
I have to keep you safe. Go!

3
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:04,950
You've had Mona in
custody this whole time?

4
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:06,256
You have the Kaupe too?

5
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:07,859
Sara, you need to bring in that fugitive

6
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,359
before someone gets hurt.

7
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:10,830
Step away from the creature, miss.

8
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,639
You murdered him.

9
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:15,080
Today I asked you for one thing.

10
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,643
- Ava, don't do this.
- Just go.

11
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:18,632
So I'll head to the Bureau
and do some digging?

12
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,877
Hank is torturing prisoners off site.

13
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,587
Keep digging. I want to know everything.

14
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,587
What do you mean you
couldn't capture the asset?

15
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,996
Blame it on your son's
time-traveling pals, sir.

16
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:30,720
Let me just say this,

17
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:33,482
and I want to say this
for the television news.

18
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:35,480
The people have a right to know

19
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:38,579
whether or not their
president is a crook.

20
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,572
Well, I am a crook.

21
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,200
Oh, actually felt good
to get that off my chest.

22
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:45,478
What other secrets have
I been holding back?

23
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:48,738
Ah, yes, despite the constant
reassurances of my wife,

24
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,741
I know that I'm certainly
only an adequate lover.

25
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:52,760
Mr. President!

26
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,094
The President won't be taking

27
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,456
any more questions at this time.

28
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:57,177
That is more about

29
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,938
Tricky Dick than I ever needed to know

30
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:00,941
And it's more than the
public needed to know.

31
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:02,685
In the days following
the news conference,

32
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,779
Nixon found himself unable to tell a lie

33
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:06,359
resulting in global chaos.

34
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:07,894
Nixon's blathering fouled up

35
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:09,766
ongoing peace talks
and trade agreements.

36
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,786
Without the release of
"All the President's Men",

37
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:13,696
Robert Redford's career floundered.

38
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,615
What? No Redford?

39
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,409
No Sundance, no indie
film, no artful nudity.

40
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,669
We have to fix this!

41
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:21,129
The only thing nastier

42
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:22,631
than a politician lying is when

43
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,089
he says how he really feels.

44
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:25,652
Now, there's no way he'd tell the truth

45
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:26,700
without a magical assist.

46
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:28,225
I hope the Watergate has vacancies,

47
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:29,652
because we need to make sure that

48
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:31,563
Nixon still cheats the press.

49
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:33,508
Uh, Captain's orders and
all, but do you think

50
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,810
it's really the best time
to be back on mission?

51
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:38,572
Yeah, I mean, it might
do well to take a beat.

52
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:41,316
I appreciate your
concern, but I'll be fine.

53
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:43,985
Just because Ava and
I had a disagreement

54
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,654
doesn't mean that I can't do my job.

55
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,563
I was actually talking
about the fact that

56
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,249
we're on the outs with the Time Bureau.

57
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,067
Yeah, and I was talking about Mona.

58
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,109
I mean, Hank's gonna be
after us since her boyfriend

59
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,612
offed that agent and, well,

60
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,739
we can't just stash her here forever.

61
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,576
Right, well, it has been eventful

62
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,695
but things are gonna blow
over with the Bureau.

63
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:04,372
We'll find a safe place for Mona.

64
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,915
And in the meantime,

65
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,511
I feel like we should be
doing what we do best.

66
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:11,337
- Am I right?
- Right.

67
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,465
Save Redford and independent film.

68
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,483
That's the spirit.

69
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,532
- Done it for worse reasons.
- Why not?

70
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:21,940

71
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,934
Director Sharpe.

72
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,366
You look terrible. What happened?

73
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,771
Joke acknowledged,
Nathaniel, but tighten up.

74
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,493
Director Sharpe is
taking a leave of absence

75
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:31,867
to get her priorities straight.

76
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:33,774
I'll be acting as
Director of the Bureau.

77
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:36,487
Wait, so, um, you're gonna be
in charge from now on? That's...

78
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,436
- Great.
- It's great.

79
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,559
Looking forward to working
with you, Director Heywood.

80
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,383
Glad to have you on board, Agent Tomaz.

81
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,890
Though my first job is a sensitive one.

82
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:46,080
I need to catch the Legends.

83
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,624
This is the last time they will
thumb their nose at authority

84
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,335
and get away with it.

85
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,053
I know they're your friends,

86
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:53,722
so, if you want to sit this one out...

87
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:55,131
No, no, Dad. You know what?

88
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,650
- We have your back.
- Agreed.

89
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,727
I stand by the Time
Bureau and by my man.

90
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:01,583
- Thank you, babe.
- Glad to hear it.

91
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:03,848
We'll pinpoint the
location of the Waverider

92
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,516
and pay it a visit.

93
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,161
We'll meet in the situation room, 0900.

94
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:10,271
Yes, sir. Copy that.

95
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,190
We need to expose what Hank's up to

96
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,983
before he drops a hammer on the Legends.

97
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,805
Did... did you just call me "babe"?

98
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:17,099
Well, yeah, I was riffing.

99
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:18,672
I was trying to keep this thing afloat.

100
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,081
Anyways, now that

101
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,916
we are stuck with Hank,

102
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:24,202
we can't go through his phone ourselves.

103
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,498
With Ava gone, there's
no one here left to trust.

104
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,426
Well, there's one person we can trust.

105
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:36,706
Gary, we need to talk.

106
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,892
Is this about what happened
between Sara and Ava?

107
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:41,320
Wait, you're working at the Bureau?

108
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:43,438
Yes, and...

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,332
I need you to do something for me.

110
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:47,225
And you're my boss,

111
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,553
which is great, you know,

112
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:50,385
I'm happy for you. No
one deserves it more.

113
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:52,447
Damn it, Gary. Focus.

114
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,708
Hank is causing total chaos here.

115
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,068
Did you notice him using
Director Sharpe's mug, too?

116
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,528
You know, I was gonna say something.

117
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,288
It goes much deeper than that.

118
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,669
Mona was right.

119
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:03,866
Hank is running some secret project.

120
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,508
And now that he's in
charge of the Bureau,

121
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:07,318
he's trying to shut down the Legends.

122
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:09,501
Nate and I cloned his phone.
We're gonna keep him busy.

123
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:10,673
You need to go through his activity,

124
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:12,275
find out what he's been up to, so we can

125
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,412
end his time at the Bureau.

126
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:16,546
Use this to stay in touch
without being monitored, okay?

127
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,549
I've always wanted to
untangle a conspiracy.

128
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,476
I'll need a bulletin board, index cards.

129
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,518
I already have yarn. I've
been getting into crochet.

130
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,805
- Yeah, me too.
- We should start a club.

131
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,741
We'll talk.

132
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:29,267
Okay.

133
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,732
Konane, no!

134
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,597
Grr.

135
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:51,664
Kid.

136
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,916
You okay in there?

137
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,089
Sorry, I, uh, never used a
future tech toilet before.

138
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,427
- So many buttons.
- Mm.

139
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,638
Give it time. You'll
learn to live with it.

140
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,358
Oh, uh, don't touch the red button.

141
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:14,195
Oh, uh, Captain, I
wanted to talk to you.

142
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,866
Good. I need to talk to you, too.

143
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:18,029
So as far as the Bureau's
concerned, you're a fugitive.

144
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:20,312
I need you to stay on the ship
and not draw any attention.

145
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:23,856
It's not just that. Um,
when we were in Mexico...

146
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,491
No, when we were in Mexico,
a man got murdered by Konane

147
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,950
because you said we could trust him.

148
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:31,379
No, Konane didn't...

149
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,748
He didn't mean to.

150
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,884
Look, Mona, whatever
it is, it's in the past.

151
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:38,219
Now it's on to the next
problem. That's how this works.

152
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:39,563
Mick, Nixon's supposed to give

153
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:41,086
his "I'm not a crook" speech tomorrow.

154
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,891
We need him back to
his lying self by then.

155
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,894
You and John stay on the
ship, look after Mona,

156
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:46,677
make sure she doesn't
get into any trouble.

157
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,679
Make sure she doesn't
touch that red button.

158
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,237
I'm telling you, I'm not crazy.

159
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:58,481
In fact, I've never
felt better in my life.

160
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,316
That's the truth.

161
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,410
Here that? The truth.

162
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:04,820
Something is very wrong
with the President.

163
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,365
And he's supposed to be at
Disney's contemporary hotel

164
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,548
to address the entire American
press corps tomorrow.

165
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:11,759
We'll, uh, we'll take care of it.

166
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:13,995
- I'll update the VP.
- All right, sir.

167
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,424
We'll, uh, start off
with a little sedative.

168
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,687
Ugh.

169
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,190
Don't know why you lot
are relying on my powers.

170
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:24,840
They're still all mucked up.

171
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,342
Look, it'll be fine.

172
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,064
We'll get him to the
ship, fix what's wrong,

173
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,488
and we'll be right back.

174
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,640
Now, let's see your Nixon impression.

175
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:41,607
Nice.

176
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:46,262
We got the cargo.

177
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:46,984
We're on our way.

178
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,747
Well, let's figure out
what loosed his tongue

179
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,309
and get the hell out of here, shall we?

180
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,065
Listen, you guys can't be here.

181
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:56,468
- The Bureau's onto you.
- Ah, good.

182
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:58,666
- Time for a pig roast.
- No one's roasting anyone.

183
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,108
And it's not just the Bureau.
It's my dad and he's got backup.

184
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:02,230
- Go.
- No, not again.

185
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,033
Guys, we're working on
stopping Hank for good.

186
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:04,926
In the meantime, you need to

187
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:06,452
find the team and stay ahead of him.

188
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:07,717
On it.

189
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:14,374
What's going on?

190
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:16,025
Nate's old man commandeered the ship.

191
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,268
There they are!

192
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,670
All units, converge on my position.

193
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:19,579
Okay, take the stairs.

194
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:22,282
Get Nixon.

195
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:23,817
Ignis-sa.

196
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,077
Ow!

197
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,330
We have eyes on the Legends
and they have the President!

198
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,907
They've gone too far, again!

199
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,160
Siri... what, uh, Alexa...

200
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,412
Gideon! Fire up the engine.

201
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,460
Legends must have bricked the ship.

202
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,771
Oh, they think of everything.

203
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,967
Nicely done.

204
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,096
I want our men watching every time jump,

205
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,765
listening to every comm.

206
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,688
How are we going to make
distance with five of us

207
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:56,599
and a kidnapped Nixon?

208
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,120
There. There's our getaway.

209
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:01,529
That's a bit on the nose, no?

210
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:03,399
We left subtlety back in Mexico.

211
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:04,940
Gotta go.

212
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:11,434
♪ Come on and take a free ride ♪

213
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,589
The Legends are in the wind, Director.

214
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,911
- Damn it!
- They must have stolen

215
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:17,530
a vehicle and hit the road.

216
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:18,738
You know what?

217
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,499
I've never needed a Waverider before

218
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,726
and I don't need one now.

219
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:23,920
You give me a dragnet.

220
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,173
I want agents at every

221
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:27,841
rest stop, diner, store
along the highway.

222
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:29,193
Move.

223
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:31,094
And you, set up a police scanner.

224
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:33,730
If the Legends so much
as forget to signal,

225
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:35,682
we'll hear about it.

226
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,089
They'll slip up eventually.

227
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:39,108
That's probably accurate.

228
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:50,581
Okay.

229
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,417
Captain, you should know that

230
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:56,345
me and tight spaces might not mix.

231
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:59,089
Do you think any of us
want to be stuck in the RV?

232
00:08:59,091 --> 00:09:00,924
Punch buggy. No punch backs.

233
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:03,919
Mona, the team's back
is up against the wall.

234
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,545
And right now, you are
a part of this team.

235
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:06,522
And if you want it to stay that way,

236
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:07,523
then you need to help,

237
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:08,715
not create more problems.

238
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:10,860
- Okay.
- Great.

239
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,462
Bob is struck with

240
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:16,874
appendicitis on an
all-new "The Waltons".

241
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:19,442
For all you lonely
hearts on the road today

242
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:21,923
here's a tune just for you.

243
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:26,375
You know, I've never been in
a car that's a room before.

244
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:30,570
Patricia.

245
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:35,092
No, I'm not Patricia, Dick.

246
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:37,294
Ooh. Camera.

247
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,296
Not to bother you, but
we've lost the ship,

248
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:41,706
drugged the President, and
I'm stuck in the back with her.

249
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,167
- Now what are we gonna do?
- We are going to Disney World.

250
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,637
Yawn. Haven't we been tortured enough?

251
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,422
I mean, we are going to fix Nixon

252
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:51,808
in time to get him to
Florida to lie his ass off.

253
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,477
We are not gonna let anything stop us

254
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,026
from what we set out to do.

255
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,355
Mick, watch our tail.

256
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,558
John, see if you can figure
out what's wrong with Nixon.

257
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:00,409
And Mona, find us something to wear.

258
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:02,811
Charlie...

259
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,562
We forgot Charlie!

260
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,231
Oh, "We'll be right back", they said.

261
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,608
Yeah, bloody right.

262
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,327
Mr. President?

263
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:12,237
- Oh, no, no, no. Okay.
- Mr. President?

264
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,256
Uh, quick, quick, quick, Charlie.

265
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:16,449
Mr. President, are you okay in there?

266
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,555
Just checking in, Mr. President.

267
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:25,032
You check in again,

268
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:28,437
you'll be lucky to be
guarding a shopping mall.

269
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,309
Um, okay, make your next left.

270
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:44,361
Okay.

271
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,747
No, your next right.

272
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:56,156
Hey, guys?

273
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,658
Looks like Nixon over there

274
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,380
is finally winning the War on Drugs.

275
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,125
Good God, I've been
kidnapped by hippies.

276
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:08,356
What is it you want?

277
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,303
Money? Power? I'll do anything.

278
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:12,147
Look, we're... We're here to help you.

279
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,743
Let's talk about money.

280
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:15,675
You know, right now we're your best shot

281
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:18,345
at getting back to your right self.

282
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:20,490
Oh, let's have a look.

283
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:23,826
Now, I have my suspicions
as to what's got at ya.

284
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:26,078
Yep, okay.

285
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:30,621
Vi veri universum vivus vici.

286
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,668
What the hell are you babbling about?

287
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,326
Oh!

288
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,828
- It's a roach.
- I've been bugged.

289
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,422
This is an agent of Ma'at,

290
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:47,707
the Goddess of truth in
the Egyptian pantheon.

291
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,185
You see, the creature,
it feeds off lies.

292
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:53,797
And whoever it eats at has
nothing but truth left to tell.

293
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,590
No wonder it found its way to Nixon.

294
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:57,509
You must have been a feast.

295
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:59,202
No, no, no... oh.

296
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,678
Sorry.

297
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,347
Put him in the closet.

298
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:03,866
Ugh.

299
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:06,109
- Come on, Dicky.
- Yeah.

300
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:08,853
Let's put Dick in a box.

301
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:11,206
Okay.

302
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,543
Um, Captain? Can we talk?

303
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:18,121
A lot's been going on and...

304
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:21,500
And a truth roach, well,
that's gonna be a wrinkle.

305
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:24,077
Look, Mona, I have a really
big responsibility for you.

306
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,307
- I need you to watch the roach.
- Me? But, um...

307
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,110
Your job was to take
care of creatures, right?

308
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:31,209
Who better than you?

309
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:38,591
Hey, little guy. Bet you're hungry.

310
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,571
Hank Heywood.

311
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,283
Renewed his Bestflix subscription...

312
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:47,892
December 16th... Hank Heywood...

313
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:49,269
November 27th... Hank Heywood...

314
00:12:52,324 --> 00:12:54,249
So that means...

315
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,114
Oh, my God, how did this happen?

316
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:03,550
I am way out of my league.

317
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:10,006
What is it, Jerry?

318
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:12,722
- No, it's... it's Gary.
- Hm.

319
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,295
I notice you're reading "Body
of Proof" by Rebecca Silver.

320
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:17,940
- Is that a conspiracy thriller?
- Book club's at capacity.

321
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:22,352
Uh, no, no, that's not it. It's, um...

322
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:25,114
I need your help
uncovering a conspiracy.

323
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:26,424
Why would I help you?

324
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:28,391
Because you might be in trouble.

325
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:29,579
Hank has his agents

326
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:31,862
taking fugitives out
of their cells at night,

327
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:34,105
and I don't want you to be next.

328
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:38,818
So I thought if I release
you for the night,

329
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,487
maybe you could help me?

330
00:13:43,617 --> 00:13:47,452
Hey, you okay?

331
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:49,471
It's not easy being trapped somewhere

332
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:52,141
where no one will listen to you, huh?

333
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:54,384
Hey, can you hear me?

334
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,189
You probably need air.

335
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:03,551
Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no.

336
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,178
What's going on?

337
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,972
Uh, oh, I just dropped it but it's okay.

338
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:09,894
It got it...

339
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:12,736
What... what's wrong with the brakes?

340
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,562
Can't slow down! Can't slow down!

341
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,072
Wasn't... Your foot, Ray.

342
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:26,366
Got it.

343
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:28,844
Who called the cops?

344
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:30,128
Cops?

345
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:33,515
I've never been pulled over before.

346
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:36,477
- What do I do?
- You just pull over.

347
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,341
Okay.

348
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:46,469
Just be cool. You got this.

349
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:52,317
Good afternoon...

350
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,037
Good afternoon, officer.

351
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,321
By the looks of your driving,

352
00:14:56,323 --> 00:14:57,922
you're having a fine afternoon.

353
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:59,399
Ah.

354
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:02,994
What is it? Drinking? Drugs?

355
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:05,363
No, sir, no, sir, no,
sir, we're just, uh...

356
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:06,957
just driving and having a little

357
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,945
steering wheel problems.

358
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:10,988
Tell me some more about
this steering wheel trouble.

359
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:12,721
Oh, well, it's a real doozy.

360
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:15,465
So I'm here with my family
and we're on our way

361
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:19,061
to North Carolina to see the
largest chest of drawers.

362
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:22,973
- Ray.
- Uh, uh, so the steering wheel

363
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:27,310
was a little loose and
so I turned to my wife,

364
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:30,054
Claire, and, uh, I said...

365
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:37,061
My friends and I here
are time travelers.

366
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,229
We've kidnapped Nixon,

367
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:41,941
and we're headed to Disney World.

368
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:44,253
Like I thought.

369
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:46,162
You're high as a Good Year blimp.

370
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:48,072
I'm calling this in.

371
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:49,616
Get this out of me.

372
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:52,761
Vi veri universum vivus vici.

373
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:55,806
Ugh.

374
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:57,839
How'd it even...

375
00:15:57,842 --> 00:15:59,300
Mona!

376
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:00,887
I'm at exit 244.

377
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,348
I've got an RV full of hopheads

378
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:03,772
who claim they're from the future.

379
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:06,341
See? Come on, son.

380
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:08,363
Let's go grab our guys
the old-fashioned way.

381
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,145
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait, I...

382
00:16:10,148 --> 00:16:12,306
I tuned this to a
frequency Hank can't read.

383
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:14,399
And I think I know a
way to contact the team.

384
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:17,531
It's a little old-school
but it should work.

385
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:18,811
I'll be in touch.

386
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:23,331
I can't have a ticket on my record.

387
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:24,383
I can't have a ticket on my record!

388
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:26,025
Yeah, well, nabbing
Nixon's gonna give you

389
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,324
more than a bloody ticket, mate.

390
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:28,505
Gun it! I'm bored.

391
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:29,824
He's right. Gun it.

392
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:31,107
But then we'll become fugitives.

393
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:32,125
We're already fugitives!

394
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:33,347
Go!

395
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,378
Hey! Get... you come back here!

396
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:42,001
Officer, we heard your
report from up high.

397
00:16:42,003 --> 00:16:43,211
Where are the offenders?

398
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:44,980
Uh, I was fixing to call it in.

399
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:47,001
You let them get away?

400
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:48,644
You're gonna have to
find another way home

401
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:50,257
because that's my car now.

402
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:56,099
There's a new sheriff in town.

403
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:57,607
Let's ride.

404
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:04,701
Nice moves, Palmer.

405
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:07,286
They're gaining.

406
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:10,548
Yeah, and I don't think
that's the cops on us, mate.

407
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:16,504
Whoa, hey! This car has no
airbags or traction control.

408
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:20,484
Exactly. Nothing but pure V8 power.

409
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,286
Whoa, okay.

410
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:24,947
We gotta lose Hank.

411
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,331
You got something for this, John?

412
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:27,774
I might, but I'll need you to get us

413
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,640
off the road quick, squire.

414
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,858
Absconditus Domus.

415
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:56,335
Where the hell did they go?

416
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,016
Nothing to see here.

417
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:03,217
What was with the radio?

418
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:06,029
The heat's heavy on the highway tonight

419
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:08,440
and that's no weather report.

420
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:10,701
Lucky for you, you're not alone,

421
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:14,896
because you got DJ Z to guide
you past those bad vibes.

422
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:17,023
DJ Z? That sounds like Zari.

423
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:19,951
Right now, the beat on
the street is to lay low.

424
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:23,362
But while you park it, here's
a hit to keep you safe.

425
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:26,699
All right, you heard her. We
should keep a low profile.

426
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,701
If we leave by night, we
should be able to make it.

427
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:31,037
In the meantime, no drawing attention

428
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,705
and no altering the timeline.

429
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:34,966
Well, we best keep that
bug bottled then, aye?

430
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:36,568
The only way to keep it contained is for

431
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:39,137
everyone to stay completely honest.

432
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:43,066
What the hell is going on here?

433
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,403
Checkers.

434
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:51,224
Maybe it's best if we
all just don't talk.

435
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:56,413
Now we just enter a command
line to a mirror site

436
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,865
and we can get into his email.

437
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,079
This email is linked
to a private server.

438
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:03,086
Must be where he's got his dirt.

439
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,330
We need a password.

440
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:08,258
Uh, or, we can reset it.

441
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,001
I forget my passwords all the time.

442
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:12,337
Those memory flashers
have a lot of side effects.

443
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:13,657
Password reset question.

444
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,625
Uh, we'll need some
personal info from Hank.

445
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,631
What's the word? Uh, sorry Gary.

446
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:26,109
- What's the word?
- I need some scoop on Hank.

447
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:27,848
Stand by, Gary.

448
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:29,568
Hey, Nate, we need to know the name of

449
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:31,189
your dad's childhood pet.

450
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:33,493
And whatever you do,
keep your dad off the FM.

451
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:36,144
I'm on it, Z.

452
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,484
Huh. That's a pretty cool trick.

453
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:46,112
You, uh, drink a lot of
Cokes when you were a kid?

454
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:47,872
Yeah.

455
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:50,208
My mom used to give me a
quarter for the corner store,

456
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,784
let me pick out whatever I wanted.

457
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:53,386
With her raising me
on her own, a quarter

458
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,764
was more than I even knew.

459
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:57,808
You don't really talk
about your childhood much.

460
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,959
Like, I'm not sure I
know where you were born.

461
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:02,979
Hackensack, in New Jersey.

462
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:04,556
Like the Billy Joel song.

463
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:06,154
We should turn on the radio.

464
00:20:06,157 --> 00:20:08,015
1973, great year for music.

465
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:10,445
Actually, why don't
we... Why don't we talk?

466
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:13,306
You know, get to know each other.

467
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:16,543
You're right, Nathaniel.

468
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:19,275
You could call me Nate.

469
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:20,995
Did you have a dog?

470
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:22,899
A lab.

471
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,909
Yeah, named him Silver.

472
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:27,987
- After the...
- Lone Ranger's horse. Yes.

473
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:29,697
Yes, yes, yes.

474
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:32,926
You used to show me old episodes.

475
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:36,829
Well, at least I taught you something.

476
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:38,849
Huh?

477
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:47,850
You know, my mom used
to take me on road trips,

478
00:20:47,853 --> 00:20:49,508
stop for ice cream.

479
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,938
Without Dad around, she
really had to play both roles.

480
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,506
She didn't know how to be a father,

481
00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:01,705
but she did her best.

482
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:06,117
Guess I could say the same for myself.

483
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,044
Um.

484
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:12,073
It's nice we get to make up
for some lost time, hmm?

485
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:14,217
But, uh, we should get back to the ship,

486
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:15,534
see if Zari's back online.

487
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:16,696
Actually, um,

488
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,032
why don't we forget the Legends

489
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:20,944
for a minute and go get some ice cream?

490
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:24,543
Fine idea, Nathaniel.

491
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,879
Nate.

492
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:29,098
Hey, Gary? The answer is Silver.

493
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,263
Silver. I'm in!

494
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:37,723
Hackers do say that in real life.

495
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:39,743
What is this?

496
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:43,580
Property deed in Hank's name from 1912?

497
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:48,067
What's this shipment for
dwarf star alloy from 1837?

498
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:50,995
He's using time travel
for personal gain?

499
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:53,072
That is against Bureau creed.

500
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:54,794
I have a copy in my wallet.

501
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:57,624
Shh-shh. Someone's coming.

502
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:46,551
Who was that?

503
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:49,220
Are you okay?

504
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:52,798
You have to take this to
Zari and stop digging.

505
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,012
I'll go back to my cell.

506
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:58,174
And, Gary, be careful.

507
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:13,699
I got an alert that someone

508
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:16,080
recovered your password
from the Time Bureau

509
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:17,674
and they're accessing your accounts.

510
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:19,700
But who would...

511
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:22,495
How would they even...

512
00:23:22,497 --> 00:23:23,847
Thanks.

513
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,524
It won't happen again.

514
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,523
You know, I was just
thinking that even though

515
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:36,629
we've had some setbacks,
that this road trip

516
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,792
has really been a great
bonding experience.

517
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:41,180
I think you're an idiot.

518
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:45,142
Well, look, we've
dealt with a lot lately,

519
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:49,947
and I think this is a very
needed chance for us to sit

520
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:51,440
and really talk about how we feel.

521
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:52,876
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

522
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:54,402
No, wait, I mean...

523
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:57,099
I don't give a damn if you're happy.

524
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,462
And I certainly don't trust you
lot in helping me face Neron

525
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:01,626
no matter how many "go
team" pep talks you give.

526
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:03,720
Well, you can't keep me down!

527
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:07,173
Actually, ever since I met you,

528
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:09,392
I sometimes lie awake at night

529
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:13,087
staring into the dark thinking
I am it, and it is me.

530
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:14,970
Also, I don't think Han shot first.

531
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:16,891
- I'm gonna go sit up front.
- Also I used the strategy guide

532
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:18,693
to beat the Water Temple
in "Legend of Zelda".

533
00:24:18,717 --> 00:24:20,145
Also, I really like gluten.

534
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:21,761
Well, I think it's a cool look,

535
00:24:21,764 --> 00:24:23,889
but the whole loosened
tie is a little try hard.

536
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:25,291
Yeah, well, you know, it's not like

537
00:24:25,293 --> 00:24:26,689
I went and loosened it myself.

538
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:30,205
Yeah, well, at least I
don't go make up my own

539
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,606
silly superhero names like
"Atom" and "Heat Wave".

540
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:33,917
Like I care what you think.

541
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,529
I want to grow my hair
out and look like Fabio.

542
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:40,331
Yeah, that... I think
that would be good.

543
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:44,594
So honestly, even as
much as I trust Sara,

544
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:46,620
this has been one disaster after another

545
00:24:46,622 --> 00:24:50,266
and I really think that this
time we are totally screwed.

546
00:24:50,268 --> 00:24:52,460
Captain, we're okay, right?

547
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:55,087
I mean, we just have
to focus on the mission.

548
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:57,465
Yeah, Mona. We're gonna be fine.

549
00:25:03,022 --> 00:25:04,805
Ah!

550
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:08,642
Of course we're not fine,
Mona. Nothing is fine.

551
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:10,811
And I am definitely not fine.

552
00:25:10,813 --> 00:25:12,944
Ava and I didn't just
get into an argument.

553
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:14,607
She asked me to leave.

554
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,650
And she hasn't answered
any of my calls since.

555
00:25:16,652 --> 00:25:19,653
And she was my one chance,
my one chance, Mona,

556
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:21,038
at something real.

557
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
And now I don't have a ship.

558
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,300
I don't have a girlfriend.

559
00:25:24,302 --> 00:25:26,619
And I am the Captain of an RV

560
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:29,213
and it is all your fault!

561
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,833
Well, I won't be your problem anymore.

562
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,050
♪ Baby she's gone she's gone all right ♪

563
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:42,393
Mona!

564
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:44,228
Mona, wait!

565
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,138
Mona, come back!

566
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:50,584
♪ What went wrong ♪

567
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,639
Mona, come back!

568
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:55,901
Look, I meant everything I said

569
00:25:55,903 --> 00:26:00,722
but if you stay here in
1973, you'll never survive!

570
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:03,892
John, get this thing out of me.

571
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:06,987
Vi veri universum vivus vici.

572
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:09,064
Ugh.

573
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:11,250
All right. You guys,
get Nixon to Florida.

574
00:26:11,252 --> 00:26:12,972
If you leave now,
there'll be time to spare.

575
00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:13,869
What about you?

576
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:15,116
Mona's out there alone

577
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,624
and we don't leave our people behind

578
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:18,750
no matter how much they
bug the crap out of us.

579
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:21,952
I'd say no pun intended,
but that would be a lie.

580
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:23,503
Hey, mate. Hold that.

581
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:25,005
What? What, where are you going?

582
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:26,902
Oh, I just need to
stretch my legs, squire.

583
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:34,513
You all right, Dad?

584
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:37,300
You didn't finish your ice cream.

585
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:39,519
Put on your seat belt.

586
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:41,471
What's the hurry?

587
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:44,474
The Legends' RV was spotted
just outside Richmond.

588
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:46,619
My men are setting up a blockade.

589
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,645
They won't get away this time.

590
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:51,940
That's great. That's great!

591
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:54,554
Whoo!

592
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:56,370
You know, this is what I dreamed about

593
00:26:56,372 --> 00:26:57,554
when I joined the Bureau.

594
00:26:57,557 --> 00:26:59,465
Stealing a cop car?

595
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:01,634
You and me working together.

596
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:08,957
Uh, yeah. Oh.

597
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,550
Ooh, you know what?

598
00:27:10,552 --> 00:27:13,003
Ooh, dad, that ice cream
is not agreeing with me.

599
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:16,297
Can you, uh... can you pull over?

600
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:33,999
Z? Z, can you hear me?

601
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:35,409
Nate, is that you?

602
00:27:35,411 --> 00:27:37,360
Listen, I need you to warn the team.

603
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:39,810
Hank's got a blockade on the
highway north of Richmond.

604
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:41,053
They got to find another route.

605
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,949
- You got it?
- Roger. Over and out.

606
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:47,254
There you go, hon.

607
00:27:57,716 --> 00:27:59,525
All right, what do you want?

608
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:02,102
- Whatever's fast and cheap.
- No, no, please no.

609
00:28:02,104 --> 00:28:06,815
Can I get six Daphne House
burgers and a round of sodas?

610
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:08,033
Coming up.

611
00:28:12,614 --> 00:28:15,899
Sara, hold up. Hey!

612
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:17,951
How do you even know
where she went, aye?

613
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:20,862
Bike treads went this way. We
passed a diner a while back.

614
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,665
- She's probably headed there.
- Hm.

615
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,292
Go ahead.

616
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:27,410
I know you've been dying
to say I told you so,

617
00:28:27,412 --> 00:28:29,120
so just do it.

618
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:30,772
Uh, it's quite the opposite, actually.

619
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,642
It's... I wanted to see
how you're holding up.

620
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,843
Honestly I'm freaking out.

621
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:38,646
With the Kaupe dead and Mona in the wind

622
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:40,898
and then there's Ava and...

623
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:43,235
What happened?

624
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:46,221
I... I went to go talk to her and...

625
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,983
And I thought everything
was going to be fine

626
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:51,726
'cause it's always fine
and it was bad, John.

627
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:55,155
Look, I just... I don't know
how to convince everybody

628
00:28:55,157 --> 00:28:58,604
that everything's okay
when I'm not okay.

629
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:01,111
Well, you know, if we were in
each other's shoes right now

630
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:03,738
then you'd be giving me
some rubbish speech about

631
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,782
how you don't have to
shoulder the burden myself

632
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:08,243
when I have friends around
me to help me carry it.

633
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:09,762
Not that I believe you for a second,

634
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:14,082
but that doesn't mean it's not true.

635
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:17,627
Thanks, even if you're just
lying to make me feel better.

636
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:20,347
Oh, I definitely am.
Hope it worked, though.

637
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:29,523
You all right there?

638
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:32,367
Uh, yeah. I'm... I'm great.

639
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:37,197
- Let's grab some tunes.
- Oh, no, no.

640
00:29:37,199 --> 00:29:39,983
Hey.

641
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:42,390
I just got a white hot tip.

642
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:43,796
The voice sounds familiar.

643
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:46,322
I don't recognize her... or
him. I... I don't hear gender.

644
00:29:46,324 --> 00:29:48,967
There's a smoky checkpoint
outside Richmond.

645
00:29:48,969 --> 00:29:51,035
If you want to make it to
your final destination,

646
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:52,674
do yourself a favor and take

647
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:55,613
route 301 all the way home, bandit.

648
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:57,142
Sounds like we're taking a detour.

649
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:05,161
Dad, dad, dad, dad!

650
00:30:05,164 --> 00:30:06,926
Are you insane? You
could have got us killed!

651
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:08,645
Ha! You're still here, ain't you?

652
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:10,349
Yeah, but we're going the wrong way.

653
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:12,140
Nope, we're right on target.

654
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,809
All units, Legends are
headed down route 301.

655
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:18,021
Reroute all units to converge
on their location now.

656
00:30:18,023 --> 00:30:19,981
Come on, I'm not gonna
miss a chance to get back

657
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:21,408
at the Legends for Mexico.

658
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,909
They're gonna get what they deserve

659
00:30:22,911 --> 00:30:24,609
for trying to protect that wolf bastard.

660
00:30:24,612 --> 00:30:27,822
- His name was Konane.
- What?

661
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:34,421
Wait, I remember you.

662
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:36,699
You're the one Director Heywood fired.

663
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,392
You're the reason that mutt got out

664
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:40,562
of the containment
facility in the first place.

665
00:30:40,565 --> 00:30:42,878
I said, his name was

666
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,547
Konane.

667
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,284
There's Mona's bike. Where is she?

668
00:31:02,286 --> 00:31:03,860
Where is everybody?

669
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,777
Yeah, I know this kind of quiet

670
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,239
and it never means anything good.

671
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:11,552
Everybody out!

672
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,805
- Mona.
- I'll do it.

673
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:25,194
I'll shoot!

674
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:27,092
The Kaupe must have scratched her.

675
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,570
Oh, she tried to tell me,

676
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:31,263
and I didn't listen.

677
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:39,770
Mona, put him down!

678
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,065
Come on, love, this isn't you.

679
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,090
Stop the RV!

680
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,667
Step out of the vehicle!

681
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,415
What are we gonna do? We
can't drive through them.

682
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,000
- Kill 'em. Kill 'em all.
- What? No.

683
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:00,989
- Yes.
- No!

684
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:01,909
- Yes!
- No.

685
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:03,153
- Yes.
- N...

686
00:32:03,156 --> 00:32:05,173
Oh, Nate's here.

687
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:07,057
I'm sure we can talk this all out.

688
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,278
Do you want to do the honors, Son?

689
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,761
Damn right, Dad. All right!

690
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:16,045
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll get you out of this.

691
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,121
Mr. Heywood, if we could
just talk about this,

692
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:23,315
I'm sure we can explain and show you

693
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,125
how this is just one
big misunderstanding.

694
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:28,695
How's that for a
misunderstanding, you pig?

695
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,448
By the power vested to me by
the United States government,

696
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,116
I hereby arrest both of you

697
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:36,115
on five charges of treason,
two of conspiracy...

698
00:32:36,118 --> 00:32:38,931
Uh, sir?

699
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,049
Mr. President? Are you all right?

700
00:32:41,051 --> 00:32:42,142
No!

701
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:43,218
These two men and their

702
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,053
co-conspirators kidnapped me.

703
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:47,047
They've besmirched my good name

704
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,541
and I've done nothing to deserve it.

705
00:32:48,544 --> 00:32:49,824
Uh-oh.

706
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,866
Well, actually, there is
nothing good about my name.

707
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:01,978
If you were born with
the name Dick Millhouse,

708
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,574
you'd grow up to be a bastard, too.

709
00:33:05,576 --> 00:33:08,026
- Ha-ha.
- What the hell?

710
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,819
Listen to me, Mona.

711
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,672
No one else needs to get hurt.

712
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:13,123
Funis Captis.

713
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:16,493
I am sorry about that, love.

714
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,304
Bloody hell.

715
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,308
Mona, can you hear me?

716
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,352
Come on, I know you're in there.

717
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:26,928
It's me. It's Sara.

718
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,483
I told you, Sara, I remember everything.

719
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:33,009
You pretended to be a friend!

720
00:33:35,364 --> 00:33:38,890
- I looked up to you!
- Mona.

721
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,995
It was all lies.

722
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,399
Mr. President, what is going on?

723
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,068
I don't know, but I'm
supposed to be in Florida,

724
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,253
lying to the press.

725
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:53,571
He ingested a truth bug.

726
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,490
See, these blunders are the exact reason

727
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,092
why we should lock up the Legends.

728
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,223
Oh!

729
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:07,302
Nathaniel, are you all right?

730
00:34:07,304 --> 00:34:09,012
No, I'm not.

731
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:11,640
I've been keeping secrets from you.

732
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:13,339
You think I don't know that?

733
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:17,094
But it's more than your
secret Pentagon side project.

734
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,377
It's always been like this, Dad.

735
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,300
The... the lying

736
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,404
and the hiding of the feelings.

737
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,360
Now that I'm getting to be
honest, I just want to tell you

738
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:25,428
that I love you, but you
just make it so damn hard.

739
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,206
Look, son, you don't understand.

740
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,568
And I like working with you at
the Time Bureau side by side.

741
00:34:29,592 --> 00:34:31,276
I've never felt closer to you.

742
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,069
But now I'm having, like, a hard time

743
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,696
even looking in your face.

744
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:38,241
Just tell me why. Why
are you doing all this?

745
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:42,245
Why are you pretending that
we are on the same side?

746
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,006
I can't.

747
00:34:45,008 --> 00:34:49,982
But everything I've
done has been for you.

748
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:53,298
And the fact that it's hurting
you, Nate, it's killing me.

749
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,468
But I want to make this right.

750
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,770
Okay.

751
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:00,897
You let the Legends walk.

752
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:03,057
That, or you lock me up, too.

753
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,727
Because if you don't trust them,

754
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,769
then you and I are not on the same side.

755
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:13,818
Stand down. The Legends are free to go.

756
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,446
From now on, we work together.

757
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,332
No more lies.

758
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,923
Watch yourself, love. She's
not in her right mind.

759
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:30,894
Oh, that's the problem. She is.

760
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:33,630
Mona, look, please stop.

761
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,058
I should have never
blamed you for everything.

762
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,012
Look, Ava, the ship, Konane,
none of it was your fault.

763
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:45,308
And I am so sorry that I told
you to ignore your feelings.

764
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,193
It was because I thought...

765
00:35:47,196 --> 00:35:49,312
Look, I thought that if I
could forget the way that

766
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,689
I was feeling, then maybe
it wouldn't hurt so bad.

767
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:56,361
Look, Mona. I was wrong.

768
00:35:56,363 --> 00:36:01,249
I was so wrong.

769
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:05,161
And you don't have
to bury your feelings.

770
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,557
You can let them out.

771
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:35,374
And if you ever need
a shoulder to lean on,

772
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:37,610
I will be there.

773
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,738
You promise?

774
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,365
I promise.

775
00:36:57,477 --> 00:37:00,427
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes, no, I don't know.

776
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:03,064
First time in my adult life
I told my dad I love him.

777
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:05,137
Years of therapy couldn't
even get me to do that.

778
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,984
Hey, speaking of, I love you so big.

779
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:08,494
I love you so big.

780
00:37:08,496 --> 00:37:10,291
- I love you so big.
- Aww.

781
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,999
Look, I don't always
agree with you, but, uh,

782
00:37:13,001 --> 00:37:16,160
if Nathaniel trusts you, then so do I.

783
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:19,121
You're free to fly if you can
get that ship of yours working.

784
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:22,892
Someone ask for lift?

785
00:37:27,507 --> 00:37:29,006
Ship was never broken was it?

786
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:31,250
Nope, it was Zari the whole time.

787
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:33,919
- Is she even your girlfriend?
- Nope, but I'm open to it.

788
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,846
Fat chance.

789
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:37,098
Come on your poor bastard.

790
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,516
Let's delouse you and get that

791
00:37:38,518 --> 00:37:40,276
truth bug contained for good, yeah?

792
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:42,731
And Nixon here has an
important speech to deliver.

793
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:44,947
Let's get you back to Orlando.

794
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:48,851
You know, the truth
really does set you free.

795
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:50,903
After spending a few
days with all of you,

796
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:52,455
I know that I can be

797
00:37:52,457 --> 00:37:55,958
a better leader, and even
more so, a better man.

798
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,278
Ah. History needs you crooked, Dick.

799
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:04,242
Who are you?

800
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:06,285
I really think I'm
gonna miss this thing.

801
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:08,638
Yeah, if I had to be
stuck on a road trip

802
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,223
at least it was with you guys.

803
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:12,308
You know, maybe that's what family is.

804
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,052
The people you don't
mind being annoyed by.

805
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:18,973
So you don't mind being annoyed by me?

806
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:20,757
Are you saying I can stay?

807
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:22,926
We could always use
another shoulder to lean on.

808
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:24,770
Besides, you're not the
first magical creature

809
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:25,822
that we've taken in.

810
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:29,266
We forgot Charlie!

811
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:34,730
Uh, Nate, hold up.

812
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:37,357
Gary surprisingly got
to the bottom of things.

813
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,409
It's not good.

814
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:40,027
Your dad's embezzling funds

815
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:42,505
for some black site
operation in Baltimore.

816
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:44,540
But he's not just taking the fugitives;

817
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:45,949
he's testing on them.

818
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,659
- But why?
- I don't know.

819
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:50,087
But I've seen this
before with A.R.G.U.S.

820
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:51,569
This is what they were doing to metas

821
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:55,250
to turn them into super soldiers.

822
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:58,479
You okay?

823
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:00,088
Yeah.

824
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,507
Now I know who my father really is.

825
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:04,610
Hank says he's doing this for me,

826
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:09,348
but I want nothing to do with it or him.

827
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,391
Hey, I... I'm sorry.

828
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:19,733
Um, yeah.

829
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:32,221
You called.

830
00:39:32,223 --> 00:39:34,924
A little late for a meeting.
This better be good.

831
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:41,380
When you came to me, uh,
I agreed to this plan,

832
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:44,557
because I saw the potential
in your vision and I still do.

833
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,810
Don't tell me you're
having second thoughts.

834
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:55,878
I mean no disrespect.

835
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:58,939
Um, I value the work that we've done,

836
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,825
and I understand why it
needs to remain top secret.

837
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:08,758
But I have a new partner now.

838
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,243
My son.

839
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:14,288
And I can't let anything
come between us.

840
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,286
What are you saying, Henry?

841
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,134
I'm saying that I don't
need you anymore.

842
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:20,344
If that's the case,

843
00:40:20,346 --> 00:40:22,271
I don't need you anymore either.

844
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:25,307
No!

845
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,426
You have to let me out of here.

846
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:30,804
You gotta let me out of here!

847
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,389
Gary!

848
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:33,783
Anybody!

849
00:40:33,786 --> 00:40:36,336
No, no, no!

850
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,446
No, no!

851
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:50,991
Someone help me!

852
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:06,223
No. No, no, no, no.

853
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:08,651
- No, no, no, no.
- Dad?

854
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:10,469
Nate.

855
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:13,013
What did you do?

856
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:16,016
What did you do?

857
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:24,742
Nate. Listen, listen to me.

858
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:26,318
Right there!

859
00:41:30,366 --> 00:41:32,824
I'm sorry.

860
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:54,426
