1
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,473
I am Knull.

2
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,349
God of the void.

3
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,852
Slicer of worlds.

4
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,104
<i>Long ago,</i>

5
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>when light invaded my kingdom,</i>

6
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,319
<i>my symbiote children betrayed me</i>

7
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,530
<i>and imprisoned me here.</i>

8
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,455
At last,
a codex has been created.

9
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:22,750
It is the key to my freedom.

10
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,878
It will unlock this prison.

11
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:30,257
I order you to search
the corners of the universe

12
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,594
until you find this key.

13
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,931
Find me the codex.

14
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,564
And when I escape,

15
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,942
and annihilate
every living planet

16
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:52,071
and destroy
my symbiote offspring,

17
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,281
I will reward you...

18
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,575
with your lives.

19
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,822
<i>So you're saying
in this universe,</i>

20
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,740
<i>there's these superhero people.</i>

21
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:37,950
All right.

22
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,912
So tell me again
about your purple alien friend

23
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,956
who really loves stones.

24
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,876
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,

25
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:50,379
aliens, they do not love stones.

26
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,672
- <i>Eddie, don't start.</i>
- No.

27
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,133
No, they do not love stones.

28
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,051
Do you know what they love?

29
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,138
They love eating brains!

30
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,056
Because that's what they do.

31
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,394
<i>Señor,</i> he made
my family disappear.

32
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,604
For five years.

33
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,858
Five years, huh?

34
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,194
Well, that is a long time.

35
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,822
All right.

36
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,032
<i>Eddie!</i>

37
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,326
<i>We are drunk!</i>

38
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,257
<i>We're home!</i>

39
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,259
<i>I'm so done
with the multi-verse shit.</i>

40
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,970
<i>And I like our version
of the barman better.</i>

41
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,640
Ow. My head hurts.

42
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,141
I feel like I'm drunk,

43
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,560
but I'm also hungover
at the same time.

44
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,812
<i>Eddie!
You want a Bloody María.</i>

45
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,481
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

46
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,070
- No.
- I don't want a drink.

47
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,117
Stop! You are destroying
this man's bar!

48
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,875
<i>Tequila!</i>

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,628
<i>I'm having the time
of my life, Eddie!</i>

50
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,464
I'd rather have
a glass of water.

51
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,882
<i>Be a man, Eddie.</i>

52
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,053
<i>We should've been a bartender!</i>

53
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,017
<i>- Tequila!</i>
- I did it.

54
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,143
I <i>did it.</i>

55
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,190
What the hell were those things?

56
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,901
I was born with them.

57
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,197
Freaking bar!
I'm done with this shit!

58
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,661
<i>This is Kelly Roulet
reporting from San Francisco.</i>

59
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,080
<i>Police are still
trying to locate</i>

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,790
<i>former reporter
Eddie Brock for questioning...</i>

61
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,083
Oh no.

62
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,128
<i>...after the tragic death
of Detective Patrick Mulligan.</i>

63
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,337
No.

64
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,589
<i>Detective Mulligan
was found impaled</i>

65
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,175
<i>amidst a series
of bizarre happenings</i>

66
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,677
<i>at the city's cathedral.</i>

67
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,387
They think that <i>I</i> killed him.

68
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,514
{\an8}<i>How long can he
evade authorities?</i>

69
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,016
{\an8}<i>Only time will tell.</i>

70
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,435
<i>If we are
on the news here,</i>

71
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:12,438
<i>we are on the news everywhere.</i>

72
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,816
Well, we can't go back
to San Francisco.

73
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,359
And I'm not staying down here,

74
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,154
hiding for the rest of my life
in Mexico, that's for sure.

75
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,447
<i>Where will we go?</i>

76
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,365
I don't know. I don't know.

77
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,537
Ooh.

78
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,498
That could work. Hey.

79
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,750
This judge got me

80
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,668
- kicked out of New York.
- <i>What a dick!</i>

81
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,379
Yeah, I still got a ton
of shit on him too.

82
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,924
<i>I've always wanted
to see the Statue of Liberty.</i>

83
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,177
Maybe we could blackmail him.

84
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,305
And clear my name.

85
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,389
<i>Let's go!</i>

86
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,684
<i>- Road trip!</i>
- Let's get the hell out of here.

87
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,395
<i>Keep the change!</i>

88
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,029
We keep our heads down,
and we keep moving.

89
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,909
<i>We are fugitives!</i>

90
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,453
<i>We are on the run!</i>

91
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,247
<i>Yes, we are innocent. Yes.</i>

92
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:16,502
<i>But I will eat every bad guy
that gets in our way.</i>

93
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,337
I need a Tylenol.

94
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,726
Do you hear that?

95
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,281
<i>Someone's in trouble.</i>

96
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,325
<i>And I need fuel for the road.</i>

97
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,409
Yeah, okay.

98
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,890
<i>That way.</i>

99
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,194
<i>Bad men, Eddie.</i>

100
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:29,032
<i>Are we the Lethal Protector,
or not?</i>

101
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,580
Do your thing.

102
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,747
<i>Easy-peasy.</i>

103
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,515
Jesus.

104
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,441
<i>Cute!</i>

105
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,234
<i>I promise not to eat it.</i>

106
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,113
They're fighting dogs.

107
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,200
<i>I draw the line
at fighting dogs, pal.</i>

108
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,417
<i>Oye, vato,</i>
you're in the wrong place.

109
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,961
Oh, hello.

110
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,546
This is our territory.

111
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,507
Well, I assume

112
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,343
by the threatening look
on your faces

113
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,262
that I oughta be scared, right?

114
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,893
But you took
the wrong path, <i>hermano.</i>

115
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,353
We can't let you leave.

116
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
I have a headache

117
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,193
on account of the fact
that I was drinking a lot.

118
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,277
I'm gonna be honest.

119
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:51,740
I have a really dark
and unpredictable side to me.

120
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,492
We all have monsters inside us.

121
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,369
Not like this.

122
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,955
So dark that it is highly likely

123
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,375
to tear your head off
and feed it

124
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,542
to your asshole.

125
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,419
<i>Or me!
You can feed it to me!</i>

126
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,963
Yeah, or I can feed it to him.

127
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,758
All right. Look. Whoa, whoa.
Come on. I got a suggestion.

128
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,051
No. Stop speaking.

129
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,136
I'm not gonna stop speaking.
This is for you.

130
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,389
I'm doing this
for your benefit, all right?

131
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,891
I don't have to. Okay?
So pay attention.

132
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,060
We're gonna find all of these
dogs loving forever homes

133
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,521
because what you're doing
is reprehensible.

134
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,315
What does your mother
think of you, man?

135
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,317
My mother's dead, <i>culero.</i>

136
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,694
<i>You made it awkward!</i>

137
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,362
I'm sorry to hear that.

138
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,739
Huh?

139
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,415
I'm giving you a chance.

140
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,792
Sweetie, I really am
giving you a chance.

141
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,168
You should probably take it.

142
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,302
<i>Say when.</i>

143
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,720
When.

144
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,189
<i>Hola,</i> bitches.

145
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:29,546
Oh!

146
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,008
Who's a bad boy?

147
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,100
Now that's
some sturdy footwear!

148
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,355
Where you going?

149
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,191
Home.

150
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,359
Nah.

151
00:10:58,909 --> 00:10:59,993
What...

152
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,079
are you?

153
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,749
We are...

154
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,417
We are Venom!

155
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,086
We are...

156
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,796
- Venom!
- No!

157
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,214
- Oh!
- Yeah.

158
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,423
- We...
- We...

159
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,259
are Venom.

160
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,095
What?

161
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,182
We are totally gonna
need to work on that.

162
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,110
<i>That was delicious!</i>

163
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,945
You're welcome.

164
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,488
Thank you.

165
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,282
<i>You take me
to all the finest places!</i>

166
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,118
Let's get the hell out of here.

167
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,494
Where's my shoe?

168
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,830
Oh, hey, buddy!

169
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,124
That's my shoe!
That's my shoe. That's my shoe!

170
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,792
Give me my shoe.

171
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,259
<i>These will fit.</i>

172
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,219
Now we are on the run

173
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,221
for something
we actually did do.

174
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,807
And I got stuck with a superhero
who can't fly.

175
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:04,891
<i>Wanna bet?</i>

176
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,085
There you are.

177
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,048
Get me General Strickland.

178
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:57,903
What the...?

179
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,871
Viral shedding.

180
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,832
These things wanna live.

181
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,093
Tell me about the man
who was just here.

182
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,893
He was acting, like, crazy.
Talking to himself.

183
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,062
What was he saying?

184
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,401
He had these big,
massive, wild arms.

185
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,861
They were bobbling like this.

186
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,365
Bring him.

187
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,386
<i>You think there are
another brother and sister</i>

188
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,637
<i>on one of those stars...</i>

189
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,057
looking at the same sky?

190
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,017
I'll be able to tell you
one day.

191
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,606
My twin brother...

192
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,567
a future NASA scientist.

193
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,111
One day.

194
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,908
When thunder roars,
head indoors.

195
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,719
No!

196
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,377
<i>He's on life support.</i>

197
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,796
<i>Get him
to emergency symbiosis now.</i>

198
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,603
It should be you.

199
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,357
<i>This just came across
our news desk</i>

200
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,441
<i>and it bears repeating:</i>

201
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,944
<i>For all of you alien enthusiasts
out there, it's a sad day.</i>

202
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,948
<i>Washington has finally announced
the decommissioning of Area 51.</i>

203
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,659
<i>The controversial site is famous</i>

204
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,994
<i>for its alleged testing
on aliens.</i>

205
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,454
<i>In other news today...</i>

206
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,387
Right this way. Come on up.

207
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,820
Strickland.

208
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,530
<i>Strickland authorized.</i>

209
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,089
- It's finally happening, then.
- Yeah.

210
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,135
Yes, ma'am. Be nothing left
but rock and dust.

211
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,886
And roaches.

212
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,305
Even the biggest of bangs
couldn't kill 'em.

213
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,517
They've been around 280 million
years. And counting.

214
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,893
I did not know that, Dr. Paine.

215
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,277
Good to go.

216
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,903
- Have a good one, Gus.
- You too.

217
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,064
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

218
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,281
Morning, Dr. Paine,
we'll keep 'em safe for you.

219
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,200
I still don't think anyone
wants my old beater, Jim.

220
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,993
Never judge a book by its cover.

221
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,167
Early morning wake-up,
General Strickland.

222
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,586
Looks like
all your dreams came true.

223
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,838
I know how that must bug you.

224
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,050
He arrived shortly
before you did.

225
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,885
Did our new friend
give him any trouble?

226
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,720
You see,
that's exactly the problem.

227
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,805
What?

228
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,348
Your assumption
we're meeting friends.

229
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,101
- Morning.
- Good morning.

230
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,687
The bonding was successful.

231
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,897
I heard.

232
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,195
You always have this
look on your face

233
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,613
like something terrible
is imminent.

234
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:34,823
Because in my line of work

235
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,991
something terrible
<i>is</i> always imminent.

236
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,494
We contain them, you study them.

237
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,079
It's how it works.

238
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,504
Let's have a look.

239
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,339
- Hello, doctor.
- Morning.

240
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,591
His other symbiote
left him for dead.

241
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,303
<i>We saved him.</i>

242
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,555
He would have died.

243
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,434
Oh, try lowering those levels.

244
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,693
Morning, Sadie.

245
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,152
Let me get that.

246
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,904
We got this down in Mexico.

247
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,198
Hi. Welcome.

248
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,868
Any more on
where the rest of him is?

249
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,412
- We're gettin' there.
- Update me as you have it.

250
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,291
I don't get this obsession.

251
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,710
I told you.
My mom made me this pin.

252
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,878
It's July.

253
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,547
- I'll see you in there.
- Mm-mm.

254
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,466
Everyone on this side...

255
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,177
is weird.

256
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,721
Leave her alone, Rex.

257
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,807
God forbid anyone should
actually enjoy their work.

258
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,032
Area 51 will be
fully decommissioned

259
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,366
by the end of the week.

260
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,910
It's just a shipwreck anyway,

261
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,745
and they're tired
of the tourists.

262
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,164
But we don't exist down here.

263
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,624
A hundred feet subsurface...

264
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,251
undetectable to any human...

265
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,420
or nonhuman.

266
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,881
No one's phoning home from here.

267
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,341
My brother's greatest ambition

268
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,260
was to work up there at 51
doing what I do.

269
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,512
And I wish
I could have shown him

270
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,764
what we've built down here.

271
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,227
<i>You're okay.</i>

272
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:29,979
<i>Just...</i>

273
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,358
<i>try to breathe. Okay?</i>

274
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,444
When my brother
and I were kids

275
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,948
they told us that UFOs were just
weather balloons, space trash.

276
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,242
Kubrick directed the moon
landing in a Hollywood studio.

277
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,453
Cool story.

278
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,538
Where are you going? This first.

279
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,332
Is there an increased risk
of exposure?

280
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,502
It's not us I'm worried about.

281
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,046
You know we carry all kinds
of viruses and bacteria

282
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,756
that could be harmful
to a sensitive lifeform.

283
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,425
And we don't know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

284
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,719
As long as we're keeping
the guests safe.

285
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,395
This is the first time
we've had a host

286
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,854
compatible with
one of our symbiotes.

287
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,856
And now we'll be able
to talk to one.

288
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,193
<i>Monsters.</i>

289
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,545
He's been experiencing panic
surges since we bonded him.

290
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,464
You try "Jingle Bells"?
So soothing.

291
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,675
Wow, why didn't <i>I</i> think of that?

292
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,012
Release him.

293
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,726
<i>Monsters.</i>

294
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,939
<i>I'm Dr. Paine. Teddy.</i>

295
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,525
You're safe here.

296
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,110
We're gonna help you.

297
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,654
Both of you.

298
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,658
The transfer was successful.

299
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,077
We had no choice.

300
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,787
We had to try and save you.

301
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,629
<i>Monsters.</i>

302
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,930
<i>You're broken too.</i>

303
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:37,940
<i>May I...?</i>

304
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,696
<i>May I ask you some questions?</i>

305
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,412
Is the symbiote
communicating with you?

306
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,249
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

307
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,129
Sound distresses them.

308
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:03,883
<i>Okay.</i>

309
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,597
<i>- Why are they here?
- What do they want?</i>

310
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,890
<i>Safe haven.</i>

311
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,600
<i>Safe haven?</i>

312
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,352
<i>We were running.</i>

313
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,646
<i>Is he talking
about the other symbiotes?</i>

314
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,147
<i>I think so.</i>

315
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,443
His creatures
search the universe for us.

316
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,904
<i>But we will be found.</i>

317
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:30,451
<i>And when we are,
he will kill us all.</i>

318
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:33,663
Who?

319
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,957
<i>There will be nothing left.</i>

320
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,459
<i>Here? On Earth?</i>

321
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,297
Why were they running?

322
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,760
<i>Because there is a dark,</i>

323
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,972
<i>cold sea</i>

324
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,349
<i>around this universe.</i>

325
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,851
<i>What is it?</i>

326
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,861
<i>You don't wanna know.</i>

327
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,831
<i>I've seen the future.</i>

328
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,767
<i>The darkness</i>

329
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:42,398
<i>has teeth.</i>

330
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,863
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

331
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:52,867
<i>We are currently cruising
at a comfortable 31,000 feet.</i>

332
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,661
<i>If you look out there
to your left just now,</i>

333
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,955
<i>you'll see the Grand Canyon.</i>

334
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,500
<i>Told you we could fly.</i>

335
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,960
Oh my God!

336
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,337
<i>Direct to New York.</i>

337
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,297
My mouth is so dry!

338
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,049
<i>And we clear your name.</i>

339
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,218
It's so unpleasantly cold!

340
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,596
How does Tom Cruise do this?

341
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:15,640
<i>He doesn't whine
like a little bitch!</i>

342
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,861
<i>What was that?</i>

343
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,407
<i>What is that?</i>

344
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,201
Oh fuck!

345
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,977
I'm sorry, Eddie,
but I got to disappear.

346
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,020
- What, now?
- <i>We're in deep shit!</i>

347
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,358
Why did you do that?

348
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,652
<i>I will explain.</i>

349
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,446
No! No!

350
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,910
No! No!

351
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,126
I'm gonna go ahead and say that

352
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,712
this is the shittest hangover
of all time.

353
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,089
<i>Look at it, Eddie.</i>

354
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,883
<i>Isn't it just astonishing?</i>

355
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,302
Oh, shut up.

356
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:37,054
<i>I don't think
I mind living here forever.</i>

357
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,558
We just came face-to-face
with a literal death machine.

358
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,185
Forever seems pretty optimistic.

359
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,319
[OVER RADIO] <i>With the
decommissioning of Area 51,</i>

360
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:54,905
<i>will the Pentagon finally admit
that they've been holding UAPs?</i>

361
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,908
That's "unidentified aerial
phenomena" to you.

362
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,368
Yeah, Dad, we know.

363
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,121
What I wouldn't give to see
who built one of those things.

364
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,998
That's why we cashed in
our savings

365
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,958
and came on this
road trip, babe.

366
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,835
So you could finally
get to see--

367
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,003
That it's bullshit?

368
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,504
Yeah, well, what if I'm right?

369
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,173
Then I really hope
we don't end up

370
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,300
in an alien space lab
with probes up our asses.

371
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,344
Or dead.

372
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,678
"Asses."

373
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,476
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

374
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,190
Kicked up some gravel there.

375
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,192
- Hang tight, family.
- You good?

376
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,194
That was wild!

377
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,862
- Did the dog vomit?
- Yeah.

378
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,377
<i>Okay!</i>

379
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,795
<i>We've got this.</i>

380
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:53,214
<i>Soft landing. Bend your knees.</i>

381
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,383
<i>Engage your core.
Engage your core!</i>

382
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,553
<i>Yes! Yes, that's it!
Yes. That's it!</i>

383
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,723
Whoa!

384
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,058
<i>Well done.</i>

385
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,684
That was terrifying.

386
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,355
Uh, this is not New York.

387
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,940
No, this is a wasteland.

388
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,775
<i>I'm detecting
passive aggression.</i>

389
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:13,859
- Are you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

390
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,654
Oh, I'm sorry. How about
some <i>active</i> aggression?

391
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,698
You just threw me off a 757

392
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,826
without even
the slightest consideration

393
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,744
for my chronic vertigo.

394
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,621
It was an Airbus A320.

395
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,541
Was it? I am sorry. All right.

396
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,960
And what was that thing?

397
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,129
That thing
that we just juiced back there?

398
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,713
You're not going to like this.

399
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,591
No, I can absolutely guarantee
you that I'm not gonna.

400
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,178
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

401
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,180
That's er... You're being weird.
That's creepy.

402
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,015
That was a Xenophage.

403
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,100
A what?

404
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,852
A Xenophage.

405
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,979
- A symbiote hunter.
- Of course.

406
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,857
Problem is, if she has found
her way here,

407
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,483
others will soon follow.

408
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,734
"Others"?

409
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,530
The Xenophage's maker
also created us symbiotes.

410
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,157
So that's your sister.

411
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,493
All the symbiotes turned on him,
locked him up on Klyntar.

412
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,703
- Your planet.
- No!

413
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,455
- Not a planet.
- Not your planet.

414
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,498
A prison we built for him
to sleep...

415
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,459
- Of course.
- ...for eternity!

416
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,210
What's his name, then?

417
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,338
I didn't hear a word you said.

418
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,465
Knull.

419
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,716
- Knull.
- No!

420
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,468
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

421
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,473
This is serious, Eddie.

422
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,807
Let's just not talk.

423
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,852
Quiet.

424
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:37,318
<i>What does this
Xyla-Xyn-Xyn-thingy,</i>

425
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,278
this symbiote hunter,
want with you anyway?

426
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,948
It doesn't. It wants us.
We have something it needs.

427
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:47,745
We only have this shitty shirt,
we got one boot and sunburn.

428
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,455
And the codex.

429
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,664
The what, now?

430
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,124
I'll show you.

431
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,878
Damn it, what are you doing?

432
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:59,048
<i>Let's say you died.
I could bring you back to life.</i>

433
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,216
<i>Well, I like that.</i>

434
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:03,093
<i>But if I did,
our separate life forces</i>

435
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:08,057
<i>would become one single force
called a codex.</i>

436
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,934
<i>What the hell is a codex?</i>

437
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:14,230
<i>It's a key.
A key that unlocks a cage.</i>

438
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,940
<i>The prison on Klyntar.</i>

439
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,942
<i>It would
free our creator.</i>

440
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,652
Well, thank God we haven't died.

441
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,237
<i>Yeah,
except that one time.</i>

442
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,200
<i>Oh, no. No.</i>

443
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,452
<i>So you're telling me
we're carrying this thing.</i>

444
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,287
<i>That's why the Xenophage
is hunting us.</i>

445
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,581
<i>What do we do?</i>

446
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,166
<i>She can
only see the codex</i>

447
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,669
<i>when a symbiote
is in its full true form.</i>

448
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,048
Right.

449
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,883
You mean you can't come out?

450
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,344
I can do this. I can do this.

451
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,680
But if I fully transform,

452
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,474
the codex sends her
a tracking signal.

453
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:53,310
She'll find us,
rip it out of our spine

454
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,062
and free Knull from Klyntar.

455
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,689
So how do we
get rid of this codex?

456
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:01,694
As long as you and I both live,
the codex exists.

457
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,612
- If one of us should die...
- No.

458
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:04,738
...the codex would die.

459
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,699
- That's not gonna work for me.
- Nor me!

460
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,785
That Xenophage was fast.

461
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,620
It won't take long
for the feds to tie us

462
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,582
to those four headless bodies
we left in Mexico.

463
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,208
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we better go.

464
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,463
Ah!

465
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,174
<i>Four legs
are better than one.</i>

466
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,093
Be honest with me, buddy.

467
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:30,097
How fast do you think
you can get that thing to go?

468
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,599
Without killing it.

469
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,933
<i>Only one way to find out.</i>

470
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:37,730
<i>Don't scare him.
Don't scare horsey-horsey-horse.</i>

471
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,734
<i>Nice horsey.</i>

472
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:42,943
Hey.

473
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,486
<i>Nice horsey.</i>

474
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,865
<i>Surprise, horsey!</i>

475
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,492
<i>I love horsey!</i>

476
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,913
Oh!

477
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,544
Let's go. Whoa!

478
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,048
<i>Yeehaw!</i>

479
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,388
<i>Ride me, cowboy!</i>

480
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,432
You are an asshole!

481
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,601
I swear to God,
when I get off this horse,

482
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,062
I'm gonna kick your ass,
you mother--

483
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:27,613
<i>Now that's horsepower!</i>

484
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:43,879
<i>Safe haven?</i>

485
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,924
No. They're not here
for a safe haven.

486
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,302
How about a new home?
Evict the current tenants.

487
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,597
I think you've watched too many
alien invasion movies, Rex.

488
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,518
Have I?

489
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,235
They were running.
That's what he said.

490
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,028
Don't kid yourself.

491
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,780
They were always migrating.

492
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,408
<i>A meteor carrying symbiote life</i>

493
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,244
<i>crashes on Earth,
and they all survive.</i>

494
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:16,537
<i>Coincidence?</i>

495
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:17,871
<i>Give me a break.</i>

496
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,541
All right.

497
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,419
Let's go get 'em.

498
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,422
You're so desperate to believe

499
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,424
that they're here
for altruistic reasons.

500
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,051
Makes you dangerous.

501
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:43,230
We just intercepted
an emergency call

502
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,690
from an Airbus out of Mexico

503
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,192
saying a man jumped
off the plane over Sequoia.

504
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,153
We'll take the Osprey.

505
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,196
Eyes wide, Paine.

506
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,916
I can't feel my balls.

507
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,503
That...

508
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,880
That was horrible.

509
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,314
<i>Visual on suspect.</i>

510
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:29,568
Take him out.

511
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:33,238
- Collect the symbiote.
<i>- Team Six engaged.</i>

512
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,542
<i>Disengage harness. Let's go.</i>

513
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,882
Oh!

514
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:15,841
Oh.

515
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,139
<i>No! The codex!</i>

516
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,682
Can't let you die.

517
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,037
Where did that come from?

518
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,718
- <i>Morph!</i>
- Copy.

519
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,519
- <i>Time to go!</i>
- Hell yeah!

520
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,101
What happened?

521
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,644
<i>There's something else out here.</i>

522
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,813
- Something else?
<i>- He said this would happen.</i>

523
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,564
I just lost three people.

524
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,233
Can you collect any samples?

525
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,027
Samples?

526
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,883
Those were not feds.

527
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,136
Those were some
special forces shit.

528
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,512
<i>They were
trying to kill us.</i>

529
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:26,430
Yeah.

530
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:30,142
Yeah, great. Great.
So now we have the cops,

531
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,518
the United States Army

532
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:35,397
and some creature
from hell hunting us.

533
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,317
Oh, God, I just saw
blood mist spray

534
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,528
out of the back
of an alien's face.

535
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,831
I killed someone.

536
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,083
<i>They didn't
give you a choice.</i>

537
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,961
<i>You</i> didn't give me a choice.

538
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,254
<i>I couldn't get to you.</i>

539
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,424
Not in the rapids. A year ago
when you stole my life.

540
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,301
<i>We've been together
for a whole year?</i>

541
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,344
A year too long.
Just stay hidden

542
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,513
while we get to New York
without getting killed.

543
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,735
We need you to come out.

544
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,033
The thing you talked about,
the creature...

545
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:29,743
It's here.

546
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,664
It killed some people.

547
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,397
Wow.

548
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,777
He's so beautiful.

549
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,882
I sense...

550
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,303
<i>I sense my own.</i>

551
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,478
<i>And yet,</i>

552
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:43,483
<i>the one Knull seeks is not here.</i>

553
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,236
<i>Hmm.</i>

554
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:48,864
<i>What does he seek?</i>

555
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,077
<i>The black one.</i>

556
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:55,996
<i>Brock's symbiote?</i>

557
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:59,457
He's the only one
who carries a codex.

558
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:05,630
<i>The end is Knull.</i>

559
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,890
You need your suit.

560
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,392
Still worried
about giving this thing a cold?

561
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,479
<i>Venom carries the key
to Knull's freedom.</i>

562
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,107
He must never obtain it.

563
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,609
<i>Or your race will be killed.</i>

564
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,153
<i>You.</i>

565
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,323
And you.

566
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,074
<i>And...</i>

567
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,577
you.

568
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:40,624
<i>Everyone, everything.</i>

569
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,959
<i>How do we stop whatever's
up there from coming down here?</i>

570
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,794
<i>You can't.</i>

571
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,590
<i>He's older than the universe.</i>

572
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,176
He needs the key.

573
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:56,556
<i>Then everything will end.</i>

574
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,853
<i>How do we stop him
from getting it?</i>

575
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:06,191
<i>If the symbiote
and the host are alive,</i>

576
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:10,111
<i>then the codex is alive.</i>

577
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,740
And if one of them dies?

578
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,700
The codex dies.

579
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,119
<i>The codex dies.</i>

580
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:22,415
- Rex, you can't be serious.
- Oh, I'm game.

581
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,292
Destroying the codex
is the only way

582
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,169
it remains unobtainable. Right?

583
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,005
<i>Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you.</i>

584
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,340
Destroying it?

585
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,133
We have barely even
scratched the surface.

586
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:33,969
My people are dead.

587
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,348
Something is coming
that cannot be beaten.

588
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,475
I'm stopping
all this shit right now.

589
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,851
Science is sacrifice.

590
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,061
Teddy.

591
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,855
This is serious.

592
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,607
Listen to her.

593
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,447
Have you spoken
to your family recently?

594
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,409
Is everything okay?

595
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,622
Yeah.

596
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:50,462
<i>I smell wet dog.
And sausamages!</i>

597
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:51,796
Hey, friend-o.

598
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,423
You okay, there?

599
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,427
No, I'm not okay.

600
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:58,345
Uh...

601
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,347
It's pretty wild out there.

602
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,223
- I know.
- Yeah.

603
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,308
You hungry?

604
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,934
Yes.

605
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,019
Come over.

606
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,104
Thank you.

607
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:11,191
- So this is my wife, Nova Moon.
- Hi.

608
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,611
And these are my kids.
Echo and Leaf.

609
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,696
- <i>A lifetime in therapy.</i>
- Don't.

610
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,947
Huh?

611
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:23,203
Don't you dare! Wow.
How beautiful are your children.

612
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,413
And that's Blue.

613
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,541
- Who is a...
- Dog.

614
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,418
And I'm Martin.

615
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,295
- Hey, Martin.
- Hey.

616
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,380
I'm Eddie.

617
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,298
- Nice to meet you, Eddie.
- You too. Pleasure.

618
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:39,094
- Come, sit, please. Come on.
- Okay. Thank you.

619
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,429
Jesus Christ.

620
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,557
So, right.

621
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,975
Oh.

622
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,853
So nothing died on that plate.
<i>Namaste,</i> man.

623
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,022
- Thank you.
- <i>Hard pass!</i>

624
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,650
Oh, dear.

625
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,611
- Eddie, where you headed?
- New York.

626
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,695
Oh, wow.

627
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:58,780
- Yeah.
- All right.

628
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,866
Long way to New York
with naked shrimps, man.

629
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,410
Yeah.

630
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,662
We could ride you out to Vegas.

631
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:06,788
Yeah.

632
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,249
<i>These people are weird,
I'm telling you.</i>

633
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:10,500
That would be so kind.
Thank you.

634
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,584
You're welcome.

635
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,086
Of course.
Life's one big adventure.

636
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,546
Who doesn't love
making new friends?

637
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:15,797
- Right?
- Right?

638
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:19,092
This guy is so one of those
serial killer hitchhikers

639
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,052
from my favorite murder podcast.

640
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,221
- Ha-ha!
- Baby. Not now.

641
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,515
How has social services
not taken us away yet?

642
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,144
She... She...
She's joking.

643
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:32,021
- I'm not.
- Please, honey.

644
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,150
So we're riding
the Extraterrestrial Highway.

645
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,484
- Yeah.
- The whatchamawhosit?

646
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,028
It's the road
that leads to Area 51.

647
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,448
See if we can spot us an alien

648
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,616
before they shut the place down
forever, you know?

649
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,743
It's, uh,
it's my lifelong dream.

650
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,245
<i>We could show him
right now!</i>

651
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,329

Well, Louise,

813
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:21,193
I'm not sure 20 bucks
is gonna get us much

814
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,112
in the way of a motor transport.

815
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,617
And I'm not ever riding
an alien horse again.

816
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,370
So I guess it looks like
we're stealing cars.

817
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,997
<i>No,
I've watched</i> Rain Man,

818
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:36,751
<i>and in my infinite wisdom
as a celestial being,</i>

819
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:39,295
<i>- working the system is easy.</i>
- Uh...

820
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:43,007
<i>We hit the slots,
then blackjack, then roulette!</i>

821
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,341
<i>Bingo-bango!</i>

822
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:47,678
<i>Luxury ride,
Bluetooth sound system, AC</i>

823
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,222
<i>and the top down.</i>

824
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:52,558
<i>Because that's how we roll.</i>

825
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,602
Paris Casino
has a strict dress code.

826
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,691
No, you know what? It's a hotel.
These are my vacation clothes.

827
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,109
Get better ones.

828
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,236
<i>He's not wrong.
Look at you.</i>

829
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,948
Don't push it, all right, buddy?

830
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,284
- <i>Want a hand?</i>
- Yes.

831
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:15,331
I didn't mean knock him out.
What are you doing?

832
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:17,124
- <i>He was being a dick.</i>
- Yeah, but...

833
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,876
<i>Oh! Look.</i>

834
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,923
<i>We need a disguise.</i>

835
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:27,468
What are we doing?

836
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,136
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

837
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,262
Hi.

838
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:34,183
Oh God.

839
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:35,559
<i>Warm.</i>

840
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,400
Why do you keep
knocking people out?

841
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,902
What is wrong with you?

842
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,487
Jesus, why?

843
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,573
So sorry, buddy.

844
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,826
I am so, so sorry.

845
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:54,286
<i>Eddie! Yeah, baby.</i>

846
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:57,665
<i>Now no one will recognize us.</i>

847
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:59,500
<i>- Seriously.
- </i>

848
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,879
<i>You could get voted

849
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:06,590
<i>if anyone cared
who you were anymore.</i>

850
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,592
I've won
Sexy Man awards before.

851
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:09,718
<i>'Course you have.</i>

852
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,471
- Hey. Hey.
- Yeah?

853
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:13,722
The guy that did that?

854
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:16,350
I saw it.
He's in the arch over there.

855
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,768
- He's shitfaced.
- All right.

856
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:20,980
We are bad people.

857
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,648
<i>Yeah, we are!</i>

858
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,608
We're keeping these shoes,
by the way.

859
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:29,321
<i>We are so money,
and we know it!</i>

860
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,781
Welcome to the Paris.

861
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,241
- Thank you.
- No, thank <i>you.</i>

862
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:34,451
- Just sit on the ground.
- What happened?

863
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,540
<i>♪ Baby, here I am

00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:50,676
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

868
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:54,555
<i>Let me multiply that 20.
Let me quadruplify it.</i>

869
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,056
What are you doing?

870
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,767
No. This is all the money
that we have.

871
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:01,187
<i>♪ Luck, be a lady tonight ♪</i>

No.

<i>Smashing jacket!
Let's eat him and steal it!</i>

874
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,700
<i>I know Lady Luck
is on our side tonight!</i>

875
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,243
No, I would say that Lady Luck

876
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,037
is definitely
not on your side tonight.

877
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:20,289
In fact, I would even
go so far to say

878
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,374
that Lady Luck hates you, buddy.

879
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,294
- <i>I can't stop now!</i>
- Of course you can't stop.

880
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,420
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

881
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,588
<i>- It's like: Aaah!</i>
- This feeling?

882
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:29,715
<i>It's like all
of my problems have gone away!</i>

883
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,884

<i>Eddie.</i>

00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,391
<i>I need more money.</i>

886
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,063
But we don't have
any more money, buddy.

887
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,814
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

888
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:48,776
You are a sore loser.

889
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:50,819
- <i>You're a sore loser!</i>
- Oh...

890
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,989
I think you broke my foot.

891
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,742
<i>Ah!
Lady Luck is a fickle slut!</i>

<i>We should have played</i>

893
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:03,249
No effing way.

894
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:06,877
Eddie Brock?

895
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,296
Mrs. Chen! That's not yours.

896
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:12,174
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Eddie! It's Mrs. Chen!</i>

897
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,676
Oh, Mrs. Chen!

898
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:14,802
Eddie, baby!

899
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:17,221
Mrs. Chen!
Mrs. Chen! Mrs. Chen!

900
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,390
- <i>I'm gonna cry.</i>
- Me too.

901
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:23,018
Wow. What happened to you?

902
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,144
You look hot!

903
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,896
- So do you.
- <i>Really hot.</i>

904
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,356
- I <i>always</i> look hot.
- Yeah.

905
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,191
- Is the big guy in there?
- Yeah.

906
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,693
Do you like my dress?

907
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:32,278
I've been winning so big,
they gave me

908
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:33,529
a credit line
at the clothes store.

909
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:35,155
And then the penthouse suite!

910
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:39,493
Wow. You know I stole this suit
off a guy who pissed on me.

911
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:41,704
I knocked him out.
I left him in a bush.

912
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:43,664
Well, that explains the stink.

913
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:47,042
You could use my room
to clean up, and then we party.

914
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,711
Oh, that would be so good.

915
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,713
And room service.

916
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:53,215
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

917
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,103
We got him.
Positive ID on Brock.

918
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,940
CCTV hit,
the Paris Hotel, Vegas.

919
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,526
- Have we reconstituted The Six?
- Yes, sir.

920
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,320
Put 'em in.

921
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,669
The Six are en route.

922
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,254
They'll bring him in.

923
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:37,384
At this time, I'm requesting
control of the Imperium Program.

924
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:41,805
You have my permission, general.

925
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:55,652
<i>When thunder roars,
head indoors.</i>

926
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,631
Let's dance, baby.

927
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:18,133
- No. No.
- <i>Yeah! I love dancing!</i>

928
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,803
Are you crazy?
That thing will find us.

929
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:21,970
Don't be a party pooper.

930
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:24,807
No! Do not encourage him.

931
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:25,933
You know what, Mrs. Chen?

932
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:27,684
We are fugitives.
We are on the run.

933
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,396
So, thank you for having us.
We gotta go.

934
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:31,647
- <i>You're no fun!
- </i>

935
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:33,899
One last dance before you go.

936
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,025
<i>We never do anything</i>

937
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,235
- <i>I want to do.</i>
- What?

938
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,070
Just a little dance.

939
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:42,032
<i>And you gave away
my chickens.</i>

940
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:44,660
Yeah!

941
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,168

942
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,003

971
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:12,099
Area 51.

972
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:13,850
- Yeah.
- Huh?

973
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,185
Yeah.

974
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,272
We made it.

975
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,193
You finally got to see it, Dad.

976
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:25,862
It's kind of cool...

977
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,031
I guess.

978
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:29,950
Yeah.

979
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,162
Leaf.

980
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:37,040
Where you goin', hon?

981
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:39,501
Well, let's see
if we can't find us

982
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,378
something cooler. Come on.

983
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:42,588
Come on, guys.

984
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:45,007
Okay, babe.
Lifelong dream.

985
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:46,717
All right. Go, go, go, go, go!

986
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:48,885
I smell alien.

987
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,185
He's deteriorating
without his host.

988
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,187
Poor thing.

989
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:02,190
Put him below with the others.

990
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,609
Safer there.

991
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,813
Down, down.
Come on, come on.

992
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:53,200
All right.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

993
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,829
I think we're gonna get
a better view from up there.

994
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,333
Follow me, guys. Come on.

995
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,377
This is so exciting.

996
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,087
I can't believe we're here.

997
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:19,893
Wow.

998
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:26,400
Wow. Oh, wow.

999
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,569
What is this?

1000
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,374
It's all broken.

1001
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,168
So sad.

1002
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,099
Buddy?

1003
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,643
Hey, buddy?

1004
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,356
Oh no.

1005
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,233
Oh...

1006
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,401
No.

1007
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:16,074
Oh, my God, how many hangovers
can you have in one day?

1008
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:18,869
<i>Eddie?</i>

1009
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,167
Hello?

1010
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,129
<i>They did this to me.</i>

1011
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,008
<i>Mulligan?</i>

1012
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:35,177
<i>Why?</i>

1013
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:36,386
You're alive?

1014
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:39,431
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1015
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,393
<i>We're being hunted, Eddie.</i>

1016
01:07:44,186 --> 01:07:46,563
You have what he needs.

1017
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,985
Protect the codex
from dark hands.

1018
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:56,448
A symbiote army waits here.

1019
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:58,074
Free them.

1020
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,535
Protect it, Eddie.

1021
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:02,537
Knull...

1022
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:07,083
must stay locked away.

1023
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,256
Eddie, I'm Dr. Paine.

1024
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:16,968
<i>Where's my friend?</i>

1025
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,178
<i>He's safe for now.</i>

1026
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:20,847
Great news!

1027
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,099
<i>- Oh shit.</i>
- We're all done here.

1028
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,268
All of this
is out of your hands.

1029
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:26,561
This is my lab.

1030
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,897
No, no, not yours.
You just work here.

1031
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:30,106
Or you did.

1032
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,900
You, Christmas,
you're going home.

1033
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:33,860
And what about them?

1034
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,111
- You heard what it said.
<i>- Hands up.</i>

1035
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,947
The codex only exists
if they're both alive.

1036
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:38,406
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

1037
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,159
You killed one of my people.

1038
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:42,994
I'm returning the favor
personally. Please escort

1039
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:44,079
- Dr. Paine out of here.
- No.

1040
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:45,163
<i>- Don't move.</i>
- Christmas!

1041
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,289
Time to go.

1042
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:47,499
Hey!

1043
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,301
Big mistake.

1044
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:06,893
- Fire!
- Run!

1045
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,858
- Oh my God!
- Fall back, fall back!

1046
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:14,734
Go!

1047
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,992
Venom, run. Go!

1048
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:32,878
Let's go! Move! Clear! Clear!

1049
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,381
Release the symbiotes!

1050
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,549
Go! Go!

1051
01:09:45,974 --> 01:09:47,684
- Come on.
- Go! Go!

1052
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,281
Hurry up! Move!

1053
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,033
Get back!

1054
01:10:03,325 --> 01:10:04,284
Ah!

1055
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:05,660
Jim!

1056
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:07,996
Ah!

1057
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:20,800
Let's go.

1058
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:22,052
Take her down.

1059
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,621
Ah!

1060
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:56,836
Come on!

1061
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,970
Get the codex out of here.

1062
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,186
That's our way out.

1063
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,199
You,
break us out of here!

1064
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,414
- There's no aliens here, kids.
- Hmm.

1065
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,004
<i>Best shoes ever!</i>

1066
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:41,256
Whoa! What was that?

1067
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,762
- Okay.
- We gotta go! Move it!

1068
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,355
We are leaving!

1069
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,024
Move!

1070
01:11:59,024 --> 01:12:00,358
Move, move!

1071
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:04,904
- Dad.
- It's all right, kids.

1072
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:13,496
Aliens! Alien invasion!

1073
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:15,331
Alien attack!

1074
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:26,092
Motherfucker!

1075
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:33,183
- You two, get airborne!
- Right away, sir!

1076
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:34,350
On me!

1077
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,979
Hurry up, airborne! Move, move,
move! In the Hummers! Go!

1078
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,147
<i>We've got to get the codex</i>

1079
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:40,440
<i>as far away as possible.</i>

1080
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:44,986
- It's Eddie?
- It's Eddie.

1081
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:47,197
- Eddie! Hey!
- Eddie!

1082
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:48,740
- Oh, no.
- Eddie, Eddie!

1083
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,953
Martin. And family.

1084
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,001
You can't be here, Martin.

1085
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,878
Dark forces, man.

1086
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,481
Eddie, can you help us?

1087
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:24,651
I lied. Aliens are real.

1088
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:26,903
My best friend
in the whole world is one.

1089
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,238
He's gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1090
01:13:28,363 --> 01:13:29,948
Okay.

1091
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:34,953
- Don't... Don't be scared.
- Hi.

1092
01:13:34,953 --> 01:13:36,037
Wow.

1093
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:39,040
Pleasure to meet you.

1094
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,959
Thanks for the chocolate.

1095
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,419
You're welcome.

1096
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,805
Ah!

1097
01:13:58,476 --> 01:13:59,602
No!

1098
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,149
Mom, Dad!

1099
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,700
Dad!

1100
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,285
Hold on, kids!

1101
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:19,956
Hold on, kids!

1102
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,627
Eddie!

1103
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:38,933
He was trying to protect you.

1104
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,811
We are not the bad guys!

1105
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,774
Echo! Leaf.

1106
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:48,109
- My baby, my baby.
- Mom!

1107
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,861
- Thank you, Eddie.
- You're welcome.

1108
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,742
You gotta be kidding me.

1109
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,628
Get in!

1110
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:07,962
Run. Run.

1111
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:09,380
Run!

1112
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:12,383
Eddie!

1113
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:28,733
Go. Bring me that codex.

1114
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,447
What's that noise?

1115
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,699
<i>She phoned home.</i>

1116
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:42,997
Oh shit.

1117
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:08,022
- Jesus!
- Get down! Get down! Get under!

1118
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,483
Take cover! Take cover!
I got you.

1119
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:22,954
<i>She saved us.</i>

1120
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,374
There's only one thing
that's gonna distract them.

1121
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,583
<i>Copy.</i>

1122
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,672
- Get 'em back to their van!
- What?

1123
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,632
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

1124
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,220
I'm gonna round them up.
Have the chopper follow me.

1125
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,516
Go, go, go! Go!

1126
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,448
Go!

1127
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,118
He's leading them to a kill box.

1128
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,162
When you get a lock,
vaporize 'em!

1129
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:31,230
We're home. We're back.
Okay, okay. Hold it.

1130
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,441
- Run!
- Go, kids! Go! Come on!

1131
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,401
Hurry. Hurry, honey.

1132
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,111
Thank you!

1133
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,239
Aliens suck!

1134
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,515
- Light 'em up!
<i>- <i>Copy that.</i>

1135
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,195

Okay. Okay.

1152
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,886

1161

Lady Liberty.

Oh, yeah.

1163
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:15,890
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, well, we're going.

1164

We'll never leave
this place, friend.

1168
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:41,374
Okay, well...

1169
01:22:44,043 --> 01:22:46,879
I thought we were gonna be
the Lethal Protector.

1170

We are.

1171
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,887
That's what this is.

1172
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,273

1180
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,037
I'll never forget you.

1181
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,877
Don't forget me either, Eddie.

1182
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,170
No.

1183
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:34,672
Time to go.

1184
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:39,051

1199
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,354
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

1200
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:23,150
I just had a crazy dream.

1201
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:31,617
Buddy?

1202
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:33,327
He's not coming back.

1203
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:43,212
But I need him back.

1204
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:46,215
He wasn't meant for this place.

1205
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:48,008
You couldn't have kept him...

1206
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:50,469
and he couldn't have kept you.

1207
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:53,972
For your bravery,

1208

you both have the heartfelt
thanks of a grateful nation.

1209
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:01,772
Eddie, you're free
to start your life again.

1210
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:04,733

and in the last few days...

1212
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:08,779
consider it expunged.

1213
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:17,871
Just so you're clear,
of course...

1214
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:20,749
you ever breathe a word of this
to any living soul

1215
01:30:20,874 --> 01:30:23,502
you will spend
