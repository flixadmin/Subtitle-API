00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,044
We know only that
she has been captured.

486
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,175
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

487
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,569
<i>No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.</i>

488
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,291
<i>Look, your partnership with Thanos</i>

489
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,204
<i>is at risk.</i>

490
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,687
<i>Thanos requires your presence. Now!</i>

491
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,375
RONAN: With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

492
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,975
and yet you summon me.

493
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,975
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

494
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,135
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

495
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,969
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

496
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,851
RONAN: Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

497
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,895
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

498
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,055
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

499
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,366
Lower your tone!

500
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,561
I may be your...

501
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,651
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

502
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,481
The only matter
I do not take seriously, boy,

503
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,166
is you.

504
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,406
Your politics bore me.

505
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,695
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

506
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,442
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

507
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,055
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

508
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,889
if you bring me the Orb.

509
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,280
But return to me again empty-handed,

510
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,804
and I will bathe the starways
in your blood.

511
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,009
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

512
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,051
This is one fight you won't win.

513
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,964
Let's head to the Kyln.

514

ROCKET: If we're gonna get out of here,

515
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,560
we're gonna need to
get into that watchtower.

516
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,400
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

517
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,004
The guards wear security bands

518
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,527
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

519
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,365
Leave it to me.

520
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,370
ROCKET: That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

521
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,130
PETER: His leg?
ROCKET: Yeah.

522
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,362
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

523
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,841
All right.

524
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,244
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

525
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,455
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

526
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,655
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

527
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,895
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

528
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,415
How are we supposed to do that?

529
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,775
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

530
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,495
So, maybe you can work out
some sort of trade.

531
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,735
You must be joking.

532
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,615
No, I really heard
they find you attractive.

533
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,335
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

534
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,855
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

535
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,695
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

536
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,815
I got one plan,

537
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,015
and that plan requires
a frickin' quarnyx battery,

538
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,175
so figure it out!

539
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,326
Oh!

540
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,535
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

541
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,535
Now, this is important.

542
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,175
Once the battery is removed,

543
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,695
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

544
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,495
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

545

there were six singularities.

into existence,

ROCKET: Question.

1620
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,655
What if I see something
that I want to take,

1621
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:16,055
and it belongs to someone else?

1622
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,415
DEY: You will be arrested.

1623
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,681
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1624
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:22,162
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1625
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,367
No, I want it more, sir.
Do you understand?

What are you laughing at?

1627
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:26,815
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1628
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,683
What if someone
does something irksome

1629
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:31,002
and I decide to remove his spine?

1630
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,681
That's...

1631
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,041
That's actually murder.

1632
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,371
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1633
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,364
So... also illegal.

1634
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,207
Hmm.

1635
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,007
They'll be fine, Dey.

1636
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:50,881
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1637
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,041

Yeah. Me.
