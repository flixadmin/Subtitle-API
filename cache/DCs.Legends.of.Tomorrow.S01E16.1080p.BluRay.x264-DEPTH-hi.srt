DRUCE: <i>You've turned your back

RIP: <i>The Time Masters.</i>

<i>They refuse to take action
against Savage</i>

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,399
because he didn't pose
a threat to the timeline.

10
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:22,774
DRUCE: The Oculus not only gives us
a window into time,

11
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:24,061
but the ability to shape it.

12

RAY: <i>If the Oculus is what
they're using to control us,</i>

13
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:27,570
then, we need to destroy it.

14
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,447
(YELLING) Shut it down!

15
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:32,367
There are no strings on me.

16
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,245
He traded his life for ours.

17
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,705
<i>He was a hero.</i>

20

ATOM: <i>Savage still has Carter
and Kendra.</i>

21
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:44,713
This is a Timeship.

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,464
A little gift from our friends.

23
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,633
I no longer need
to rule the world.

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,886
I now have the ability
to change it.

25
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,926
RORY: What are we doing back here?

26
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,154
Savage has a Timeship
courtesy of the Time Masters

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,488
and the timeline is unclear

28
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:13,074
due to our destruction
of the Oculus, meaning--

29
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,826
Savage is lost to history.

30
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,162
Which is why
I've brought you all home.

31
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,663
Mission's not over, man.

32
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,750
Jax is right. We've lost Savage before.
We'll find him again.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,002
And then what? We have
no way of killing Savage,

34
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,355
<i>particularly now that Kendra and
Carter are in his possession.</i>

35
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,340
Assuming that they're still
alive, which is highly unlikely.

36
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,384
So that's it?
We're just giving up?

37
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:34,012
I'm on my way to the Refuge
to retrieve your younger selves

38
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:35,459
and return them to the timeline.

39
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,515
It will be as if you never left.

40
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:40,018
You think that we can just
return to our old lives,

41
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,104
and then pretend like
none of this ever happened?

42
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,690
That might be a tad difficult.

43
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:49,360
I had to bring you back to
May 2016, not January 2016.

44
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,697
Great. So what you're saying is
for the last five months

45
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:55,700
my mom probably thinks that
I'm dead. Thanks a lot, man.

46
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,704
Why?
Why the change of plans, Rip?

47
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,876
If you're getting back on that ship,
we get back on that ship.

48
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:08,713
In truth, I never left it.

49
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,886
I'm sorry
for all that I've asked of you

50
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,096
and that it all came to nothing.

51
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,558
I wish you all well.

52
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,234
I never liked that guy.

53
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,494
Hello? Hello?

54
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:43,581
Dad!

55
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,959
Hey.

56
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,920
- Hi, Daddy.
- Baby.

57
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,171
When did you get back?

58
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,506
I just got back.

59
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,800
I tried calling,
but nobody was answering.

60
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,552
I was at Laurel's
but she wasn't there.

61
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,262
Where is everyone?

62
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,267
It's Damien Darhk.
He's causing problems.

63
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,477
Good to know nothing's changed
in five months.

64
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,106
Dad?

65
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,317
What's wrong?
Is everything okay?

66
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,322
No, baby.

67
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,449
You're starting to scare me.

68
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,457
Damien Darhk was in prison,
and he escaped.

69
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:32,171
And everyone tried to stop him,

70
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,008
but your sister...

71
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,260
Honey, she, um...

72
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:39,762
No, Dad, no.

73
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,806
I'm sorry, baby.

74
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,975
- No. Dad. No.
- Come on, I got you.

75
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,393
(SOBBING)

76
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,520
I got you.

You idiot, we were in the clear!

79
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:00,857
BROOME: He was going after us.

80
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:04,829
On foot!
You shot him and wasted ammo.

81
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:05,997
Cops are coming.

82
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:07,308
You wanna yell at me some more

83
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:08,625
or should we both
get outta here?

84
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,002
RORY: <i>Neither.</i>

Oh! It's me. (CLEARS THROAT)
It's Ray.

88
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:21,842
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

89
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,389
I thought we should talk.

90
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,309
Drive.

91
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,024
You didn't waste any time
getting back to your old habits.

92
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,818
I like stealing stuff.
It makes me feel good.

93
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,071
Do you ever think that

94
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,917
maybe you weren't meant
to do this anymore?

95
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,992
What do you want, Haircut?

96
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,371
To apologize.

97
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,498
Sort of.

98
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:50,667
For Snart.

99
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,503
I was the one who
was supposed to die

100
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,712
and I can't help feeling--

101
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,382
It wasn't your fault.
It was his.

102
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,344
Son of a bitch never did
anything without a plan.

103
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,848
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he wanted this.

104
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,850
What are you doing
with your hand?

105
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:11,521
Maybe he wanted us to.
you know, be partners.

106
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,191
I think I'm gonna be sick.

107
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:16,567
I think Snart knew.

108
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,403
He knew that I'd keep
an eye out for you

109
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,904
and you'd keep
an eye out for me.

110
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,532
While doing what?

111
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,076
What we haven't finished doing.

Incredible. You've gotten
every answer correct tonight.

115
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,051
Since when did you become
such a history buff?

116
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,762
I guess I've developed
a passion for it recently.

117
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,098
During your sabbatical?

118
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,101
<i>You hardly ever talk about it.</i>

Martin?

120
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,357
I know, I'm-- I'm sorry.

121
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,943
My sabbatical was, um...

122
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:05,616
I left some
very important work unfinished.

123
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,121
The ship's not gonna
be here, Grey.

124
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:11,789
We saw it take off, remember?

125
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:16,461
Yes. And doing so
would've left...

126
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:18,546
Quantum signature.

127
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,853
That's what
I've been trying to tell Mick.

128
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:22,925
Radio beacon.

129
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,135
Quantum entangler.

130
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:25,303
Boring.

131
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,722
When do we
get in contact with Hunter?

132
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,401
PROFESSOR STEIN:
Ms. Lance, are you all right?

133
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,063
How do we get
the <i>Waverider</i> back here?

134
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,444
Hi, Daddy. We miss you.

135
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,988
MIRANDA: <i>And love you.</i>
JONAS: (CHUCKLES<i>) And love you.</i>

136
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,991
GIDEON: <i>Captain, I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>

137
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,078
Tell me you've located Savage.

138
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,830
<i>No. But we have received
a transmission</i>

139
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,916
<i>from 2016 Star City.</i>

140
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,354
I don't understand.
It should've worked.

141
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,851
Did you account
for sub-space interference?

142
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,591
It's the first thing
I thought of.

143
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,301
Did you adjust for
temporal polarity?

144
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,677
Raymond, you insult me.

145
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,763
Can you reach the <i>Waverider</i>
or not?

146
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,690
- We're working on it.
- We're working on it.

147
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,143
Actually, guys,
I think it just worked.

148
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,029
Ha!

149
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,995
I thought I made my intentions
perfectly clear.

150
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,164
And we wish to be equally clear
about ours.

151
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:37,875
Do you mind?

152
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,842
Just checking to see
if you're real this time.

153
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:41,462
JAX: <i>You're not ditching us again.</i>

154
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:44,632
When the mission's over, then
we can all go our separate ways.

155
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,634
And this mission is not over.

156
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:47,802
Yeah, just curious

157
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,196
how much headway you've had
tracking Savage

158
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,263
without all of us.

159
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,472
None.

160
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,325
But neither have I got
myself into bar fights

00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,898
Fall back!
Staying here to fight Nazis

321
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,525
<i>is exacerbating the damage</i>

322
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,443
that we have already done
to the timeline.

323
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,196
- But Kendra--
- Is alive, thankfully.

324
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,948
And we will rescue her
in due course.

325
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,575
I hope.

326
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,631
So this is a spaceship?

327
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,260
It's a Timeship. But, yes, it
does also travel through space.

328
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:33,345
You've seen it before, Mr. Hall.

329
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:37,182
That used to be my name.
Carter Hall?

330
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,160
There really is
rather a lot to fill you in on

331
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,728
and we really
do not have the time.

332
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,229
- What about--
- RIP: <i>Kendra.</i>

333
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,457
Yes, we need your assistance
in locating her and Savage.

334
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:48,110
Perhaps we can start with what
Savage was doing in 1944.

335
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:52,281
He said something about, um,
Thanagarian technology...

336
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,657
"Thanagarian"?

337
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:56,118
The Thanagarians are a race
of extraterrestrials.

338
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,412
He also said that

339
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,497
this "technology"
was actually three meteors.

340
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,460
GIDEON: <i>Captain, I have surveillance
footage which might be relevant.</i>

341
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,753
Thank you, Gideon.

342
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,132
JAX: <i>I've seen that rock before.</i>

343
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,884
Savage had one of those in 1958.

344
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,635
He took our blood.

345
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,054
He said he would use it
in a ritual to erase time,

346
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,390
take the world back to 1700 BC.

347
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,731
What are you doing?

348
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,298
Come on, man.
We gotta try it again.

349
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,877
That thing that we did
in World War II?

350
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,445
- It's called "transmutation."
- Yeah.

351
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,881
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>It's a similar process</i>

352
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,532
by which our uniform
materializes when we merge.

353
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,700
But at the moment,

354
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,107
we need to focus on figuring out
what Savage is planning.

355
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,455
Come on. Just the once.

356
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,126
Is that Raymond
and Kendra's lucky vase?

357
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,253
I don't know. I just
found this junk lying around.

358
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,214
Come on.

359
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,233
Don't you think that turning
something into something else

360
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,467
might come in handy?

361
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,471
All right. One time only.

362
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:58,764
Okay, just the once.

363
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:03,519
All right.

364
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,020
(EXHALES)

365
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,169
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>You need to focus,
Jefferson.</i>

366
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,612
Why do you always say that
like I'm not focusing?

367
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,447
<i>Just do what you did before.</i>

368
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:19,159
Before, we had a Nazi trying
to kill us. This is just a vase.

369
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,792
(SIGHS) Come on.

370
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:28,794
(SIGHS)

371
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,549
I never thought
I'd utter these words,

372
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,217
but I think we need a Nazi.

373
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,385
Not funny.

374
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,112
Look, the reason
I keep telling you to focus

375
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,972
is because transmutation
is a literal function

376
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,473
of mind over matter.

377
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,141
Dude, this sucks.

378
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:44,828
Why do I always gotta
be in the driver's seat?

379
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:45,936
Don't despair, Jefferson.

380
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,647
This is only our second attempt
at transmutation

381
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,192
and you know what they always
say, "The third time's a charm."

382
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,946
What?

383
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,656
The third time.

384
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,533
Three rituals.

385
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,743
I think I know what Savage
is planning to do.

386
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:05,789
(SCOFFS)

387
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,710
PROFESSOR STEIN: I've figured out how
Savage plans to erase time.

388
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,254
I believe he intends to detonate
each of these meteors

389
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,089
in a different time period.

390
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,133
How can you destroy the world
three times

391
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,135
in three different times?

392
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,512
You can't. It would create
a temporal paradox.

393
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:21,999
Which would result
in a time-quake

394
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,219
that would return the Earth

395
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,809
to the point of the first
chrono-thermic reaction.

396
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,019
Ancient Egypt.

397
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,478
JAX: <i>Okay, it's official.</i>

398
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,355
This is
the craziest bad-guy plan

399
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,815
in the history of bad-guy plans.

400
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,609
I don't think
that sanity is a yardstick

401
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,295
by which Vandal Savage
can be measured.

402
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,964
Okay, so which time periods
are we talking here?

403
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,907
You said Savage
was in possession of

404
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,159
one of these meteorites in 1958.

405
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,220
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>That was a year
of a rare alignment</i>

406
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,662
with the Earth and Thanagar.

407
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,332
Evidently, he got hold
of a second meteorite in 1944.

408
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,208
Which would be useless
to him in a year

409
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,502
where the Earth and Thanagar
weren't in alignment.

410
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,422
Now, if my math is correct,
and trust me, it is,

411
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:59,509
the next two years that Earth
and Thanagar are in sync

412
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:02,679
are 1975 and 2021.

413
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,724
But Savage still has to do this
in three different time periods?

414
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,270
That's the beauty of immortality,
Jefferson. He can.

415
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,941
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>He can literally
be in three places at once.</i>

416
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,375
It can't be...

417
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,962
It can, thanks to time travel.

418
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,298
And it's because of time travel
that I know you're here.

419
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,716
<i>You're out here tonight</i>

420
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:43,929
because you've felt an imminent
presence of something.

421
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,598
Uh, a meteorite?

422
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,392
And I am going to give you
a use for it

423
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,728
which will give us the power
to rewrite destiny itself

424
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,982
and change the course
of the entire world.

425
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,084
So if Savage plans on blowing up
the world three times,

426
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,253
- how do we stop him?
- We don't.

427
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,981
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>We kill him.</i>
CARTER: <i>How?</i>

428
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,507
We've always known that only
you or Kendra could kill Savage

429
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,635
using items exposed, as you
were, to the meteors' radiation.

430
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:25,387
Now, the radiation
works both ways.

431
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:26,994
It gave Savage
his immortality, but--

432
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,016
It also makes him vulnerable.

433
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,935
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>And Savage is about
to unleash the radiation</i>

434
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:35,230
from three meteorites
in three different time periods.

435
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:36,940
Triple the exposure.

436
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:41,278
Yes. Which should be sufficient
to render Savage mortal.

437
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,781
And then all we've gotta do
is kill Savage three times.

438
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,908
Indeed. Gideon can navigate
the <i>Waverider</i>

439
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,660
and we can split
into teams of two.

440
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:53,373
<i>One in 1958, one in 1975,
and one in 2021.</i>

441
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,961
Open it.

442
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,632
Did you know that this is
one of the original meteorites

443
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,218
which fell upon
the Middle Kingdom?

444
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,846
<i>Drawn from the ground
after millennia,</i>

445
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,640
<i>straight into Nazi hands.</i>

446
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,017
The object that has bound

447
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:13,810
the two of us together
for 4,000 years

448
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:18,231
has the power to take us back
to where it all began.

449
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:22,652
But this time,
I will be the pharaoh, and you--

450
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:26,198
Will hate you.
Like I've always hated you.

<i>All our teams
need to act simultaneously.</i>

454
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,089
I think that's a comet
or something.

455
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,341
SAVAGE: It's a meteorite,
point of fact.

456
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,177
I was drawn to it as well.

457
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:51,681
When can I kill him?

458
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,493
ATOM: We have to wait for
the meteorite to go critical.

459
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:54,601
When's that?

460
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,049
ATOM: When he starts the ritual
at all three time periods.

461
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,233
Um, we got a nuclear bomb here.

how much of a badass I was.

you don't have the money?

I was going to
sell a nuclear warhead,

468

and pay you out of the profit.

469

00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:50,019
Oh, my God!
This is an intervention.

637
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,687
Yeah, you could
kind of call it that.

638
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,190
Listen, Grey,
you were meant for more

639
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:57,860
than sitting around,
answering trivia questions about history.

640
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:02,865
Me, you, Firestorm...
We're made for changing history.

641
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,825
This is my life.

642
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:08,162
And your life will be waiting
for you when you get back.

643
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,206
You really want me to do this?

644
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:14,418
I could never forgive myself
if I kept you from it.

645
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,046
My husband, the superhero.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

647
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,202
Why are you
looking at me like that?

648
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,746
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

649
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:54,417
You left me a message, I came...
What of it?

650
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:57,586
I just wanted to talk.

651
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:03,592
You and I,
we've done a lot of thieving,

652
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:05,970
a lot of cool stuff,
a lot of fun.

653

(CLEARS THROAT)

654
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:13,978
Anyway, I just wanted to make
sure I said something important

655
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,731
that wasn't left unsaid.

656
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,776
Mick, I don't do touchy-feely.

657
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:23,988
If you got something to say,
say it.

658
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:27,783
This wasn't a good idea.

659
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,666
You're the best guy I ever knew.

660
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:41,297
You may not think you're a hero,
but you're a hero to me.

661
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:46,844
You got that?

662
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,972
Yeah, I got it.

663
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:52,475
See you around.

664
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:09,825
You okay?

665
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:12,036
Fine.

666
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:13,496
So, did you tell him?

667
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:16,123
That he killed himself
to save our destinies?

668
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,958
If it's any consolation,

669
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:21,962
I can always bring you back to
this particular time and place.

670
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:24,715
I'm fine. Just let it be.

671

RIP: A full complement. (LAUGHS)

672
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,835
To be honest, I had my doubts
that all of you would be willing

673
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,028
to throw in with me
for a second go.

674
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,989
- Well, actually--
- We're not coming with you.

675
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,702
With Savage gone, we wanna start fresh.
See what happens.

676
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,621
I give it three months. Tops.

677
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:58,541
Look, I just...

678
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,294
I wanna say thank you
to all of you.

679
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,048
- Ray, I--
- No.

680
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,551
This is... It's meant to be.

681
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,137
I wish both of you
nothing but the best.

682
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:21,480
Be safe.

683
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,899
See you guys around.

Every time they do that,
I get hungry for chicken.

685
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,917

it's not slowing down!

Get down!

What the hell's going on?

692
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:08,569
To be honest, Mr. Jackson,
I have absolutely no idea.

693
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,119
Is this 2016?

694

Is this May 2016?

695
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:23,876
Yeah.

696
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:25,563
You're exactly
where you said you'd be.

697
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:29,298
Do not get on that ship.

698
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,135
If you do, you're all dead.

699

700
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,308
Says you, Mr. Rory. You sent me.

701
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:43,646
I'm sorry. Who exactly are you?
