Subs collected, corrected and if necessary re-synced by Tronar for
"Breaking Bad Season 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 + Extras BDRip DVDRip HDTV TSV"

2
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,485
These people.

3
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,068
Pathetic.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,239
I already read that one anyway.

5
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,409
Kleinman has better magazines.

6
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,824
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

7
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,449
We won't even get the results
till next week.

8
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,242
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

9
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,168
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:53,463
You definitely want the PET/CT
and not just the PET.

11
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,130
Yeah, it's a PET/CT.

12
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,805
Good. That's what you want.

13
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,352
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

14
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,395
I'm not naming any names.

15
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,652
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

16
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,523
This is where Walt's doctor is.

17
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,409
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week...

18
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,361
...to get the results.

19
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,532
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

20
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,325
I could take one look at Walt's...

21
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,872
...and tell you immediately
how he's doing.

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,872
- Really.
- Doctors like people to think...

23
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,539
...that they're so much smarter
than the technicians...

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,887
...but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

25
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:43,394
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

26
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,645
Excuse me.

27
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,783
You all right in there?

28
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,823
Yeah.

29
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,208
Hey, you okay?

30
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,913
Yes.

31
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,338
I'm fine, thank you.

32
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,700
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

33
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:45,952
- So how'd we do?
- You did fine.

34
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,294
- See anything?
- I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

35
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,340
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

36
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,960
Sorry.

37
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,797
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

38
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,592
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

39
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,474
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

40
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,633
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

41
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,846
How much time they giving you?

42
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,393
Weeks.

43
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,186
Maybe.

44
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,861
Sorry to hear it.

45
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,689
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

46
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,697
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

47
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,615
How much money are we laundering?

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,957
At this time, $16,000.

49
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,372
How long you been doing this?

50
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,871
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

51
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,550
Yeah, apparently.

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,098
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar...

53
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,842
...minus my fee,
which is 17 percent...

54
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:32,227
...comes to $9960.

55
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,057
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

56
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,811
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

57
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,402
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

58
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,866
Make hay
while the sun is still shining.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,167
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

60
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,664
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

61
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,377
Actually, I...

62
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:09,052
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

63
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,224
- Really?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,859
You know, I never did call her.

65
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:27,031
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

66
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,790
God, Walt.

67
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,876
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

68
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,457
I am. Positive is good.

69
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,873
I'm all for positive...

70
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:47,554
...but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

71
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,140
It...

72
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,215
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

73
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:53,811
I know.

74
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,390
Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

75
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,684
You know, forgive me.

76
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,023
Look...

77
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,157
...I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if...

78
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,945
If...

79
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,150
...I'm no longer around.

80
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,617
I just need to get that straight,
that's all.

81
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:22,162
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

82
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,294
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

83
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,266
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

84
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,019
A 30-minute discourse...

85
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,682
...about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

86
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,186
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them, you know.

87
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,693
I'll be lucky
if I get a word in edgewise.

88
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:09,508
I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

89
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,057
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

90
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,353
Yeah.

91
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,408
- We should do something.
- Yeah, we should.

92
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,073
No, something else.

93
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,072
We should go somewhere.

94
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,075
Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

95
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,416
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

96
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,170
Georgia O'Keeffe.

97
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,292
She's a painter.

98
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,878
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

99
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,970
No, is that bad?

100
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:57,927
- Boy, you need some educating.
- Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

101
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,265
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

102
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,064
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

103
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,850
So romantic.

104
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,741
Yup, we're going. Get up.

105
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,780
Why can't we just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

106
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,285
It's the shit.

107
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,581
A little culture won't kill you.

108
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,375
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginae.

109
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,877
Really?

110
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,209
- Is there still cereal?
- Yeah.

111
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,349
Yo, if I know you, leave a message.

112
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,317
Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.

113
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,730
- Hello? Jesse, pick up...
- Hold on, hold on.

114
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,986
Sorry, one sec.

115
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,736
- What?
- I've been trying to reach you.

116
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,119
Where's your drop phone?

117
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,915
- I've been busy.
- Well, clear your social calendar.

118
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,664
- We have to cook.
- What? Today?

119
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,291
No, you'll need today at least
to gather supplies.

120
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,753
Now, we're going to need
all new glassware...

121
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,463
...heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

122
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:20,553
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

123
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,723
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

124
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,691
Smoking marijuana,
eating Cheetos and masturbating...

125
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,391
...do not constitute plans
in my book.

126
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,687
Well, screw you and your book, man,
all right?

127
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,859
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

128
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,287
- You're going to a museum, huh?
- Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

129
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,533
- Georgia O'Keeffe?
- She's a painter, duh.

130
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,208
She does these vagina pictures.

131
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,538
Or paintings, or just painted.
I don't know.

132
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,165
What are you even talking about?

133
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,548
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

134
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,835
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

135
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,387
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

136
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,057
Let me explain something to you.

137
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,303
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

138
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,732
- Tuesday? Four days straight?
- Like it or not, we have no choice.

139
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,227
Yeah? And why exactly is that?

140
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,403
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

141
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,857
- What?
- It's losing its chemical potency.

142
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,196
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you...

143
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,694
Hell, no.

144
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:25,536
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

145
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,957
You have a paper and pencil?

146
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,247
- Come on.
- All right, all right. Go.

147
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,338
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

148
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,760
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

149
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,012
I really wish
you didn't have to do this.

150
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,635
Me too.

151
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,596
But I'll be back before you know it...

152
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,517
...and you can always call
if you need me.

153
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:53,311
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

154
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,241
Love you.

155
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,087
- Fly safe, okay?
- Okay.

156
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,600
The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading...

157
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,196
...of passengers only.

158
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,279
No parking.

159
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,667
Attention, passengers:
Please maintain visual contact...

160
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,203
...with your personal belongings
at all times.

161
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,829
Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated...

162
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,007
...by airport personnel.

163
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,597
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

164
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,434
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

165
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,807
Yeah. Did you get everything?
All six?

166
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,351
- Yeah.
- With reflux condensers?

167
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,148
Yes. Like I said, yes.

168
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:23,025
- Just go. Drive. Go, go.
- Okay.

169
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,288
Good morning to you too, man.

170
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,089
- Stupid...
- Three entire bags of Funyuns?

171
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,633
What? Funyuns are awesome.

172
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,891
- God.
- Hey, more for me.

173
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,974
How about something
with some protein maybe?

174
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,479
Something green, huh?

175
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:42,105
Man, I'm getting no service.

176
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,737
How are you even alive?

177
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:50,367
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

178
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,289
Yeah, I've got a signal.

179
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:59,036
- Hey, let me use yours, would you?
- Absolutely not.

180
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,414
I have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

181
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,673
- You know that.
- It's not business, all right?

182
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,166
- It's personal.
- Oh, personal.

183
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,174
- What, female?
- Maybe.

184
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,217
Absolutely. That's all I need.

185
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,723
Skyler hits redial
and some stripper answers.

186
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,637
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
Dickwad.

187
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,640
Sorry. My wife checks.

188
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,814
- Drinking water?
- Yup.

189
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,691
Is that all we've got?

190
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:29,822
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

191
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,989
Oh, God.

192
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,840
No, not there.
That is our workstation.

193
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:50,339
- Oh, our "workstation."
- That's right.

194
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:54,766
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

195
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,520
Considering it's our only set...

196
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,684
...and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

197
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,864
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

198
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,982
Two-point-three-five pounds.

199
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,953
Two-point-three-five.

200
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,822
That's the last of it.

201
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,826
- How many total?
- Nineteen.

202
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,048
So dollar-wise?

203
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,881
How much?

204
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,212
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...

205
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:38,174
...that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds, at...

206
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,764
- What are we selling for these days?
- Forty a pound.

207
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,765
- Forty thousand dollars?
- Hey, you said raise the prices.

208
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,851
All right, that's 40 times 42...

209
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,103
...minus distribution charges...

210
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,527
What?

211
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,439
What?

212
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,527
Six hundred seventy-two
thousand dollars.

213
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,368
- All in?
- No.

214
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,209
Each.

215
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:06,832
Each?

216
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,711
- Each.
- Six hundred and...?

217
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,380
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

218
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:17,045
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

219
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:21,973
Hey, come high, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

220
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,021
Yes! Yes!

221
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,902
Well, there goes the generator.

222
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,438
I think that's it for the gas.

223
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,152
Perfect timing, yo.

224
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,238
- How do you figure that?
- What do you mean?

225
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,450
We're done cooking.

226
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,581
I am not done
until this barrel is empty.

227
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,954
Look at this.

228
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,418
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

229
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,749
- Come on, where's your ambition?
- Jesus. Seriously?

230
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,255
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

231
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,423
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane...

232
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,556
...and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

233
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,340
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off?

234
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,099
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

235
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,852
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the sizzle...

236
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,561
...and glass up the rest.

237
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:12,773
Come on.

238
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,857
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

239
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,733
Grand Slam?

240
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,108
Hot shower?

241
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,442
A bed?

242
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,164
- Separate rooms.
- Yeah, that's a given.

243
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,750
What the hell?

244
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,510
What the...? The battery's dead.

245
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:45,261
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place...

246
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,098
...where did you put them?

247
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:52,058
- I left them right here in the ignition.
- Son of a bitch.

248
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,434
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

249
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,195
- The buzzer didn't buzz.
- The what?

250
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,647
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in...

251
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,490
...to let you know the battery's on.

252
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,361
I know that. It didn't buzz.

253
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,866
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

254
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,998
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

255
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,331
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

256
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,165
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

257
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,001
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

258
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,295
The buzzer did not buzz.

259
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,668
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

260
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,511
Yes, I see your point.

261
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,343
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

262
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,761
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

263
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,599
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

264
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,186
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

265
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,309
- Jesus.
- Okay, just...

266
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,451
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

267
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,285
Okay.

268
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,694
How?

269
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,081
You gonna be okay?

270
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,466
Oh, damn it.

271
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,845
What's it taste like?

272
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,504
Bad, huh?

273
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,021
This is good.
This is good. Right here.

274
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:18,270
Okay. There.

275
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,234
Here. Red to red, black to black.

276
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:31,865
Positive, negative.
All right. Start it up.

277
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,746
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

278
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,882
- You have to really pull.
- I am.

279
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,884
No, really pull, not like a girl.

280
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,764
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulling.

281
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:49,432
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

282
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:52,926
Oh, my God.

283
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,266
Oh, jeez.

284
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:24,256
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just...

285
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:27,090
Well done.

286
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,224
God.

287
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,204
Come on, you bitches.

288
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,493
Hear me now.

289
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,080
Damn it.

290
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,923
Stupid.

291
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,261
Okay, now we have to use
your phone.

292
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,603
This is ruined. Do you understand?
Just ruined.

293
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,815
You hooked it up wrong
and blew it up.

294
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,778
No, no, no.
That is not what happened.

295
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,102
How do you know?

296
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,691
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

297
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,652
- That's what I know.
- There was a fire.

298
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,696
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

299
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:34,989
Is that what you were...?
You were thinking?

300
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,034
Now that we have
identified the problem...

301
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,457
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

302
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,711
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

303
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,167
Your wife is not gonna notice
one little call.

304
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,052
Mr. White, come on.

305
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,719
God.

306
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:58,010
All right, look, just make it snappy.

307
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,314
- Roaming drains the battery.
- All right.

308
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,313
Yo, Skinny, hey.

309
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,697
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

310
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:14,369
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

311
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,406
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

312
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,079
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

313
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:20,621
All right, so you ready?

314
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:24,916
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

315
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:29,758
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

316
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,797
All right...
No, big arrows, giant arrows.

317
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,220
They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

318
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:37,683
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

319
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:40,765
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

320
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:43,733
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

321
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:48,189
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

322
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,196
About another 15 miles.

323
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,159
- Really? That far?
- Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

324
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,453
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

325
00:24:56,663 --> 00:25:00,364
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

326
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:04,083
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
Bring water.

327
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,921
Leave now.

328
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:07,965
Here.

329
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,799
He's coming.

330
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:18,638
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel...

331
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,260
...who broke his leg
mountain biking...

332
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,149
...and he had to drink urine for...

333
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:27,228
You know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

334
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:33,565
He said it tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

335
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:39,489
Look, we should just call, you know?

336
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:43,490
I'll be quick, just be like,
"Yo, where are you?"

337
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,338
All right.

338
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,474
Come on.

339
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,642
Yo. Yo, where are you?

340
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,142
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

341
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,896
Yes, he's almost here.

342
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:12,895
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

343
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,570
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

344
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,777
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

345
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:21,079
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

346
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,366
Wait, wait. What river?

347
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:25,954
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

348
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,707
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

349
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,129
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you...?

350
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,046
Phone's dead.

351
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,593
Now what?

352
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:47,641
Mr. White, what now?

353
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,478
Oh, come on. Seriously?

354
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,764
What's this?

355
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,059
I'm trying to...

356
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:35,019
...trickle-charge the battery.

357
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,821
Seriously?

358
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:40,281
Just by turning that thing?

359
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,285
The commutator.

360
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,452
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

361
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:50,617
Usually this little piston engine
turns it...

362
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,917
...but considering that it's lying here
completely totaled...

363
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,256
Anyway.

364
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:06,301
Apply a little elbow grease.

365
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:10,898
It'll take longer, a lot longer...

366
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:13,979
...but theoretically...

367
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:17,104
...it should work.

368
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,608
Theoretically.

369
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,330
It has to work.

370
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,035
You understand?

371
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,428
Can I try?

372
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,685
Yeah.

373
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,631
How much longer?

374
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,468
I don't know.

375
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,569
Now?

376
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:47,410
Hey.

377
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:50,038
Mr. White.

378
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,762
Hey.

379
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:07,640
Yeah?

380
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,261
Yo, man, you hanging in?

381
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,980
Yeah, I'm good.

382
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:21,853
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

383
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,398
No, give it a little longer...

384
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,695
...just to make sure we're...

385
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,847
Methylamine doesn't spoil...

386
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,514
...does it?

387
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:55,302
No. That's not why we're here.

388
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:08,868
Yo.

389
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,912
Lie much?

390
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,623
Here, push.

391
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:38,146
Okay, okay, okay.

392
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:41,019
Now.

393
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,147
Go on.

394
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,611
Please, please, please.

395
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,501
Yes. Yes.

396
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:16,307
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

397
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,011
No. God.

398
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,144
Please. Please.

399
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:44,497
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

400
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:47,669
Why? Why?

401
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,383
Mr. White.

402
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,225
Mr. White!

403
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,436
What are you doing?

404
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,779
Mr. White?

405
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:12,984
Oh, God.

406
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,592
I have this coming.

407
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,641
What?

408
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,434
I have it coming.

409
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:45,558
I deserve this.

410
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,983
Hey, snap out of it.

411
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:52,145
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

412
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:53,860
Right?

413
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,704
All I ever managed to do...

414
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:02,247
...was worry and disappoint them...

415
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,786
...and lie.

416
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,578
Oh, God.

417
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,713
All the lies.

418
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,427
I can't even...

419
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:17,639
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

420
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,520
You know what? Screw this.

421
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:25,311
I'm walking. You can come or not.

422
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,814
Where's my other shoe?

423
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:34,281
Jesse. Jesse.

424
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,320
Your body...

425
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:43,370
...is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

426
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:48,662
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

427
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:51,336
And when they're gone...

428
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:55,335
...your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

429
00:34:56,054 --> 00:35:01,641
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

430
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:05,850
You go marching out there...

431
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:09,932
...and within an hour,
you will be dead.

432
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:14,232
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now...

433
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,357
...and think of something scientific.

434
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,825
Something...
Something scientific, right.

435
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:22,991
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

436
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,876
You made poison out of beans, yo.

437
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:29,326
All right, look. We got...

438
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:34,671
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

439
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,924
How about you take
some of these chemicals...

440
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,711
...and mix up some rocket fuel?

441
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:42,849
And we can just send up
a signal flare.

442
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,345
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help...

443
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:49,268
...or a homing device...

444
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,310
...or build a new battery or...

445
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,353
Or wait, no.

446
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,812
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV...

447
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:59,482
...and build it into something
completely different?

448
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,572
You know, like a...
Like a dune buggy.

449
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:06,239
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or...

450
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:11,419
What? Hey. What is it?

451
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:13,958
What?

452
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,754
Do you have any money?

453
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,084
Change, I mean. Coins.

454
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:22,091
- Yeah, I got a bunch from the...
- Okay.

455
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,134
- Yes.
- Gather them.

456
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:28,218
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws...

457
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:31,807
...and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

458
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:35,608
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

459
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:38,027
- Solid zinc, okay.
- And... And bring me...

460
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,612
Bring me brake pads.

461
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:44,409
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

462
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:47,373
- Okay. Brake pads, okay.
- Brake pads.

463
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:52,958
What are we building?

464
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:56,709
- You said it yourself.
- A robot?

465
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,051
- A battery.
- Yes.

466
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,135
Move!

467
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:16,569
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

468
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:18,937
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

469
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:22,901
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

470
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:27,032
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

471
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,907
Remember the electrolytes?

472
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:31,455
Well, think about it.

473
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,329
A battery is a galvanic cell.

474
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:38,299
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode...

475
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:40,631
...separated by an electrolyte, right?

476
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,427
- Right.
- Yeah, well, anyway.

477
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:47,257
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide...

478
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:49,682
...and graphite
from your brake pads.

479
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:54,058
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

480
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:58,521
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

481
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:01,361
Then... Here, I'll show you.

482
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:04,111
On the opposite side is our anode.

483
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,154
This.

484
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:09,121
It's zinc.

485
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:14,408
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

486
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:18,044
- So the sponge is the electrolyte?
- Yeah.

487
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:22,124
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

488
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:26,424
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

489
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:28,891
Good.

490
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:34,679
Good. And now, what shall we use...

491
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:37,568
...to conduct
this beautiful current with?

492
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:43,110
What one particular element
comes to mind?

493
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,786
Wire.

494
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,452
Copper.

495
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,708
- Oh, I mean...
- Copper.

496
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,331
Right.

497
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:03,418
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

498
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:06,553
And how many cells will we need?

499
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:09,634
We've only got material enough
for six.

500
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,723
Okay.

501
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:22,771
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

502
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,447
All right.

503
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,408
Cathode.

504
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,118
Anode.

505
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:38,335
Damn. That is good.

506
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:41,831
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

507
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:02,814
Come on.

508
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:49,483
Attention, passengers:
Please maintain visual contact...

509
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,988
...with your personal belongings
at all times.

510
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,693
Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated by...

511
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:56,657
How's the...?

512
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,411
It's fine.

513
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,716
I know I can trust you to...

514
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:18,059
Yeah.

515
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:22,684
Hey, whatever happens...

516
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,557
...your family will get your share.

517
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:29,983
Thank you.

518
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:40,582
So...

519
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:47,587
...I'll be hearing from you, yeah?

520
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:52,922
Yeah.

521
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:13,614
How's everyone doing?

522
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:19,538
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

523
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:24,789
- I know. I know, enough already. It's...
- I'm teasing.

524
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,961
Everything in its time.

525
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:31,420
Walt, I have your scan results.

526
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:36,338
- Yeah.
- You're showing signs of remission.

527
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:42,550
- Oh, my God.
- I wanna clarify.

528
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,476
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

529
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,063
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

530
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,318
To classify someone
as in remission...

531
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:53,234
...we only need to determine
that the tumor hasn't grown.

532
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:55,821
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

533
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:57,566
Technically speaking...

534
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:00,822
...a tumor can remain
the exact same size it was before...

535
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,495
...and the patient
could still be in remission.

536
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:07,243
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage III adenocarcinoma...

537
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:09,455
...I'd like to see, I hope to see...

538
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:13,291
...at least a 25- to 35-percent
reduction in tumor mass...

539
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:19,015
...something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

540
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:21,016
Everybody still with me?

541
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:26,179
And how has my cancer responded?

542
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:29,767
Walt, your tumor has shrunk
by 80 percent.

543
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:37,526
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

544
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:39,985
Wait, I'm really... I'm confused.

545
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,611
Is...? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

546
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:47,871
- Mom, yeah.
- Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

547
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:51,209
- Okay, but, I'm... Wait...
- Sweetheart, you were right.

548
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,175
- It's very good news.
- It's very good news.

549
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:57,421
- Oh, my God.
- My God, are you kidding me?

550
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:01,849
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

551
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,269
That's great.

552
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:17,149
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

553
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:21,233
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

554
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:24,573
It's okay. This is fairly common.

555
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,165
See that scary-looking thing there?

556
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,210
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

557
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:34,667
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

558
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,959
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

559
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:40,095
Tissue inflammation? I...

560
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:42,262
Are you sure about that? I mean, I...

561
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:48,263
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

562
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,481
- What?
- You probably have a tear...

563
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:53,269
...in your esophagus
from coughing.

564
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:56,272
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

565
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:59,858
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

566
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:02,946
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

567
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:05,699
- I'm sorry, I just...
- No more secrets, Walt.

568
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:09,615
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

569
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,005
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

570
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:16,123
But now at least
we have some options...

571
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:19,212
...the most important of which
is time.

572
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,712
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

573
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:26,715
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

574
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:32,062
- Yes.
- Yeah.

575
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:33,437
Oh, my God.
