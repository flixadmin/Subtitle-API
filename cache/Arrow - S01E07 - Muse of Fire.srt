1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,202
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,210
For five years, I was stranded
on an island with only one goal: survive.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,680
Oliver Queen is alive.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,009
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,049
To use the list of names he left me...

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,090
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,047
To do this,
I must become someone else.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,287
I must become something else.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,641
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,281
The Oliver you lost
might not be the one they found.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,609
When you were plotting your plan
to save the city...

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,889
...I don't think you considered the effect
it would have on the people in your life.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,127
You're wrong.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,245
Not being able to tell my family the truth
doesn't hurt anyone worse than me.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,323
I made you a promise I couldn't keep.

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,167
After being granted the miracle
of having my child returned to me...

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,768
...that you seem to have no interest
in telling me the truth.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,681
You've gotta let me in, Ollie.
You've gotta let someone in.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,126
- Hello?
- Hi.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,324
Mom said I'm supposed to remind you
to pick her up for lunch.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,280
Was I supposed to have
lunch with her today?

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,641
She said she left you five messages.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,366
Just bite the bullet
and have a Cobb salad with the woman.

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,801
You know Thea, sometimes it's difficult to
remember which one of you is my mother.

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,004
Mrs. Queen, all I'm asking for is a chance
to sit down and discuss our proposal.

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,925
If that's all it is,
then I can save us both the time.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,049
- It's rejected.
- I see. May I ask why?

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,368
Do I really need to answer that,
Mr. Copani?

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,163
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm meeting my son for lunch.

30
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,571
Get down!

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,569
- Mom? Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,966
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm...

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,924
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,009
Call 911.

35
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,571
Hi.

36
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,967
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

37
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,048
I'm fine.

38
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,770
- Did you reach Walter?
- No, I'm sorry.

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,122
As I was telling
your mother and sister...

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,086
...the CAT scan showed a grade-2
concussion. She can go home so long...

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,240
...as someone stays with her, just to
make sure there are no after effects.

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,964
- Thank you.
- Hm.

43
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,523
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left you.
I thought you were fine.

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,484
What did you think you were doing?

45
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,923
I wanted to get the license plate
of the guy who took a shot at you.

46
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,169
- Well, that was foolish.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,728
- So did you get the license plate?
- No, he got away.

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,930
Maybe you should spend
a little less time trying to be a hero.

49
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,361
You're obviously not very good at it.

50
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,369
- That's cute.
- Wasn't trying to be.

51
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,691
You left Mom in the street.
Alone and hurt in the street.

52
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,724
Heh, to get a license plate?

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,767
- You don't believe me?
- I love you. Mom loves you.

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,882
But it's getting hard
when you won't be truthful with us.

55
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,360
Detectives.

56
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,927
- Do you have any leads on the shooter?
- Not yet.

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,566
- Did you get a look at him?
- He was wearing a helmet.

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,088
- Don't worry. We'll find him.
- My head of security is on his way.

59
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,884
I wanna make sure there are men
outside my mother's door.

60
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,570
She needs to be protected.

61
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,843
Well, you know your family's
at the tippy-top of my list of priorities.

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,690
The guy she was with was connected.

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,965
Mobbed-up-to-the-eyeballs connected.
She wasn't the target.

64
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,287
And you're welcome.

65
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,206
Uh, technically, I did get here, like,
1O seconds before this guy.

66
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,127
Keep the change.

67
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,125
So, Tommy,
what brings you by so late?

68
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,642
Well, I assumed, rightly, that you would
be at home working tonight...

69
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,561
...and I also assumed
that you might be hungry. Also rightly.

70
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,401
I don't know.

71
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,405
This is a mushroom and olive pizza
from Mario's.

72
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,762
Oh, that is damn good pie.

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,569
- All right. What do you have to offer?
- Spicy tuna on crispy rice from Toro.

74
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,205
Oh.

75
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,927
Damn you, Merlyn.
I hope sushi was all you had in mind.

76
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,006
Uh, actually, there was something
that I wanted to ask you.

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,409
- And what's that?
- Will you go out with me?

78
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,648
Like, on a date?

79
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,121
You brought me dinner
to ask me to dinner?

80
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,403
Oh, uh, well, I also did throw you
a really big charity gala.

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,161
See, I thought you threw it for
the hundreds of people it would benefit.

82
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,807
Oh, yeah, hundreds of people.
Plus one more.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,570
- Tommy, heh.
- Laurel.

84
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,809
I get it. Okay, this is all happening
for us in the wrong order.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,401
First, we're friends for many years...

86
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,888
...and then, briefly,
we are friends with benefits...

87
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,085
...extremely excellent benefits,
and now I'm just hoping...

88
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,290
...that we can be two people
sitting at the same restaurant...

89
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,767
...at the same table at the same time.

90
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,442
See, when I say it like that,
it doesn't sound so scary, does it?

91
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,124
Oliver, your mom's nearly killed...

92
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,005
...I think you can take a day off
from training.

93
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,680
My mother wasn't the target.

94
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,086
This man was. Paul Copani.

95
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,720
He was trying to close a deal with her
when they were shot at.

96
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,648
Copani works
for Bertinelli Construction.

97
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,810
- And Frank Bertinelli.
- The mob boss.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,490
I did some digging.

99
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,809
Copani isn't the first member
of Bertinelli's crew who's been hit.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,047
You did some digging.

101
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,328
Bertinelli has a lot of enemies.

102
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,808
The best way to figure out
who's trying to target his organization...

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,288
- ...is to get inside of it.
- So let me get this right, Oliver.

104
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,371
Your mother's shot at, nearly killed, and
the way you process this emotionally...

105
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,884
- ...is by going undercover with the mob.
- I'm not trying to process it emotionally.

106
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,890
Yeah, well,
maybe that's your problem, man.

107
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,687
You ever thought about
just being there for your family?

108
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,688
I tried that today with Thea.

109
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,724
She told me I wasn't being honest
with her and she's right.

110
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,529
I can't very well explain to her
that I left our mother alone...

111
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,690
...and bleeding on the pavement
because I'm fast enough...

112
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,167
...to almost run down the attacker.

113
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,526
But what I can do
is protect my family.

114
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,809
And, Diggle, when I find out
who this guy is, he's a dead man.

115
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,404
- Speedy, where you going?
- Clubbing.

116
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,729
Which is difficult to do in your house
and not at an actual club.

117
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,809
I have to go out tonight.

118
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,802
- I thought you'd be watching Mom.
- I've spent the whole day with her.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,925
- I thought you were taking the night shift.
- I'm sorry, but this thing, it's important.

120
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,523
You know, sometimes, Ollie,
I just don't get you.

121
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,768
And by "sometimes" I mean never.

122
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,486
You're actually not the first person
to say that to me today.

123
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,330
Why am I not surprised?

124
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,645
- Oh, nice dress. Where you headed?
- Upstairs. Apparently.

125
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,206
- Long story.
- Hey, I heard about your mom.

126
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,687
- Is she all right?
- Well, she's resting upstairs.

127
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,331
More shaken up than anything.

128
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,603
I gotta run to this, uh, business thing.
I do appreciate you stopping by.

129
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,286
No problem.
Just so long as your mom's all right.

130
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,084
Yeah.

131
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,681
Hey, one more thing.

132
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,122
Mainly because I don't want you
to find this out from someone else...

133
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,971
...that someone else
especially being Laurel...

134
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,525
...uh...

135
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,691
...we're going to dinner,
as in a, uh, date.

136
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,286
That's good.

137
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,609
Laurel deserves someone special
and so do you.

138
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,087
Thanks, man.

139
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,840
- I gotta run to this thing.
- Absolutely. I'll catch you later.

140
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,686
Oh, and, uh, Tommy, if you hurt her,
I'll snap your neck.

141
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,610
I'm just kidding, heh.

142
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,727
Mr. Bertinelli.

143
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,888
- Call me Frank.
- Call me Oliver.

144
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,730
Yeah, heh.

145
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,527
Thank you for agreeing to meet me
at my home.

146
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,485
My father used to say living rooms
make the best conference rooms.

147
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,523
- Oh, I'm gonna steal that.
- Heh.

148
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,247
- Nick Salvati, my associate.
- How do you do?

149
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,363
Let's have a drink.

150
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,449
So, what are you in the mood for, hmm?

151
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,647
We could watch reality housewife
cooking show or Cop Docs.

152
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,281
It's where doctors run around
fighting crime...

153
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,400
...when they're not all
sleeping with each other.

154
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,210
Whatever you want, sweetheart.

155
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,368
You're the one who's given up
your evening out.

156
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,683
Aw, it's not like there's anybody else
who could be staying with you.

157
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,408
- Oh, wait, yes, there is.
- Don't be too harsh on your brother.

158
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,920
Why not? I mean,
aren't you getting, heh, sick of his lies?

159
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,806
Thea, everyone has secrets.

160
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,525
I mean, we all have things
that we wanna keep to ourselves.

161
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,963
I just don't get him sometimes.

162
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,690
I know.

163
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,009
I know.

164
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,322
You know, being in that hospital
and seeing Dr. Lamb again...

165
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,121
...it made me remember the day
that Oliver came home.

166
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,530
It was Dr. Lamb that told me
that the Oliver we'd lost...

167
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,121
...might not be the Oliver
that they'd found.

168
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,686
I think it's easy to forget, but he lived
apart from civilization for 5 years.

169
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,927
Hm.

170
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,122
- So, what, he gets, like, a free pass?
- No, no, no, not at all.

171
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,766
I just think we need to stop judging him
for the Oliver he was...

172
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,170
...and start accepting him
for the Oliver that he is.

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,330
So, Oliver, I'll be honest with you,
I was surprised to hear from you.

174
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,280
It was my impression from the local news...

175
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,040
...that you weren't gonna be involved
with your family's business.

176
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,363
Apparently there were a few catchphrases that
I missed while I was away for five years.

177
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,210
One of them being
lame-stream media.

178
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,040
- The press never gets anything right.
- Oh, I know a thing or two about that.

179
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,808
- So, Oliver, I'll be blunt.
- Hmm?

180
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,121
I want the contract...

181
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,085
...to build Queen Consolidated's
new applied sciences division.

182
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,171
- And I'm inclined to give it to you.
- Your mother wasn't quite so enthusiastic.

183
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,845
- How is she by the way?
- She's recuperating at home, thank you.

184
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,280
What a terrible thing that happened.

185
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,963
And, Frank, I was very sorry to hear
about what happened to Paul Copani.

186
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,290
Paul was a good friend.
He was a good man.

187
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,365
The violence in this city...

188
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,125
Sometimes I wonder why I stay.

189
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,727
I had the same thought.

190
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,402
So why'd you come back?

191
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,080
After that island you could have
settled anywhere in the world.

192
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,004
Because Starling City is my home.

193
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,287
No matter which way you go or turn,
you always end up at home.

194
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,286
- Oliver, this is my daughter, Helena.
- Hello.

195
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,887
- Nice to meet you. I'm heading out.
- All right. Take one of the guys with you.

196
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,082
- I can take care of myself.
- Heh.

197
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,369
I wasn't asking, sweetie.

198
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,889
Frank, that meeting you requested?
They can do it.

199
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,607
Now.

200
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,803
- I can come back another time.
- No, no, no. Just, uh...

201
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,363
Just excuse us for a moment,
would you?

202
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,483
Mm-hm.
- Thank you.

203
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,284
Oliver Queen.
The rich man's Lindsay Lohan.

204
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,764
Look, um...

205
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,203
...I've gotta go to this other meeting.

206
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,323
But I need someone
to take him to dinner.

207
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,965
So you pimp out your daughter.

208
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,925
No, I ask her to help me
close a business deal.

209
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,169
I remind her
that the family business is dying...

210
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,682
...and that we need this contract
and Oliver Queen can give it to us.

211
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,965
Please, sweet pea, huh?
For us. For me, hmm?

212
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,924
That's my girl.

213
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,647
Oliver, I'm so sorry,
something has come up.

214
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,322
But Helena would love to take you
to dinner and discuss the deal further.

215
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,726
- Oh.
- Hm.

216
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,410
I was hoping to speak with you.

217
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,288
Well, as you, uh, speak for your family,
my daughter also speaks for ours.

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,288
It's really not necessary.

219
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,641
- It'd be my pleasure.
- Sure.

220
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,082
I look forward to working together.

221
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,161
- Thank you for coming.
- Anything for a friend.

222
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,285
We're not responsible
for the attacks on your people.

223
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:54,329
These attacks on my business,
on my family's lifeblood, they stop now.

224
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,681
Or I'm coming for you.

225
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,169
What does the Triad have to gain
by provoking you?

226
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,724
Well, no one ever credited the Triad
with rational thinking.

227
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,848
If not them, then who?

228
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,371
Whoever it is...

229
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,841
...when I find out who's behind this,
there will be blood.

230
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,407
Bertinelli's ready to put the screws
to everyone...

231
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,204
...who pays him protection money.

232
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,721
Yeah, well three of his best
earners have been murdered.

233
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,769
He's gotta make up the cash
somewhere.

234
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,562
Whoever is pruning the family tree
is looking to make Bertinelli suffer.

235
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,821
So you do think it's one
of the other families?

236
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:36,350
No.

237
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,681
Then who?

238
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Well, according to the coroner's report,
none of the vics took a clean shot.

239
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,645
Half the bullets missed.
Our killer is not a pro.

240
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,241
That's not stopping them
from pulling that trigger.

241
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,925
That's up to us.

242
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,960
Or this is gonna blow up
into an all-out mob war.

243
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,524
- You're an angel, Helena. So beautiful.
- Heh.

244
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,562
Well, we are gonna take good care
of both of you tonight.

245
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,322
- You'll tell your father hello from us?
- Of course, Mr. Russo.

246
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,284
- I'll give you a minute.
- Thank you.

247
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,808
I heard about your mother's accident.

248
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,209
- Is she gonna be okay?
- She's gonna be fine. Thanks.

249
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,084
I'm glad.

250
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,402
So why would you wanna go
into business with my father?

251
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,410
You know who he is
and how he made his money.

252
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,807
You don't approve
of your family's enterprises?

253
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,206
We share a name.

254
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,483
That name defines us
whether we want it to or not.

255
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,762
You've already made judgments
about me...

256
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,889
...just like I've made judgments about you.

257
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,811
Right.
I'm the rich man's Lindsay Lohan.

258
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,527
Heh, sorry.

259
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,169
- That's okay.
- Heh.

260
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,449
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

261
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,286
I know it must have been hell for you...

262
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,763
...alone on that island for five years,
but, um...

263
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,646
But what?

264
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,809
But was there ever a day when you were
just happy to be away from everything?

265
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,845
No pressure from your family.

266
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,402
No need to be the person
that everyone else expects you to be.

267
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,083
- Was there ever a day when...?
- When I didn't feel lost, that I felt...

268
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,406
...free?

269
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,850
More than one and, uh...

270
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,847
And those are the days that I miss.

271
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,168
- What, is it too spicy for you, Merlyn?
- No. No, not really.

272
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,530
I'm just, um, crying because I was thinking
of a Hallmark commercial...

273
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,530
...I saw earlier today
featuring a sick kitty.

274
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,491
It was very emotional.

275
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,609
- Will there be anything else?
- No, thank you.

276
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,370
Yep.

277
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,761
Thanks for letting me
take you to dinner.

278
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,647
Well, thank you
for letting me choose Indian.

279
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,887
Yeah, I read this article
by a film critic once who said...

280
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,608
...if he could have one wish it would be
to watch his favorite movie again...

281
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,290
...for the first time.

282
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,601
I kind of wish that was us.

283
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,401
So you want dinner and a movie?

284
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,604
No.

285
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,604
I wish we had just met,
and that all this was just beginning...

286
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,442
...and there wasn't so much of me
I wish you'd forget.

287
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,802
Well, keep saying nice things
like that...

288
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,805
...and maybe next time
I'll let you choose the restaurant.

289
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,287
- Mr. Merlyn?
- Yeah.

290
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,165
I'm sorry, I'm afraid your credit card
has been declined.

291
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,489
You swipe it a few times? Sometimes
those things can be a little glitchy.

292
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,647
I did. And, um, I'm afraid the credit card
company wants me to confiscate it.

293
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,924
Sorry.

294
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,401
People are always asking me
what did I miss the most.

295
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,481
Uh, air conditioning.
Satellite radio. Taglia...

296
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,920
- Tagliatelle?
- Right.

297
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,207
Hmm.

298
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,166
Those are the answers I give people because
those are the answers they're expecting.

299
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,126
- Why can't you just be truthful?
- I don't know how truthful I can be.

300
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,410
You've been through a crucible.
And it changed you. How could it not?

301
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,681
That's beautiful. Your cross.

302
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,927
- It's a gift. From my fiancé.
- Heh, fiancé.

303
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,001
- I didn't know you were engaged.
- I'm not. Anymore.

304
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,566
- He died.
- I'm sorry.

305
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,129
Me too.

306
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,211
That was my crucible.

307
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,161
Boy, it's nice to...

308
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,004
It's really nice to be with someone
that I can be myself with.

309
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,921
It's nice to be with someone
who knows how hard it can be.

310
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,681
- Ugh, I'm really sorry.
- It's okay. Take it.

311
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,445
Thank you.

312
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,690
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's Dig.

313
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,927
Something came up.

314
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,600
You gotta get out of there
and call me back.

315
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,327
Helena, I have to go.
There's something that I have to do.

316
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,724
It's about my mother.
Otherwise, I would, I would, uh, stay.

317
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,206
And I would like that.

318
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,329
Uh, my father would kill me
if I let you pay.

319
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,209
I have a confession.

320
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,449
- I didn't wanna go out with you tonight.
- That makes two of us.

321
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,005
I'm really glad that I did.

322
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,800
That makes two of us.

323
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,722
Oliver.

324
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,163
Be careful with my father.

325
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,610
Thea, you don't need to knock,
sweetheart.

326
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,610
What about me?

327
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,127
I hope you don't mind.

328
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,004
Thea let me in.

329
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,366
What are you doing here?

330
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,403
I wanted to see how your recovery
was going.

331
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,728
Well, surely someone of your
means has a telephone.

332
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,367
I like to see someone when I have
something important to talk about.

333
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,605
We used to be friends, Moira.

334
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,087
I still remember that time.

335
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,726
You, me and Robert.

336
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,006
Which is why I came by.

337
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,960
You are a vital part
of Starling City's future.

338
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,047
Robert feared that future.

339
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,081
He lost his conviction.

340
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,081
It's been my experience that
when someone has a brush with death...

341
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,726
...like you experienced today, even their
deepest held convictions can change.

342
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,361
- Have they?
- No.

343
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,084
You didn't have to say it.

344
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,049
I can see that they haven't.

345
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,200
- What happened?
- Yeah, it's what's about to happen.

346
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,129
Bertinelli's enforcer, Nick Salvati?

347
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,847
Yeah, we drank a Scotch together,
he seems like a real stand-up mobster.

348
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,123
Yeah, well he's paying visits to everyone
who owes the mob protection money.

349
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,966
Diggle, I'm trying to figure out
who took a shot at my mother...

350
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,969
...not take on all of organized crime.

351
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,579
Well, listen Oliver,
Salvati and his goons have

352
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:55,068
already put four people in
the hospital tonight...

353
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,123
...and if somebody doesn't stop him...

354
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,641
...the poor bastard who owns
Russo's is gonna be next.

355
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,525
- Wait, wait. Russo's?
- It's at the corner of Adams...

356
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,563
I know where it is. I'm here right now.

357
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,285
What?

358
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,687
I was having dinner
with Bertinelli's daughter.

359
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,524
Oliver, you're supposed
to be going undercover...

360
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,888
- ...not speed dating.
- I didn't have a choice.

361
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,041
Yeah, well, uh, I've seen her on the web.
You made quite the sacrifice.

362
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,886
Salvati's here.

363
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,528
I'm sorry, we're closed.

364
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,568
Huh? Mr. Salvati.

365
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,330
- Uh, I have some fresh-made lasagna.
- We're not here for food, Mr. Russo.

366
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,562
- Your payment's due.
- I already made my payment this month.

367
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,802
You need to pay again.

368
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,207
Please, I can't afford to make
another payment if I'm...

369
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,007
Going to what? Restock your bar?

370
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,365
- Break his fingers.
- Leave him alone!

371
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,284
- Break hers too.
- No, don't touch her!

372
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,000
Go!

373
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,091
I don't understand.

374
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,647
- Why is she targeting her family?
- I don't know.

375
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,162
- Here I thought you had parental issues.
- This is not a joke, Diggle.

376
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,721
Oliver, you're not falling for this girl,
are you?

377
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,446
Because I know
you can't be that crazy.

378
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,449
Helena Bertinelli shot at your mother.

379
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,847
She also murdered four men
in cold blood.

380
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,051
She has to have reasons
for what she's doing.

381
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,683
Reasons?

382
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,846
Since when do you care
about the bad guy's reasons?

383
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,408
Oh, she is bad guy, Oliver.
She's the killer.

384
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,001
And whatever's going on in your head,
get it straight.

385
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,601
Any attempt on his right hand...

386
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,282
...is gonna send your new friend's father
on a Warpath.

387
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,686
I know what I'm doing.

388
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,686
Now I know how your family feels
when you lie to them.

389
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,450
Is this the only angle you've got?

390
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,325
The Russos chintzed out a bit
on their security package.

391
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,285
Somebody's in the wings with a gun
shooting at these guys.

392
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,450
- What do you got from earlier? Yeah.
- Before the shooting?

393
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,325
Business dinner, birthday dinner,
couple of blind dates.

394
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,568
Any guests
of the Chinese persuasion?

395
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,211
- Why?
- Humor me.

396
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,926
Whoa, whoa.

397
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,169
- Wait. Wait a second, what was that?
- Help yourself.

398
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,966
Come on.

399
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,488
Son of a bitch.

400
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,161
Detective. ls everything okay?

401
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,129
Your, um...

402
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,846
Your buddy with the arrows
was at Russo's last night.

403
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:43,400
And I was there earlier with a date. So,
what, you think I'm the hood guy again?

404
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,407
Heh, no.

405
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,768
Your date. Helena Bertinelli.
If I were you, I'd stay away from her.

406
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,042
Her family is bad news on a good day.

407
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,567
Why the sudden concern
for my well-being?

408
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,491
A few weeks ago, I made a mistake.

409
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,770
I almost got you killed.

410
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,564
And you felt like you owed me one?

411
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,285
If I did, as far as I'm concerned,
this clears the books.

412
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,803
Can I talk to you? Dad.

413
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,607
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a little occupied at the moment.

414
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,883
I just talked to the accountant.
He said my accounts were frozen.

415
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,321
He said my credit cards
were all canceled.

416
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,922
I pay Sandy a king's ransom
each year in fees, Tommy.

417
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,731
When it comes to money,
if he says it's so, it's so.

418
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,241
Do you think this is a joke?

419
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,006
No.

420
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,249
You are.

421
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,365
Although, I must say,
your chronic irresponsibility...

422
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,121
...and terminal laziness
has lost its humor.

423
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,527
Heh.

424
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,250
You're wondering why now.

425
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,082
- The better question is why not sooner?
- It's...

426
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,650
- it's my trust fund.
- Which is comprised of my money.

427
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,161
Oh, excuse me.

428
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,086
Was comprised.

429
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,127
Helena.

430
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,202
- How did you find me here?
- I followed you from your house.

431
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,646
Your fiancé?

432
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,490
Yeah.

433
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,409
You said that losing him
was your crucible.

434
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,362
That it changed you.
You didn't say how.

435
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,721
When you love someone
as much as I loved him...

436
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,604
...with all of your heart...

437
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,522
...then you can't just turn that emotion
off when they're taken from you.

438
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,567
You still feel things as deeply.
And if it...

439
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,525
If it can't be love that you feel...

440
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,965
...then it becomes hate.

441
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,131
Hate for who?

442
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,924
Oliver.

443
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,203
You should stay away from me.

444
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,047
Helena.

445
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,050
Get in.

446
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,730
My father is going to kill you for this.

447
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,327
I've been wanting to do that for years,
you spoiled bitch.

448
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,842
I knew it was someone from the inside
waging war against your father and me.

449
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,850
I just never thought it'd be this inside.

450
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,801
You dropped this at Russo's.

451
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,961
You're smarter
than I gave you credit for, Nicky.

452
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,041
- You're not.
- Hey!

453
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,363
You're a businessman, right?
So let's talk business.

454
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,881
I can offer you a lot of money
if you let us go.

455
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,364
This isn't about money, Richie Rich.
This is about loyalty.

456
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,803
He's got nothing to do
with any of this.

457
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,285
- Then what the hell is it about?
- My father had Michael murdered.

458
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,651
Of course he did.
He didn't want you to know the truth.

459
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,811
Your rat of a fiance
was gathering evidence.

460
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,571
He was talking to the frigging FBI.

461
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,287
The love of your life
was going to destroy your father.

462
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,681
You're wrong.

463
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,885
We found a laptop in Michael's bag,
Helena.

464
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,448
Everything that could send your father
and me to prison...

465
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,608
...for the rest of our lives was on it.

466
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,406
- That computer...
- Was mine.

467
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,329
Michael wasn't the one
talking to the FBI. I was.

468
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,087
- You?
- My father is a monster...

469
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,329
...who doesn't care who he hurts
to keep his money and power.

470
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,124
And I wanted it to stop.

471
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,800
Well, then it's your fault
Michael's dead.

472
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,925
Not your father for ordering the hit
or me for carrying it out.

473
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,686
Yours.

474
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,370
You shot Michael?

475
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,728
In the chest. So he knew it was me.

476
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,244
Just like this.

477
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,561
You're gonna burn in hell
for what you've done.

478
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,602
It'll be worth it.

479
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,447
Helena?

480
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,169
I didn't have a choice, Oliver.

481
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,887
No one can know my secret.

482
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,289
CSU didn't find any usable prints
except for the three victims'.

483
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,209
One of them had a GSW to the chest.

484
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,722
So who broke the necks
of Salvati and his buddy?

485
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,208
Look, it's been a while
since the hood broke anyone's neck.

486
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,408
And I didn't see any arrows
laying around.

487
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,082
Well, better pray that Frank Bertinelli
blames the hood for this.

488
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,482
Because if he thinks it's the Triad...

489
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,126
...Starling City is ground zero
to World War Ill.

490
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,290
You okay?

491
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,445
- Spoke to my dad today.
- I bet that was fun.

492
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,962
He explained to me what happened
with my credit card yesterday.

493
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,481
And my checking account,
my savings account...

494
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,725
...my brokerage account,
my stock portfolio.

495
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,207
He cut me off completely.

496
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,410
What?

497
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,928
My car got repossessed. That was fun.

498
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,727
And I have to move out of my apartment
by the end of the month.

499
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,486
You are gonna be fine, Tommy.

500
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,446
In fact, you are gonna be great.

501
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,007
Merlyn money or not.

502
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,882
And, you know...

503
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,882
...I have a mushroom
and olive Mario pizza...

504
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,243
...in my refrigerator
waiting to be eaten.

505
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,890
- I suppose it's already paid for, right?
- Exactly.

506
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,080
- When did you get back?
- Just now.

507
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,522
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Hmm.

508
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,643
But did you come home only
because you heard I was hurt?

509
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,805
No.

510
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,968
I was already on my way
when Thea called.

511
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,043
I actually came home
because I missed my wife.

512
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,526
It's okay.

513
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,166
- Is she all right?
- Walter's home.

514
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,531
She's gonna be fine.

515
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,327
Look, I'm sorry if I was a bitch
with you earlier.

516
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,321
There were a few times.

517
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,568
- Could you be more specific?
- Don't push it.

518
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,531
Don't worry. You weren't a bitch.

519
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,407
At the hospital, you were a little...
A little bit.

520
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,760
Look, I'm just worried about you.

521
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,242
You seem really lonely.
And we all have our secrets, Ollie.

522
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,086
Clearly you have yours.

523
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,925
And it's fine
if you don't wanna share them with us.

524
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,762
But I just really think you should
share them with someone.

525
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,364
I'd ask how you got in here...

526
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,520
...but the Starling City vigilante
comes and goes...

527
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,609
...as he pleases, doesn't he?

528
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,084
How'd you know?

529
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,404
I saw you fight.

530
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,647
And I saw your eyes.

531
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,201
That island changed you in ways that
only someone like me could understand.

532
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,890
No.

533
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,685
What you're doing right now...

534
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,083
...I know that it feels like justice,
but it's not.

535
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,483
- It's revenge.
- Sometimes revenge is justice.

536
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,768
- Your father killed your fiancé.
- And what did your father do to you?

537
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,049
Isn't the man in the hood
fighting to set things right?

538
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,686
Why is your vendetta more valid
than mine?

539
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,451
We're the same, you and I.

540
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,407
- No, we're not.
- Heh.

541
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,449
Hiding in plain sight.

542
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,241
Concealing our anger
with smiles and lies.

543
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,528
Don't lie to me, Oliver.

544
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,967
You feel the same as I do. I know it.

545
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,446
Why are you crying?

546
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,169
I don't know.

547
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,925
Maybe it's because I have been alone
in my hate for so long.

548
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,691
- It feels...
- So good to tell the truth.
