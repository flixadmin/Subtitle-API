1
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,084
A couple pretzels, please.

2
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,123
What the heck, make it a dozen.

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,020
I need my salt.

4
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,254
- Taxi! Taxi!
- Thank you.

5
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,227
What the...?

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,968
Taxi! Taxi!

7
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,332
- Here, let me help you.
- I've got it.

8
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,441
No, I don't want you to think
everyone in Central City's a jerk!

9
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,471
Thanks.

10
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,477
- Hey, listen, you okay?
- I'm fine.

11
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,616
Well, I'm from the neighborhood
if you're lost or anything.

12
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:52,878
Are those pretzels?

13
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,615
Yeah. Yeah. Help yourself.

14
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,334
Listen, stop me if I'm out of line here...

15
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,334
...but when was the last time
you had something to eat?

16
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,405
I gotta go. Thanks again.

17
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,232
Sure.

18
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,620
Hello, Stacy.

19
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,994
Can we offer you a lift?

20
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,435
Bodey!

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,168
Hey! Hey!

22
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,378
Somebody help me!

23
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,144
Get away from me!

24
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,613
Come on, Stacy, relax.
Give me the knapsack.

25
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,589
Get away from me.
Why can't you just leave us alone?

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,920
Good question.

27
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,936
Sorry.

28
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,207
I guess dinner's on him.

29
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,782
Are you okay, miss? I heard a scream.

30
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,789
No. It's all right.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,657
- I thought I saw someone chasing you.
- They...

32
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,799
They just wanted my stuff.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,663
No offense, but I saw
what was in your suitcase.

34
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,631
It's hardly worth stealing.

35
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,399
Wait. Wait.

36
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,669
I'm a cop, all right?

37
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,944
Please, let me help you.

38
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:10,818
I would be happy if you could just get us
to a street mission or something.

39
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,515
I am dead broke...

40
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,126
...and we could really use...

41
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,298
...a bed and a hot meal.
- We?

42
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,576
Oh, my goodness,
don't you look beautiful.

43
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,680
What did you tell the landlady
when you borrowed the highchair?

44
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,873
You're now my cousin from Seattle.

45
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,142
- Did she buy that?
- I hope so.

46
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:50,311
I'm telling you, in this building,
gossip is a major-league sport.

47
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,787
Let me do that. You go ahead and eat.
You must be starved.

48
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,619
- Are you sure...?
- Yeah, no problem.

49
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,127
My brother used to bring his kid
into the station.

50
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,391
We'd take turns taking care of him.

51
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,534
He used to take his naps...

52
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,862
...in a desk drawer.
What do you think of that?

53
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,407
Here it comes. Now open that mouth.
Yes. Yes.

54
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,273
Here you go. All right.
Now some for me.

55
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,715
Good.

56
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,580
What? Am I doing this okay?

57
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,657
Better than okay. I'm usually
the only one she lets feed her.

58
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,522
I think she's got a crush on you, Barry.

59
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,859
The feeling is mutual.

60
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,693
There. All right.

61
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,604
Okay.

62
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,365
Stacy...

63
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,637
...what kind of trouble you in?

64
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,307
What do you mean?

65
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,371
Well, back there on the street...

66
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,677
...it seemed like you kept
looking over your shoulder.

67
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,480
Like you thought somebody
was watching you.

68
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,713
Just habit, I guess.

69
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,853
Lily and I have been on the road
a while.

70
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,797
Barry?

71
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,766
- I think Lily's finished.
- What?

72
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,830
Yeah, I think she is.

73
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,537
Come here.

74
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,578
What a mess. What a mess.

75
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,506
Sure it's all right, us staying here?
I mean, you've already done a lot.

76
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,880
What, a little Chinese takeout?
That's no big deal.

77
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,984
Besides, in the morning I'll take you
to a place downtown...

78
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,647
...where you and Lily can stay...

79
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,520
...until you figure things out.

80
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,260
I don't know, Barry.

81
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,431
We're only gonna be in Central City
a couple of days.

82
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,565
Well, think it over, that's all.

83
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,732
Oh, yeah.

84
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,305
Listen, when you're ready,
you can take my room upstairs, okay?

85
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,807
- I'll bunk down here with Earl.
- Thanks.

86
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:56,037
Can you look after her for a couple
of minutes? I'm gonna go wash up.

87
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,342
Yeah, I think I can manage.

88
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,652
Here we go.

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,415
Hey, what's the matter, Earl?

90
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,688
Don't worry, you haven't been replaced.
Besides, you'd love having a baby around.

91
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,091
Okay. Here we are.

92
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,026
Better give me this.

93
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,037
Toy.

94
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,707
We need a baby toy here.

95
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,211
Oh, thanks, Earl,
but pre-chewed is not the idea.

96
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,050
It's a modern world, kid.
Get to know your tools.

97
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,817
Watch.

98
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,222
Very good.
You've played this game before.

99
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,257
Well, just give it a try for a few days.
It's really a good setup here.

100
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,197
Yeah, but I know
how these places work.

101
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,701
There's probably a waiting list
a mile long.

102
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,864
Don't worry about it. I got connections.

103
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,911
- Hi.
- What's the matter?

104
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,842
You too big to hug your mother?

105
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,380
No way. Come over here.

106
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,585
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

107
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,212
Come on in.

108
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,181
You must be Stacy.

109
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,655
And this is Lily. I'm Nora Allen.

110
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,522
- You run this place?
- No.

111
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,857
Voluntary duty, three days a week.

112
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:23,058
Any more than that and his father
would turn our house into a poker parlor.

113
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,261
Come on, let's take the grand tour.

114
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,738
The bedrooms are upstairs.
Each mother and child shares one.

115
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,435
Hi, Annie. And the kitchen is in here.

116
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,777
Everybody helps out,
so be prepared to pitch in.

117
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,681
And this is the dining room.
We also have classes in here.

118
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,516
Childcare, self-defense.

119
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:49,089
And this, Lily, is the playroom.

120
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,488
Hi, Kathy. How's it going?

121
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,635
So, what do you think, Stacy?

122
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,570
It's wonderful.

123
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,136
Why don't we go to my office and talk
about paperwork and all that dull stuff.

124
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,871
Papers?

125
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,909
I mean, if I stay,
it's confidential and everything?

126
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,916
Oh, absolutely.
It's just for our records here.

127
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,822
Okay?

128
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,382
All right.

129
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,820
Kathy, I need you to go to the market.

130
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,860
Barry, will you watch the kids?

131
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,795
What? Me? All of them? I can't do that.

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,595
Of course you can.
We'll only be a few minutes.

133
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,773
Hi.

134
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,135
Say hello to Uncle Barry.

135
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,883
Here you go.

136
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,478
Hungry?

137
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,244
Yeah.

138
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,096
Biscuits? Teething biscuits, huh?

139
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,995
Barry, what's all that crying in here?

140
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,294
Crying? Who's crying?

141
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,804
Barry, why are you eating
teething biscuits?

142
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:47,170
Oh, I got this molar. It's killing me.

143
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,875
Yeah, I agree.

144
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,289
And absolutely no disturbances
after 11 p.m.

145
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,953
If he doesn't get precisely
seven hours of sleep, heads will roll.

146
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,568
Also, we'll need new linens each day.
And I mean new.

147
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,896
Buy them at Caruso's,
put them on the tab.

148
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,902
He'll want fresh fish for supper.
Make sure that it's fresh.

149
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:19,407
If it wasn't sucking seawater an hour ago,
he'll send it back. Got that?

150
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,411
Fine.

151
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,281
Three, two, one.

152
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,551
The Flash? The Flash interceded?

153
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,987
Yes, Mr. Moses.

154
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,856
- And he took the child?
- Actually, we didn't see.

155
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,424
That is, we're not sure whether
Stacy actually had Lily...

156
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,625
Lillian with her.

157
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,771
- And where is Stacy now, Roy?
- We're working on that, sir.

158
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,600
She's out of precise range.
But she hasn't left the city.

159
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,005
The overall field reading
on the homing device...

160
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,578
...is in the southwest sector.

161
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,240
This ionizer won't be sufficient.

162
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,942
- Get half a dozen more. And clear this.
- Yes, sir.

163
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,386
Central City. I was here 10 years ago.

164
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:10,926
It's dirtier than I remember.
Even the air smells decayed.

165
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,623
Do we have any friends here?

166
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,734
Yes, sir. In the police department.
He's already been contacted.

167
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,233
He's keeping his eyes open.

168
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,731
Good. Now, what about this Flash?

169
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,534
There must be a file on him.

170
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,610
Sightings, rumors, et cetera. Get it.

171
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,509
- You saw him?
- Yes, Mr. Moses.

172
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,549
Big guy, red suit.

173
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,787
Thank you. Very informative.

174
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,456
What makes him tick?

175
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,528
Genetic engineering?

176
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,697
Or perhaps he's completely synthetic.

177
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,767
Whatever he is, I have to find
a way to deal with him...

178
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,201
...if he intervenes again.

179
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,565
Interesting.

180
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,410
I want Stacy found tonight.

181
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,240
- Understood?
- No problem, Mr. Moses.

182
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,113
Now, have them send up
a bowl of raw vegetables.

183
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,949
And if they haven't been sterilized...

184
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,715
...you will be.

185
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm sorry, I have to stick by the rules.

186
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,259
No visitors after 5 p.m.
Except with prior consent.

187
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,525
All right? Now, if you'll excuse me.

188
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,499
But Stacy and Lillian are here,
aren't they?

189
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,161
I really can't help you.

190
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:31,298
Mrs. Allen, you were a young girl once.

191
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,445
I'm sure you've had your share...

192
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,309
...of lovers' quarrels
and misunderstandings.

193
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,281
I mean, what kind of life is this?

194
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,855
Alone on the streets with our baby.

195
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,424
Stacy left a good home.

196
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:51,528
She had everything
she could have desired.

197
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,028
And I love her.

198
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,123
I just want to get her back...

199
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,202
...solve our differences,
take care of Lillian properly.

200
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,769
Please...

201
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,370
...can't I just speak to her now,
here, in the lobby, with you present?

202
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,066
I'm afraid that's not possible.

203
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,608
- I'm going to have to insist that you...
- Mrs. Allen.

204
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,972
My husband is coming to pick me up
in a few minutes.

205
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,085
My husband, the ex-policeman.

206
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,984
I understand.

207
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,654
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

208
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,780
She's on the move. But she's close.
The signal's getting stronger.

209
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,444
Just find her, Roy.

210
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,909
I've got it. Bodey, turn right here.

211
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,953
Stacy.

212
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,290
I said I'd find you.

213
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,402
It was such a useless exercise
on your part.

214
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,269
And I was not happy...

215
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,912
...that you exposed Lillian
to the perils of the road.

216
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,706
Give me the baby.

217
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,820
She's safe, Philip. You'll never find her.

218
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,750
Never?

219
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,287
You know me better.

220
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,250
Put her in the car.

221
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,932
I know how people
are about loaning things.

222
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,499
I've got loads of LaserDiscs.
Take what you want.

223
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:40,366
Great, because I have two nights off.
I wanna sit on my couch and watch movies.

224
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,006
Okay. I have all the classics.

225
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,005
<i>The Great Escape</i>,
<i>The Guns of Navarone.</i>

226
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,576
God, Barry, don't you have any
with women in them?

227
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,442
<i>Bullitt. Bullitt.</i>
Yeah, that has a woman. I think.

228
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,508
How about <i>3 Godfathers</i>?

229
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:57,246
Yeah, that's great. It's about these
three cowboys who find a baby.

230
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,253
Oh, boy.

231
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,328
Lily?

232
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,732
One of your adventures before
you became the Flash, eh, Barry?

233
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,568
Lily is Stacy's baby. Why on earth
would she leave her with me?

234
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,301
"Dearest Barry, be back in the morning.
Please take care of Lily. Love..."

235
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,481
A rather annoying cute little drawing
of a heart, "Stacy."

236
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,016
- Are you sure you're not the father?
- Tina, this is no time for comedy.

237
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,983
- What am I gonna do?
- Well, nothing out here.

238
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,724
Take her inside here.

239
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,588
Very quietly. Quietly. It's a baby.

240
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,030
I can't believe this girl would leave
a baby with someone.

241
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,394
Well, she's been running away
from something.

242
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,867
She's obviously very confused.

243
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,871
- But she barely knows...
- No, Tina! You'll wake the baby.

244
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,673
Carefully, carefully.

245
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,006
Okay. There.

246
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:02,148
Besides, it's only for one night.
How difficult could it be?

247
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,487
- Okay. All right. Now, don't panic.
- Okay.

248
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,287
Just rock. Rock. Gently.

249
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,419
Gently. Gently.

250
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,065
- Pick her up.
- Pick her up? Yeah.

251
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,168
I should pick her up. All right, come on.
Come to Uncle Barry.

252
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,736
Come on. It's all right. Yes.

253
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,600
- Maybe she's wet.
- Wet?

254
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,499
- You're a girl. You check.
- Trust me, you'll know.

255
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,509
I'll know. Great. All right. Here we go.

256
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,978
Let's see here. Nope. Dry. Dry.

257
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,344
That doesn't mean
she's gonna stay that way.

258
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,646
Come on. Don't you know
how to handle children?

259
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,288
- Just because I'm a woman?
- Yeah.

260
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,290
Barry, my doctorate's kinetic physics,
not pediatrics. Call an expert.

261
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,655
- Call your mother.
- My mother! That's perfect.

262
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,127
Yeah, she's done this before. Here. Yeah.

263
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,823
Okay. Mom. Right.

264
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,462
I forgot, they're out of town
for the weekend.

265
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,663
Mom, listen, this is Barry.

266
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,240
You've gotta call me immediately
when you get this.

267
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,742
I need some maternal advice ASAP.

268
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,609
This is idiotic.
We're both college graduates.

269
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,809
- Right. We're responsible adults.
- Exactly.

270
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,717
Millions of people do this every day.
We can do this for at least one night.

271
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,551
Maybe she's tired, Barry.

272
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,784
- Hungry! Maybe she's hungry.
- Good idea.

273
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,895
Yeah. See what we've got in there.

274
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,458
I don't think you've got what she wants.
She needs real baby food.

275
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,364
Real baby food? Okay.

276
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,062
All right, I'll make a run.
I'll make a run.

277
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,869
Okay. Well, step on it, Barry.
I don't really know my way around kids.

278
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,568
You'll be fine.

279
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,542
Get used to it, kiddo.

280
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,290
- Oh, there he is.
- I have just the thing.

281
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,661
I know. Here we go.

282
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,491
You're gonna love this.
You're gonna love it.

283
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,360
Okay, here we go. Come on.

284
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,063
Here we go. Here we go.

285
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,831
Come on. Come on. You like this.

286
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,234
Here we go.

287
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,767
All right.

288
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,467
I tell you, you're gonna love it.
Come on, here you go.

289
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,442
- Here you go.
- Maybe we should sing.

290
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,275
- Sing? Sing what?
- Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,105
Well, it's gonna be a long night.

292
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,912
All right, now, where's my daughter?

293
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,515
How did you find me?

294
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,386
I thought you might try
to run away, so...

295
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,983
No.

296
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,695
No!

297
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,386
Give that back!

298
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,227
It's the only thing I have
to remember my parents by.

299
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,762
How sweet.

300
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,997
When you unfortunately discovered
my real business and intentions...

301
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:12,701
...I thought it best to conceal
this small homing beacon...

302
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,473
...in the one thing I knew
you would never part with.

303
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,113
Why can't you just leave us alone?

304
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,118
Because you took something
that belongs to me.

305
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:27,281
Lillian is mine. And one way or another,
I will get her back.

306
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,893
I will not let her be raised
by a criminal!

307
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:34,328
I have never been convicted
of any crime. Never.

308
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,835
Stacy, please, have a seat.

309
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,677
Please.

310
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,245
How could I ever have loved you?

311
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,850
You're so beautiful.

312
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,521
Your mother, Olympic gold medalist,
your father, Nobel-prizewinning chemist.

313
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,592
You carry their greatness.

314
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:07,631
You're a monster.
All you wanted was a test tube!

315
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,261
Stacy, you're young.

316
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,166
You can still have other children,
if you live.

317
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,468
Now, where is my daughter?

318
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,274
- Please, Philip...
- Don't touch me.

319
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,839
- My daughter.
- I will not give up...

320
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,507
...the only good thing I've got.

321
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,086
That's awfully selfish of you, isn't it?
I mean, look at yourself.

322
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,519
You're hardly a fit mother.

323
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:36,191
Whereas I can give Lillian everything.

324
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,659
I would rather she was raised
by strangers...

325
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:42,356
...even if I can never see her again.
- All right.

326
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,166
I'll give you 24 hours to change
your mind, and then...

327
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,766
...l'll have Bodey ask you.

328
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,852
Don't wake the baby.

329
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,235
- Oh, Mom, thank goodness.
- I got your message.

330
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,766
- Is Stacy here?
- No.

331
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,601
She disappeared with Lily
from the home last night.

332
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,437
No. She left Lily here with me
and Tina.

333
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,380
- Tina?
- Barry! Lily's gone!

334
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,913
What?

335
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,982
- What do you mean, she's gone?
- Lily? Lily?

336
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,519
- Lily?
- Lily?

337
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,181
<i>We've got the largest inventory of</i>
<i>large screens anywhere in Central City.</i>

338
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,124
<i>Bad credit?</i>
<i>No problem at Wacky Walter's.</i>

339
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,356
- <i>We carry our own financing.</i>
- I should have known.

340
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,892
Come here, you.

341
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,670
Yeah. Yes, I know, it's loaded.

342
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,365
Give me this. Say bye-bye.

343
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,908
Barry with a baby,
and me without a camera.

344
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,773
Hello, Mrs. Allen. I'm Tina.

345
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,246
It's Nora. It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Tina.

346
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,376
- So, Barry, you two spent the night, huh?
- Mom!

347
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,558
He can blush at the drop of a hat.

348
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,924
Mom, I think the baby needs you.

349
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,429
- Where? Where?
- Over there. Right over there.

350
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,600
Plastic diapers?

351
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,703
Come on, this is the '90s.
You should use cloth.

352
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,736
- There, sweetheart.
- Mom, where's Stacy?

353
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,378
Well, someone came to see her.

354
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,547
He claimed he was a relative.

355
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,615
Nice-looking man,
but I didn't let him in.

356
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,518
And then during the night
she just took off.

357
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,751
Well, she's been on the run
from somebody. Maybe this guy?

358
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,254
- An old boyfriend?
- Well...

359
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,587
...he seemed too mature for Stacy.

360
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,353
And somehow dangerous.

361
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,431
Dangerous, Nora?

362
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:59,766
Maybe I'm just being a policeman's wife,
but I think she's in real trouble.

363
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,202
- Yeah, I picked that up too.
- She's a sweet girl.

364
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,934
I hope she's not abandoning Lily.

365
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,804
Mom, don't call the welfare people
just yet, okay?

366
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,776
I'll see if I can get a line on Stacy.

367
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,008
What do you want me to do with Lily?
Take her to the mothers' home?

368
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,517
No, no, no. Lily is my responsibility.

369
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,849
Yes. I mean, if Stacy
had wanted her to be at the home...

370
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,516
...she'd have left her there, right?
- But, Barry...

371
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,561
I only have a couple hours' computer work
to do at the office.

372
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,394
Besides, if Stacy is in some kind of trouble,
I would be happier if Lily is with me.

373
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,696
- Call if you need me.
- Call if you need me.

374
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,501
- It's okay. It's all right.
- You make a great mother.

375
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,643
If there weren't children present...

376
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,081
Yes. Say bye. Say bye. Bye-bye.

377
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,806
Okay, off to work.

378
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,020
Hey, Allen. Who'd you arrest this time?
"Baby Face" Nelson.

379
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,460
Hey, not so close, Murph.
You're a bad influence.

380
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,829
- Oh, give me a break.
- She's gorgeous. Look at that.

381
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,562
I'm watching her for a friend.

382
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,834
- Hey, what a liberated guy.
- Well, whatever.

383
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,674
I've got work to do.

384
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,745
I didn't know Allen had a kid.

385
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,348
You know what? Neither did he.

386
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,349
Will you knock it off.
Come on, he's just babysitting.

387
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,751
- Come on.
- Why are you always on me?

388
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,017
Because I'm always paying
for the doughnuts.

389
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,791
Now, Stacy said she was from Chicago...

390
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:40,028
...but this says there is no police record
for Stacy Doubek.

391
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:45,208
Let me see if I can find a birth certificate
for Lillian here.

392
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,076
Bingo. "Mother: Doubek, Stacy Anne.

393
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,685
Father: Moses, Philip Mark."

394
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,381
Philip Moses.
Why does that sound familiar?

395
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,956
I don't know. I'll run it through
the federal linkup.

396
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,059
- All right.
- Here you go.

397
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,458
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. You again.

398
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:09,098
That's all right. We're gonna be fine.
We're gonna be fine.

399
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,996
Just figure this out.

400
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,334
Okay. Hey, have I got an idea
for you, huh?

401
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,874
It's all right. No, you're gonna love it.
No. I know.

402
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,807
Yes, yes. Wait till you see it.

403
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,750
Everybody's a critic. Come on.

404
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,648
There you go. I'll be right back.

405
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,755
Don't panic.

406
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,110
Okay. It's all right, princess.
Come with me.

407
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:58,442
Wait till you see what I've got for you.
You are just gonna love it.

408
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,886
All right.

409
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:05,682
All right. There you go.

410
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:10,561
I crosschecked Moses' federal data file.
There's more on the way.

411
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:15,164
Let's see what we've got here.
Oh, yeah.

412
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,825
According to this, your daddy is a real
criminal mastermind. Look at this.

413
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,064
A dozen indictments in five years.

414
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,333
Suspected of murder, sabotage,
espionage, drug trafficking.

415
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,976
No convictions.

416
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,305
According to these
and my mom's description...

417
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,313
...this is the guy who was
at the home looking for Stacy.

418
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,043
- See what else you can find.
- Right.

419
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,650
Think about it, Stacy.

420
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,059
The clock's ticking.

421
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,499
- Hello? Tina McGee.
- <i>Yeah, Tina.</i>

422
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,933
Listen. We got some information
on Stacy...

423
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,004
...but there's only so much
I can do here.

424
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,970
I'm gonna have to hit the streets.

425
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,076
You think maybe you could
look after Lily?

426
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,711
Of course. But you owe me
for this one, Barry.

427
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,110
- Bigtime.
- Don't I know it. See you.

428
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,720
It always looks so easy in the movies.

429
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:03,407
Good girl. I knew you'd find
a way to escape.

430
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,344
Follow her. She'll lead us right to Lily.

431
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,657
Please keep an eye
on your valuables, folks.

432
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,922
It seems there's a brace of pickpockets
working on this block tonight.

433
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,066
- Thank you.
- There you go.

434
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:44,142
Sir, you dropped your wallet.

435
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,086
A little street theater, Fosnight?

436
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,912
- What's next, a mime show in the park?
- Do you know me?

437
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,490
- So does National Express.
- I never felt a thing.

438
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,996
Listen, I need information, all right?
A character named Philip Moses.

439
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,930
I don't know. Moses is bad news. I mean,
the guy's got an ego that can kill you.

440
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,097
Let me see, what's the rap
for counterfeiting? What, 10 years?

441
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,903
Okay. Okay.

442
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,809
If Moses were in town...

443
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,744
...with his pull
and his cleanliness thing...

444
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:23,354
...he's probably at The Highwayman.
But you never heard it from me.

445
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,855
- I never reveal a source.
- You got a light touch, Allen.

446
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,585
You're in the wrong line of work.

447
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,388
Cops.

448
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,962
- Yes?
- Where's Barry?

449
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,540
- Oh, you must be Stacy. I'm Tina.
- You're Barry's girlfriend?

450
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,439
- Well, no, not exactly.
- Oh, you're a very lucky girl.

451
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,444
Barry's a great guy.

452
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:54,745
Oh, sweetie. Oh, did you miss me?

453
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,713
Baby, baby.

454
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,159
Mr. Moses.

455
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,825
- How far do we go?
- We should have no problems.

456
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,269
But if someone gets in our way,
kill them.

457
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,522
She was here.

458
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,393
She escaped.

459
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,924
Or they let her escape.

460
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:46,133
Either way, she'll go to Lillian.

461
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,098
- Who's that?
- Don't answer it.

462
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,606
- Why?
- Don't answer it.

463
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,807
Who do you think you are,
coming in here?

464
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,283
- No.
- Poor, foolish Stacy.

465
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:07,185
Now, you didn't really think
that you escaped on your own, did you?

466
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,519
Please, Philip...

467
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,491
You know why I'm here.

468
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,300
- Philip, please don't hurt anybody.
- That is entirely in your hands.

469
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,809
- Philip, no!
- Now...

470
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:31,845
...give me the child, or the same treatment
shall happen to both of you.

471
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,476
You wouldn't hurt her.
She's your only child.

472
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,678
Don't you dare underestimate me.

473
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,727
Can't you stuff something in her mouth
to shut her up?

474
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,956
That's better.

475
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,658
The baby.

476
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,609
Bodey.

477
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,418
Good girl.

478
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,609
That's the freak who stopped us
the last time.

479
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,121
Lily!

480
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,055
Oh, my God.

481
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,354
Oh, baby.

482
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,857
Are you okay, sweetie?
What did they do to you?

483
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,299
- How did you...?
- You can thank the Flash.

484
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,903
- Are you all right?
- Swell.

485
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,542
Listen, I don't suppose you...

486
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,110
That is, the Flash.
- Got his hands on Moses as well.

487
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,871
No, unfortunately.

488
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,643
But the Flash assures me
he's number one on his hit list.

489
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,879
Now, Stacy...

490
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,079
...I think it's time.

491
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,314
The whole story.

492
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,628
And after you got pregnant, you found out
about Philip's criminal record.

493
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,498
That's when Philip told me
he never really loved me.

494
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,727
That he had used me...

495
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,735
...because I was the perfect mother
for his child.

496
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,566
I just talked to the feds.

497
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,609
They'll assist.

498
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,682
They've been trying to nail Moses
to the wall for years.

499
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,315
You'll never catch him.

500
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,113
He's not giving up until
he gets what he wants.

501
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,655
But if we could set a trap...

502
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,228
No! I will not risk my baby!

503
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:03,128
Listen, you wanna put a stop
to this guy, or what?

504
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,031
I will not let Lily be used as bait!

505
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,035
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

506
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,108
Now, it's your decision.
For you and for Lily.

507
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,336
Sooner or later you're gonna have to
face this problem head-on.

508
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:19,711
- You can't keep running away.
- I'm so confused!

509
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,046
Maybe Philip was right.
Maybe I am an unfit mother.

510
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,053
Now, you listen to me.

511
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:31,391
You are a tough girl, Stacy. A smart girl.
I don't care what Moses says.

512
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,996
Now, your love for Lily
will get you through this...

513
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,191
...whatever you decide.

514
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,732
All right.

515
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,372
Lieutenant Garfield,
I'll help you catch Philip.

516
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,949
We must leave Central City.
But not without my daughter.

517
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:55,313
She's the link to my future. My heiress.

518
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,718
Listen, they just took the girl
over to the home right now.

519
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,024
But there's something
you ought to know about.

520
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,659
I see.

521
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,597
That calls for an appropriate
countermeasure then.

522
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,369
<i>Lieutenant, do you want us to use</i>
<i>procedure code alpha? Over.</i>

523
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:23,742
That's right. I want this done
without the usual fuss.

524
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,214
- Everything's under control.
- Yeah, except my girdle's killing me.

525
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,877
- What, you think you're the only one?
- Hey, guys, knock it off, all right?

526
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,449
We don't wanna wake Lillian.

527
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,087
- <i>Lieutenant.</i>
- Just a minute.

528
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,100
- Heads up.
- All set.

529
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,454
Good evening, ma'am. Evening, ladies.
The main office sent me down.

530
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,617
There seems to be some kind
of power outage in one of your tran...

531
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,387
Oh, look at the baby.

532
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,459
- All right, ladies...
- Freeze, punk.

533
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,098
- Roy.
- I can't believe it.

534
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,135
- He set me up.
- Moses.

535
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,573
Oh, my God. What about Lily?

536
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,538
Barry?

537
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,539
Barry?!

538
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,848
I cleared the back entrance for you.
But there's one uniform on watch upstairs.

539
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,354
We'll deal with him, Mills. Thank you.

540
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,090
Yes. Just in case.

541
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,090
Let's go.

542
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,527
So are you and Sabrina
getting serious?

543
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,264
- Well, I guess.
- Can I help you, gentlemen?

544
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,966
Julio, it's the man
who came to the home!

545
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,771
Bodey.

546
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,917
- You're not going to take that child!
- Oh, really?

547
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,055
That's one woman
I wouldn't threaten, Moses!

548
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,125
I'm ready for you this time,
you speed freak.

549
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,525
This ultrasonic weapon is doing things
to your equilibrium...

550
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,863
...that shouldn't happen to a dog.

551
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,473
Thank you very much.

552
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,749
- Where you been?
- I've been checking with the station.

553
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,282
Mom and Julio are all right.

554
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,319
They just have headaches
the size of Mt. Rushmore.

555
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,154
- You okay?
- Yeah.

556
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,689
According to the FBI,
Moses spent the past few weeks...

557
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,763
...liquidating all his financial holdings
and transferring them into bearer bonds.

558
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:32,460
They figure he's got close
to 10 million in assets.

559
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:36,771
And look at this, huh?
All the exits to the city are covered.

560
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,443
- Highways, trains, the airport...
- Don't bet on it.

561
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,375
Moses is too smart to let himself
get backed into a corner.

562
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,775
He's got an escape route.

563
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,407
What I can't figure is how they knew
where the baby really was...

564
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,783
...and how they got in and out
of police headquarters so easily.

565
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,617
Maybe he had help.

566
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,792
- Meaning what?
- Meaning a man like Moses...

567
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,054
...can buy almost anything.
Or anybody.

568
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,697
I don't like your implication.

569
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,766
Who was on duty
at the back entrance tonight?

570
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,366
- <i>Central City Police.</i>
- This is Garfield.

571
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,975
- Who was on the back door tonight?
- <i>Dave Mills, sir.</i>

572
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:16,580
- Dave Mills? All right, I wanna talk to him.
- <i>He already left.</i>

573
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,146
- He did?
- <i>Yes. He volunteered for roadblock duty.</i>

574
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,580
- When?
- <i>About an hour ago.</i>

575
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,417
Where?

576
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,226
- He volunteered for roadblock duty.
- Where?

577
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,161
Skyline Drive.

578
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,693
That's the road to the old airport.

579
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,532
This is Garfield. I want all available units
out to Skyline Drive now!

580
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,213
Lillian. Lillian, look at this.

581
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,715
You know what this is?
This is a bond. A bearer bond.

582
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,980
And they are better than money
because you can take them anywhere.

583
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,181
And they are all ours.

584
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:05,054
All $ 10 million worth.

585
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,892
Yes. That's right, $ 10 million.

586
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,932
Roadblock up ahead.

587
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,472
I just heard there's a half a dozen units
headed this way.

588
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,236
They must know your escape route.

589
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,438
But the time they get here,
we'll be long gone. Move your car.

590
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,881
If they know about the airfield,
they know about me. You gotta take me.

591
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:32,250
- I don't think so.
- You can't leave me here. I know too much.

592
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,683
You know, I do believe
you're right about that.

593
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,364
Hey!

594
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,742
Okay, here we go. Come on.

595
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,873
Bodey, do something with this,
will you?

596
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,576
Get her to stop that racket.
It's giving me a headache.

597
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,779
Mr. Moses, I think it's wet.

598
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,049
Then change it.

599
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,419
I'm loading the plane. Don't dally.

600
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,491
Don't worry. Don't cry.

601
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,664
Everything's gonna be all right.

602
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,566
It will be as soon
as you're out of her life.

603
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:30,609
Face it, Bodey, you're really not
the maternal type.

604
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,107
I see you more as hard labor.

605
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,919
In fact, I know of an opening
you'd be perfect for:

606
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:43,321
Making license plates for the state
for the next 20 years.

607
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,797
Personally, I think you'd look
a lot better in gray.

608
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,228
Prison gray.

609
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,340
Lily?

610
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,111
You've broken
your last commandment, Moses.

611
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,753
Give me the baby.

612
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:48,323
She is my daughter. Mine!

613
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,494
Oh, well. Easy come, easy go.

614
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,463
No!

615
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,899
No!

616
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,280
No. No!

617
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,614
No! Please!

618
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,889
- All right, move in. Let's get them.
- Yes, sir.

619
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,725
- Lily!
- Spread out around here.

620
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,798
Has anybody seen my baby?

621
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,271
Lily!

622
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,705
Come on. Come on.

623
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,206
Oh, my God.

624
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:42,903
My baby! Has anybody seen my baby?

625
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,415
Sweetie.

626
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,043
Oh, sweetie.

627
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,856
Did you miss me, honey?

628
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,570
- How's Lily?
- I can hardly keep up with her.

629
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,764
- Your mother's been wonderful.
- My mom?

630
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:13,033
- That lady?
- Yeah, your mom.

631
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,040
She got me a job downtown.

632
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,181
I finally think that Lily and I
are gonna be all right.

633
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:23,510
More than anyone else, it's because of you
that Lily and I are still together.

634
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:27,680
Well, I guess the Flash
had something to do with it, huh?

635
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:33,352
Listen, I just want you to know
that if you and Lily ever need anything...

636
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,124
- Mama.
- She said your name.

637
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,268
Yeah, she's just starting to talk.

638
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,270
- Lily, look who's here.
- Hey, cute stuff. How you doing?

639
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,908
- Uncle Barry.
- Flash.

640
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:51,044
- You know, it sounded like she said...
- "Splash." She said, "Splash."

641
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,011
You know, time for her bath, I think.

642
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,175
- Is that what you want? To take a bath?
- I think that's it.

643
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,887
Come on.

644
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,852
- Bye, Barry.
- Bye.

645
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,721
Flash.

646
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,655
Flash.

647
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,328
Kids.

648
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,262
