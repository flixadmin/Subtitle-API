1
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,964
- Well, hello again.
- Hi, I hope we're not too late.

2
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,799
- No, no. Perfect timing.
- Okay.

3
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,968
- Stan, this is my husband, Walt.
- Hi.

4
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,136
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,430
- Sandia laboratories, huh?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,141
I hear some fascinating stuff
goes on out there.

7
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,935
Yeah, well, you know.

8
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,229
Working on anything
you can talk about?

9
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,274
I'm picturing giant space lasers.
Am I right?

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,277
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

11
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:13,156
Giant space lasers? That sounds cool.
I'll bring it up at our next staff meeting.

12
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,493
- Well, just remember I get a cut.
- All right. It's a deal.

13
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,788
So this is it, honey. What do you say?
Wanna take a tour?

14
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,957
- Sure.
- Okay.

15
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,003
Look, how about
I give ya'll some privacy?

16
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:30,757
I'll go out to the car, make a few calls.
Take as much time as you need.

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,719
- All right.
- Okay, thanks.

18
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,974
- He's a nice guy. He doesn't push.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:43,812
So as you can see,
there's this kind of flow going on here.

20
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,856
- It's a nice big living room.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,818
And this is the dining area.

22
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,323
- Oh, the dining area. Right.
- Yes. Oh, and...

23
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,450
It's got a pool.

24
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,286
Pool is nice.

25
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,289
Backyard could be a little bigger.

26
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:07,502
And... oh, there's a breakfast bar
kind of dealie here, which is nice.

27
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,631
And, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious...

28
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,675
And, you know,
got good appliances and...

29
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,552
How many bedrooms?

30
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,679
Three. Told you.

31
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,975
They're all pretty good size and...
Oh, this is the first one here.

32
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,561
And then there's two more
at the back.

33
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,730
Only three bedrooms?

34
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,691
We're gonna need at least five,
don't you think?

35
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,237
What, do I look like
I'm about to drop a litter?

36
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:39,826
No, no, no.
We'll have three kids total, eventually.

37
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,537
Yeah, but we'll need
a spare room for a study...

38
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,874
So that I can work at home
and you can write.

39
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,879
Yeah, no.
I don't think this is gonna be enough.

40
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,050
Okay, what about a wine cellar?

41
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,054
I mean, we certainly cannot be
expected to live without a wine cellar.

42
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:03,225
Very funny. I just think we need
to set our sights high is all.

43
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:08,397
- At least, higher than here.
- Walt, this is a good neighborhood.

44
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,733
It's got a good elementary
and a very good high school...

45
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,905
And believe me, because I have
definitely looked everywhere.

46
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,783
For our price range,
this is as good as it gets.

47
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,953
Well, then let's stretch our price range.

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,871
Truly. I mean, why...?

49
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,251
Why buy a starter house when we'll
have to move out in a year or two?

50
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,753
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,755
I'm serious.

52
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,426
Come on. Why be cautious?

53
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,470
We've got nowhere to go but up.

54
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,065
- Yeah.
- Walter, you see us?

55
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,775
Yeah. I see you.

56
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,905
I 'd like you to exit your vehicle
and start walking toward us.

57
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,993
And then what?
I'm gonna need some...

58
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,246
Some kind of assurance.

59
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,416
I assure you,
I could kill you from way over here...

60
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,294
If it makes you feel any better.

61
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,143
Walter, you've been busy.

62
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:19,147
You wanna put your arms out
to your sides for me, if you would?

63
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,958
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

64
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,127
I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

65
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,129
I need my sleep.

66
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,342
You said no half measures.

67
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:53,181
Yeah. Funny how words can be so open
to interpretation.

68
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,352
- You get your car fixed?
- Not yet.

69
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,854
You're gonna wanna
getyourcarfixed.

70
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,983
Let's see how this goes first.

71
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,853
Has your condition worsened?

72
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,856
- Excuse me?
- Your medical condition.

73
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,942
- Has it grown worse?
- Not that I know of, no.

74
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,737
Is there a ringing in your ears?

75
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,448
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

76
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:57,412
- I'm quite well, thank you.
- No. Clearly, you are not.

77
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,957
No rational person would do
as you have done.

78
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,045
Explain yourself.

79
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,051
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

80
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,719
I intervened.

81
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,305
Some worthless junkie.

82
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,600
For him, you intervene
and put us all at risk.

83
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,604
Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
keep the peace for eight hours.

84
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,273
That's right. He couldn't.

85
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,942
He was angry
because those dealers of yours...

86
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,278
Had just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

87
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,322
I heard about it.

88
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,283
He should have
let me take care of them.

89
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,243
Maybe.

90
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,581
Then again, maybe he thought
it was you who gave the order.

91
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:50,131
Are you asking me
if I ordered the murder of a child?

92
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,427
I would never ask you that.

93
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,851
Where is Pinkman now?

94
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,106
I wouldn't know.

95
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,818
Couple of time zones away, at least.

96
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,363
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.

97
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,992
He has enough money to last forever,
he knows he needs to keep moving.

98
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,786
You'll never find him.

99
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,830
I don't know, Walt...

100
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,250
It's what I do, after all.

101
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,212
He's out of the picture.

102
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,508
I saved his life, I owed him that,
but now he and I are done.

103
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,845
Which is exactly what you wanted,
isn't it?

104
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,853
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man.

105
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,523
So if I may,
I would like to review options with you.

106
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,569
Of which, it seems to me,
you have two.

107
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,779
Option a:

108
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,823
You kill me right here and now.

109
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,909
Apparently,
I have made that very easy for you.

110
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,704
You can kill me, no witnesses...

111
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,708
And then spend the next few weeks
or months...

112
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,711
Tracking down Jesse Pinkman
and you kill him too.

113
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,340
A pointless exercise, it seems to me,
but that is option a.

114
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,176
What is option b?

115
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,719
I continue cooking.

116
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,763
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

117
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,224
We forget this ever happened.

118
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,060
We consider this a lone hiccup...

119
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:31,065
In an othennise long
and fruitful business arrangement.

120
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,236
I prefer option b.

121
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,078
You'd need a new assistant.

122
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,457
- I could get right on that.
- No.

123
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,918
This time, I choose.

124
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,769
Your car...

125
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,604
Get it fixed.

126
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,647
Really?

127
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,718
It's good to see you.

128
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,433
It's good to be back.

129
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,311
Well, shall we?

130
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,481
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

131
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,036
What about that rhinoceros?
You think he'd make a good pet?

132
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,707
Don't you think if you called,
he'd come running?

133
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,877
I bet he would.
I bet he'd come running:

134
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,879
You're silly, pop-pop.

135
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,174
Well, a little. But he'd probably
knock everything over.

136
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,928
- Plus, there's that big nose of his.
- That's not a nose, that's a horn.

137
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,350
- Is that so?
- His real nose is little.

138
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,854
I learn all kinds of things
being with you.

139
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,068
Okay, June bug, these are for you.

140
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,570
- What about the rest?
- The rest are for me.

141
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,239
No, they're not.
You're too old for balloons.

142
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:30,912
You're never too old for balloons.
Give me a hug.

143
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,373
I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.

144
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,042
- Bye, pop-pop.
- Bye, baby.

145
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,379
Hi, sweetie.
Did you have fun with pop-pop?

146
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:47,403
http://hiqve.com/

147
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,879
Please. Please, no.

148
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,459
Chow, you have anything
you wanna tell me?

149
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,421
Thank god you're here.
They keep me prisoner.

150
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,466
- They keep you prisoner.
- I don't do nothing for them ever.

151
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,803
They try and make me. I say, no.

152
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,142
They steal my chemicals.
I can't stop them. I am businessman.

153
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,811
You're a business...
The lady out front...

154
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,607
Hey, lady, are you still there?
Ask her if she's still there.

155
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,956
She says, yes.

156
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,836
How's her driving? Driving.
Is she good behind the wheel?

157
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,505
Good. She's good driver.

158
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,342
Licensed? Dependable?

159
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,843
She has a camry.

160
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,685
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

161
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,689
I strongly recommend
that you return our calls next time.

162
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,025
So have her drive you to the hospital.

163
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,324
She's gonna need her shoe.

164
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,046
- Where'd they cross?
- Laredo, looks like.

165
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,882
They didn't exactly send
their a players.

166
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,052
But like you said, it's cartel, all right.

167
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,223
Probing for weakness.

168
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,018
Well, they didn't find any.

169
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,898
What about Pinkman?

170
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,360
I'm making inquiries.

171
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:14,046
Yeah, that's two.
All right, let's close it up.

172
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,431
All right, bring it down.

173
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,225
You ready?

174
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,982
Okay, we're good.

175
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,115
You can take your mask off now.

176
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,085
Does that guy ever leave?

177
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,966
When exactly did that start?

178
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,385
It's new.

179
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,809
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

180
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,271
- Sorry to hear that.
- No, it'll be fine.

181
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,649
Things will continue
to smooth out and...

182
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,194
Yeah, it'll be fine.

183
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:25,201
By the way, if you're at all worried
about working with me...

184
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,328
No, I'm not.

185
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,538
Whatever my shortcomings
last time...

186
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,000
I intend for things to go perfectly
from here on out.

187
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,837
- So if there is...?
- Gale, you're great.

188
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,673
- Seriously.
- I just...

189
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,012
However you like things to be done
is exactly how we're gonna do them.

190
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,014
Penod.

191
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,726
From here on out, so...

192
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,438
Please, teach me.

193
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,822
Okay.

194
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,114
Gale. It's good to see you.

195
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,949
Mr. Fring.

196
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,784
Wow, this is...

197
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,246
I should have called.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

198
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,459
No. No, no, not at all.
Please, come in.

199
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,922
Can I offer you something?
A creme de menthe?

200
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,799
No. No, thank you.

201
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,469
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

202
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:52,848
Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.

203
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,852
I need to talk to you
about something.

204
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,480
Something rather pressing.

205
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,362
If push came to shove,
I was wondering...

206
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,491
How soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

207
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,826
You and an assistant.

208
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,287
Why would...?

209
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:20,668
- Why would push come to shove?
- Has Walter ever talked to you...

210
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,505
About why he got into
this particular line of work?

211
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,009
I guess I assumed
it was because it pays so well.

212
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,845
It is, but specifically...

213
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,015
Has he ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

214
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:42,106
I'm not surprised.
He's a very private person.

215
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:45,567
What exactly
are his health problems?

216
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,028
He's dying of cancer.

217
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:53,492
It is why he does this, to provide for
his family, which he's accomplished.

218
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,871
They will never want for anything,
he's seen to that.

219
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,627
How long does he have?

220
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,881
That is very much the question.

221
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:12,428
He does not wanna talk about it.
And every time I bring it up with him...

222
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:19,184
I don't know that he's fully accepted
the reality of it.

223
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:24,148
And not to sound cold-blooded,
but I am running a business here.

224
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:29,361
- No, I understand.
- I have a very large investment in this.

225
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,698
There's so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down.

226
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,241
Not even for a week.

227
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,870
So you understand my concern.

228
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,081
And my desire for continuity.

229
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,750
I do. Absolutely.

230
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:47,129
Now, I intend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants...

231
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:51,258
Assuming that
he's physically up to it.

232
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:57,139
But as he cannot or will not tell me
how long that might be...

233
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:02,227
I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

234
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,481
Well, worst-case scenario...

235
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,782
I suppose if we had...

236
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,243
At least a few more cooks together.

237
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,580
You don't think you're ready now?

238
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,957
Well, I mean...

239
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,627
He is such a...

240
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,004
A master.

241
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,466
There's always more for me to learn.

242
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:39,473
But I'm thinking that if we had...

243
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,433
Say...

244
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,852
One or two more cooks.

245
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,734
One more...

246
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,779
I guess would do it. I suppose.

247
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,449
I believe in you, Gale.

248
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:03,163
I know that when the time comes,
you will be ready.

249
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,846
What's up?

250
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,147
Walt, is there...?

251
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:37,698
Any particular trick
to purging the catalyst bed?

252
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:44,705
No, it's pretty straightfonnard.
I'll show you when we get there.

253
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,316
Yeah?

254
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,735
Tell him I'm in conference.

255
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,954
- I'm in conference.
- I'm looking to find a client of yours.

256
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,916
I was hoping you could help me out
with an address.

257
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,252
- Which client?
- Jesse Pinkman.

258
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,547
Jesse-Pinkman-in-the-phone-book
Jesse Pinkman.

259
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,259
How would one track him down,
I wonder.

260
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,265
- You're still here.
- I need your full attention, Saul.

261
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,601
Jesse Pinkman.
Current whereabouts.

262
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,480
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you get back to whatever this is.

263
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,942
What am I, an 8th-grade hall monitor?
Current whereabouts.

264
00:28:55,108 --> 00:29:00,280
- Let me tell you something, Mike, you...
- Whoa, you are good right there.

265
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:03,617
Now, let's both get comfortable.

266
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,748
Now, when I say,
I'm looking for Pinkman...

267
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,251
We both know why, don't we?

268
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:17,881
You pretending othennise only wastes
my time and serves to annoy me.

269
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,508
Look, Mike...

270
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,469
There are rules to this lawyer thing.

271
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,680
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

272
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,266
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

273
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,601
That's something I provide for you.

274
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,645
So if I give up Pinkman...

275
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:35,315
Then you're gonna be asking,
"Saul gives them up pretty easy.

276
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,026
What's to keep him
from giving me up?" You see?

277
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,153
So then, where's the trust?

278
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,825
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

279
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,496
Yeah, that's an argument.

280
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:56,128
Don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

281
00:29:56,503 --> 00:30:00,632
Now tell me where to find him.
You know it's the right thing.

282
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:09,182
I can't tell you, Mike, all right? I...

283
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:15,355
Look, if I was to tell you, well, I just...
I couldn't live with myself.

284
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,190
I'm sorry.

285
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,196
But who's to say I didn't write
the address down in my day planner?

286
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,867
Or on a scratch piece of paper
somewhere?

287
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,995
Who's to say
I didn't write down a location...

288
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,498
Strictly for
my own professional use?

289
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,754
Do not touch anything on my desk.

290
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,966
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a nescafé.

291
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:03,904
I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
Like a mother hen.

292
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:09,242
Money-laundering ain't what it used
to be. God, do I miss the '803.

293
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,705
You're wasting your time.
I'm buying the car wash, end of story.

294
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,626
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so...

295
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,230
Was I right? Where else you gonna find
a cash-only business that's this fun?

296
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:43,443
Unless we're talking massage parlors,
and, I don't see it. Shall we?

297
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,620
You ever actually play laser tag?

298
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,916
You know, it's good cardio.
Plus, you get to shoot at kids.

299
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,344
You got your bumper cars over there
down that way.

300
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,180
Got your arcade here,
all the latest video games.

301
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,351
Snack bar's there. Nothing stopping
you from selling beer to the parents.

302
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,690
- That's a whole new revenue stream...
- All right, already. We're good.

303
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,609
Holy Christ.

304
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,821
We're good? This constitutes good
where you're from?

305
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,824
- My car is bugged?
- I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.

306
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:34,202
I'm being followed?
What the hell have you gotten me into?

307
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,290
My own pi is threatening to break
my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum...

308
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,668
Threatening that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

309
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,172
Over and above.
Service-wise, this is over and above.

310
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,340
You and I survive this...

311
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,010
I'm seriously rethinking
my pricing, yeah.

312
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,346
And that goes double for you,
hip-hop.

313
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,348
Okay, my guy's no dummy, right?

314
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,895
I give us maybe 24 hours before he
figures out that address goes nowhere.

315
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,814
You guys do your thing,
make it snappy.

316
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,359
I'll go see if they have "Tetris"
or something.

317
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,119
So how you holding up?

318
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,624
You?

319
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,168
I got my old job back.

320
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,671
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

321
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:31,510
- So he's their boy, huh?
- He's their boy.

322
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,054
How long you think you've got?

323
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,392
Well, he asks a lot of questions
about the cooking process.

324
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,730
I try to be as vague as possible,
but I got that guy Victor watching me...

325
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,525
Listening to every word I say.

326
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:52,030
You know, maybe that the only thing
saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.

327
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:57,160
And once he feels confident
that he knows my entire method...

328
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,584
So, what do we do?

329
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,590
You know what we do.

330
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,768
There's got to be some other way.

331
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:27,107
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

332
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:32,487
All right? I mean,
I can't believe I'm saying that and all...

333
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,656
But for your family.

334
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,952
The DEA would love you,
all the shit you could tell them.

335
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,122
Federal witness protection,
that's a good deal.

336
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:47,294
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.
I mean, I'll make it.

337
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,965
We had a good run.

338
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,135
But it's over.

339
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,477
The cook can't stop.

340
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,982
That's the one thing I'm certain of,
production cannot stop.

341
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,443
Gus can't afford to.

342
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,155
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got...

343
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,659
Then I've got leverage,
and leverage keeps me alive.

344
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,246
It keeps you alive too.
I think I can see to that.

345
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,960
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.

346
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:42,474
I can't do it, Mr. White.

347
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,061
Like you said, I'm...

348
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,189
I'm not a...

349
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,817
I can't do it.

350
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:06,539
I'm gonna need your help.

351
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,917
I mean,
they're watching me day and night.

352
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,379
They never leave me alone with Gale,
not for a moment.

353
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,173
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

354
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,094
He's not in the phone book,
I can't find him on the Internet...

355
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:23,056
And I can't do it in the lab,
Victor's always there.

356
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,102
But if I could just...

357
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,271
Shake Victor,
for even an hour one night...

358
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,899
I think then that...

359
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,694
I may be able...

360
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,074
To make it look like an accident.

361
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,621
There's got to be some other way.

362
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,708
I'm all ears.

363
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,754
But when it comes down to you and me
versus him, I'm sorry.

364
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,549
I'm truly sorry...

365
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,760
But it's gonna be him.

366
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,432
Now, you are the only edge
that I've got...

367
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,560
As long as they don't know
that you're in town.

368
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,105
But I need you to track him,
get me his address.

369
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:25,118
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

370
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,083
Are you gonna save mine?

371
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,657
Yeah?

372
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,534
Please, tell me you found him.

373
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,373
6353 Juan tabo boulevard.
Apartment 6.

374
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,379
- You there?
- Yeah.

375
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,883
6353 Juan tabo. Number 6. Got it.

376
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:09,722
- He's home?
- Yep.

377
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,225
Anyone watching the place?

378
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,979
No. Looks pretty much wide-open.

379
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,398
When are you gonna do it?

380
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,404
Tonight.

381
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,739
Once it gets dark.

382
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,079
Don't do this, Mr. White.

383
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:37,417
Please. Go to the cops.

384
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,658
We got a problem.

385
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,620
Some kind of chemical leaking
in your lab.

386
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,455
Better come with me.

387
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,960
I'll follow you.

388
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,256
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
Come on, get in the car.

389
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,366
I don't know if it's a barrel leak...

390
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,828
But you got something
mighty stinky down there.

391
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,500
After you.

392
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:49,882
Walter, the sooner you figure out what
this is, the sooner we all go home.

393
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,681
Please, don't do this.

394
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,686
You don't have to do this.

395
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,857
Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter.

396
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,608
Downstairs.

397
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:12,071
I'll cook. I'll cook for free. There won't
be any more trouble, I promise you.

398
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,906
- No.
- If I could talk to Gus...

399
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,950
- No.
- I can make him understand.

400
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,453
If I could talk to Gus,
I can convince him.

401
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,538
Just let me, please... please.

402
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,459
- Please, let me talk to him.
- Shut up! Shut up.

403
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,464
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

404
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,761
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

405
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:38,431
Like you said, he's the problem.
He's always been the problem.

406
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:42,393
And without him, we would...
And he's in town, all right?

407
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,271
He's not in Virginia
or wherever you're looking.

408
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,775
He's right here in Albuquerque
and I could take you to him.

409
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,277
I'll take you right to him.

410
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,948
- What do you say?
- Where is he?

411
00:42:56,115 --> 00:43:00,119
- Right now, you give me an address.
- I don't... he moves. He moves around.

412
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,081
But if you let me call him...
No, no, please.

413
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,958
No, I just... my phone. I'll just...

414
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:10,296
It's just my phone. I'll call him
and I'll have him meet me.

415
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,632
All right? Okay?

416
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,467
Okay?

417
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,258
Did you do it?

418
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,846
Mr. White?

419
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,181
Did you do it?

420
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,684
No, I didn't do it.

421
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,687
I can't now.

422
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:12,024
- It's gonna have to be you.
- What? No way, man.

423
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,361
You're closer than we are.
You'll have a 20-minute lead.

424
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,197
They've got me,
they're going to kill me.

425
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,575
- Jesse, do it now! Do it!
- Son of a bitch!

426
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,034
Do it, Jesse! Do it!

427
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,004
Just what the hell was that exactly?

428
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,922
You might wanna hold off.

429
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,549
Yeah?

430
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:40,678
- —Why?
- Because your boss is gonna need me.

431
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:47,518
6353 Juan tabo, apartment 6.

432
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,113
Hi. How can I help you?

433
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,956
Take whatever you want.

434
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,584
I have money. I have...

435
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,379
I got a lot of money.

436
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,965
Ihave_"

437
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,684
Please, don't do this.

438
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,479
You don't... you...

439
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:20,152
You... you don't have to do this.
