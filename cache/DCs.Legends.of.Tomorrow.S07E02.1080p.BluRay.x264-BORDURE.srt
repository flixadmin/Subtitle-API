1
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,801
Any chance of getting this thing
running again?

2
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:12,472
The simplicity of the thermosyphon
cooling is sheer elegance.

3
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:14,766
The capitalist dictate
of constant improvement

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,186
often pushes us past the pinnacle
of achievement into inferior products.

5
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:21,189
And this your brain off of drugs?

6
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,525
Hey, don't weed shame me. I know stuff.

7
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,110
So, is that a yes? Because, soon enough,

8
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:27,838
someone's gonna see
that J. Edgar Hoover's missing,

9
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:28,964
and the timeline's gonna start changing.

10
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,032
If I can find some water, yes.

11
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,515
Oh, Gary, can you check the back seat
for some water, please?

12
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,411
I think I saw something
under Hoover's coat.

13
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:37,789
Please don't mention his name.

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,958
This guy is giving me
terrible indigestion.

15
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,573
It was probably all those cigars. Ugh!

16
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,962
Or all the bigotry.

17
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,131
Oh!

18
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,718
Uh, I've got some soda. Does that work?

19
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:52,178
We'll find out.

20
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:53,805
How about this?

21
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,099
A radio!

22
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,601
Oh. We can pick up some newscasts.

23
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,744
<i>The lovely and lethal
Bullet Blondes remain at large.</i>

24
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,695
<i>Last seen driving east
on the Bankhead Highway.</i>

25
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,906
<i>Caution advised.
They are considered armed and dangerous.</i>

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,242
Huh. I can't believe the name stuck.

27
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,910
Yeah, and they didn't mention Hoover,

28
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:17,745
which means
they think he's still alive.

29
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:19,706
Well, he's not.

30
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,004
Nate, what's up?

31
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,807
We've gotten out of tighter spots
than this.

32
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,591
Have we?

33
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,551
Mick's gone, Astra's down for the count,

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,554
Zari is nursing a broken heart
in a pocket dimension,

35
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,639
and I killed J. Edgar Hoover.

36
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:39,159
It was an accident, and it could have
happened to any man of steel.

37
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,183
That's not funny.

38
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,687
I spent my whole life studying history,

39
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,939
making sure
it's preserved and passed on.

40
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,151
By killing Hoover, I personally
messed up the entire 20th century.

41
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,611
Look, we're gonna fix it, okay?

42
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,155
Are we?
Because without Gideon or the ship,

43
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,781
there's no way you can guarantee that.

44
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:54,907
Nate, you are spinning.

45
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,367
I murdered a man, Sara.

46
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,494
And for the first time in our lives,

47
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,414
we have to accept that
that could be permanent.

48
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:02,789
Okay, look...

49
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:05,585
Uh... Wife, Nate,
we've got a big problem.

50
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,480
Hoover was supposed to be on a train to
New York from Midland, this afternoon.

51
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,757
If he's not there,
the whole timeline's screwed.

52
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,259
No, it won't be.

53
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:17,972
Nate, history needs saving,
and you are just the man to do it.

54
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,433
So long as the world thinks
that Hoover is still alive,

55
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,185
then the timeline remains on track.

56
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,354
No, no, no.
I know what you're thinking. No.

57
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:27,106
There's no way I can impersonate Hoover
all the way to New York.

58
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,067
I could barely do it
in some podunk Texas town.

59
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,779
- Gary!
- Huh?

60
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,782
Can you do some kind of spell
and make him look like Hoover?

61
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:38,159
Uh...

62
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:44,999
Technically, yes, but I'd need some
of Hoover's spit, or a fingernail.

63
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,088
Or hair.

64
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,344
We're mobile, people.

65
00:02:56,803 --> 00:03:01,099
Well, good, because J. Edgar Hoover
has a train to catch.

66
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,501
I did a spell to resurrect a machine.

67
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,294
I don't know what this is.

68
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,047
I'd recognize
that smug little smile anywhere.

69
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:34,548
It is Gideon.

70
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,260
She doesn't look like a machine.

71
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,679
Well, not a machine exactly, <i>Mami.</i>

72
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:44,016
A computer, who speaks. Usually.

73
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,186
Hello, computer.

74
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,441
On the upside, it looks like
you got your magic working again.

75
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,860
My magic is clearly garbage.

76
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,236
Stop that.

77
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,156
She's still Gideon though, right?

78
00:03:58,823 --> 00:03:59,907
What's two plus two?

79
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,285
There you go.

80
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:11,335
Wow. Computers are very exciting.

81
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:14,755
Sorry.

82
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,180
Is it ready?

83
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:26,017
Not yet, it needs to fully ferment.
This is just the primary stage.

84
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,120
Okay, we need to come up with
some kind of distraction or something

85
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,831
because that train leaves in five
minutes and Hoover needs to be on it.

86
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,399
And to the public eye, he will be.

87
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,902
Look, because they're
not gonna be looking at him.

88
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:42,116
No, they are going to be looking
at the most wanted women in America.

89
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
What?

90
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:47,163
- Oh, I'm not sure about this.
- Just follow my lead. Come on.

91
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,917
My safe word is "core competency."

92
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,632
Coming through here.
Look out, we've got the Bullet Blondes!

93
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,325
This isn't the last you're gonna hear
of the Bullet Blondes.

94
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,844
That's right, coppers.

95
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,538
Who you calling the cops?

96
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,782
We're the Bureau of Investigation.

97
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,975
That's right, and J. Edgar Hoover
always gets his man, or woman,

98
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,520
or gender nonconforming individual.

99
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,272
I'll need four extra tickets
for my associates.

100
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,566
Are those the Bullet Blondes?

101
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,736
Well, we're not a pair
of cancelled stamps.

102
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,781
Mr. Hoover, let me find some seats
for you and your men.

103
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,832
Our most secure cabin
is the honeymoon suite.

104
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:39,298
In the name of J. Edgar Hoover,
I am commandeering this cabin.

105
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:42,969
Oh, no. No need to commandeer.
We don't wanna spoil your honeymoon.

106
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,846
Spoil? Phonus balonus.

107
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:49,350
After them Palmer Raids, we'd be proud
to help out a patriot like Mr. Hoover.

108
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,775
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, best wishes.

109
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:04,615
Phew! That was close.

110
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,409
Can you please take these off now?

111
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,741
What were the Palmer Raids?

112
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:14,166
After World War I, America
was freaking out about communism.

113
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:18,796
So Hoover and the DOJ arrested thousands
of immigrants, union workers,

114
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,715
anything that smelled like
organized labor.

115
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,800
A real champion of civil liberties.

116
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,220
Oh, he pretty much codified racial bias
into our judicial system.

117
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:29,390
Okay, but morally, he's repulsive.

118
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,434
Historically, however,

119
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,729
he's one of the most important men
of the 20th century.

120
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,481
He founded the FBI.
He ran it till he died.

121
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:40,026
Yeah, well, great men
aren't usually good guys.

122
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,405
And that is our cue to disappear.

123
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,282
Oh, B, key me.

124
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,454
The key, Time Bureau manual
and some honeymoon chocolates.

125
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,582
Say hi to Z for me.

126
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,636
<i>Capitáns,</i> hey.

127
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,012
Are we home yet?

128
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,931
How did your bank robbery go?

129
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,391
Did we figure out
who blew up the <i>Waverider</i> yet or no?

130
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,727
Am I talking too much?
Am I talking not too much?

131
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,938
- I think she's a little high.
- I'd say very.

132
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,272
We're still in 1925.

133
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,815
And now we're on a train.

134
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,152
What? Where are we going?

135
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:27,323
But really, where is
anybody really going?

136
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,700
You okay, Z?
I thought you didn't partake.

137
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,039
See, I found myself on a journey,

138
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,584
and that journey
is with these tiny little bears.

139
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,755
And I'm going on that journey
à la carte.

140
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,052
Allah carte!

141
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,971
Allah... carte.

142
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:51,639
Okay, well, we'll be upstairs.

143
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,517
Yeah, if you need anything, please don't
hesitate to come and find us.

144
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,560
Actually, hesitate a little.

145
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,854
- Oh. Hesitate a lot.
- Mmm!

146
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,274
Ugh. Gross moms.

147
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,657
Hey. Maybe we won't even
need that potion.

148
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,801
We just hide out in the cabin.

149
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,910
You in there, Speed?

150
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,453
"Speed"?

151
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,515
That was Hoover's nickname.

152
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,139
Only his closest friends
called him that.

153
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,333
It's Francis Baker.

154
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,293
Junior, of course.

155
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:25,297
Oh, the GW boys are gonna go wild
when I tell them I saw you.

156
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,592
- Gary, potion.
- It's frothing ready.

157
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,761
All right, how long does the spell last?

158
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:34,306
It depends upon your metabolism.
Could be an hour. Could be 24.

159
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,435
Hey. It sounds like Hoover
was a supreme douche.

160
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,478
You really sure you want to be him?

161
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,731
I have to clean up my mess, B.

162
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,318
Wait, don't drink it in front of us.

163
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,159
Did it work?

164
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,137
We don't know,
since you drank it in front of us,

165
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:57,389
we'll only know if the magic works
when someone else sees you.

166
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,414
For the love of...

167
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,877
This is silly.
Let me see your...

168
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:06,464
face.

169
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,220
Edgar, there's that handsome mug.

170
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,857
Let me buy you lunch, Speed.

171
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,778
The oysters here give Old Ebbitt's
a run for their money.

172
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:40,372
Director of the
Bureau of Investigation at 29.

173
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,166
Speed indeed.

174
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,463
I think you fellas
will be more comfortable elsewhere.

175
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:53,928
Yeah, sure.

176
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,429
More comfortable.

177
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,274
Ew.

178
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:09,485
No, thank you.

179
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:12,196
Oh. She made a little doll.

180
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,448
I wish the Legends
would just get back already.

181
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:16,009
They would know exactly
what to do with her

182
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,618
and her creepy outsider apple art.

183
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,912
They can't find this Dr. Davies guy
soon enough.

184
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,085
Oh! Oh, Gideon!

185
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,923
Great, now she's broken.

186
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,057
Hey! You okay?

187
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,103
Yeah, why?

188
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,523
Oh, man. Are you mad
that we're honeymooning in your house

189
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,316
after everything that
happened with John...

190
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,985
Shh, Aves,

191
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,195
I love you.

192
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,780
I love you both.

193
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,074
I love your love.

194
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,827
I love that you're loving each other
right now,

195
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,747
even if that love is happening directly
above me while I eat sugar foam.

196
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:09,170
Okay, well, if you ever want to talk
or anything, just come find me.

197
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:13,299
No, seriously, I am A-okay, golden.

198
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,137
You know what, just hear me out, Z.

199
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,723
No judgment, okay? I'm just...

200
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,493
I think you and Behrad
are very different people,

201
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,895
and I think that maybe
your coping mechanisms

202
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,938
might not be the same
as his coping mechanisms.

203
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,985
You know, honestly, I'm not sure that
I'm doing this stoned thing correctly

204
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:38,657
because I either feel like very hungry,
or tired all of the time.

205
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,618
That can't be it. Can that be it?

206
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,329
I don't know. You're a doer, though,
you know, you're like me.

207
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,372
Oh, it's true, I love a project.

208
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,933
You love a project?
Let's find you a project.

209
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,293
Ooh! Cleaning. Cleaning!
That's a good one.

210
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,818
I'm gonna clean this place.

211
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,838
I'm gonna clean this place
clean of John vibes.

212
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:54,506
Yes! Yes, that's my girl.

213
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,841
You know, at minimum,

214
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,053
it will give me an excuse
to leave this room because...

215
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,180
you guys are very loud.

216
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,682
What? Come on, we're not loud.

217
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,188
"Core competency." Boop!

218
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,776
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

219
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,028
God!

220
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,876
So, tell me, is there a Mrs. Hoover?

221
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,003
Oh, no, ma'am. I'm married to my job.

222
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,506
Well, let me give you my card

223
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,092
in case you and your job
ever get divorced.

224
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,013
My purse, it's gone!

225
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,556
Never fear, madam.

226
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,811
You have the nation's finest detective
at your service.

227
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,482
Should we round up the usual suspects?

228
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,533
Those are my men.

229
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:17,298
No one is leaving this car
till we get that purse back.

230
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,926
Now, what was in your purse?

231
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:22,927
Jewelry?

232
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:28,309
Money?

233
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:34,898
Anything of note?

234
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,486
Hmm...

235
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,156
My calling card, my comb,

236
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,867
and one of those delightful pastries
from the breakfast cart.

237
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,454
You never know when you might get
a flash of the grumblies.

238
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,833
Hmm. Oh, my.

239
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,090
Goldie!

240
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,053
I believe this is
what you're looking for.

241
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,346
Huzzah!

242
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,431
Thank you, Mr. Hoover.

243
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,579
- Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!
- Thank you. Thank you.

244
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,895
Stop. What are you doing?

245
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,943
Oh.

246
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,820
Well, I must get back to work.

247
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:26,200
If only all the bad guys
were as easy to catch as Goldie here.

248
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,828
Marvelous seeing you,
Francis Baker Jr., of course. Okay.

249
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,248
It's working, they're buying it.

250
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,519
Yeah, they're buying that Gary and I
are petty thieves because of our looks.

251
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,962
I'm trying to be as authentically Hoover
as possible.

252
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,048
I wouldn't mind
a little less authenticity.

253
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:44,802
Why don't we go back to Plan A?
Hunkering.

254
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,031
You're right. We should play it safe
till we get to New York.

255
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,600
Ow!

256
00:14:58,982 --> 00:14:59,983
Get off!

257
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:05,322
Director Hoover.
Thank God. We just got word from HQ.

258
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,116
There's a plot afoot to kidnap you.

259
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,559
We need to get you off this train.

260
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,039
Give me a minute.

261
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,645
I'm sure we could find a way
to get to New York

262
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,505
that doesn't involve Hoover cosplay,
or kidnapping.

263
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,608
Listen, the real J. Edgar Hoover
was never kidnapped,

264
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:24,752
so he must have solved this.

265
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,511
No, this is getting
way too out of control.

266
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,197
I mean, I'm sure we can fix this
with a do-over.

267
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,532
What if there's no more do-overs?

268
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,837
What if this is it?
We owe it to history to make it right.

269
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,731
Gentlemen, this sounds like a case
for the Bureau of Investigation.

270
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,116
Has she had anything to drink?

271
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,994
She doesn't need anything to drink,
she's not a person.

272
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,418
I may not know what a computer is,
but I know a heartbeat.

273
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,879
And you made that, Astra.

274
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:08,719
You are not only a very powerful witch,
you're also a mother now.

275
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,014
- I am nobody's mother!
- Dang.

276
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,309
Now, what will the team do
with a human Gideon?

277
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,352
Probably just give her Rory's old room.

278
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,436
There's always space for one more
with the Legends.

279
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,648
Where are your Legends now, anyway?

280
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,151
They went to New York
to meet this time-travel guy.

281
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,320
Once they find him,
they're gonna come get us.

282
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,990
Okay, I'm no expert, but it seems to me

283
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,659
if you have a machine
that can travel through time,

284
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,914
what do you just go back to,
right after the moment you left?

285
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,000
- I mean, unless...
- It didn't work.

286
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:46,924
What was the word from HQ?

287
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,635
Not a lot of detail.

288
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,804
The Dallas field office
intercepted a telegram.

289
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,518
"Hoover on tren, northbond."

290
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,028
"Train" and "northbound"
are both misspelled.

291
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,898
- So he's a foreigner.
- Or a bad speller.

292
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,276
The men in Little Rock
are gonna alert DC.

293
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,296
Planning to have agents
at every station on the route.

294
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Good.

295
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,288
Mr. Hoover says
we're looking for a foreigner.

296
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,450
- I didn't say that.
- Stay put in here, Mr. Hoover.

297
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,744
We'll turn this train upside down
till we find our man.

298
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,164
Hoover doesn't run an investigation
from behind.

299
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,876
All right, all we got to go on
is this telegram,

300
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,003
which doesn't give us a motive
or a means,

301
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,465
but its timing does narrow down
a list of possible suspects.

302
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,176
Donovan, Rodgers, get me a list

303
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,762
of all the passengers
that got on this train since Midland.

304
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,597
- Go!
- On it, sir.

305
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,618
The three of us are gonna start
at the front of the train,

306
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,185
and we're gonna work our way back.

307
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,105
We're looking for anyone
who has a reason to hurt Hoover.

308
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,068
Who would possibly
want to hurt that guy?

309
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,321
A "please" would have been nice.

310
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,659
Is there anyone on this train

311
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,620
you may suspect
of having anti-government sentiment?

312
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,788
Anti-government?

313
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,456
The government is the only thing

314
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,500
keeping this country
from going to the dogs.

315
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,212
Have you heard anyone
talk about anarchy or...

316
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,591
socialism?

317
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,759
Well, that depends.

318
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,637
Would you call a working wage socialism?

319
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,141
Then, yeah,
I'd say we're all talking about it.

320
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,520
Lovely to see America by train car.

321
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:28,275
Be a lot lovelier if I wasn't
being spied on by a bunch of dicks.

322
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,403
- By "dick," do you mean cop?
- Mmm.

323
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,531
You think someone on this train
is a ne'er-do-well?

324
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:39,328
Good luck pulling one over
on America's finest lawman.

325
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:40,829
That's very nice of you.

326
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,498
Hoover?

327
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,000
That man is cursed.

328
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,085
You have no idea.

329
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,340
Hoover? Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

330
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,426
Ugh. Tell me about it.

331
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,222
Everybody on this train loves Hoover.

332
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,183
Yeah, everybody with
first class tickets.

333
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,353
The people we talked to
would be happy to kill Hoover.

334
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,605
If we're looking for motive, we got it.

335
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,273
Lots of it.

336
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,957
Which is as good as finding none at all.

337
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:14,780
We're switching this investigation
away from the why and onto the how.

338
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,532
And with agents in every city,

339
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:20,345
it would be pretty hard pulling off
a kidnapping in any of the stations.

340
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,620
They'd get caught immediately.

341
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:22,829
Or congratulated.

342
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,792
But if you get the train
off the main route...

343
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,794
No one would be guarding the track.

344
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,339
And if you could redirect the train,
you have control of the train.

345
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,882
Ooh! Inside job!

346
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,342
- Inside job?
- Inside job!

347
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:39,805
Director Hoover, meet Igor Lewandoski,
the train's engineer.

348
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,516
A Russian and a labor organizer.

349
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,959
He wasn't scheduled to work today
but had a change of heart.

350
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,479
He joined the crew back in Midland.
Awfully convenient.

351
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,498
- Did he confess?
- He won't say diddly.

352
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,843
But he's our guy, I'm sure of it.

353
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,985
Trust you can get the confession
we need.

354
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,946
Do your worst, boss.

355
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,364
Yeah.

356
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,251
Boy, a very sad party of one
happened in here.

357
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,086
It doesn't matter.

358
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,881
Zen in ten.
Here I come, starting with the fridge.

359
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,554
See, even I know
you don't keep whiskey in the fridge.

360
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,032
- Aves.
- Hi, Z.

361
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,344
How many bottles of whiskey
are there on the table?

362
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,537
- Um... Two.
- Two!

363
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,125
- The fridge is making whiskey.
- What? That's fantastic!

364
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,085
The <i>Waverider.</i>

365
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,756
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of like the <i>Waverider.</i>

366
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,675
Although, the fridge doesn't
take requests like Gideon.

367
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,219
No, no, no. This bottle,
this bottle is the <i>Waverider.</i>

368
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,264
And this bottle is the mystery <i>Waverider</i>
that blew us up.

369
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,767
So if there's two <i>Waveriders...</i>

370
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,227
who's to say there isn't...

371
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:14,983
A third <i>Waverider.</i>

372
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,280
And a fourth. It will never end.

373
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,283
Oh, I get it.

374
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,243
You're still really stoned.

375
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,536
So, let's say we go back

376
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,140
and stop the mystery <i>Waverider</i>
from blowing us up, that's great.

377
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,475
But that <i>Waverider</i> came from somewhere,

378
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,584
which means if one showed up,
then another one could

379
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:33,707
and another and another...

380
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,338
Okay, wait,
let's just slow this train down.

381
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,840
Take this. Remember this?
Here, grab this. Hi, hi, hi.

382
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,426
Look, squirt, squirt. Squirt and wipe.

383
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,805
Squirt and wipe,
and the gummies are gonna wear off,

384
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,408
and then you're gonna be feeling
the natural high of a job well done.

385
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,769
Look, show me. Show me.
I'm watching. Squirt and wipe.

386
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:56,358
You got this. You got this.

387
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,902
You can be mean.
You can be mean as hell.

388
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,367
He's all ready for you, sir.

389
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,535
Good.

390
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,663
Uh, sir? A quick word?

391
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,291
- How are you gonna swing this, Nate?
- I don't know.

392
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:16,086
- I don't want to hurt the guy, but...
- No way, man.

393
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,338
Look, those two agents
are expecting Hoover.

394
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,691
They have all the evidence they need.
That's more than enough.

395
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,343
It's not enough! I need a confession!

396
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,388
Look, Nate, I know you feel like
this is the end of the world,

397
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:28,849
but you're just a good guy
who made a bad mistake.

398
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,904
What was the alternative?
Let him kill you?

399
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,310
You're worth a thousand Hoovers.

400
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,897
By comparison to Hoover,
I am nobody in the timeline.

401
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,899
Come on, Nate, you know that's not true.

402
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,442
You've got to forgive yourself.

403
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,618
This isn't about me.

404
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,751
So, what are we gonna do?

405
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,896
You ever hear the one about
the black lady, the brown lady

406
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,590
and the broken computer
who walked into a bar in 1925?

407
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,216
Uh, no.

408
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,968
Yeah, because it would never happen!

409
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,651
Let's face it,
there's nothing we can do.

410
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,430
The Legends are on their own.

411
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,354
Great, more decapitated apple heads.

412
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,867
I think she's trying
to tell us something, Astra.

413
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,328
Uh... An apple a day.

414
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:33,955
Easy as apple pie.

415
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,584
Don't put all your apples in one box.

416
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,710
That is not a thing.

417
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,088
It's six apples, in a box,
off the table, on the floor.

418
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,757
Thank you, Dr. Seuss.

419
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,718
It's clearly apple...

420
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,555
sauce.

421
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:57,187
Okay, you know what, enough!
Just stop trying to tell us things!

422
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,749
I wish I could just shove you back
into the wires and the sockets,

423
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,125
or whatever makes you work
on the <i>Waverider,</i>

424
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,318
because then maybe
you could actually help us!

425
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,330
So, why are you so mad at Gideon?

426
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,624
She hasn't done anything to you.

427
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:22,337
Because... she's a constant reminder
of my giant failure.

428
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,757
That's why you don't want to go
after the Legends.

429
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:28,927
I'm useless to them, Spooner.

430
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,597
You made one mistake, Astra.
Ease up on yourself.

431
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,392
At least you still have magic.

432
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:39,145
Hey, you have things to offer, too.

433
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:42,816
Like what? Without aliens,
what do I bring to the table?

434
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,112
Ranch wear.

435
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,573
You know, I guess
we're both pretty useless.

436
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,355
You mean the three of us are...

437
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:55,745
What is that?

438
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,088
Gideon, no!

439
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:14,848
Gideon.

440
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,353
Why did you do that?

441
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,439
Wires and sockets.

442
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:24,149
She understood you.

443
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:35,660
Hey, Z, can Sara and I
grab one of those bottles of... whiskey?

444
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,162
Oh. Hey, girl!

445
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,038
Hey, buddy.

446
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,293
Uh, what did we talk about?
More cleaning, no more gummies, yeah?

447
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,670
Oh, no, I'm not stoned. I'm enlightened.

448
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:48,381
See, I finally realized
why John gave me this key.

449
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,634
To clear my head
and think about the bigger picture.

450
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,386
See, I was so focused on my phones

451
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,346
and skincare sales
and romantic entanglements

452
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,390
that I never stopped to think about
what was really going on with the team.

453
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:01,019
The team? Our team?

454
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:05,482
Yeah. See, without those distractions,
I was able to dig deep

455
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,859
and really think about how we got here.

456
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,046
So, I read your Time Bureau
agent manual earlier...

457
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,447
What? That thing is over 200 pages.

458
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,617
Yeah, and I started thinking,
it's not about the how they blew us up,

459
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,328
it's about the who.

460
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,590
I made a list of suspects.
Do you wanna see?

461
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:24,167
- Um, yes. Yes, I do!
- Great.

462
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:31,508
Time to spill the beans, Lewandowski.

463
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,387
What did you say?

464
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,849
- Please, you're making a mistake.
- I'm making a mistake?

465
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,851
I'm making a mistake?

466
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,320
Get out. Out!

467
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,620
No, no, no.

468
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:02,997
Please.

469
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,422
Sounds like he's really
putting the screws on him.

470
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,135
Let me know if he needs backup.
I gotta take a leak.

471
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,891
Don't do this, Nate.

472
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,317
What are you doing?

473
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:36,239
I'm trying to tell you
that you don't have to tell me

474
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,950
anything you don't
want to because...

475
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,661
I will find the answers I want

476
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,413
some other way, okay?

477
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,168
This is even worse than last time.

478
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:50,962
I've interrogated you before?

479
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,381
Of course, you don't remember.

480
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:59,846
You and your men came after me
and my family and hundreds of others

481
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:03,975
on your manhunt for Emma Goldman
back in 1919.

482
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:05,852
I knew nothing about her,

483
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,396
but because of your "Red Scare"
no one believed me.

484
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:14,027
My wife and children had to flee,
and your men beat me for being Russian.

485
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,155
I lost everything because of you!

486
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,705
I'm sorry, Igor.

487
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,377
Makes total sense
why you were planning on kidnapping me.

488
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,756
Me?

489
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,177
I've tried to stay
as far away from you as possible.

490
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,888
But when you're looking for enemies,
that's all you see.

491
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:47,018
Makes it easy to miss
what's going right in front of you.

492
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,362
Where did those mountains go?

493
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:01,491
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Somebody switched tracks 15 miles back.

494
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,534
Igor.

495
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:06,037
Thank you, Igor.
I'll untie you in a minute.

496
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:07,789
Grab him!

497
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,211
The jig is up, Hoover. Get over here.

498
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,006
It's kind of silly, huh?

499
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,943
Put on the right kind of suit
and you can fool anybody you want.

500
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,470
Even America's best detective.

501
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,813
Pretty dumb,
pulling a gun on a Bureau agent.

502
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,690
You think you're the smart guy here?

503
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,192
If you hadn't made such a stink
back in Midland,

504
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,212
we never would have known
you were on this train.

505
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:40,697
Funny thing is, we've been trying
to pinch you for months.

506
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,784
Snorky's offered a nice chunk of cash
to whoever brings you in first.

507
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,621
Snorky.

508
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:50,915
Snorky, Snorky?

509
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,083
Who the heck is Snorky?

510
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,460
These guys work for Al Capone.

511
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,380
Come out with your hands up, Hoover!

512
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,343
And so do all of them.

513
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,513
You got two minutes!

514
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,610
I ain't got all day, Edgar!

515
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,156
Come out or we start popping passengers.

516
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,413
Oh, we can totally
take these guys.

517
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,124
No.

518
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,286
Without Gideon
it's hard to keep track of the timeline,

519
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,464
but Hoover wasn't killed
by mobsters, right?

520
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,175
So don't we have to fight?

521
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,927
In the real timeline,
none of this happened.

522
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,138
And the world still thinks I'm Hoover.

523
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,808
I'm gonna have to make this right.

524
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:05,490
Come on.

525
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:27,970
Well, congratulations.

526
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,515
You got me.

527
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,771
Who are you?

528
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:42,819
Damn it.

529
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:46,823
I'd give the multi-verse
a low probability.

530
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,325
- I mean, what even is a Paragon?
- Mmm-hmm.

531
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,953
I think we are onto something
very important here, Z.

532
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,079
Me too, Aves.

533
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,802
Okay, so who's left
on our villains' list?

534
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,040
Uh, Damien Darhk.

535
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,918
Loves us way too much
to kill us, I think.

536
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,629
Mallus, Mallus, Mallus.

537
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:02,879
Big Beebo...

538
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,465
Hmm. David Bowie.

539
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,717
You know, he got
that really great song out of us.

540
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,153
- Yeah, it was very catchy.
- Yeah.

541
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,613
- Let's put him in the "maybe" pile.
- Okay.

542
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,514
What about those guys over there?

543
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,974
These guys over here.

544
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,518
We got time pirates,
time wraiths, time witches,

545
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,604
clones, doppelgängers, ourselves,
time itself.

546
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,399
Okay, let's call that the
"Why the hell not?" pile.

547
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,482
Copy that.

548
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:24,402
Oh.

549
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,193
And then there's this one.

550
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:31,409
I mean, that's too out there, right?

551
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:34,120
Sorry. We've been chased by a demon dog.

552
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,806
Who's to say
that we're not being hunted by...

553
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,332
Sara? Ava?

554
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,042
- Is that...
- Guys?

555
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:43,254
Hello? Anybody?

556
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:45,423
Hello?

557
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,092
We got a Hoover-shaped Nate problem.

558
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:49,552
That doesn't sound good.

559
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,471
- Guys.
- Hate to cut it short,

560
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,390
but we could really use
some backup out here.

561
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,018
Yeah, Nate's been kidnapped
by Al Capone's men!

562
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,480
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

563
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,666
We need to find a way to stop this
with zero casualties.

564
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,193
What, with weed gummies and magic booze?

565
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:06,943
Yes!

566
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,029
- Yes?
- Yes?

567
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:11,699
I ain't gonna ask you again.
We want Hoover, not some nobody clown.

568
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,618
You're right. I am a nobody.

569
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,413
But I'm the nobody
who killed J. Edgar Hoover.

570
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,333
- Killed?
- Yeah.

571
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,503
I'm supposed to bring in the head
of the Bureau of Investigation,

572
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:24,629
instead I got Mr. Nobody.

573
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,507
This is not the plan.

574
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,883
Yeah, tell me about it.

575
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,636
Ah, Snorky's gonna pop me, for sure.

576
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,179
Doesn't seem fair.

577
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:35,365
I mean, how could you know
the guy you were supposed to kidnap

578
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:36,557
ended up getting killed?

579
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,407
Some things are outside of your control.

580
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,287
I could just bump you off
and mess your face up,

581
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,355
real good,
pass you off as Hoover's body.

582
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:45,691
You can do that.
It may work, for a while, but...

583
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:54,659
But you can't outrun a lie forever.

584
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:58,246
Eventually, you'll just end up
hurting the people you care about.

585
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,925
Sometimes it's easier
just to face the music

586
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,084
and accept the fact
that you made a mistake.

587
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,046
Hey, take a deep breath with me.
Come on.

588
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,219
Now repeat after me.

589
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:16,347
I forgive myself.

590
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,308
I forgive myself.

591
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,478
- There. Now don't you feel better?
- No.

592
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:23,896
Oh.

593
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,148
But that makes me feel better.

594
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,318
- You all right there, big guy?
- Better now.

595
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,005
Hoover's death
must have been quite the shock,

596
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,449
so we brought you a little something
to soothe your grieving souls.

597
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,410
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

598
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,495
Oh. Never ending, one could say.

599
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,831
Holy smokes!

600
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:45,710
The Bullet Blondes!
The big fella loves you gals.

601
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:52,675
I would like to formally apologize
for how I treated you both.

602
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,678
And I would like to ask for a do-over.

603
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,471
- Already done.
- My man.

604
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,808
Your photographs don't do you justice.

605
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,566
It's a lot of company
for the middle of nowhere.

606
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:31,339
Boys.

607
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:32,840
Ladies.

608
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:34,800
Another Hoover?

609
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,886
I thought you said you killed him.

610
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,305
I... I did.

611
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:48,773
Okay, two <i>Waveriders</i> and two Hoovers,
that cannot be a coincidence.

612
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,692
Is it me, or does he look
even more pissed off now?

613
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:53,611
We're kidnapping you.

614
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,363
And I'm arresting you.

615
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,490
In fact, you're all under arrest.

616
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,325
Over our dead bodies!

617
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,994
Maybe we should just skedaddle
right over here, yeah?

618
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,996
Everybody, take cover!

619
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,641
Get in there! Come on! Move it! Go!

620
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:24,966
We can't let Hoover die again.

621
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,576
I don't think we need to
worry about that.

622
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,201
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, slow!

623
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,829
Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait...

624
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:48,481
Look, guys, this is out of control.

625
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,018
The timeline's
at serious risk of changing.

626
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,252
Give me this.

627
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,013
Oh!

628
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:04,264
Come on.

629
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,566
Oh, no. Did we kill him again?

630
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:20,322
There's no blood.

631
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:22,241
Whoa. That dude is tough.

632
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,665
I don't even think he is a dude.
I think he's a...

633
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:38,507
Robot!

634
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:39,884
Robot.

635
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,093
What are the chances?

636
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:44,054
Wait, so robots blew up the <i>Waverider?</i>

637
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:49,393
J. Edgar Hoover, a robot.
That explains a lot.

638
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,145
I ate a robot?

639
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:55,566
Sorry stomach and small intestine
and small stomach and third...

640
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:57,151
Gary, shush. Shush.

641
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,361
You did not eat a robot,
you ate the real Hoover.

642
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,405
This, this must be his replacement.

643
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:03,551
Guys, what... What is he doing?

644
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:05,868
Rebooting himself?

645
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,078
Self-destruct sequence initiated.

646
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:09,497
Twenty seconds.

647
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,832
Guys, I don't think that... Yeah.

648
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,877
We gotta go! Come on, let's go. Move it!

649
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:17,004
Boy, I hope Spooner and Astra are okay.

650
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:20,066
They're probably having
the chillest time at Gloria's right now.

651
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,427
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Nine, eight, seven...

652
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,971
Six, five, four...

653
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,934
Three, two, one, zero...

654
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,028
Hey, Gideon. Hey.

655
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,198
I'm sorry.

656
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,575
I'm so used to the old you.

657
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:48,911
The one who always had all the answers.

658
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,498
I never thought you'd be the one
needing help from us.

659
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,544
Do you think we could try again?

660
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:05,219
I wish we could figure out a way
to communicate with her.

661
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,679
I mean, she's obviously trying.

662
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:11,559
<i>Tranquila, mi amor</i>. You'll find a way.

663
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,185
You always did.

664
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:19,024
Esperanza, you didn't speak
until you were six years old.

665
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,236
I don't remember that.

666
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:25,239
You communicated with me in other ways.

667
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,492
We always understood each other,
you and I,

668
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:30,160
even if we weren't using words.

669
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:33,998
You would come over and hug me,

670
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,001
or hold my hand.

671
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:40,754
Your little touch,
it made me feel heard.

672
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,425
It's your gift, Esperanza.

673
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:50,055
<i>Gracias, Mami.</i>

674
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,574
I know this must be tough for you.

675
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:11,619
I get it.

676
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:13,913
I know it must be really hard

677
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,196
when no one understands
what you're trying to tell them.

678
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,876
And I hope you that you're not useless.

679
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,378
You're just... figuring it out.

680
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,656
<i>How did I even get here?</i>

681
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,472
<i>- Why can't they understand me?</i>
- I can hear her.

682
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:33,223
I can hear Gideon's thoughts.

683
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,059
- She's scared.
- What's she saying?

684
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,519
Hey, it's okay. Gideon, I'm right here.

685
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,106
Just breathe and focus.

686
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,946
<i>Dr. Davies' machine in New York City,</i>

687
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:49,865
<i>time travel experiment
takes place November 7th, 1925.</i>

688
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,951
She's saying Dr. Davies'
time travel experiment

689
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:55,162
will take place in New York City
on November 7th, 1925.

690
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,206
That's two weeks from today.

691
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,499
Precisely, Captains.

692
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,753
She's back!

693
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:04,630
That's fantastic!

694
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,173
The plan's gonna work.

695
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,109
Two weeks, maybe that explains
why they're not back yet.

696
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:12,221
But we have to get to Dr. Davies fast,
or the Legends will die.

697
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,598
Or maybe that's why.

698
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:18,686
Pack up that ranch wear.

699
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:21,397
We've got some Legends to save.
