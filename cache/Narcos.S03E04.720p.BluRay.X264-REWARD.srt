1
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,569
Please, pay attention!

2
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:12,698
I need you to put your phones,
beepers and radios in the container.

3
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,617
Is this necessary, Agent Peña?

4
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:18,204
- I'm afraid so, Captain.
- Please, I'll take that.

5
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,998
One of my guys
says one of your guys

6
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,334
is working for the cartel.

7
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,713
- They have any proof?
- Can't say yet.

8
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:32,009
But this warrant will be hard to execute
if they're one step ahead.

9
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,764
It's just a precaution.

10
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,059
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Okay.

11
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,146
For the next three hours,
we'll be running silent.

12
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:49,235
- My colleagues and I will take the lead.
- And the target?

13
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,072
I'll just say that it's everything
you've trained for.

14
00:01:56,325 --> 00:02:01,705
We're advisors. We work together,
same as always. Credit's all yours.

15
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:12,383
Gentlemen, you heard!
I need you to be tight and right!

16
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,135
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

17
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,719
Let's go.

18
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,321
In case you're confused,
<i>Capitán Calderón,</i>

19
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:38,075
I wouldn't have come all the way
from Bogotáif it wasn't a big deal.

20
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,538
My men's safety,
that's what I care about.

21
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,000
I make the final call
if anything feels off.

22
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,460
You follow?

23
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,512
My kid gave it to me
right before I went out on this buy-bust.

24
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:02,474
Some Jamaican took a rip at me,
missed by that much, so...

25
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,228
I rub it for luck ever since.

26
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,385
So, what are we doing here?

27
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,681
We're arresting
one of the godfathers of Cali.

28
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:45,095
'Applauded
by the multitude present on 10th street,

It's too early.

Go.

- Nobody lives here, boss.
- That's bullshit.

74

Intel had Pacho here last night.

75

What do you think? What do we do?

76
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,993
I think there could be hideouts here.

77
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,996
- We have to check the house again.
- All right.

78
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,039
We turn this place upside down.

79
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:45,627
Gentlemen, we're going to search
every corner of this house, understood?

80
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,636
It's an elegant house in Palmira, boss.

81
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,180
I don't know whose it is,
but it's not one of ours.

82
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:01,727
Very good. Get out of there
and make sure no one sees you.

83
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,770
Yes, sir.

84
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,402
- Salcedo.
- 'Jorge.'

85
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,820
Sir.

86
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,409
I need you to do something important.

87
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,953
When you leave your house,
you'll find Navegante.

88
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,372
He knows where you have to go.

89
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:27,085
Of course, sir, but what should I do
with the operation I'm monitoring?

90
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,548
Cordova. Give it to Cordova.

91
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:37,095
- Jorge... Be careful.
- 'Of course, sir.'

92
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,859
He's one of my best men.
He'll take care of it.

93
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,240
You're a man of your word.

94
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,402
'Juárez...'

95
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,781
So close to heaven
and so far from God.

96
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,492
Impressive.

97
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:45,330
I'm so glad you brought me
to see the eighth wonder of the world.

98
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,878
Don't be an asshole, Pacho.

99
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,756
El Paso, Texas
is what I wanted you to see.

100
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,551
Fucking NAFTA
changed everything, Pacho.

101
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,388
It's been around for what?
Two years, more or less?

102
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:05,726
More than two million trucks have
crossed already, many of them ours.

103
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,310
Filled to the brim.

104
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,564
Do you know how many trucks
the Americans check?

105
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:15,318
Less than ten percent. It's insane.
They don't have the manpower.

106
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,446
Assholes opened the floodgates,

107
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:22,492
and now they stand there
with a baby's bucket to try and stop it!

108
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,496
This is the right business.
I already know this, man.

109
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,373
No, man, what I'm saying is,

110
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:32,502
you're getting out of the right business
at the exact wrong time.

111
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,463
And you're going to regret it.

112
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,425
You want some?

113
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,224
Amado, are you suggesting
that I betray my partners?

114
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:51,146
No. No way.
Why betray? They want to get out.

115
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,109
I'm proposing that we start
something new, you and I.

116
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,530
Just imagine it,
you send it to me, I get it across.

117
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:05,577
In two years, we'll be flooding
this fucking shitty country.

118
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,831
Think about it, all right?
Think about it.

119
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,751
Just don't take too long,
because in six months,

120
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,420
I need to secure a new supply.

121
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,591
Hopefully, it'll be with you.

122
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,270
Hey...
Give it another once-over?

123
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,816
Okay.

124
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,990
It should be now.

125
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,800
Thirty seconds.

126
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,893
Hey! Hey! You can't park there!

127
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:17,649
Damn truck. These fucking trucks
are always breaking down.

128
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,902
- You can't park here.
- Let me grab the cables and I'll move it.

129
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,654
Move the fucking truck!

130
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,041
Gilberto!

131
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,379
Someone's ringing the doorbell!

132
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,134
- Careful.
- Sorry, wait just a moment.

133
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,845
Let me get the door.

134
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,935
Gilberto?

135
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,027
Police! Back up.
Quickly! Move it!

136
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,362
Quickly! Move it!

137
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,448
What's going on?

138
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,993
Sit down, ladies.
Sit down, ladies, I won't say it again.

139
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,372
You can't come in here.
Get out.

140
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,507
He's fucking running!

141
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,152
Get up! Look at my face!

142
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,863
Let's go.

143
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:50,951
- Sit down, Miss.
- I already told you, Gilberto's not home.

144
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,619
Did he contact anyone?

145
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,872
- No one, Colonel.
- No? All good?

146
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,793
Mrs. Rodríguez, I have a federal warrant
signed and executed by myself,

147
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,421
as representative
of the Colombian National Police.

148
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,385
The question is, will you cooperate?

149
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,500
Are you all right?

150
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,044
Yes.

151
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,008
It's good here.

152
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,810
The only thing left
is to demolish the house.

153
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,107
Yeah. Okay.
We're done. I'm calling it.

154
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,654
I'm sorry, I thought we had something.

155
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,698
Welcome to my world.

156
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,745
Well, do what you need to wrap up,
have your men report back.

157
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,788
- Okay.
- Feistl, anything else?

158
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,332
- Ride to the airport?
- Sure.

159
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,264
Look, when we get there,
I think it's better if I go in alone.

160
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,600
These people are angry.

161
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:44,064
What we're asking of them,
it's an insult on top of their grief.

162
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,610
You're different, Jorge Salcedo.

163
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,989
Different? How?

164
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,910
You're crippled.
You don't carry a gun.

165
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,624
Most people don't carry guns.

166
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,754
Yeah... but you're not most people.

167
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,133
And that's why it's so weird.
Interesting.

168
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,386
That you never carry a gun.

169
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,352
- I see. Why do you think that is?
- I don't know.

170
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,855
Maybe you're scared.

171
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,988
Fear... of what you could do with it.

172
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:39,160
That you've been walking around a killer
and never knew it.

173
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,184
Pedrito, go in the house!

174
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,898
Good afternoon, Mrs. Salazar.
Calm down, Mrs. Salazar. Calm down.

175
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:14,445
My name is Jorge Salcedo.
I'd like to speak with you, if I could.

176
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,574
Go right back to where you came from,

177
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,536
and tell that whore
if she wants my grandson,

178
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,038
she can come looking for him.

179
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,790
I just came to talk.

180
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,168
If you don't like what I have to say,

181
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,336
I'll go back to Cali and deliver
whatever message you want.

182
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,547
I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

183
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:39,053
Your boss murdered my son
to take up with his whore wife.

184
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,850
And now you come to take my grandson
far from the only family he has left.

185
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,520
I know this is not what you want to hear.
But she is his mother.

186
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,315
And Miguel Rodríguez is protecting her.

187
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,567
Ha! Protecting?

188
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,196
Is that what they call it now?

189
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,740
And he will be protected as well.

190
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:03,870
And if you let me take him back, I promise
you can see him whenever you'd like.

191
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,665
Ah, you promise?
How nice of you.

192
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,669
Who told you I would do that?

193
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:16,257
I have him here and I can see him
whenever I want and protect him.

194
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,551
That bitch made her choice.

195
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:23,598
Mrs. Salazar... please accept my offer.

196
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:28,186
The next men who come...
won't be asking.

197
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,146
There will be war.

198
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,321
Why don't you ask my sons?
See what they think.

199
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:45,203
If you don't mind, <i>Capitán,</i>
we need to stop by a friend's house.

200
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,457
Make a right here.

201
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,923
Nice neighbourhood.
Your friend's very wealthy.

202
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,635
He's a very fortunate man.

203
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,645
What is this?

204
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,857
My friend likes chickens.

205
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,324
- Colonel Martínez.
- Captain.

206
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,037
- You know what's happening here?
- Yes, I think I know.

207
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,498
I'm giving you one chance

208
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,168
to do the right thing
and not fuck up this operation.

209
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,386
You think you're clever?

210
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,515
You're in Cali. Cali is my city.
This isn't Bogotá.

211
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,226
You're way out of line here, Hugo.

212
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,479
Perhaps.

213
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:08,161
He's here. We'll find him.

214
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,665
Watch him.

215
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,919
You got your kid's drawing?

216
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,758
I'm unarmed. I didn't come for a fight.

217
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,344
We'll send your fucking head
to Miguel in a fucking box.

218
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,138
- Walk, motherfucker.
- Let's go.

219
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,307
Duvan!

220
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,850
Duvan!

221
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,396
Bring out the car.

222
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,233
Pedro. Let's go. I'm taking you
to your mother. Take my hand.

223
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,821
- Very good.
- Shut your fucking mouth or I kill her.

224
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,702
All right, my lady.
Make like a statue or I shoot your ass.

225
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,163
I'm getting in first, you hear?

226
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,956
Real still.

227
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:58,544
You're taking the boy.
What else do you want? Relax.

228
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,671
- Stop!
- Mama!

229
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,715
What else, motherfucker?

230
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,636
Fucking asshole!

231
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,167
Fuck!

232
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,318
Drop the weapon.

233
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,241
Drop the weapon.

234
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,040
Don't shoot.

235
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,250
I'm a man of peace.

236
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,938
Let's go.

237
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,206
Hey! Stop!

238
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,293
Colonel! Calderón took off.

239
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,045
- Fuck. We move fast.
- Okay.

240
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,677
- Do you have a phone in there?
- Yes, in there.

241
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,314
They got Gilberto and they're moving
towards the aerial base.

242
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,274
The whole workforce is on this.

243
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:54,155
'They're not going to leave the city.
Tell all the men to be alert. Understood?'

244
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,842
Move it, asshole!

245
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,477
They'll try to take us on the road.

246
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,187
Guns out!

247
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,072
Hello?

248
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,115
'Don Miguel...

249
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,409
- 'Something's happened.'
- What happened?

250
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:45,706
I'm outside Gilberto's house.
They got him. They got your brother.

251
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:21,534
'We've got a visual.'

252
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,913
Surround him in the market!

253
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,217
Tail him!

254
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,562
Look! There he goes! Faster!

255
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,149
Let's get him on the next turn!

256
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,365
Hold your fire!

257
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,291
Driver! Put your hands
where I can see them!

258
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,501
Driver!

259
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,338
Out further!

260
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:18,924
Further!

261
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:30,728
Get out. Open the back.

262
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,814
- Okay. Let me get the keys.
- Open it.

263
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,289
- Open it!
- Okay. All right. Settle.

264
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,638
Those American sons of bitches tricked us.
We've got the wrong fucking truck!

265
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,848
They're going to the air field.
We'll get them there.

266
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,810
I took care of security.

267
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:15,439
Let those sons of bitches
try to touch us again.

268
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,360
Send Salcedo's beeper
another message.

269
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,962
Uncle! It's me, Nicolas!

270
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,008
Come in.

271
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,263
- Nicolas.
- Uncle.

272
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:54,395
- Is it true?
- Yes.

273
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,357
They got him.

274
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,110
Nicolas, why don't you go home
and wait there?

275
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,404
Once something happens, I'll call you.

276
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,531
No, sir, I have to help.

277
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,159
Come.

278
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:13,330
You know your dad doesn't
want you mixed up in this.

279
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,458
We have to have faith that
your dad won't be taken out of Cali.

280
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:20,588
And if he is? Why did we waste
all that money on my education?

281
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,883
I'm a lawyer.
I'm taking the first flight to Bogotá.

282
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,260
I want to help him.

283
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,804
Let's hope that's not necessary.

284
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,739
Fuck.

285
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,199
Wait here.

286
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:41,627
- 'Hey, boss. What's up?'
- There's cops surrounding the plane.

287
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,546
'Cops? Good ones?'

288
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,174
I don't think so.

289
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:52,888
Colonel Martínez...
Sir, please don't come any closer.

290
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:57,601
Your men are impeding the transport
and arrest of a fugitive under warrant.

291
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,439
You know it.
And that means prison.

292
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,196
What you do today...

293
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,533
...what you do this moment...

294
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,996
...defines you
for the rest of your lives.

295
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,837
Are you police or not?

296
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,264
That's better.

297
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,723
Home stretch.

298
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:41,538
Shit!

299
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,252
'What's up? It's me.'

300
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,130
- About fucking time.
- 'I was out of range.'

301
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,091
'They arrested Gilberto.'

302
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:57,471
- What?
- They got him, Jorge. They got Gilberto.

303
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:03,602
- You were monitoring the raid.
- 'But they never mentioned Gilberto's name.'

304
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:07,564
Even so, we checked
all the tapes. It's impossible.

305
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,777
It doesn't make sense!

306
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,488
I just don't understand!

307
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,700
Brother... they got him.
They took him away.

308
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,245
We got beat.

309
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,372
Get back here quick.

310
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,880
Hasta la vista, baby. Ciao.

311
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,355
Take that.

312
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,492
Five seconds to take photos, no more.

313
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,536
Congratulations.

314
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,164
But you know this won't hold up.

315
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:08,917
You're fucking with things
that are much bigger than you are.

316
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:14,882
Smile, Gilberto.
You're about to be on TV.

317
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,428
This way, Mr. Rodríguez!

318
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:22,431
Mr. Rodríguez, do you have a response
to the charges against you?

319
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:25,225
Conspiring to export cocaine
and illegal enrichment?

320
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,643
Enough. Let's go.

321
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:30,981
Do you have anything to say
to the people of Cali? Mr. Rodríguez.

322
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,490
'For those of us
who thought the surrender was bullshit,

323
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:44,453
'Gilberto's arrest proved
that these guys could be caught.

324
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:48,207
'For the people who thought the surrender
was the only way to avoid violence,

325
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,500
'it was the beginning of a nightmare.

326
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:54,796
'The first shot in a war
to bring down another cartel.

327
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:58,842
'But whatever side you fell on,
one thing was clear:

328
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,971
'Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
came as a surprise to everybody.

329
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,059
'Especially him.'

330
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,534
Don Gilberto.

331
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,173
Hey, congrats.

332
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,592
Congratulations. Good work.

333
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,470
No, where you going?
Come on, we want to toast you!

334
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,264
Start without me.

335
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,689
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Big day.

336
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,734
- Quite a notch on your belt.
- It was strong intel, sir...

337
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,611
Do you know how much work
you torched?

338
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:03,156
The people want to see the godfathers
in handcuffs and that's what they'll get.

339
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:07,119
- Front page of every newspaper tomorrow.
- Colombians may not feel that way.

340
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,123
Let's go find out.

341
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,293
Get changed.

342
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,721
- My love!
- Mummy!

343
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,725
Mummy.

344
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,102
- Are you hungry? No?
- No.

345
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:37,024
How cute. Looks a lot like his dad.

346
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,280
Come on.
Mum'll read you a story in a bit.

347
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,824
Go. I'll be right there.

348
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,411
Thanks for showing up, Jorge.

349
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,501
Sir, we don't know
how much the DEA knows.

350
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,547
We need to assume
all your current homes are... unsafe.

351
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,135
I'll stay here for now.

352
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,142
We all need to talk.

353
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:19,858
What did you expect? A warrant
by definition authorises the police...

354
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:23,820
Wait. Let's not lie to ourselves.

355
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,574
This operation was run
by the Drug Enforcement Administration

356
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,076
of the United States.

357
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,995
The takedown, Mr. Attorney General,
was National Police.

358
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,625
The transport was by our police.
The booking was by our police.

359
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,169
So a war started by National Police?

360
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,505
Look, as Attorney General,

361
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:47,094
my main... concern is achieving
a peaceful settlement with the godfathers.

362
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,721
And the arrest
of Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela

363
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:54,267
means we now have new leverage
to negotiate with.

364
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:57,270
The President of Colombia,
Ernesto Samper.

365
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,237
I hate to be late to a good debate.

366
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:08,990
You know us, might as well try
to smooth rough water with a hammer.

367
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:17,249
I've been apprised by Minister Botero
about our newly-incarcerated Cali godfather.

368
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:21,211
- With all due respect, Mr. President...
- Go ahead, Miguel.

369
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:26,133
We've worked for months
to negotiate this surrender.

370
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,429
We recommend the immediate release
of Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela.

371
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:37,727
Colombia is a nation of laws.
Not of concessions.

372
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,691
If I give a pass to the largest criminal
organisation in the world,

373
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,527
the trust of the people
will be lost forever.

374
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,743
Mr. Rodríguez is entitled to the same
due process as any Colombian citizen.

375
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,288
Let's see where due process gets him.

376
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,417
For now...

377
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,837
...his arrest stands.

378
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,174
Thank you, gentlemen.

379
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,760
Fuckin' A.

380
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,486
Thank you very much.

381
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:03,563
We talked about this.
I don't want the stink of this on you.

382
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,106
Relax, Dad.

383
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:09,236
I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one
in the family who can visit you.

384
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:17,202
Besides, I thought
you could use a friendly face.

385
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:22,374
What I could really use
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.

386
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,506
How's it look?

387
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,426
The warrants are old.

388
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,180
- Invalid?
- Vulnerable.

389
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:42,060
I have a lunch tomorrow at 1:00pm
with the Colombian Board of Pharmacies.

390
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,229
8:00am, latest, I'm out.

391
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,149
Dad, you're here until our lawyers
get you in front of a judge.

392
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:53,238
And he'll hold you here in Bogotá
due to the conspiracy charge.

393
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:58,785
I don't get it.
This is a mistake, a blunder.

394
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,539
A gross overstep
by a rogue American agent!

395
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:05,166
That's what you want to believe.

396
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:08,128
But if that was the case,
you'd be out by now.

397
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:13,383
- Dad, this is real.
- No, money is real!

398
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,510
What about all I've paid?

399
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:20,098
Sons of bitches can't leave me
confined here!

400
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,896
How the fuck did they surprise us
like that, gentlemen?

401
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,565
It was Calderón.

402
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,862
Dad, I say we tear him to pieces.

403
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:38,325
- And his fucking family and his children.
- David, please.

404
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,661
Obviously, there's responsibility
on all sides.

405
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:45,957
- Cordova...
- Sir, just as we realised...

406
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,626
By the time you realised,

407
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:52,839
Colonel Martínez had already been
in my brother's house for 30 minutes.

408
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,717
Don Miguel. The failure's mine.

409
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:59,012
When it comes to the DEA,
Cordova counts on me.

410
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:05,268
Wait. Cordova, you're my brother's
personal head of security.

411
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:10,649
- Yes, sir.
- Then you should've been there.

412
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,403
Your men should've been there.

413
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,950
Your guards were fooled
by a fucking chicken truck!

414
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,163
I want to know what the fuck
is happening here.

415
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:31,294
Because I'm starting to believe
that none of us is safe.

416
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,464
Not your families...

417
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,552
...and not mine.

418
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,805
My family.

419
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,689
Thank you, Attorney General Valdivieso,
Defence Minister Botero.

420
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,276
Today marks an important beginning,

421
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:57,320
an important victory.

422
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,990
Because of the success
of our Colombian-American operation,

423
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,660
the Cali cartel is on the run.

424
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:08,248
And with the continued support
of the Colombian National Police,

425
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:13,086
I promise you
the other three godfathers will fall.

426
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:17,006
'Questions?'

427
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,427
That's as much recognition
as we can hope for, right?

428
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,475
None at all? Smart move.

429
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,561
Keep his face all over this
while we're closing in.

430
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,022
Kiss-ass.

431
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,359
Want some?

432
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,945
No, I'm moving tables.

433
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,405
Oh, boy.

434
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:45,285
Oh, God.
Can't believe you're eating that shit.

435
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:19,527
- Colonel, please.
- Thanks.

436
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,240
Have a drink with me.

437
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,828
Tonight, we celebrate.

438
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,081
Tomorrow, we go back to work.

439
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,837
Well, not for me.

440
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,882
What are you talking about?

441
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:44,969
You remember those papers
that were seized by your men in Cali?

442
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,097
Yeah, we never saw those.

443
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,934
Apparently, Vargas did.

444
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:54,854
There was a list of cops who've
been accepting money from Cali.

445
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:59,359
One name he was eager
to share: mine.

446
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,906
Those son of a bitches
want to discredit Gilberto's arrest.

447
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:09,118
Exactly. It sends a message
to any cop who wants to try what we did.

448
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:20,839
I turned in my weapon and my badge.

449
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,718
Good luck.

450
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,221
Colonel...

451
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,933
I'm sorry.

452
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:43,736
Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

453
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,867
You did everything right, Peña.

454
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:51,202
But now you're all alone.

455
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,915
Take care.

456
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,194
We need to talk about your security.

457
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,407
Let me be in charge.

458
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,785
I'll protect you, Dad.

459
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:38,625
Now's not the time for a change.

460
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,717
We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

461
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,223
What if he doesn't come back?

462
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,740
Jorge?

463
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,241
Jorge.

464
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,344
- They got Gilberto.
- 'I don't understand.

465
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,472
I thought Gilberto had this
all under control.

466
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,265
'So did I.'

467
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:40,937
- And what now?
- 'This could get messy.

468
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:46,025
'Stay where you are.
Right now, we look out for ourselves.

469
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,695
'Pacho... be smart.'

470
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,994
For now, we wait.
You stay there a while longer.

471
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,746
We have to keep everything running.

472
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:05,586
'The health of the business has never
been more important. Understand?'

473
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,130
Yes. Of course.

474
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,427
You listening to me, motherfucker?

475
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,389
Hey, listen, buddy,
I don't speak Spanish.

476
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,684
No speak Spanish.

477
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:24,022
Okay. Have a nice day.

478
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,513
Hey, boss. Good day today, huh?

479
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,265
The Jurado tapes.

480
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,144
We probably shouldn't call them that
because they're not legal, per se.

481
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,188
I want all of them.
