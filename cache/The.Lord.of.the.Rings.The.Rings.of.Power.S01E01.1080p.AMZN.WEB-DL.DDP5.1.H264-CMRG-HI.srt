It's not going to float.

It was a good ship, sister.

I made it just as you taught me.

[crickets chirping]

25
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:30,291
Do you know why a ship floats
and a stone cannot?

26
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:35,333
Because the stone sees only downward.

27
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,250
The darkness of the water is vast
and irresistible.

28
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,750
The ship feels the darkness as well,

29
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,666
striving moment by moment
to master her and pull her under.

30
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,750
But the ship has a secret.

31
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:57,291
For unlike the stone,
her gaze is not downward but up.

32
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,875
Fixed upon the light that guides her,

than darkness ever knew.

34
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,500
But sometimes the lights shine
just as brightly

reflected in the water
as they do in the sky.

36
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,541
It's hard to say which way is up
and which way is down.

How am I to know which lights to follow?

The most important truths often are.

41
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,458
But you must learn
to discern them for yourself.

I promise you there is not a soul
amongst our company

who yearns for home more than I.

I can still feel the light of the Trees

Don't you think
it's the least bit strange?

World's strange.

192

If I let 'em pitch-kettle me,

Why?

197
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,333
Looked like a badger. Maybe a fox.

198
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,750
More likely a Harfoot.

199

A Harfoot?

Ugh. Don't care to be seein' none,

Travelers? At this time of year?

225
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,791
- It's an omen, I warrant ya.
- [Sadoc grumbles]

226
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,458
- Mmm-hmm. Bad one. As bad as they come.
- Easy, Malva.

227
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,791
The last time we had travelers this early,
it was the Great Frost.

228
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,250
And there's no misremembering
how bleak a season that was.

229
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,333
More than likely they just got lost,
that's it.

[snaps fingers] Has to be the reason.

[Largo] You're gonna spoil dinner.

[Marigold] I've looked high and low again.

The wee ones are still out there.

234

They'll be fine, Goldie.

235
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,375
Nori's with them. You know Nori.

Yes. I do.

[Poppy] Can we turn back now?

239
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,875
There's 110 things out here
that could kill us.

240
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,250
[Nori] Hundred-eleven
if you count you worrying to death.

241
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,892
[Poppy] You know the rules.
We're not supposed to be out this far.

242
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,541
Don't be... If we didn't do everything
we weren't supposed to,

243
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,250
we'd hardly do anything at all.

[child] Me first!

245
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,750
[Nori] Go on, now. Watch the puddle.

246
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,375
Watch your head.

- Oh, but you haven't even seen it yet.
- [Poppy whining] Seen what?

00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,208
Good place for a hill-troll to hide,

I found something.

273

There's something in the mud.

What is it?

275

It looks like a footsie.

A dog.

277
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,166
Just a dog.
You know how dogs love berries.

Is he going to eat our berries?

Not if he doesn't see us, he isn't.

282
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,250
Hey. Twos and hands, everyone. Time to go.

Go on, now. Come on.

00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,791
Tell me everything.

329
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,791
[Galadriel] This mark's very existence
proves Sauron escaped.

330
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,125
He's still out there.

331
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,166
The question now is, where?

332
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,125
I intend to ask of the King
a fresh company.

333
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,208
- If he supplies enough to...
- You have only just arrived.

334
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,500
Must you speak of leaving again so soon?

335
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,416
You know very well why I must.

336
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,666
There will be ample time later
to discuss official matters.

337
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,291
I want to hear about you.

338
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,291
Your harrowing journey.

339
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,083
Why, Elrond.

340
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,291
You really have become a politician.

341
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,125
You make it sound so grim.

342
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:48,541
I am not some courtier
to be placated by idle flattery.

343
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,291
I demand to speak with the King directly.

344
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,416
You have made that plain.

345
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,708
So I will be equally plain.

346
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,583
It was not your company
who defied you out there,

347
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,416
but rather you who defied the High King,

348
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,041
by refusing to heed
any limit placed upon you.

349
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,333
In an act of magnanimity,

350
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:18,125
he has chosen
to honor your accomplishments...

351
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:21,291
Rather than dwell upon your insolence.

352
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,416
Test him again

353
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,916
and you may find him less receptive
than you might have hoped.

354
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,458
Are you going
to arrange an audience or not?

355
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,541
If after the ceremony
that is still your wish,

356
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,041
you shall have it.

357
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,666
[lively chatter, laughter]

358
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,958
[chuckles]

359
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,833
Ah. She has returned.

360
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,500
- How fare thee?
- Well and well, Father.

361
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,041
And look at her!

362
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,166
You found all that
down by the river bank, did you?

363
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,250
Mm-hmm.

364
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,916
Did you hear about the travelers?

365
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,416
- Travelers?
- Mm-hmm. Hunters.

366
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,333
Two of them.

367
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:15,500
Big as great boulders.

368
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,041
Right up on that ridge.

369
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,625
I can't believe I missed them.

370
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:22,375
Maybe you ought to stick closer to home,
that way you don't miss anything, hmm?

371
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,791
[sniffs, gasps]

372
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,083
[both laugh]

373
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,416
You went to the old farm again.

374
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,291
Didn't you?

375
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,416
I was careful.

376
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,416
But the children might not be.

377
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,083
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

378
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,333
We never get hunters up here
before the harvest.

379
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,625
- [Marigold] Mmm.
- Or wolves.

380
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,041
I wonder if there's trouble down south.

381
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,583
And what concern is that of yours,
Elanor Brandy foot?

382
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,375
Haven't you ever wondered...

383
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,916
What else is out there?

384
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,875
How far the river flows

385
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:08,583
or where the sparrows
learn the new songs they sing in spring?

386
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:13,333
I can't help but feel
there's wonders in this world.

387
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,500
Beyond our wanderin'.

388
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,000
I've told you.

389
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,583
Countless times.

390
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,916
Elves have forests to protect.

391
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,250
Dwarves, their mines.
Men, their fields of grain.

392
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,833
Even trees have to worry
about the soil beneath their roots.

393
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:37,291
But we Harfoots are free
from the worries of the wide world.

394
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:41,125
We are but ripples in a long, long stream.

395
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,958
Our paths set by the passing seasons.

396
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,708
Nobody goes off trail
and nobody walks alone.

397
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,416
We have each other. We're safe.

398
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,375
That is how we survive.

399
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,875
[sighs] Go on. Help your father.

400
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,000
That's your problem.
You see, a wheel's supposed to be round.

401
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:44,666
[Gil-galad] These most valiant of warriors

402
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,291
kneel here before us, victorious.

403
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,708
For though Morgoth fell an Age ago,

404
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:58,208
some feared a new evil might arise
from his shadow.

405
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,125
So for centuries now,

406
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:04,291
these soldiers have swept
across crag and crevice,

407
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:07,625
washing away the last remnants
of our enemy

408
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:11,416
like a spring rain over the bones
of a spoilt carcass.

409
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,458
And now, at last,

410
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:20,041
they return to us in triumph,

411
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:23,250
for they have proven beyond any doubt

412
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:27,458
that our days of war are over.

413
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:30,875
Today...

414
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:35,541
Our days of peace begin.

415
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,500
[sighing]

416
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,958
And as a measure of our gratitude,

417
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,583
these heroes shall be granted an honor

418
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,416
unrivaled in all our lore.

419
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,791
They will be escorted to the Grey Havens

420
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:19,208
and granted passage across the sea
to dwell for all eternity

421
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:24,000
in the Blessed Realm, the Far West.

422
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,250
The Undying Lands of Valinor.

423
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,916
At last, they are going home.

424
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,166
[applause]

425
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:56,458
[fireworks whistling, exploding]

426
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:37,375
Are you just going to stand there,
breathing like an Orc?

427
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,000
It is said the wine of victory is sweetest

428
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,666
for those in whose bitter trials
it has fermented.

429
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:49,250
I do not feel victorious.

430
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,375
You deserve the honors of this day.

431
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,916
Your brother would be proud.

432
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,958
I remember when the first of these
were carved.

433
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:08,708
The likeness of one fallen,
preserved upon a living thing.

434
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:12,541
I suppose some part of me
always believed my rest would be here,

435
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:13,916
with them.

436
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,875
But instead, I am to leave them.

437
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:22,458
This is the gift of your king.

438
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
A gift I have decided to refuse.

439
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,125
Galadriel, you...

440
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,916
My brother gave his life hunting Sauron.

441
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:36,416
His task is now mine.

442
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,458
I go to seek the enemy
that escaped us in the north.

443
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,125
Alone, if I must.

444
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,291
Ah, yes. Your mystery sigil.

445
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,208
I shared it with the High King.

446
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,083
- Then why would...
- Because seeing a sigil

447
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,708
does not mean you're any closer
to finding Sauron.

448
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:01,166
It is over. The evil is gone.

449
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,625
Then why is it not gone from in here?

450
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,041
After all you have endured...

451
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,666
It is only natural to feel conflicted.

452
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,125
Conflicted?

453
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,666
I am grateful you have not known evil
as I have.

454
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,125
But you have not seen what I have seen.

455
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,250
I've seen my share.

456
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:27,958
You have not seen what I have seen.

457
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:30,916
Evil does not sleep, Elrond.

458
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,458
It waits.

459
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,958
And in the moment of our complacency,

460
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,458
it blinds us.

461
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:43,041
Let us say that all is as you fear,

462
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:46,458
and this enemy is out there somewhere,
lying in wait.

463
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,291
Do you truly believe seeking him out
will satisfy you?

464
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,041
That one more Orc upon the point
of your blade will bring you peace?

465
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,041
- If you are wrong...
- I'm not wrong.

466
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,583
If you are wrong,

467
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:01,625
will you lead more Elves
to die in far-off lands?

468
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:05,583
To convince yourself you have done enough,

469
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:08,500
how many more statues
would you add to this path?

470
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,958
No one in history
has ever refused the call.

471
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,875
Do so now, it may never come again.

472
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,750
You will linger here, an outcast,

473
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,083
poisoned in dark whispers and dreams.

474
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,625
And in the West,
do you think my fate would be better?

475
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,916
Where song would mock the cries
of battle in my ears?

476
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:34,833
You say I have won victory
over all the horrors of Middle-earth.

477
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,583
Yet you would leave them alive in me?

478
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,000
To take with me?

479
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,916
Undying, unchanging, unbreaking,

480
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,333
into the land of winter less spring?

481
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,833
Only in the Blessed Realm

482
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,416
can that which is broken in you be healed.

483
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,333
Go there.

484
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,625
Go, and I promise you...

485
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:03,250
If but a whisper of a rumor
of the threat you perceive proves true,

486
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,125
I will not rest until it is put right.

487
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,416
You have fought long enough, Galadriel.

488
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,541
Put up your sword.

489
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,208
Without it, what am I to be?

490
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,916
What you have always been.

491
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,125
My friend.

492
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,416
[Men grunting]

00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:25,833
Hmm.

498
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:27,916
Ha!

499
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,625
Poisoned more likely.

500
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,625
Poisoned? By who?

501
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,250
[Waldreg] For all we know,
the onion-eyed scut done it himself.

502
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:36,333
[chattering stops]

503
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,250
[Waldreg] Arondir. [chuckles]

504
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:52,250
Has it really been a fortnight already?

505
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,583
[Arondir] It has.

506
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,250
[dog whimpering]

507
00:37:56,416 --> 00:38:00,083
Uh, very little to report this go-round,
I'm afraid.

508
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:03,583
A couple of shabby disputes,
a bit of uneven dice-handling.

509
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,291
And... Oh, yes!

510
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,833
Had a bit of a thrill in here,
Trewsday last.

511
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,833
Bit of a row over a girl.

512
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,666
His eye was lazy, hers over active,
if you take my meaning.

513
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,250
[chuckles]

514
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,000
Do you care for a drink, soldier?

515
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,291
Well, my well is yours, as ever.

516
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,875
And the poisoning?

517
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,416
What poisoning?

518
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,291
The one you were just discussing.

519
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,500
No, no, no, no...

520
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,625
It was but poisoned grass
he was twattlin' about.

521
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:34,958
A fellow passed through,
said his grazing's gone rotten.

522
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:37,208
That only weeds will grow.

523
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:40,000
This fellow, where was he from?

524
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,000
Didn't say. East, I think.

525
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,166
On what day was he here?

526
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,291
- Oh, let it go, knife-ears.
- [slams]

527
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,250
It's a bloody patch of grass.

528
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:55,625
The lot you lump us in with
died off a thousand years ago.

529
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,541
When are you people gonna let the past go?

530
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,958
The past is with us all,
whether we like it or not.

531
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:10,833
One day, our true king will return.

532
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:16,458
And pry us right out
from under your pointy boots.

533
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,750
- Easy, lad. Quench the fire now.
- [glass shatters]

Come on, lad.

536
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,208
Will there be anythin' else then?

537
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,791
[lively chatter continues]

538
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,375
[birds chirping]

539
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,208
Give me your hand.

540
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:17,916
Hmm.

541
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,000
<i>Alfirin</i> seeds.

542
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:23,958
[sighs]

543
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,666
I've not seen this flower
since I was a child.

544
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,916
Where did you find these?

545
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:34,041
I had to trade with another healer
who was passing through.

546
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,250
We crush the petals to form a salve.

547
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,958
You crush them?

548
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,500
[chuckles] Gently.

549
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,958
Are there healers among your kind?

550
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,416
There are.

551
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,333
But we call them artificers.

552
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:53,333
Most wounds to our bodies heal
of their own accord,

553
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:57,833
so, it is their labor instead to render
hidden truths as works of beauty.

554
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,458
For beauty has great power
to heal the soul.

555
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,458
Then I hope
you find <i>alfirin</i> flowers beautiful.

556

- [door opens]
- [both gasp]

557
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,416
Until next time, then.

00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,583
Soldier. [sighs]

559
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,916
Anything to report?

560
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,875
Nothing out of the ordinary.

561
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,666
And the well...

562
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,333
How was it?

563
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,291
Did you draw some water?

564
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,958
We are awaited at Ostirith.

565
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,916
Have you considered
the consequences I might face

566
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,916
if the Watch warden were to discover
what it is that you're doing?

567
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,666
Afraid I don't take your meaning.

568
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,309
It's difficult enough
keeping watch over them

569
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,416
without having to keep
one eye squarely on you.

570
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,750
Or do you think me blind?

571
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:02,000
No. I think you talk too much.

572
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,625
And you smell of rotten leaves.

573
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:06,208
No, I don't.

574
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,458
Yes, you do.

575
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:10,166
[sniffs]

576
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:18,291
[Médhor] My point is this.
Only twice in known history

577
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:21,500
has a pairing between Elves and humans
even been attempted.

578
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,083
And on each occasion, it ended in tragedy.

579
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,250
It ended in death.

580
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,250
You need not remind me.

581
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,541
[sighs]

582
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,416
Then why do you persist?

583
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,916
Give me one reason. One.

584
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,833
[Elf] Arondir! Médhor!

585
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:39,208
The High King has declared
the days of war are over.

586
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:43,083
All the far outposts are being disbanded.

587
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,625
We're leaving.

588
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,833
[wind whooshing]

589
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,375
- Taking a last look?
- Mm-hmm.

590
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,000
Seventy-nine years
I've been stationed here.

591
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,791
I suppose I've grown accustomed to it.

592
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:29,000
[Revion] Can you believe this place
was once a barren scrap of rock?

593
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:31,083
It has changed much, Watch warden.

594
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:34,041
But the Men who live here have not.

595
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:38,541
The blood of those who stood with Morgoth
still darkens their veins.

596
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,833
That was long ago, Watch warden.

597
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,541
What were you before the war?

598
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:51,583
A grower.

599
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:54,250
Then you shall be returning home
to far more than you left.

600
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:58,208
Honors, title.

601
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,166
Your life will begin anew.

602
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:04,208
But mark this, Arondir,

603
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:08,416
that for 79 years, you've kept watch
over the men and women of Tirharad,

604
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,416
not because of what their ancestors
once did...

605
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,875
But because of who they still are.

606
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,625
And be grateful.

607
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,333
That you need never see them again.

608
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,291
[ladder creaking]

609
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,375
[wind whooshing]

00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:00,791
[sighs]

611
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,166
Careful. That's fire-root powder.
You have to do it slowly.

612
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,333
Go any slower, I'll be stuck here all day.

613
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,291
You're in a boil this morning.

614
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,000
Hardly slept.
Mice were dancing a proper jig

615
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,125
- under the floorboards.
- Again?

616
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,916
Last three nights.
Scratchin' and scrapin'.

617
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,250
What's one of them doing here?

618
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,750
I heard you were leaving.

619
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:38,958
We are.

620
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,166
Where's the rest of your company?

621
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:48,000
Most likely searching for me
at this very moment.

622
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:50,375
Then why are you at my home?

623
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,583
Say what you wish to say.

624
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:07,166
I have said it already.

625
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:11,583
A hundred times over,
in every way but words.

626
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:14,708
- Mother.
- [gasps]

627
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,916
There's a man here for you.

628
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,541
[knocking on door]

629
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:27,958
Mum.

630
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:33,125
[Tredwill] You heal animals, too?

631
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,583
- [cow moaning]
- If you could just give her a look.

632
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,541
She's got some sort of a sickness.

633
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:43,708
[Arondir] What manner of sickness?

634
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:44,791
[gasps]

635
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,541
[Bronwyn] It isn't a fever.

636
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:57,166
And she doesn't appear to have any sores.

637
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,000
Where has she been grazing?

638
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,833
Hmm. She wandered east a few days ago.

639
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:04,541
Think she might have ate something?

640
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:09,125
- [cow groaning]
- [squishing]

641
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:12,041
What was that, squirted out of her?

642
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,916
How far east?

643
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,375
[Tredwill] She might've made it
as far as Hordern.

644
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:25,833
Where are you going?

645
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:29,166
Hordern's a day's journey.
If I leave now, I can reach it by dusk.

646
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,583
[Bronwyn] I'm going with you.

647
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:43,000
[door creaking]

648
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,833
Be quick about it.

649
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:47,208
He finds us in here,
he'll knock our teeth out.

650
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,500
[chickens clucking]

651
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:53,000
Only spotted it by mistake.

652
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,375
Stepped on a lucky board.

653
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,083
So, tell me,

654
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:01,625
is it true? About your mum?

655
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,000
Is what true?

656
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:08,500
Heard Waldreg caught herself
and one of the pointies

657
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,125
mighty sweet back of his well
the other day.

658
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,333
Who told you that?

659
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,666
Everybody.

660
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,291
It's a lie.

661
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:18,375
Maybe that's why your father
run off like he done.

662
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,791
My father didn't run off.

663
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,041
Then what happened to him?

664
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:23,458
You don't even know, do you?

665
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,833
Salty rascal's got the King's bounty
down there.

666
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:32,916
[Theo] This is the real bounty.

667
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:54,125
Watch it!

668
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:56,000
[door creaks]

669
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:57,708
Go on, quick.

670
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:07,541
[rumbling]

671
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:11,708
- [blazing]
- [voices whispering in Black Speech]

672
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:16,583
[waves crashing]

673
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,541
She has passed beyond my sight.

674
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,833
Galadriel was so certain
her search should continue.

675
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:47,083
[Gil-galad] We foresaw that if it had,

676
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:52,541
she might have inadvertently kept alive
the very evil she sought to defeat.

677
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,666
For the same wind
that seeks to blow out a fire

678
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,166
may also cause its spread.

679
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,750
Then the shadow she sought...

680
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,166
You believe it does exist?

681
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:11,416
Set your mind at peace about it.

682
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,291
What you did was right.

683
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:18,333
For Galadriel and for Middle-earth.

684
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,750
It's hard to see what is right...

685
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,416
When friendship and duty are mingled.

686
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:31,083
Such is the burden of those who lead

687
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,208
and those who would seek to.

688
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:38,250
Galadriel sails to the sunset.

689
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:43,166
You and I must look to the new sunrise.

690
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,458
To that end,

691
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:51,625
are you acquainted
with the work of Lord Celebrimbor?

692
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,583
[laughs]

693
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,666
The greatest of Elven-smiths, of course.

694
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,166
I've admired his artistry
since I was a child. Why do you ask?

695
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:04,000
He is about to embark on a new project.
One of singular importance.

696
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:08,208
And we've decided
that you will be working with him.

697
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:14,666
But I'll allow you to explain the details,
Lord Celebrimbor.

698
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,291
First the big people, now the stars.

699
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,333
Eyes open when they should be sleeping.

700
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:42,583
Almost like...

701
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:46,375
Like they're watching for something.

702
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:47,958
Watching for what?

703
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:48,875
[thud]

704
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:51,833
A tongue-lashing,
if you don't mind your own cartwheels.

705
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:53,750
What is it? What do you see?

706
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:56,041
Elanor Brandy foot,
with your father's nose,

707
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,958
and always poking it into trouble,

708
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:02,250
you are far too curious and meddlesome
to have been born a Harfoot.

709
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:05,041
Are you quite certain
you're not part squirrel?

710
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,208
- [slams book]
- [coughs]

711
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:09,208
Sadoc. Sadoc, please.

712
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,208
Tell me.

713
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:16,541
[whispers] The skies are strange.

714
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:20,208
[whispers] Strange.

715
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:21,375
Strange how?

716
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,333
[Largo] Nori! Do you have that grease?

717
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:24,666
On my way.

718
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:29,416
[crickets chirping]

719
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,958
How familiar are you
with the townsfolk of Hordern?

720
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,875
Very, I should hope. I was born there.

721
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,041
Why?

722
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,583
The people of Hordern were known
for having been especially strong

723
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,333
in their loyalty to Morgoth.

724
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:49,875
What did you just say?

725
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:55,166
The truth.

726
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:58,416
You're talking about my friends.

727
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,083
Close kin, I know them.
There are good people there.

728
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:03,083
[sighs]

729
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,041
That is why I'm here with you.

730
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,125
Instead of the Watch warden.

731
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:13,416
Bronwyn.

732
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:24,041
You're the only kind touch
I've known all my days in this land.
