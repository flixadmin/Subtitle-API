1
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,863
Is that Estermont?

2
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,407
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

3
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,619
The Sapphire Isle.

4
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,502
Why are we on a merchant ship?
Why no Lannister sails?

5
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,674
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

6
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,718
We'll get off earlier not far
from Sunspear,

7
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,345
row ourselves to the Dornish shore
in the night.

8
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,348
You ever been to Dorne?

9
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,350
-No.
-I have.

10
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,227
The Dornish are crazy.

11
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,314
All they want to do is fight and fuck,
fuck and fight.

12
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,773
You should be happy to go back.

13
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,945
There's nothing like a good fight
to get you in the mood for fucking.

14
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,781
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

15
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,825
to clear your head for the next fight.

16
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,077
It's how the two work together.

17
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,496
Now we're gonna be doing a lot
of fighting, I'm sure.

18
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,667
Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get
to stick around for the rest.

19
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,255
-Not after we've kidnapped their princess.
-We're not kidnapping their princess.

20
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,841
We're rescuing my niece, bringing her back
to her family.

21
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,801
Your niece?

22
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,062
I've been doing this sort of thing
a long time.

23
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,314
-I'm good at it.
-That's why you're here.

24
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,777
I know. Why are you here?
Why not send 40 of me? Or an army?

25
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,071
Unlike most folks,
you've actually got one.

26
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,073
Because I don't want to start a war.

27
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,285
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

28
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,581
It has to be me.

29
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,878
If I'm putting something like
this together,

30
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,547
a one-handed man who happens to be

31
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,175
one of the most recognizable faces
in Westeros is not--

32
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,468
It has to be me.

33
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,226
You set your brother free, didn't you?

34
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,230
I'll bet your sister didn't like that.

35
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,858
Varys set him free.

36
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,823
Well…

37
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,120
if you ever see the wee fucker,
give him my regards.

38
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,959
He murdered my father.

39
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,381
If I ever see him, I'll split him in two.

40
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,634
And then I'll give him your regards.

41
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,770
The Iron Bank has called in one-tenth
of the crown's debts.

42
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,898
Given the expense of rebuilding
the royal fleet--

43
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,818
-How much can the crown afford?
-With winter coming,

44
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,196
half what they ask, less?

45
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,616
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

46
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,912
Well, House Tyrell could front the gold
and the crown would pay us back in time

47
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,415
or I'd have words with my daughter.

48
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,006
You've already given us too much.

49
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:25,260
No, we must arrange better terms
with the Iron Bank.

50
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,220
-Absolutely.
-In person.

51
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,976
-Me?
-We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank,

52
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,271
someone of importance to show
these bankers our respect.

53
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,816
As the king's Master of Coin,
I can think of no one more qualified.

54
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,568
I would be honored, Your Grace.

55
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,112
The king's expressed concern
about his father-in-law's safety

56
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,363
on this voyage.

57
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,621
He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally
lead your escort.

58
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,625
My very own Kingsguard?

59
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,044
-Please express my--
-Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

60
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,088
Of course. Of course.

61
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,800
I'll give your regards to the Titan
of Braavos.

62
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,062
The small council grows smaller
and smaller.

63
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,563
Not small enough.

64
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,576
May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?

65
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,121
No.

66
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,710
The old High Septon would have asked
the vintage.

67
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:45,674
I could say that our minds are temples
to the Seven and should be kept pure.

68
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,928
But the truth is I don't like the taste.

69
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,141
How may I serve?

70
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,436
All over Westeros we hear
of septs being burned,

71
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,064
Silent Sisters raped,

72
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,484
bodies of holy men piled in the streets.

73
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,238
Wars teach people to obey the sword,
not the gods.

74
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,782
Perhaps the gods need a sword
of their own.

75
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,451
In the days before the Targaryens,

76
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,538
the Faith Militant dispensed the justice
of the Seven.

77
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,667
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more
than two centuries ago.

78
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,588
If I explain their holy purpose to my son
the king,

79
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,342
I have no doubt he will sign a decree
arming the believers you felt worthy.

80
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,055
An army that defends the bodies and souls
of the common people?

81
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,351
An army in service to the gods themselves.
And to you, of course,

82
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,313
as the chosen representative of the Seven.

83
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,231
An honor I never expected.

84
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,194
-Or, indeed, ever wished for.
-Which is why you were chosen.

85
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,698
You and I both know how the world works.

86
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,869
Too often the wicked are the wealthiest,
beyond the reach of justice.

87
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,414
The king himself cannot always punish
those who deserve it most.

88
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,167
All sinners are equal before the gods.

89
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,259
What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

90
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,221
Shielded by gold and privilege.

91
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,808
May the Father judge him justly.

92
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,219
What are you doing?

93
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,849
Help me! Help me!

94
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,900
Yeah. Yeah.

95
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:11,987
Get off me!

96
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,703
Come on.

97
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,955
Shut up! Move!

98
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,924
This is
Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.

99
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,562
Cocksuckers.

100
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,690
Boy fucker.

101
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,443
You buggering filth!

102
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,947
There's a special place
in the seventh hell for your kind.

103
00:10:56,031 --> 00:11:00,327
Please. Please, I'll pay.
I'll… I'll pay all of you.

104
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,454
Yes, you will.

105
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,449
Seize him.

106
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,867
Sinner.

107
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,120
-Get your hands off me.
-Ser Loras of House Tyrell,

108
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,206
you have broken the laws of gods and men.

109
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,917
Who do you think you are?

110
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,419
Justice.

111
00:11:58,593 --> 00:11:59,844
Why is my brother in a cell?

112
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,805
I… I don't know.

113
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,309
-I… I didn't order it.
-We both know who did.

114
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,271
You told me she was returning
to Casterly Rock.

115
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,483
Are you saying my mother's behind this?

116
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:18,947
She's jealous you're not hers anymore.
Arresting my brother is her revenge.

117
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,782
Aren't you and Mother getting along?

118
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,417
Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

119
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,422
Do you have any affection for me at all?

120
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,633
Of course I do.

121
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:40,844
You're my queen.

122
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,932
I can't bear to think of my brother
locked away in some grimy cell.

123
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,727
I'll set him free for you.

124
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,938
Do you promise?

125
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,199
-I demand that Ser Loras be freed now.
-Did I arrest him?

126
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,494
Well, no.

127
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:12,167
But yo… you armed the Faith Militant.
You… you gave the High Sparrow an army.

128
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,918
I did.

129
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,881
And your wife has every right
to criticize.

130
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,677
We can't allow fanatics to arrest
the queen's brother

131
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,220
no matter his perversions.

132
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,598
Then…

133
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,060
can I tell Margaery you'll have
Ser Loras released?

134
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,104
I told you, I'm not holding Ser Loras.

135
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,940
You're the king.

136
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,110
I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow,
he'll release the poor boy.

137
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,326
Halt!

138
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,727
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

139
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,398
Give the order and we'll clear out
this rabble.

140
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,194
You mean, kill them?

141
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,446
Here at the sept?

142
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,907
You'd be sending them to meet the gods
that they love.

143
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,538
Bastard!

144
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,374
You're an abomination!

145
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:40,964
Born of sin!

146
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,800
Filthy bastard!

147
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,223
We'll find another way.

148
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,143
Abomination!

149
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,734
My queen?

150
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,701
There was no way to free Ser Loras
without violence.

151
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,706
You're the King of the Andals,

152
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,002
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
the Protector of the Realm,

153
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,547
and you let a band of fanatics imprison
your brother by law.

154
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,218
-I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.
-Are you? When?

155
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,639
-I… I don't know.
-You don't know?

156
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,142
He was praying just now.

157
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,439
I have to send word to Grandmother.

158
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:41,858
Will you come back later?

159
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,487
I need to be with my family, Your Grace.

160
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,782
Of course.

161
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,579
You think highly of this boy?

162
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,539
Good.

163
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,585
-Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
-And a bastard by some tavern slut.

164
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,463
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

165
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,385
I should have given you a son.

166
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,973
-Not your fault.
-Whose, then?

167
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,226
I gave you nothing but weakness.

168
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,148
And deformity.

169
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,110
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

170
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,654
My lady.

171
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,281
Her father is the Lord's chosen king,

172
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,034
and her father's blood runs
through her veins.

173
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:48,049
-You march on Winterfell soon?
-We must to beat the snows.

174
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,388
Once before, you put your faith
in Ser Davos and left me behind.

175
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,477
-I hope you won't make that mistake again.
-I won't.

176
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,776
-I need you.
-You only need faith, my king.

177
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,533
And you, my lady, what do you need?

178
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,869
To serve my lord.

179
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,376
Lord Ashford.

180
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,009
Lady Caulfield.

181
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,513
Oh, Lord Smallwood.

182
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,517
-I've never even heard of these people.
-They haven't heard of you, either.

183
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,562
But we need men and they have some.

184
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,109
How many men does this Lord Mayzen
have to send us?

185
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,153
More than Lord Wibberley.

186
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,502
-Not him.
-I know, I'm sorry.

187
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,588
But we need men and supplies

188
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,465
and Roose Bolton's the Warden
of the North.

189
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:14,010
-He murdered my brother.
-We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.

190
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,221
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

191
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,351
And we can't get more men without help
from the Warden of the North.

192
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,043
Apologies, my lady.

193
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:00,973
Lord Commander.

194
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,267
How can I help you?

195
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,812
Come with us when we ride south.

196
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,648
None of us know the castle as well
as you do.

197
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,652
Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses,
its people.

198
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,197
Winterfell was your home once.

199
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,409
Don't you want to chase the rats
out of it?

200
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,164
Castle Black is my home now.

201
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,544
The Night's Watch take no part
in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

202
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,711
There's only one war.

203
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,256
Life against death.

204
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,095
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

205
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,847
You're gonna show me some vision
in the fire?

206
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,976
Forgive me, my lady, I don't trust
in visions.

207
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,021
No visions. No magic.

208
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,691
Just life.

209
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,588
Do you feel my heart beating?

210
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,134
There's power in you.

211
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,722
You resist it, and that's your mistake.
Embrace it.

212
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,569
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

213
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,572
Two parts of a greater whole.

214
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,284
In our joining, there's power.

215
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,495
Power to make life,

216
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,831
power to make light…

217
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,792
and power to cast shadows.

218
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,671
I don't think Stannis would like that
very much.

219
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,215
Well, then we shouldn't tell him.

220
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,428
-I can't.
-Why?

221
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:04,931
I swore a vow.

222
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,851
I loved another.

223
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,437
The dead don't need lovers.

224
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,814
Only the living.

225
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,946
I know.

226
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,115
But I still love her.

227
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,216
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

228
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,338
Are you lonely?

229
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,633
Just bored.

230
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,845
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

231
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,596
Were you bored a lot, too?

232
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,057
I know Castle Black

233
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,309
-is no place for a child, but--
-I like it.

234
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,228
I thought I'd be left at home.

235
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,148
I know Mother didn't want to bring me.

236
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,400
Why do you say that?

237
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,237
She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

238
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,033
She shouldn't have said that.

239
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,961
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

240
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:11,932
When you were an infant,

241
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,686
a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.

242
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,066
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

243
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,445
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

244
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,699
No doubt he had heard of your birth

245
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,078
and assumed new fathers were easy targets.

246
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,168
I still remember how you smiled when I put
that doll in your cradle.

247
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,463
How you pressed it to your cheek.

248
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,515
By the time we burnt the doll,
it was too late.

249
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,186
I was told you would die.

250
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,438
Or worse…

251
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,650
the greyscale would go slow.

252
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,196
Let you grow just enough to know
the world before taking it away from you.

253
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,825
Everyone advised me to send you
to the ruins of Valyria

254
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,952
to live out your short life
with the Stone Men

255
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,121
before the sickness spread
through the castle.

256
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,166
I told them all to go to hell.

257
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,004
I called in every maester on this side
of the world.

258
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,049
Every healer. Every apothecary.

259
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,637
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

260
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,891
Because you do not belong across the world
with the bloody Stone Men.

261
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,271
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

262
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:44,400
And you are my daughter.

263
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,130
I thought I might find you here.

264
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,718
Your Aunt Lyanna.

265
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,804
Father never talked about her.

266
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,309
But sometimes I'd find him down here
lighting the candles.

267
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,520
They say she was beautiful.

268
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:08,484
I saw her once. I was a boy living
with your mother's family.

269
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,820
Lord Whent held a great tourney
at Harrenhal.

270
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:17,868
Everyone was there. The Mad King,
your father,

271
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,662
Robert Baratheon…

272
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,083
and Lyanna.
She was already promised to Robert.

273
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,877
You can imagine what it was like for me,

274
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,630
a boy from nowhere with nothing
to his name,

275
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,592
watching these legendary men tilting
at the lists.

276
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,473
The last two riders were Barristan Selmy
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

277
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,726
When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered
for their prince.

278
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,938
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet

279
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,316
and they saw that silver hair.
How handsome he was.

280
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:52,653
Until he rode right past his wife,

281
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,699
Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

282
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,369
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

283
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,414
He rode past his wife…

284
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,294
and he lay a crown of winter roses
in Lyanna's lap.

285
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,462
Blue as frost.

286
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,512
How many tens of thousands had to die
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

287
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,017
Yes, he chose her.

288
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,312
And then he kidnapped her
and raped her.

289
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,030
Come.

290
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,949
Let's speak somewhere the dead
can't hear us.

291
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,874
-You're dressed for riding.
-I am.

292
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,837
-Where are you going?
-King's Landing.

293
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,841
-King's Landing?
-Cersei sent for me.

294
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,552
We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.

295
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,221
You can't leave me here.

296
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,016
I know how hard it is to live with people
you despise. Believe me.

297
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:06,477
But it won't be for long.

298
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,354
How do you know?

299
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,566
Stannis Baratheon garrisons
at Castle Black.

300
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:17,446
He'll march south to King's Landing
before the winter snows block his way.

301
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,907
But first he has to take Winterfell.

302
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:22,701
-You don't know that.
-I do.

303
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,580
Once he liberates these lands
from the Boltons,

304
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,499
he'll rally your father's bannermen
to his cause.

305
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,250
With the North behind him,

306
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,128
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

307
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,172
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

308
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,883
He has a larger army.

309
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,344
He's the finest military commander
in Westeros.

310
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,639
A betting man would put his money
on Stannis.

311
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,517
As it happens, I am a betting man.

312
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,561
And if you're right?

313
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,605
Stannis takes Winterfell,

314
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,900
he rescues you from the most despised
family in the North.

315
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,278
Grateful for your late
father's courageous support of his claim,

316
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,656
he names you Wardeness of the North.

317
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,076
But I-- I wouldn't--

318
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,497
-Wardeness of the North?
-You are the last surviving Stark.

319
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,582
He needs you.

320
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,378
And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?

321
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,338
Or he does and the Boltons defeat him?

322
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,300
Then you will take this Bolton boy,
Ramsay, and make him yours.

323
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,720
-I don't know how to do that.
-Of course you do.

324
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,140
He's already fallen for you.

325
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,853
-His father frightens me.
-He should. He's a dangerous man.

326
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,815
But even the most dangerous men
can be outmaneuvered.

327
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,360
And you've learned to maneuver
from the very best.

328
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,825
I'll return before too long.
You'll be strong without me.

329
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,335
The North will be yours.

330
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,589
Do you believe me?

331
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,553
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

332
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:09,952
Breakfast.

333
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,083
That would have been a shit way to die.

334
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,752
As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways
to die.

335
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,589
Aye, but your lot have to give the singers
a good ending.

336
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,758
I don't care what's sung about me
when I'm dead.

337
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,718
No?

338
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,805
Two knights off to rescue a princess.

339
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:33,392
-Sounds like a good song to me.
-Sounds like all the rest.

340
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:38,480
What about you?

341
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,149
What shit way would you choose?

342
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:47,698
In my own keep drinking my own wine
watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

343
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,576
How disappointing.

344
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,787
I thought you'd have something
more exciting planned.

345
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,667
I've had an exciting life.
I want my death to be boring.

346
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,506
-How do you want to go?
-In the arms of the woman I love.

347
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:09,886
She want the same thing?

348
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,227
Let's go.

349
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:28,864
The captain of that ship,

350
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,992
-what was he, Braavosi?
-Pentoshi.

351
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,455
-And he's headed to Oldtown?
-As I said. Why?

352
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,291
What's to stop him from docking down
the coast

353
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,169
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

354
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,211
A bag of gold.

355
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,006
I'm not sure you understand

356
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,342
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

357
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,926
It was a heavy bag.

358
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,763
And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths
to get it.

359
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,307
But you won't be around if he breaks 'em.

360
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,194
-How many you count?
-Four.

361
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,573
-How many do you think you can take?
-One if he's slow.

362
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,912
Halt!

363
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:18,997
Over the hill.

364
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:22,751
Fucked in the ass.

365
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,805
Morning, lads.

366
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,140
Glad we found you.

367
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,435
-Who are you?
-Cooper.

368
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,437
This is Darnell.

369
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,816
-You're from King's Landing.
-Accent gave me away?

370
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,861
Flea Bottom, whelped and whipped.

371
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,240
-Why are you here?
-Our ship capsized in the night.

372
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,908
We managed to swim ashore.

373
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,077
It was a near thing, really.

374
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,663
Thought the sharks would get us.

375
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,083
There are no sharks in Dorne.

376
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,795
Could have sworn those were shark fins.

377
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,715
Dolphins, maybe.

378
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,843
Throw your swords in the sand.

379
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,595
Boys, there's no need for this.

380
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:19,808
Just point us in the right direction,
we'll find our way home.

381
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,352
Swords in the sand now.

382
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,715
That one should be slow enough.

383
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,145
Nice move.

384
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,524
Luck.

385
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:52,901
You had a wonderful teacher.

386
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,959
Always wanted a Dornish stallion.

387
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,879
Beasts can run a day and night
without tiring.

388
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,092
We'll ride to the Water Gardens
with a nice breeze in our faces.

389
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,426
First we need to bury these bodies.

390
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,179
Birds have to eat too.

391
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,598
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

392
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,975
We're not here to start a war.

393
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,395
Do you know how long it'll take us to dig
all those holes?

394
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,606
I can't dig very well with one hand.

395
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,483
Not at all, really.

396
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,849
Mama.

397
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,025
-Nym, Obara.
-Will it be war?

398
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,361
Prince Doran will weep for your father,
but nothing else.

399
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,447
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

400
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,200
Without Doran, we have no army to march
against the Lannisters.

401
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,037
We don't need an army to start a war.

402
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,790
Queen Cersei loves her children.

403
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,628
-And we have one of them.
-We may have a problem.

404
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,345
A ship's captain who found me
in Planky Town

405
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,971
claiming he had information to sell.

406
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,600
He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister
into Dorne.

407
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,728
He's come for Myrcella.

408
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:57,317
If he gets to her before we do,
we lose our only chance for revenge.

409
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,569
You must choose.

410
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,656
Doran's way and peace,

411
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,951
or my way and war.

412
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,580
I'm with you always.

413
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,083
Nym?

414
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,047
Obara?

415
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,259
When I was a child,
Oberyn came to take me to court.

416
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:28,098
I had never seen this man,
and yet he called himself my father.

417
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:32,686
My mother wept, said I was too young,
and a girl.

418
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,316
Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet
and said,

419
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:44,155
"Girl or boy, we fight our battles,
but the gods let us choose our weapons."

420
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:49,327
My father pointed to the spear
and then to my mother's tears.

421
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,920
I made my choice long ago.

422
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,967
Will you untie me?

423
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,429
Will you please untie me?

424
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,723
Will you please?

425
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,372
Thank you.

426
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,340
Who are you?

427
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:45,884
Your captor.

428
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,805
-Do you have wine?
-No.

429
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,018
-Can't sleep without wine.
-Then stay awake.

430
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,234
You're going the wrong way.

431
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,491
My sister is in Westeros.
Westeros is west.

432
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,242
We're heading east.

433
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,661
I'm not taking you to your sister.

434
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,999
You said you were taking me to the queen.

435
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,837
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
She's the queen I serve.

436
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,679
What a waste of a good kidnapping.

437
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,933
It so happens I was heading there myself.

438
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,727
What business would you have
with the queen?

439
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:40,313
Gold and glory. Oh and hate.

440
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,650
If you'd ever met my sister,
you'd understand.

441
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,446
So, now that it's clear we
are on the same side…

442
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:03,670
A highborn knight from the North
of Westeros down on his luck in Essos.

443
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,549
Dragon epaulets, bear sigil breastplate.

444
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:10,718
You're Jorah Mormont.

445
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:13,888
I have to ask.

446
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:18,893
How exactly were you serving your queen
in a whorehouse half a world away?

447
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,063
Is it possible that you were running?

448
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,441
Why would you be running?

449
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,985
And why would she have sent you away?

450
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,070
Oh, wait.

451
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,657
You were spying on her, weren't you?

452
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,410
It's all coming back to me.

453
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,787
I was drunk through most
of the small council meetings,

454
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:38,913
but it's all coming back.

455
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,292
You passed notes to Varys's little birds.

456
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,004
She found out, didn't she?

457
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,882
Found out and exiled you.

458
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,303
Now you hope to win back her favor
with a gift.

459
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,472
Risky scheme.

460
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,601
One might even say desperate.

461
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,480
You think Daenerys will execute me
and pardon you?

462
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,234
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

463
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,091
Everyone looks happy enough from up here.

464
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,511
What?

465
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,348
I was thinking about all the times
your brother

466
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,642
made me go with him down
from the Red Keep

467
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,018
into the streets of King's Landing.

468
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,687
-Why?
-He liked to walk among the people.

469
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,397
He liked to sing to them.

470
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,317
-He sang to them?
-Yes.

471
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,820
Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook

472
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,782
or the Street of Seeds
and then he'd sing.

473
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,825
Just like all the other minstrels.

474
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,828
-And what did you do?
-I made sure no one killed him.

475
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,414
And I collected the money.

476
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,167
What? He liked to see how much
he could make.

477
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,461
-He was good?
-He was very good.

478
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,504
Viserys never told you?

479
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,090
He told me Rhaegar was good
at killing people.

480
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,094
Rhaegar never liked killing.
He loved singing.

481
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,388
And what did you do with the money?

482
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,140
Well, one time, he gave it
to the next minstrel down the street.

483
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,102
One time, he gave it to an orphanage
in Flea Bottom.

484
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,855
One time we got horribly drunk.

485
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,025
Your Grace.

486
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,821
Hizdahr is here, waiting
in the audience chamber.

487
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,448
How many others are there?

488
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,742
Fifty? A hundred?

489
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,537
Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?

490
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,915
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

491
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,459
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

492
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,797
Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.

493
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,716
Your Grace.

494
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:03,766
All men must die,
but not all can die in glory.

495
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,810
-Glory?
-Why else do men fight?

496
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,187
Why did your ancestors cross
the Narrow Sea

497
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,733
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
So their names would live on.

498
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,110
Those who find victory
in the fighting pits

499
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,946
will never become kings,
but their names will live on.

500
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,950
-It's the best chance they'll ever have.
-Is that what you used to tell men

501
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:23,536
before you set them to butchering
each other for sport?

502
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,664
Your Grace, today is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

503
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,499
I do not recognize this tradition.

504
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,836
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

505
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,129
your city, together.

506
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,008
Without them, former slaves
and former masters

507
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,509
have nothing in common.

508
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,973
Nothing but centuries of mistrust
and resentment.

509
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,643
I can't promise this is the answer
to all our problems…

510
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:50,355
but it's a start.
