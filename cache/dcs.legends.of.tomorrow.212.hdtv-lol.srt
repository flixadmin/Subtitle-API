1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,554
Time travel is real,

2
00:00:02,556 --> 00:00:04,757
and all of history is vulnerable to attack,

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:06,459
which is why we must travel through time

4
00:00:06,461 --> 00:00:09,268
to stop the spread of these
so-called time aberrations,

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,187
and to erase their damage to history.

6
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:14,573
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

7
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:16,358
so please don't call us heroes.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,776
We're something else.

9
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:19,077
We're legends.

10
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:22,698
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,666
We're The Justice Society of America.

12
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:25,951
Dr. Mid-Nite, Star Girl.

13
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:27,786
Copy that.

14
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:30,956
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

15
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:34,676
The Spear allegedly has the
power to rewrite reality.

16
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:36,295
I know that you're one of the protectors

17
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:39,047
of the Spear of Destiny,
and I know that you know

18
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:40,465
where the other pieces are hidden.

19
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:43,802
Oh... okay, okay.

20
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,387
The piece of the Spear's
inside your telescope.

21
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:47,272
Will you put the gun down, Jax?

22
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:49,975
He's with the Legion now.
Why are you protecting him?

23
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:51,944
I'm protecting you.

24
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:13,832
Hello, Charles.

25
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:22,808
Oh, I see you found a way
to cure your blindness.

26
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,094
The future is full of
marvels, Captain Hunter.

27
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:30,432
Uh, no longer a captain, I'm afraid.

28
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:32,851
Wow.

29
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:34,686
What do we have here?

30
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:37,656
This is a bio-morphic implant,

31
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:41,109
capable of modifying its
host's neural processes.

32
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:44,780
One day, this could end
violence as we know it.

33
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:48,166
Or, by the same means, amplify it.

34
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:49,668
I thought none of us were supposed to

35
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,370
contact the other again.

36
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:52,838
A new threat, I'm afraid.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,673
A cabal of sorts is after the Spear.

38
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:56,959
- I'm rounding up the fragments.
- Why?

39
00:01:56,961 --> 00:01:59,294
They're safer apart than they are together.

40
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,263
They'll be safe at the Vanishing Point.

41
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,881
Really?

42
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:05,767
You said the Time Masters
couldn't be trusted.

43
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:08,887
Did I? Bollocks, so I did.

44
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,722
I suppose we're gonna have to do this

45
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:12,774
the hard way, then.

46
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:17,312
Now, where is the fragment of the Spear

47
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:19,197
that I had you protect?

48
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,068
I don't know why you want
it, but you'll never find it.

49
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,653
Mm, well, seeing as you've been posing

50
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:26,571
as a researcher in cybernetic implants,

51
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:30,042
my guess is that you have
hidden the fragment...

52
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:33,578
Inside you.

53
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:44,923
- What's going on?
- Lily's algorithm located

54
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,475
a piece of the Spear of Destiny.

55
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:48,977
When? I mean, I know just
now, but where are we headed?

56
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,263
Detroit, the year 3000 AD.

57
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:53,015
Journey into the distant future.

58
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:54,066
How exciting.

59
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:55,517
Speak for yourself.

60
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,601
Come on, man, who doesn't like the future?

61
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:58,103
I like history. Yeah, I know,

62
00:02:58,105 --> 00:02:59,988
it's filled with terror and violence,

63
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,740
- but the future just...
- It's uncertain.

64
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:03,325
Yeah, and it freaks me out a little.

65
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:04,943
Then just stay on the ship.

66
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,278
You think I should stay on the ship?

67
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,113
I don't care. It's up to you.

68
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,092
I am a time travel professional.

69
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:21,710
If you need me to visit the future,

70
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:23,378
I can visit the future.

71
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,630
And I'm just saying
it's entirely up to you.

72
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:27,716
And I'm just saying shut up.

73
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:28,934
Nate, you'll stay on the ship.

74
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:30,602
The rest of us will go find the Spear.

75
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:32,637
Unfortunately, the medallion
is no longer sensing

76
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,273
the presence of the Spear fragment.

77
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,975
So we came here for nothing?

78
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:38,860
Maybe not. Gideon,

79
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:41,980
do they have booze in the year 3000?

80
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:43,398
Better yet, Gideon,

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,534
do you have the last
position of the fragment?

82
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:49,788
Somebody find a light switch or something.

83
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,490
What the hell does a light switch look like

84
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:54,076
in the year 3000?

85
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:55,460
Huh...

86
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:56,995
Yeah, I guess there's not many places

87
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:58,330
you can go with a light switch.

88
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,665
But everything else is leaps and bounds

89
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,467
beyond our current science.

90
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,976
Amaya...

91
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,850
- Charles.
- How do you know the stiff?

92
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:21,153
This is Dr. Mid-Nite
of the Justice Society.

93
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:24,606
What's a member of the JSA
doing this far into the future?

94
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:25,991
Rest in peace.

95
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:27,359
That's sweet, Mick.

96
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,528
No, it's what he wrote on the floor...

97
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,363
R.I.P.

98
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:33,582
That's not "Rest In Peace."

99
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:36,952
It's the name of Dr. Mid-Nite's killer.

100
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:39,254
- I just don't get it.
- Please be more specific.

101
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:40,839
That could be a very long list.

102
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,208
Okay, even assuming

103
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,344
the Legion took the
Spear fragment from here,

104
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:47,546
how did they know it was here?

105
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:48,713
Without the medallion, you mean.

106
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:50,215
Rip must've told them.

107
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:52,634
Somehow, he remembers where
the pieces of the Spear are.

108
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:56,354
Well, then it's a good
thing you let him escape.

109
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:58,273
Do you wanna say something to me?

110
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:02,394
Jax told me about how he
was gonna kill Rip in 1776,

111
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:03,895
and about how you stopped him.

112
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:05,814
Because we're not killers, Amaya.

113
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:09,151
Except for yourself and Mr. Rory and...

114
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,902
I'll stop helping now.

115
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,537
I'm not condoning murder,

116
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,156
but the JSA would've captured Rip

117
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:15,574
without regard for sentiment.

118
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:16,658
You think I let Rip go,

119
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,243
- because of sentiment?
- Yes.

120
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:19,661
All right, let's just all take a breath.

121
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:23,048
I'm sorry that your friend got killed.

122
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,716
And it may be sentimental,

123
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:27,085
but my team comes before tactics.

124
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:30,422
And as a result, you've put
the whole of reality at risk.

125
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:33,425
Maybe this is why your team loses so often.

126
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:35,644
- Pardon the interruption...
- Excellent timing, Gideon.

127
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:37,429
Your daughter Lily's algorithm

128
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:39,764
has identified a location for
another piece of the Spear.

129
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:41,433
Well, when it rains, it pours.

130
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:42,734
Where is it, Gideon?

131
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,653
A small island known as Britannia

132
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:47,739
in the year 507 AD.

133
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:54,746
Medieval England.

134
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:56,531
See, this is what I'm talking about...

135
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:59,334
a nice, well-documented piece of history.

136
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:02,287
Knights in shining armor,
damsels in distress,

137
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,207
and best of all, jousts.

138
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:08,460
Heh, well, jousting didn't
appear in England till 1300 AD.

139
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:10,595
Don't take this away from me.

140
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:12,430
Raymond.

141
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:14,799
Just forget about history
for once, all right?

142
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,051
We're in the Age of Legend.

143
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,720
Well, remember as Santayana once said.

144
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:20,639
"Those who cannot remember history

145
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,724
are condemned to repeat it."

146
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,943
Was he a knight? I don't remember his name.

147
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:27,395
And I was pretty obsessed
with Arthurian lore as a kid.

148
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:28,864
Hmm, well, if you were,

149
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,815
you would know that there were not jousts.

150
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:33,401
Oh... well...

151
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:35,036
agree to disagree.

152
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,955
Fair.

153
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:46,915
Are you skipping Medieval
Times, as well, Professor?

154
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,135
Yes, I was just catching
up on some research.

155
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:52,003
Huh, what'd you do?

156
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:53,471
Excuse me?

157
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:55,006
Don't say excuse me.

158
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:57,225
It makes you sound guilty.

159
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,810
I haven't the foggiest
idea what you're talking...

160
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,014
- What are you doing?
- Thieves.

161
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:05,016
They have a certain smell.

162
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:07,018
I thought that was just
because you didn't bathe.

163
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,353
What'd you steal?

164
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:10,405
How dare you even suggest...

165
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,440
What did you steal?

166
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:17,362
Dr. Mid-Nite wouldn't be needing it,

167
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:19,864
so I figured I'd...

168
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:22,951
I couldn't resist.

169
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:25,036
Though I prefer the term "borrowed."

170
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,840
Impressive.

171
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:31,343
There's hope for you yet.

172
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:33,595
Look, all I'm saying is,

173
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:35,130
the stories you grew up on are just that.

174
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:36,548
They're stories, all right?

175
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,516
The Medieval world was a time of turmoil.

176
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:40,385
It was the collapse of Rome,

177
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:43,271
which led to the collapse
of civilization itself.

178
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:45,523
And don't even get me started
on the health and sanitation.

179
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,109
- Yeah, please don't.
- Cholera, diphtheria,

180
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:51,229
uh, typhoid fever, and I'm not
even touching skin diseases.

181
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,032
Speaking of which, why did you
choose to dress like a leper?

182
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:56,484
I didn't. This is historically accurate.

183
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:59,871
You all look like you're
going to a Renaissance Fair.

184
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:02,123
- What is it?
- We're being followed.

185
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,075
And by the way, even if I was a leper,

186
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:05,460
it'd be way less obvious than

187
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:07,379
a bunch of knights in shining armor.

188
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,804
Wait... I mean, ho...
I mean... I mean, hark!

189
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:17,505
Good knight, we intend you no harm.

190
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,758
We are but mere travelers in this land.

191
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,643
Your dialect is way off.

192
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:25,397
I, Raymond of the Palms,
and my band of merry men

193
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,733
and women, humbly request
safe passage to Camelot,

194
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:30,568
and an audience with King Arthur.

195
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,903
King Arthur?

196
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,571
Yes, you can his crest on their shields.

197
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:43,448
I am Guinevere.

198
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,583
We shall escort you to Camelot...

199
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:51,456
But your leper must remain
outside the castle walls.

200
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,624
I'm not a leper!

201
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,309
Still think this is just a story?

202
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:14,479
This place shouldn't exist.

203
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:16,398
There's no need of that here.

204
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,733
We're all equal in the court of Camelot.

205
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,319
That's why I love this guy.

206
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:22,620
Our paths crossed in the wood

207
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,906
while tracking the
Black Knight, Your Grace.

208
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:26,408
How then are we to know
that they're not in league

209
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,876
with that vile rogue?

210
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:29,794
- Ray?
- Your Grace,

211
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:31,579
I swear we are not your enemies.

212
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:35,250
We are warriors on a
quest, a race against evil.

213
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:38,002
A great evil haunts my
land these many days,

214
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:40,889
kidnapping my noble
Knights of the Round Table.

215
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:43,675
Therefore, it'll fall on my wisest adviser

216
00:09:43,677 --> 00:09:45,844
to measure the truth of your words.

217
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,145
Oh, please don't say it.

218
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:48,179
Summon Merlin!

219
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:55,520
Get ready to fight our way out of here

220
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:57,155
if Merlin rules against us.

221
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,696
That's Star Girl.

222
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:09,534
What are you doing in Camelot?

223
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:21,917
This ship... it never ceases to amaze me.

224
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,803
Well, speaking of amazing... Merlin?

225
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:27,256
Just an identity I adopted
to fit into this era.

226
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:29,091
But are you even doing in this era?

227
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:32,428
Let me guess, it has something
to do with the Spear of Destiny.

228
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,264
We found Dr. Mid-Nite in year 3000.

229
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,483
He's dead, Courtney.

230
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,185
We think he was killed because he possessed

231
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:40,769
a piece of the Spear.

232
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,855
What do you know about
the JSA's final mission?

233
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:45,024
Obsidian told me that the JSA disappeared

234
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,359
after a trip to Leipzig in 1956.

235
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:49,495
The mission was to recover
the Spear of Destiny,

236
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:51,864
and keep it from falling into enemy hands.

237
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:58,087
And how was it that you were
all scattered throughout time?

238
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,288
We were joined on our mission by someone

239
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,258
who called himself a Time Master.

240
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,459
Rip Hunter.

241
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:04,677
Yes.

242
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,633
He said the Spear could
alter reality itself...

243
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:13,852
that it was too powerful for
any man or woman to possess,

244
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:16,889
so we broke it into four separate pieces.

245
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:18,274
Mr. Hunter took one...

246
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,275
And took the rest of you

247
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:20,859
to three different time periods.

248
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:23,696
When I arrived in Camelot,
it was a middling kingdom.

249
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:25,898
To help me protect my piece of the Spear,

250
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,867
I fashioned it into the
legendary court of King Arthur

251
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,819
and his Knights of the Round Table.

252
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,634
Courtney, I respect your devotion,

253
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:46,752
but shouldn't you at least tell me

254
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:48,003
where the fragment is hidden?

255
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:50,222
Don't worry, Amaya, I promise,

256
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:51,924
the piece is somewhere very safe.

257
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:55,844
Your tracking in the woods was excellent.

258
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:58,230
There's not many people that
can get the jump on me like that.

259
00:11:58,232 --> 00:12:00,733
I was a warrior long before I was a queen.

260
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,185
Why does it sound like you preferred that?

261
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:07,022
Politics is not one of my passions.

262
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:09,525
But Arthur is a true friend and ally,

263
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,160
and I believe in his vision for a more just

264
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:13,028
and peaceful kingdom.

265
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,032
From what I see, Camelot
lives up to its reputation.

266
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,201
Where is the good king?

267
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,036
On the hunt...

268
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:23,706
no doubt chasing a boar
through the brush as we speak.

269
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:56,071
Do your worst, knave.

270
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:57,706
I'd rather die than surrender.

271
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:02,911
Then you are an idiot.

272
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:04,997
You're not going to run me through.

273
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:07,132
No.

274
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:10,753
We have something else in
mind for you, Your Majesty.

275
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:14,223
Huzzah!

276
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:18,260
Mmm.

277
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,014
Ah!

278
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:23,899
I can't believe Marty
and Mick are missing this.

279
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,734
Like, right? I mean, when's the next time

280
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:27,353
we're gonna get to feast in Camelot?

281
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,571
- Mm.
- Hey, guys, check it out.

282
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:31,940
- That's Sir Galahad.
- How do you know that?

283
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,826
Because he's sitting in the Siege Perilous.

284
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:35,861
- What?
- Come on.

285
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:37,112
Some kind of historian you are.

286
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:38,864
Siege Perilous is a special seat

287
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,616
reserved for only the purest of knights.

288
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,117
I don't how many times
I have to tell you...

289
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,837
there's a difference
between legend and history.

290
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,839
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

291
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,293
Sir Galahad.

292
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:56,131
Oh, is this seat taken?

293
00:13:56,133 --> 00:14:00,636
It is now, my friend.

294
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:02,688
Apologies, you must get this all the time,

295
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,391
but I must tell you, I am a really big fan.

296
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:08,694
A fan. So you make wind?

297
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,729
No, no, no, no, no, um...

298
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:12,030
Well...

299
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:13,782
I mean, maybe after all this food.

300
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:17,820
No, what I mean is I'm a...

301
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:21,240
I'm a big admirer of yours.

302
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:22,541
You've heard tale of my exploits?

303
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:24,126
Yes! Yes!

304
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:27,129
Since I was a wee lad.

305
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,964
It's hard to explain.

306
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,049
I am but a servant.

307
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:33,335
It is my honor to serve
the true inspiration

308
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:35,504
of Camelot's glory...

309
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:38,557
King Arthur, for was it not he

310
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,844
who said that might must serve right,

311
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:45,180
lest it bloom into the
cruel flower of tyranny?

312
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,099
Yet another reason I love him.

313
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:57,493
They sound the return of the king.

314
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,745
Arthur's captured the Black Knight.

315
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:04,783
Arthur, I was beginning to...

316
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,255
Oh, sorry about the ruse,

317
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:11,707
but I figure it was the
only way to get inside.

318
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,625
Oh! Hey, guys.

319
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:15,878
I see you've met my friend Arthur here.

320
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,214
Give us a smile, Arthur.

321
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,136
Arthur...

322
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:28,023
The king has left the building.

323
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:30,976
You don't get the reference? Ugh, pity.

324
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,648
Basically, your king now does
anything I want him to do,

325
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,368
so if you don't him to spill
your blood all over this floor,

326
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,705
I suggest that you hand over
your fragment of the Spear.

327
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:46,575
My patience is running short.

328
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:55,133
The fragment... where is it?

329
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,171
As long as I live, you will never have it.

330
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:03,559
That might turn out to
be shorter than you think.

331
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:23,278
Stand fast, or your king dies.

332
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,615
All I have to do is think it,
and he slits his own throat.

333
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,000
Ultimatum time.

334
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:30,586
Deliver the fragment to me by dawn,

335
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:35,007
or I'll come back with an army
just as obedient as Arthur here.

336
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,792
Choice is yours...

337
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:39,628
Camelot... or the Spear.

338
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,837
Galahad, may you rest in peace,

339
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,506
where sorrow and pain are banished.

340
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:20,426
May the everlasting light
of Camelot shine upon you.

341
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:22,595
How do you know this Black Knight?

342
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:26,065
His name's Damien Darhk.
He works with the speedster

343
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,451
who turned Rip Hunter against the JSA.

344
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:31,087
Well, Rip's not the only
one under their control now.

345
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,572
That thing's dark magic
has turned my king...

346
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:36,258
my own husband into my enemy.

347
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,194
- It's not his fault.
- And yet I watched him

348
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:40,496
strike down Sir Galahad with my own eyes.

349
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:42,865
You have to believe that
your husband can be saved,

350
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,750
or else he will be truly lost.

351
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:45,951
Unless we stop the Black Knight's army,

352
00:17:45,953 --> 00:17:47,203
we may never find out.

353
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:48,954
My Queen, you must be strong.

354
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:50,840
With King Arthur missing,
the Knights of the Round Table

355
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:53,676
will look to you to lead them.

356
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:56,512
The mantle of king is Arthur's.

357
00:17:56,514 --> 00:17:58,381
Not mine.

358
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:01,217
Guinevere, wait.

359
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:05,604
Look, sometimes the mantle...
it just falls into your lap.

360
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:09,558
Trust me. I know that it's hard.

361
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,694
You're clever,

362
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:13,479
you're brave,

363
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:16,732
and you are a natural born commander.

364
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:18,117
I know you can do this.

365
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,409
You saw what they did to Arthur.

366
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:28,794
Imagine what they could do with
an army of brainwashed knights.

367
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:31,414
- What are you suggesting?
- The fragment of the Spear...

368
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,998
we need to get it out of the castle.

369
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,383
How can your team protect the Spear?

370
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:37,887
You couldn't even protect Dr. Mid-Nite.

371
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:39,555
- That's not fair.
- I'm not going anywhere,

372
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:42,425
and neither is the fragment.

373
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:44,477
Fascinating. It seems to contain

374
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:47,763
some sort of sophisticated receiver.

375
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:50,733
Clearly it's the same technology I...

376
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:54,487
I-I found in Dr.
Mid-Nite's lab.

377
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:57,273
- Grey, you didn't.
- You bet he did.

378
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:59,909
Nicked it off the dead
guy. Even I was impressed.

379
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:02,828
I was simply curious.

380
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,330
And it's a good thing I did.

381
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:06,582
These components appear to be a set,

382
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:10,336
perhaps functioning together
as transmitter and receiver.

383
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:12,588
- Or commander and soldier.
- Exactly.

384
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,340
The commander wears the transmitter,

385
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:17,093
sending orders via an
electro-telepathic signal

386
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:19,095
to this receiver, worn by the soldier.

387
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:20,880
Well, anything with a
signal can get hacked.

388
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:22,264
That is the hope, yes.

389
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,300
So all we need to is somehow

390
00:19:24,302 --> 00:19:26,302
boost the brain power of
whoever's wearing this.

391
00:19:26,304 --> 00:19:27,853
Or find someone

392
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:32,391
with a preternaturally powerful brain.

393
00:19:32,393 --> 00:19:34,143
You mean you?

394
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:35,694
Fine, if you insist.

395
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:40,649
Now, all we need is a test subject.

396
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:44,153
Someone who's mind is, uh, pliable.

397
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:47,706
What?

398
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:53,829
Hey, Sir
Drools-A-Lot,

399
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:57,333
prepare the rest of your tin
men to get ready to march.

400
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:04,390
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

401
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,511
Prepare your men, King Arthur.

402
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:13,015
As you wish, my liege.

403
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:15,434
Prepare to march.

404
00:20:15,436 --> 00:20:17,520
Who knew these things would come in handy?

405
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,165
Now, Mr. Rory, I want you
to get up out of that chair.

406
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:35,037
No, I command you to
get up out of that chair.

407
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:39,875
Do... do you feel anything
at all, a foreign impulse,

408
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:41,677
just like twinge perhaps?

409
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,214
Wait, I'm picking up on something.

410
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:48,217
Oh, my God, it's working.

411
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,635
I'm hungry.

412
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:51,720
This is a disaster.

413
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:56,225
Wait.

414
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,365
It seems our adversaries are
sending a signal of their own.

415
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:06,902
- What does that mean?
- Oh, dear God.

416
00:21:06,904 --> 00:21:10,573
It means the Legion is coming for Camelot.

417
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:18,914
Valiant Knights of Camelot,

418
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,834
I know the fear you feel.

419
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:25,888
We stand now on the precipice of doom.

420
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,424
Our king has been taken from us.

421
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:30,226
Evil draws close,

422
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:34,563
and hope, it seems, is lost.

423
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:37,983
But we must rise and face this challenge,

424
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:40,102
as Arthur would have wanted.

425
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:42,404
We must remember who we are.

426
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:44,740
We're brothers and sisters.

427
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:46,742
We're fighters and friends.

428
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:49,194
We are not mere knights.

429
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:51,530
We are Camelot!

430
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:53,616
We are Camelot!

431
00:21:53,618 --> 00:21:58,203
We are Camelot! We are Camelot!

432
00:21:58,205 --> 00:22:01,373
The dark army approaches.
It's reached the great wood.

433
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,709
It seems your wizard is too late.

434
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:05,377
Is she talking about Professor Stein?

435
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:06,879
No matter.

436
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:09,882
We shall settle this at
the point of our swords.

437
00:22:09,884 --> 00:22:13,102
Camelot calls to you in its hour of need.

438
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:14,887
Will you answer?

439
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:19,358
Who will follow me onto
the field of battle?

440
00:22:22,813 --> 00:22:24,480
Dude, what are they doing?

441
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:26,782
These guys don't stand a chance out there.

442
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:30,569
Is this really worth
the risk for some dream?

443
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:32,621
Yes, because a long time ago

444
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:35,291
that dream meant the world to a little boy,

445
00:22:35,293 --> 00:22:37,242
and he still remembers.

446
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:51,590
This isn't gonna end well.

447
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:02,184
What are you doing?

448
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:04,937
If Star Girl won't give us the
fragment for safe-keeping...

449
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:06,939
You're stealing it?

450
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:09,274
She's not thinking straight.

451
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:20,336
I should have known.

452
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:24,506
You sure this is the way you wanna do it?

453
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:27,960
Star Girl was your teammate,
not to mention your friend.

454
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:30,546
The Legion of Doom are
closing in on us as we speak.

455
00:23:30,548 --> 00:23:32,431
There's no time for sentiment.

456
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:34,099
Do you really wanna chance Damien Darhk

457
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:37,386
having the power to rewrite reality?

458
00:23:37,388 --> 00:23:39,355
I guess not.

459
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:45,894
It's set in stone.

460
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:47,229
Not for long.

461
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:07,416
Damn, that was badass.

462
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:19,395
Let's get out of here.

463
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:21,513
Put it down.

464
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33,371
We should attack now.

465
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:41,045
Let me tell you how an ultimatum works.

466
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,915
The so-called Legends have until dawn

467
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,750
to deliver the Spear.

468
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,084
You don't actually believe

469
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,803
that they'll hand it over, do you?

470
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:50,972
Perhaps not, but meeting on a battle field

471
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:54,175
is infinitely more wise than
laying siege to the castle.

472
00:24:54,177 --> 00:24:56,093
Right.

473
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,930
I-I just thought that you
would want my expertise.

474
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,516
After all, I have already retrieved

475
00:25:01,518 --> 00:25:04,101
two fragments of the Spear, but...

476
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,103
Word to the wise,

477
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,689
speak to me with respect.

478
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:11,692
That little thing on your
head doesn't control me.

479
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:14,745
I don't want to fight with you, Amaya,

480
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,614
- but I will if I have to.
- Then get ready,

481
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,282
because I'm not leaving
without the fragment.

482
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:19,834
Hey, we have enough enemies as it is

483
00:25:19,836 --> 00:25:22,170
- without fighting each other.
- You left us, Amaya.

484
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:23,454
I was there to protect the Spear,

485
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,705
and I will continue to protect it

486
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,090
until I take my last breath.

487
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,458
Because you know that doing the right thing

488
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,927
is more important than
doing what feels right.

489
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,546
You're still a member
of the Justice Society.

490
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:34,549
No, I'm not. My heart belongs in Camelot.

491
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:35,850
Your heart?

492
00:25:35,852 --> 00:25:37,518
You of all people should understand.

493
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,137
It wasn't duty that led
you to join the Legends.

494
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:44,525
You've fallen in love with Arthur.

495
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:48,196
Your make-believe kingdom
is a real soap opera.

496
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:51,065
How can you expect me to turn away

497
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:55,152
from the truest thing I've ever known?

498
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:58,155
All I know is that the Legion of Doom

499
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:01,075
will not stop until they get this,

500
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:02,493
and once they do,

501
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:06,881
the world, as we know it, is over.

502
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:11,719
Which is why you're taking it, Amaya.

503
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:16,224
I can't go, so you have to fulfill my oath.

504
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:17,808
Protect the Spear.

505
00:26:19,262 --> 00:26:21,979
All right, you heard the wizard.

506
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:22,897
Let's boogie.

507
00:26:35,945 --> 00:26:38,362
Ray, this is wrong.

508
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:41,582
Please tell me that's not Galahad's sword.

509
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:43,534
I know, it's not historically accurate,

510
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,669
but...

511
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:48,372
I couldn't resist.

512
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:54,712
It's like a saber made of light.

513
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,180
Yeah.

514
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,882
Uh, just don't call it a light saber.

515
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:00,217
- Major trademark issues, right?
- Yeah, trademark.

516
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,303
Have you lost your complete mind?

517
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:05,106
No, I focused the ionic
energy into Galahad's sword.

518
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:08,059
That's great, Ray, but Sara
says it's time to go, so...

519
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,144
What? But the battle hasn't even begun.

520
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:11,896
Precisely why we're leaving now.

521
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:13,948
Listen, Amaya found the fragment,

522
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,367
so there's need for this medieval warfare.

523
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,069
That's great news, right?

524
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,154
Let's go.

525
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:23,374
In case you weren't listening,
this is the part where we run.

526
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:27,244
- I can't.
- Sure, you can.

527
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,913
Left foot, right foot, repeat, let's go.

528
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:33,050
No, Nate, look around you.

529
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:35,720
All of these men are willing
to die on the battlefield...

530
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:39,223
not for some Spear, but for an idea.

531
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:41,976
And I get it now. Camelot
isn't about history.

532
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:43,761
It's not even about some dusty old books

533
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:46,731
that got a lonely kid through childhood.

534
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:50,985
It's about one noble idea...

535
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,571
that we can all stand up for what's right,

536
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:56,107
no matter what.

537
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,442
And I can't walk away from that.

538
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,578
I believe you, Ray.

539
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,448
I do. And Camelot's great.

540
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,866
But if you don't leave right now,

541
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:07,201
- you're gonna die here.
- Would it kill you

542
00:28:07,203 --> 00:28:08,869
to be just a little bit more supportive?

543
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:10,621
You don't get it, man.
I checked the manuscript.

544
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,123
I saw your funeral.

545
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:18,963
Well, sounds to me like the
stuff Legends are made of.

546
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,383
All right, Gideon, let's
get ready for take off.

547
00:28:22,385 --> 00:28:24,602
- Yes, Captain.
- This doesn't feel right.

548
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:27,021
We don't just leave people in trouble.

549
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:29,223
They're knights, and they're
fighting so we can get away.

550
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:31,308
- With the piece of the Spear.
- And without Rip.

551
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,694
Take comfort we live to fight another day.

552
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:35,479
The Legion already has
two pieces of the Spear.

553
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,448
I don't like it, but we cannot risk them

554
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,983
getting a Yahtzee.

555
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:40,451
What the hell's a Yahtzee?

556
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,286
System's online, Captain Lance.

557
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,821
We are ready to time-jump.

558
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,909
Where's Raymond?

559
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:51,829
With this sword, I dub thee

560
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:57,251
Sir Raymond of the Palms,
defender of Camelot.

561
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:59,637
Rise, good knight.

562
00:29:03,643 --> 00:29:05,509
I tried talking to him, but he's hell-bent

563
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,094
- on getting himself killed.
- Doesn't he know

564
00:29:07,096 --> 00:29:08,679
that we have the piece of the Spear?

565
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,598
All he seems to care
about is being remembered

566
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,184
- in some BS bedtime story.
- We can't leave him behind.

567
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,102
We're not leaving him. He chose to say.

568
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:17,521
Amaya, I know you're following
JSA protocol at whatever cost,

569
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:19,523
but this is seriously screwed up.

570
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,325
We can't risk losing a piece of the Spear,

571
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:23,110
especially when the
Legion is being backed by

572
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:24,445
evil Knights of the Round Table.

573
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:25,863
I thought you were
gonna un-evil-fy them.

574
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,698
We were if we just had a little more time.

575
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,167
- We still can.
- And what happens if you can't?

576
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,370
Well, as much as
Haircut's a pain in my ass,

577
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,123
I'm not gonna let him fight alone.

578
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,008
Sit down. That's an order.

579
00:29:40,463 --> 00:29:44,432
- What's an order?
- Don't test me, Mick.

580
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:46,050
Don't threaten me, blondie.

581
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,605
I can't believe I'm actually
agreeing with Mr. Rory.

582
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:53,057
- Sara.
- I said sit down.

583
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,942
Stop.

584
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:57,895
I've already lost one team.

585
00:29:57,897 --> 00:30:01,232
I'll be damned if my decision
rips the Legends apart too.

586
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:04,368
- What are you saying?
- Listen to your gut, Captain.

587
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,287
Don't abandon Ray.

588
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:08,038
He may be sentimental, but the team

589
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,407
should come before tactics.

590
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,881
All right, let's do this.

591
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,632
Guinevere's knights are
not gonna able to last long

592
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,885
against Damien Darhk's
army unless you three...

593
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:22,553
Take out Mid-Nite's
mind-control tech.

594
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,171
- We're on it.
- We are?

595
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:26,423
Amaya, Nate...

596
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,631
you ready to go get medieval out there?

597
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:39,515
Wait, you... you've got it reversed.

598
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:41,734
I need the transmitting
device, not the receiver.

599
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:43,369
I got an idea.

600
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:45,321
What if it's not about brain power,

601
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:47,790
but about intensity? Like his.

602
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:48,991
We don't have time for this.

603
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:51,660
Put the dog collar on, Professor.

604
00:30:54,716 --> 00:30:57,416
I have more patents than
Mr. Rory has felonies,

605
00:30:57,418 --> 00:30:58,834
and that's saying something.

606
00:30:58,836 --> 00:31:01,003
To think that his mind is
more powerful than mine...

607
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:02,254
Shut up.

608
00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:07,560
Wait, did you shut up
because you wanted to,

609
00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:09,895
or because he told you to?

610
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:12,598
- Hm.
- Make him answer.

611
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,400
Answer the man, Professor.

612
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,523
Astonishing.

613
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:21,857
It worked.

614
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:23,242
I knew it. Okay.

615
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:25,027
Now all we gotta do is amplify the signal.

616
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:26,195
What do you want me to do?

617
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:28,197
Just rest your brain, Mr. Rory.

618
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,665
We'll let you know when
it's time to take control

619
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,033
of the evil army.

620
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:34,003
Ah, finally I get to fulfill my destiny.

621
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,254
God help us.

622
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:54,366
So, came to fight for an
imaginary kingdom after all?

623
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:55,584
I came to fight for a friend.

624
00:32:58,256 --> 00:32:59,672
A really dumb friend.

625
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:34,156
Okay, I need you to unleash the darkness

626
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:35,824
on those brainwashed knights.

627
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:37,243
Let 'em inside your head.

628
00:33:37,245 --> 00:33:39,662
Fill their minds with
every brutish impulse...

629
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:41,213
every traumatic memory.

630
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:44,083
That just might be enough
to overload the system.

631
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:46,335
Spare nothing.

632
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:51,891
Poor babies.

633
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:18,033
Be gone, devilish sorcerer!

634
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:35,134
Damien...

635
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:40,723
Sorry, I don't do rescues.

636
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:41,890
Yah.

637
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:46,195
Damn it, Ray!

638
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:14,306
You're here to finish me off, Captain?

639
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:19,595
What are you doing?

640
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,900
Saving your life.

641
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:50,092
Give it up, Raymond.

642
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:53,595
You're a glorified nerd, not a knight.

643
00:35:53,597 --> 00:35:55,798
I'm Sir Raymond of the Palms,

644
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,634
and on behalf of
my 12-year-old self,

645
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:00,102
allow me to retort.

646
00:36:32,503 --> 00:36:34,002
Yield, Damien!

647
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:38,507
Okay, okay, I submit.

648
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:02,725
Ray!

649
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:04,277
Ray!

650
00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:08,564
Ray. Oh, come on, buddy,

651
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:10,733
open your eyes, you stupid bastard.

652
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:12,234
Ray, come on!

653
00:37:16,374 --> 00:37:17,456
Ray!

654
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,676
Stop yelling at me.

655
00:37:24,332 --> 00:37:26,749
Ray, you brilliant bastard.

656
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:28,751
It's not Ray anymore.

657
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,670
It's Sir Raymond of the Palms.

658
00:37:30,672 --> 00:37:32,888
Yeah.

659
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,257
I'm never gonna call you that, buddy.

660
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:44,650
Thank you, Amaya. Tales of your deeds

661
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:47,436
will honor these halls for
longer than you can imagine.

662
00:37:47,438 --> 00:37:49,438
The honor is mine, Your Grace.

663
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:01,083
Hey. So you're staying?

664
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:03,035
Like you, I found a new home.

665
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:05,421
- Like me?
- With the Legends.

666
00:38:05,423 --> 00:38:06,956
The team suits you.

667
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:12,261
Take care of yourself, Courtney.

668
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:16,882
You too, Amaya.

669
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,888
What was that all about?

670
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,274
- Just a little friendly advice.
- Yeah?

671
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:26,976
We should get going. Where's Ray?

672
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:28,728
Um, he said something about

673
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:31,280
paying his respects to
the queen before we left.

674
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:33,149
Hm, funny,

675
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:35,651
Sara said the exact same thing.

676
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:40,373
I just wanted to say good-bye.

677
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:42,324
I enjoyed meeting you.

678
00:38:42,326 --> 00:38:45,494
And I you, Sara Lance...

679
00:38:45,496 --> 00:38:46,545
a lot.

680
00:38:46,547 --> 00:38:48,964
Sara
Lance-A-Lot.

681
00:38:52,003 --> 00:38:54,804
I should go.

682
00:38:54,806 --> 00:38:56,889
Do you really have to leave?

683
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:59,508
It is I, Raymond of the Palms, my lady...

684
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,560
come to bid my fair lady adieu.

685
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:03,896
Oh, well...

686
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:06,732
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.

687
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:08,601
- Sara.
- It's okay, Ray, come in.

688
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:12,188
And a thousand thanks for
your service to the realm.

689
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,857
If ever your travels bring you back,

690
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,992
there will always be a
seat at the Round Table

691
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:19,528
for Sir Raymond of the Palms.

692
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,081
Thank you, My Lady.

693
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:29,839
You know, every good
legend ends with a kiss.

694
00:39:44,555 --> 00:39:46,856
Good-bye, Guinevere.

695
00:39:57,485 --> 00:39:58,868
Surely you must admit

696
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,619
that it's not a superior intelligence,

697
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:04,156
but rather the murky depths
of your mind that proved vital.

698
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:05,741
Just admit it,

699
00:40:05,743 --> 00:40:07,209
my brain saved the day.

700
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:09,245
I will admit nothing of the sort.

701
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:10,629
All right, I'll admit it,

702
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:12,998
walking around in a
legend felt just as real as

703
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,750
walking around any part of history.

704
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:16,886
And you know what? Maybe legend and history

705
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:19,388
aren't so different after
all. Maybe they're just stories

706
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,225
to remind us where we come
from and who we can become.

707
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:24,927
So what do you say? You wanna find out

708
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:26,262
how you're gonna be remembered

709
00:40:26,264 --> 00:40:28,314
in everyone's favorite bedtime story?

710
00:40:28,316 --> 00:40:30,316
Nah.

711
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:33,435
I think I'd rather make
up my future as I go.

712
00:40:33,437 --> 00:40:35,654
Nice.

713
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,612
I got something I wanna say to you.

714
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:50,669
Well, I'm a captive audience, aren't I?

715
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:52,454
I was gonna kill you

716
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:54,373
for what you did to Sara,

717
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:58,177
but she stopped me, and I'm glad.

718
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:00,296
But make no mistake,

719
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:03,432
you are not Captain, and
this is not your ship.

720
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:04,967
Not any more.

721
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:09,271
So if you even think about
hurting anyone on my team,

722
00:41:09,273 --> 00:41:11,607
I will not hesitate to end you.

723
00:41:14,562 --> 00:41:17,313
Feel good to get that
off your chest, did it?

724
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:31,838
Gideon.

725
00:41:32,544 --> 00:41:34,327
I'm here, Captain.

726
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,157
You always are.

727
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:54,560
