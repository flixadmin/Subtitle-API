1
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,204
Gustavo, sit down.
You're making me nervous.

2
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,628
lt's a good plan. Trust yourself.

3
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,630
Everything is going to be okay.

4
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,278
Are you crazy?

5
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:16,464
The boss is gonna rip your balls off!

6
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,841
What, you gonna tell?

7
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,452
And you?

8
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,996
They ain't gonna say nothing.

9
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,457
They like what they see.

10
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,350
You're not going to offer our guests anything?

11
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,936
Who says they're guests?

12
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,898
lf the boss wants them to drink...

13
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,526
...they drink.

14
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,825
So...the Chicken Brothers.

15
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,495
l like your restaurant.

16
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,668
Dark meat and white meat?

17
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,420
Don't look like no brothers to me.

18
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:16,633
At last!

19
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:18,327
The master chefs!

20
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,321
You two....

21
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,367
That chicken you cook....

22
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:31,289
l swear, it has got to be the 
tastiest chicken in all of Mexico.

23
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,399
Thank you, Don Eladio.

24
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,150
lt's a great honor.

25
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,569
Max is the chef.

26
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,445
The compliments are all his.

27
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,155
Gustavo is too modest.

28
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,283
There'd be no restaurant without him.

29
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,744
Well, however you two do it, keep it up.

30
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,249
Your chicken, it's so...zesty.

31
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,585
Piquant.

32
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,754
But it does not taste like a Mexican style.

33
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,048
lt's a recipe l learned in Chile...

34
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,051
...which l've modified a bit for the Mexican palate.

35
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:05,973
l bet we like a little 
more chili than you Chileans.

36
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,578
We Mexicans like a good hard kick!

37
00:37:11,802 --> 00:37:13,302
Sit down please.

38
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,447
So...if your partner is the chef...

39
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,949
...then who are you?

40
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,494
Don't tell me you are just the taster!

41
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,124
l handle the business operations.

42
00:37:32,218 --> 00:37:34,886
Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.

43
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,924
Good, good.

44
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,260
But tell me something.

45
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,139
That chicken, so fabulous...

46
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,100
...so excellent....

47
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,937
Besides that, what else
do you have on your menu?

48
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,439
We have several side dishes.

49
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,733
Rice. Beans.

50
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,527
Sometimes we prepare a carnitas entrée...

51
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,030
...if we come across fresh beef in the market.

52
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,866
Anything else?

53
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,535
Come on, be honest.

54
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:13,499
There is nothing else you offer?
A little taste of something else?

55
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,960
Something on the side?

56
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,465
Because when l send my men to your restaurant...

57
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,761
...they come back with more than just chicken.

58
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,555
They come back with drugs.

59
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,855
You are selling them narcotics.

60
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,358
Methamphetamine.

61
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,154
With all due respect, Don Eladio.

62
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,864
l didn't sell it to them.

63
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,866
l gave them samples.

64
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,285
Samples.

65
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,707
Some businessman.

66
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,460
l gave them samples to give to you.

67
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,672
To introduce you to our product.

68
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,008
Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offense.

69
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,261
But he...that is to say we...

70
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,514
...could think of no other 
way to get your attention.

71
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,767
We want to work with you, Don Eladio.

72
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,522
l know all about methamphetamine.

73
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,278
That's poor man's cocaine.

74
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:31,160
Only bikers and hillbillies use it.

75
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,205
There's no money in it.

76
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,082
May l, Don Eladio....

77
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,501
l am a biochemist by training.

78
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,254
The methamphetamine 
we make is much superior...

79
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,758
...to the so-called biker crank you know of.

80
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,718
lt is crystallized, like glass.

81
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,303
Purer.

82
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,638
And the chirality of the molecule...

83
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,183
...its very structure, is different.

84
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,310
The narcotic effect is far more potent.

85
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,646
This product is the drug of the future.

86
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,608
lt'll triple your profits.

87
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,902
Perhaps quadruple.

88
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,781
They're not only good cooks...

89
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,949
...they're great at shoveling manure.

90
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,377
Right now, you deal almost exclusively with cocaine.

91
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,671
But the coca plant can't grow in Mexico.

92
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,925
You are no more than middlemen...

93
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,094
...for the Colombians.

94
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:34,848
They cut you a percentage 
for smuggling across the border.

95
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,779
But the lion's share
of the profits goes to them...

96
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,984
...despite your assumption of all the risk.

97
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,737
This new crystal methamphetamine....

98
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:53,826
lt's stronger, more addictive than cocaine...

99
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,412
...which means it will move in higher volume.

100
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,582
But most importantly, it's completely artificial.

101
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,085
We can show you how to manufacture it...

102
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,419
...right here in Mexico.

103
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,840
And you keep all the profits.

104
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,638
My men do like your product.

105
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,270
Hector, what is wrong with you?

106
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:25,298
Why did you not get glasses for our guests?

107
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,285
Go on.

108
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,200
You are quite the talent.

109
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:40,247
l bet you learned cooking
from your mama. lsn't that true?

110
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:46,253
But...what about the chemistry?

111
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,548
l studied at the University of Santiago.

112
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,967
Gustavo paid for my education.

113
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,218
Oh, really?

114
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:59,099
l have degrees in both 
biochemistry and chemical engineering.

115
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,768
With minimal capital investment...

116
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,396
...we can set up a 
factory-grade laboratory for you.

117
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,816
Train your own people
to manufacture large quantities...

118
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,860
...of highly pure methamphetamine.

119
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,321
Fantastic!

120
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,701
Tell me one thing, though.

121
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,370
lf you're the cook....

122
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,706
Why do l need him?

123
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,129
You.

124
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:35,969
Why should l negotiate with 
someone who doesn't respect me?

125
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,558
Who insults me by dealing
under my nose without my permission?

126
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,604
Who manipulates me into a meeting...

127
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,191
...in front of my own men?

128
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,611
What do l need you for?

129
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,323
Don Eladio. Please.

130
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,158
l didn't sell anything.

131
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,535
l apologize if you are offended...

132
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,914
...by my method of obtaining this meeting.

133
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:07,501
l merely took the initiative.

134
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:12,506
l meant no insult.

135
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,883
Don Eladio, Gustavo didn't mean to offend.

136
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,760
l know Gustavo like a brother.

137
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,262
He's an honorable man.

138
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,181
The most loyal man l have ever known.

139
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,642
He rescued me from the Santiago slums.

140
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,435
He made me the man l am today!

141
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,397
Gustavo is a genius.
He will make you millions!

142
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:32,109
Just find it in your heart 
to forgive him this one small mistake.

143
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:33,986
Please...

144
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,780
He's my partner.

145
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,741
l need him! l swear to God!

146
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,237
Look at him.

147
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,947
You did this to him.

148
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,993
Now, look at him.

149
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,300
Listen to me.

150
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:43,597
The only reason you are alive and he is not...

151
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:48,101
...is because l know who you are.

152
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:49,978
But understand....

153
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,647
You are not in Chile anymore.

154
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,244
My advice....

155
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,539
Stick to chicken.
