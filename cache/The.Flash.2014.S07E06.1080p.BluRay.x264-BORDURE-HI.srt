100 years ago.

You're around it all day. Duh.</i>

00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,304
<i>Besides, that place is so boring.</i>

00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:13,348
[yelling]

5
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,517
- [laughing] <i>Wait. What's that?</i>
- [chuckles] Um...

6
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:17,352
Yeah, just some guy cosplaying.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,853
<i>What's he doing now?</i>

8
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,648
I don't know. Must be some sort of
Comic-Con thing or something.

9
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,651
[engine bellowing]

10
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:26,903
What in the world?

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,406
<i>- Natalie? Natalie, what's that noise?</i>
- [heavy feet thumping]

12
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,120
<i>Natalie, what's that noise?</i>

13
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:39,582
[creature snarling]

14
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,793
<i>Natalie? Natalie?</i>

00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,254

16
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:47,840
[roaring]

17
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,038
[Speed Force as Nora Allen]
My beautiful boy.

18
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,824
I'm giving him all the strength I can
to heal him.

19
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:16,244
Which means I'll be weak
for a bit longer.

20
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,037
Because Psych
and Fuerza attacked you?

21
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,561
[Speed Force as Nora Allen] Exactly.

22
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,583
[sighs]

23
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,418
Do you remember what happened?

24
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,211
Only some of it.

25
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:30,258
When I was reborn,
I was surrounded by light and love.

26
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,136
Then came the pain.

27
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,056
I could feel these Forces of Nature
were like me. Only... evil.

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,421
If they're like you,
then why are they trying to kill you?

29
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:40,560
I'm not sure,

30
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,770
but I think it's to feed.

31
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,524
That's why I had to find Barry Allen.

32
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:49,110
I thought he could keep me safe
until I fully recovered.

33
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,946
But if the other Forces find me
in this condition,

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,656
I wouldn't survive another attack.

35
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,782
Don't worry.

36
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,660
We are gonna figure out a way
to keep you safe.

37
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,286
Somehow.

38
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,042
Holy Henry T. Sampson...

39
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:09,505
Wow. So you're the actual,
all-encompassing,

40
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,591
immeasurably interstellar,

41
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,510
and mind-bendingly cosmerific...

42
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:18,806
Yes, Chester P. Runk.
I am the Speed Force.

43
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,977
[Cisco] Woo-hoo. Chessman...

44
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:26,481
How's that isotope detection system
coming along?

45
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,899
Yeah, actually...

46
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,568
- [whispers] She knows my name.
- I think she does.

47
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:31,653
[Chester] Okay.

48
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,031
Behold, believers...

49
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,742
This puppy I designed
can boost isotopic signals

50
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,160
for our satellites to scan.

51
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,621
Now all we need to do
is build a few units,

52
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,748
place them around the outskirts
of the city, and...

53
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:45,083
Eureka!

54
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,019
And then we would
get an early warning

55
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,753
if Psych or Fuerza
decided to come back.

56
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,340
And they can detect
foundational isotopic signatures.

57
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,217
So, we won't just know
they're coming...

58
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,095
We'll know, whoever it is,
Psych or Fuerza,

59
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,097
which one is headed our way.

60
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,765
Chester, that is amazing.

61
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,267
Could we use this
to follow the other Forces?

62
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,937
Perhaps find them
before they find us?

63
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,438
Not yet.

64
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:10,191
Right now they only work
in close proximity, so...

65
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:14,320
But at least now we have a way
to help protect you.

66
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,825
Cisco, how long would it take
to make enough amplifiers?

67
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,911
We have everything we need
in the S.T.A.R. Labs van.

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,374
So, we could build them as we go.

69
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,459
So let's do this, baby.

70
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:31,423
- 'Cause Team Chesco is on the case!
- 'Cause Team Chesco is on the case!

71
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,786
- Ah! [chuckles]
- Let's get it.

72
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,300
[sighs] Separated at birth.

[hip-hop music playing on stereo]

74
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:40,847
Hey.

75
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:42,682
What's all this?

76
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,184
Norvok finally brought the rest
of my stuff over

77
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,936
from one of Amunet's stash houses.

78
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,106
I was gonna throw everything away
but then muse struck.

79
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,194
Oh, wow. It's great.

80
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,947
Yeah, this'll really give the place
some attitude when I'm done.

81
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,116
I'm sorry.
You wanna hang that in here?

82
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,494
Yeah. That empty wall behind you,
it's been driving me crazy.

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,205
Well, you know what they say...

84
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,834
Great minds...

85
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,710
What do you think?

86
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:20,803
Um... It's missing something.

87
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:31,773
Ah.

88
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:33,983
Much better.

89
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,489
You know, art should always provoke
a strong reaction.

90
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,824
It does.

91
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:49,415
- And... sensor is ready.
- [device beeping]

92
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:50,624
Excellent.

93
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,377
Once the amplifier goes live,

94
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:57,215
then our early warning system
will be a go.

95
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,467
And that means it's time for...

96
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,150
[in sing-song voice]
Coffee and a cronut.

97

[in sing-song voice]
Coffee and a cronut...

98
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,097
Actually, you know,
there's a Sip-n-Dash in Masonville.

99
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,142
Or was, back in the day.

100
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,313
Oh, I used to live there,

101
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,315
but Grandma Runk and I moved
to Central City

102
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,733
when I was done with high school.

103
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,192
[Cisco] All right.

104
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,671
- Looks like we're ready to go.
- [Chester] Okay, cool.

105
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,947
[Chester sighs]

- Why?

[both sigh]

111
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,123
[Cisco] Look at this.

112
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,752
What do you think?

113
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,839
You think it's the neutrino
filtration glitching on us?

114
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,966
Cisco, Cisco, Cisco...

115
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:43,802
What?

116
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,556
[both screaming]

117
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,023
We're okay? We're okay.

118
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,024
What was that?

119
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,986
I have no idea.

120
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,948
[chiming softly]

121
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,659
Well, looks like
the sensor's working.

122
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,454
[sighs]

123
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,626
Did I give you my phone?

124
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,253
No.

125
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,755
Mine's gone, too.

126
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,300
Okay, hold up.

127
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,843
Where's the van?

128
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:27,554
It was just here.

129
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,310
[grunts]

130
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,442
Does the van have a secret cloaking
mode that I don't know about?

131
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,776
Asking for a friend.

132
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,570
That's no van.

133
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,578
[softly] Whoa.

134
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,580
Ches...

135
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,791
we've just been <i>Under-the-Domed.</i>

136
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,255
[Iris West] Nora?

137
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:04,842
You all right?

138
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:06,969
Yeah.

139
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,057
Just making sure
nothing happens to Barry.

140
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,728
[sighs] How do you deal with all this?

141
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,190
Well, it's never easy
dealing with a threat.

142
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,433
Especially when it affects someone
that you care about.

143
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,446
But don't worry, okay?

144
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,114
By this time tomorrow,

145
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,492
Barry will be back
to his old self, healed,

146
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,994
wrapped up on the couch,
full BBB-style.

147
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,833
BBB. Barry's Blanket Burrito.

148
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:41,879
It's hard to explain.

149
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,965
No, I understand.

150
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,551
It's something
between the two of you.

151
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,559
Actually, you know what?

152
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,645
It doesn't have to be.

153
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,602
I wanna show you something.

154
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,483
Come with me.

155
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:08,863
[Chester] We made it.

156
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,494
Now we can find a phone and call
S.T.A.R. Labs before...

157
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:17,915
Tell me you're seeing
what I'm seeing.

158
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,961
Does it have anything to do with
<i>Space Jam</i> being back in stock?

159
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:26,674
[Cisco] At that Blockbuster Video
that doesn't exist anymore?

160
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,510
[Chester] Yeah. And get this.
I saw a Sip-n-Dash store back there

161
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,555
that got torn down
when I was in high school.

162
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,810
I think we just time-traveled.

163
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,187
Really?

164
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,276
So, tonight we're gonna party
like it's 1998?

165
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,749
None of the pay phones work.

166
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,250
We don't have cell phones.

167
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,169
And we're trapped
in an invisible barrier.

168
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,463
We are stuck...

169
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,132
in the '90s?

170
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,343
This is so epic! Epic!

171
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:15,681
Wait. No, no, no.
It is off the heezy-fo-sheezy.

172
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,941
[Cisco] Okay, Cheesy,
why don't you calm down?

173
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,983
Look. Is this frickin' awesome?

174
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,568
Yes.

175
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,571
Do we desperately need to figure out
a way to get back home?

176
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:31,989
Also yes.

177
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:37,036
Well, how are we supposed to do that
without a DeLorean hot tub?

178
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,497
By looking at what brought us here.

179
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,249
A green energy wave

180
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,878
that looks like it came straight out
of <i>Turtle 2.0, White Whale's Revenge.</i>

181
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,880
Coincidence? I think not.

182
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:51,926
Look, I know you and Turtle 2.0
kinda have this thing...

183
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,009
I'll say.

184
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,514
Maybe we're not dealing with
a meta at all.

185
00:09:57,223 --> 00:10:01,560
The amplifier showed
an isotopic surge when the wave hit.

186
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,604
So it's one of our Forces.

187
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,232
Wait. Check the signatures.
Was it Fuerza or Psych?

188
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:10,653
Neither. The sensor detected
a temporal energy.

189
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,072
So there's a new Force
in town, and...

190
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,949
And it can control time.

191
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,285
Yeah, okay, we got to get outta here
and warn the team.

192
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,704
- The Speed Force isn't safe.
- Not so fast.

193
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,415
We need to know exactly
who we're up against.

194
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,668
Remember how the Speed Force

195
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,837
asked if the amplifiers
could track the Forces?

196
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,838
Yeah.

197
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,507
If we added a transmitter diode
to the sensor...

198
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,093
It could localize
the isotopic circuits enough

199
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,679
to detect a new Force
within a 20-yard radius.

200
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,807
Right, but we need
the kind of maxed-out receiver

201
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,267
that just doesn't exist yet.

202
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:48,858
Time to go shopping.

203
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,780
Man, there's a Tech Station
right here.

204
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,952
Ches, hurry up. This is embarrassing.

205
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,833
See?

206
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,379
One man's trash is another man's...

207
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,464
Another man's reason
for a tetanus shot?

208
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,843
I already got my tetanus shot.

209
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,720
[beeping]

210
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,765
I can't believe you just used junk
to fix our sensor.

211
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,728
Just think of it as one
repurposed Force Finder.

212
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,274
Rest in peace, Ultrafax 4000.

213
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,068
Damn, they don't make 'em
like you anymore.

214
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,236
All right.

215
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,990
Let's find ourselves a time god.

216
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,911
- [school bell ringing]
- [Cisco] The high school, huh?

217
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,705
The sensor seems to think
they're in here somewhere.

218
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,207
Let's do this.

219
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,167
Yo, yo, yo. For real?

220
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,587
Masonville's principal
suffers zero fools. Feel me?

221
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,673
All right,
then we just sneak in, simple.

222
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,426
We gotta blend in.

223
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,929
We got to kick it up a notch.

224
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,473
<i>This is how we do it</i>

225
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:03,598
Come on.

226
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,310
<i>This is how we do it</i>

227
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,853
<i>Check it out!</i>

228
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,104
<i>Once upon a time in '94</i>

229

<i>Montell made no money

230
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,651
<i>There lived a DJ

231
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,070
<i>He came up to Monty,

232
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,364
<i>You and Oji are gonna make some cash</i>

233

<i>Sell a million records

235
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,912
<i>This is how we do it...</i>

236
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,581
All right. Here's the plan.

237
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,125
We ask people questions.

238
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,087
See if anybody has any
diabolical plans to alter the future.

239
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,506
- Yes.
- And then we check the sensor.

240
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,966
If it spikes...

241
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,842
Then we've found our time god.

242
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:39,926
Let's get it.

243
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:43,889
This for the yearbook?

244
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:48,602
Yeah. "Future
Falcon Forecast" section.

245
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,655
- [Cisco] Mm-hm.
- What's the question again?

246
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,942
Where do you see yourself
in 23 years?

247
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,276
Mm.

Stranger danger.

How old are you?

00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,328
I'm seven, you predator.

327
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,957
Because you still think it's 1998.

Oh, no, no.

I don't wanna get in your van.

Listen, just listen. Okay?

You're not seven.

You're 30. And you're a scientist
at S.T.A.R. Labs. Remember?

00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,105
What about visiting Atlantis?

Or King Shark versus Grodd?

How did we get here?

342
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,380
Last thing I remember,
Parker was going all <i>Get Out</i> on us.

343
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,507
No, no. Parker's not our Biff Tannen.

344
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,134
A modern reference jolted him awake,
just like you.

345
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,844
We're back on Main Street.

346
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,514
Right before the wave hit,

347
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,601
Parker said, "It's gonna start over."

348
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:54,615
Gotta go.

349

- It's a time loop.
- It's a time loop.

350
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,627
This isn't about changing the future,

351
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,421
it's about reliving one day
over and over.

352
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,509
[Cisco] When Parker woke up,
it reset the loop.

353
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:14,219
But why didn't you get whammied?

354
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,681
I think the sensor absorbed
the temporal energy

355
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,141
and shielded me.

356
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,644
I mean, by the looks of it,
that's not happening again.

357
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,146
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

358
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,523
We have to fix this.

359
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,735
Otherwise, if the loop resets,
we won't be shielded.

360
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,695
We won't remember
that we're stuck in the past,

361
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,214
and we'll be trapped here
like everyone else.

362
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,238
We have to fix this now.

363
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,801
Okay, you know, I think I have the
parts to fix this at Grandma Runk's.

364
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,201
Perfect. Let's go there right now.

365
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,846
And while we're on our way
maybe we can figure out

366
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,039
what's so special
about December 4th, '98.

Uh...

You know what?

He's had it for years.

How does swaddling himself help?

Well, it's not about the blanket.

376
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:11,902
It's more like wrapping himself
in the memories and the comfort

His mother made it for him.

talk about her much. So...

it stays with him.

And I wish that I could take
that away from him, but...

The X-76 power converter,

they just sold the last one
to that guy.

Okay, chill.
It's not that big a deal.

480
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,379
- It's kind of brilliant.
- I know.

481
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,382
Plus, he gets the joy
of learning to see treasure...

482
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,177
where other people see trash.

483
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:40,350
Do you do this kind of thing
a lot for him?

484
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,102
Everything I do is for him.

485
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,358
He's the reason
I get out of bed in the morning.

486
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,950
But don't you ever resent
having to work so hard, 24/7?

487
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,077
I'm the boy's father.

488
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,792
Chester is worth any sacrifice
I have to make.

Besides...

490
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,133
when it comes to him...

491
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,589
I don't believe in quitting.

492
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,350
So...

493
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,563
You don't care about your work
more than your son.

494
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,423
You care about your work because...

495
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,570
I'm just a man
trying to do the right thing.

496
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,488
Make my son proud.

497
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,208
Yeah, this is weird.

498
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,919
Sorry. Uh...

499
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,339
It was pretty inspiring.

500
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,760
And I hope I can be
a great dad too someday.

501
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,347
Something tells me you will be.

502
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:04,868
Still not selling you
that part, though.

503
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:11,691
But if you really need one,
I think I have an idea.

504

Hold that.

Dude's a genius. Check it.

You know what this means?

513
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:57,737
Now we can disrupt
the temporal isotopes...

- ...and go home.
- ...and go home.

We were just going to...

- Blockbuster.

- [scoffs] Four times, man.

Oh, man. It's so good.

520

Now it's time to kick you wannabe

you don't belong here.

It was the second string quarterback

Not me, dumbass.

I got four pins in my knee

is doing to my city?

558
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,860
There are geothermic isotopes
all over the city,

559
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,588
which means
we know it's one of the Forces.

589

Yeah, but this energy doesn't match
Psych or Fuerza, which means...

But today, when I looked
at my past with fresh eyes...

I saw that my dad worked hard

00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:24,642
Not just for me...

641
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,061
but for everyone.

642
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,362
Time to bounce.

643
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,902
[Caitlin] Well, Barry, looks like
your vitals have stabilized.

644
00:36:58,926 --> 00:36:59,926
How you feeling?

645
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,679
I feel fine.

646
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,725
So, no luck finding Deon yet?

647
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,228
So far, satellites haven't found
any traces of his

648
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:10,393
temporal energy signature.

649
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,273
And he's a time god. So who knows

650
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,818
where or when he might be hiding?

651
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,904
Plus, I think Deon's only just now

652
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:21,449
starting to realize
the full scope of his powers.

653
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,283
But I don't get it.

654
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,495
Not once did he mention
chasing after you.

655
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,041
Well, unlike the others,
he might not know that I survived.

656
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,418
That makes sense.

657
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:36,881
You know, it's weird. Every time
you and Chester talk about Deon,

658
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,924
he sounds a lot more reasonable
than Psych,

659
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,260
and a lot less lethal than Fuerza.

660
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,471
Even so, being able to control time

661
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:45,681
makes him the most powerful
Force yet.

662
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,560
He could stop you in your tracks
anytime, anywhere. That's his power.

663
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,942
It's like he's the opposite
of the Speed Force.

664
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:56,025
He's the Still Force, which I guess

665
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:59,528
would make Fuerza the Strength Force.

666
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:04,700
And that would make Psych
the Sage Force.

667
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,581
If this new Force
is more powerful than me,

668
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,291
then how did you defeat him, Cisco?

669
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,086
I didn't defeat him.

670
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:17,378
Chester P. did.

671
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,590
I got lucky.

672
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:23,385
Yeah, I'm going to leave the going
<i>mano-a-mano</i> with Big Bads

673
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:24,887
to the Flash, you know.

674
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:26,764
[phone vibrating]

675
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:31,185
Oh. That's Kamilla.
Supposed to meet up at Jitters.

676
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,519
Caitlin, you still in?

677
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:33,926
Absolutely. Let me grab my bag.

678
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:35,731
What about you, Ches? You still down?

679
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:38,150
No. I actually have an errand to run,

680
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,879
but bring a brother
back a Vibe-accino?

681
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,571
Duh.

682
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,032
Hey, you didn't get lucky.

683
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,993
All right? What you did out there...

684
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
I'm proud of you.

685
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:52,873
Yeah.

686
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,960
I guess I'm just a man
trying to do the right thing.

687
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:58,796
Make my pops proud.

688
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,720
Caitlin, hurry up. I'm trying
to get this coffee and a cronut.

689
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:08,763
Iris...

690
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,932
thanks to you, I'm seeing things
a lot clearer now.

691
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:16,564
Well, I imagine you two are anxious
to get home,

692
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:18,061
so I'll see in the morning.

693
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:21,151
Wait. You're staying here tonight?

694
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,571
Well, I want to know right away

695
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:25,698
if the satellites
find the other Forces.

696
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,491
Yeah. No, I get that,

697
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,136
but we'll get an alert
if that happens.

698
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,789
Nora, we have clean sheets
in our guest room

699
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,124
and plenty of blankets.

700
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,168
Sounds cozy.

701
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,211
Yeah, it is.

702
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,716
You should stay with us tonight.
Right, Barry?

703
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,636
Um...

704
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:49,721
Sure.

705
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,101
Yeah, of course.

706
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,731
You have no idea how much
that would mean to me.

707
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,108
- Really.
- It's our pleasure.

708
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,360
- Thank you.
- Come on.

709
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,214
I got you, Pops.

710
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:28,218
I'mma finish what you started.

711
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,152
Okay.

712
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:58,582
Oh... No. No. No, no, no.

713
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,584
Is that damn time bubble back?

714
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,670
Oh, no. I just like the look.

715
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,672
So I decided to swing
by a thrift store.

716
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:06,590
Picked up these bad boys, too.

717
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:08,550
Listen, we need to talk.

718
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:11,971
Ugh. Nothing good ever starts
with "We need to talk."

719
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:16,100
This new state liaison
that's auditing C.C.P.D.,

720
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:17,223
her name's Kristen Kramer.

721
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:21,230
I just found out that she's here
to catch a dangerous fugitive

722
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,898
- meta-human.
- Hm.

723
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:24,817
She's here for Killer Frost.

724
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,279
That's not who I am anymore.

725
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:33,158
I know. I just got to find a way
to make her see that.

726
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,328
In the meantime, you need to lay low.

727
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:37,871
Yeah, that's not going to happen.

728
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,040
She's former Army
Intelligence, Frost.

729
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:42,710
I don't care if she's
Xena, Warrior Princess.

730
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:45,212
I am finally free
to live my own life,

731
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,673
and no one is going
to take that away from me.

732
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:51,552
So if this Kristen Kramer wants
to come after me,

733
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,513
then I say, "Bring it on."
