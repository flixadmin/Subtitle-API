Make contact with Ethan.
You'll run the game together.

124
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,017
the names of our agents
in every country in Eastern Europe

125
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,352
will be up for grabs to the highest bidders.

Third world terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords,

127

any and everybody who'd love
to get rid of long-term coverts like us.

128

If they're exposed, they'll be executed.

129
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,785
So I'll run the whole show
from the crow's nest here.

Everyone knows their roles.
Let's punch out the details.

131

There's a camera built right into the bridge.

132
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,961
Whatever you see, it sees,
and then it transmits it back here.

Of IMF agents at the embassy tonight.

359
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,235
I don't quite follow you.

360
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,115
Well, see if you can follow me around the room.

361
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,744

at seven and 8 o'clock,

at the embassy at nine and 11.

363

at the top of the stairs.

366
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,095
You're worried about me. Why?

367
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,599
Well, for a little over two years,

368
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,520
we've been spotting serious blowback
in IMF operations.

369
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,230
We have a penetration.

370
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,441
The other day, we decoded a message
on the internet

371
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,777
from a Czech we know as Max.

372
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,697
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

373
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,534
Max, it seems, has two unique gifts,

374
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:50,205
a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

375
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,542
This time, he'd gotten to someone on the inside.

376
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,004
He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our NOC list.

377
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,132
An operation he referred to as job 314,

378
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,176
the job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.

379
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,432
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.

380
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,478
That's correct.
The actual list is secure at Langley.

381
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,064
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
He was one of ours.

382
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,654
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

383
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,871
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

384
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,706
Yeah.

385
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,586
The mole's deep inside

386
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,590
and like you said

387
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,720
you survived.

388
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,391
I want to show you something, Ethan.

389
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,896
Since your father's death,

390
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,024
your family's farm has been in receivership

391
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:03,528
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.

392
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,199
Your father's illness was supposed
to have wiped out that bank account.

393
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,330
Dying slowly in America, after all,
can be a very expensive proposition.

394
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,416
So...

395
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,588
Why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

396
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,259
I can understand you're very upset.

397
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,262
Kittridge, you've never seen me very upset.

398
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,015
All right, Hunt. Enough is enough.

399
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,434
You have bribed, cajoled, and killed.

400
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,686
And you have done it using loyalties
on the inside.

401
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,855
You want to shake hands with the devil,
that's fine with me.

402
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,774

Shut up, I saw you. You were in the car.

No, I got out of the car.

I ran to the bridge.
He said someone was just...

Don't give me that. I was on the bridge.

- There was nobody on the bridge.
- What happened to Jim?

Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead!

I just walked away.

Whoever the mole is,

484
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,860
I think goes by the name of Job.

485

I can't find him, but if he knows
I have the NOC list,

00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,899
if you simply showed up, I might give it to you?

516
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,528
Why not? You gave Job $125,000.

517
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:39,867
Hmm, the penny drops. You are not Job.

518
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,666
Job is not given to quoting scripture
in his communications.

519
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:52,004
Then there was its tone, aggressive but playful.

520

Job is not playful.

521
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,761
So you are something of a paradox.

- Well, that depends.
- On what?

523

Whether you like a paradox.

I want $150,000 today.

525
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,233
No, no.
That's quite out of the question.

526
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,239
The disk Job sold you, it's worthless.

527
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,909
It's bait, part of an internal mole hunt.

528
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,375
And how might you know that?

529
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,296
Are you another Company man?

530
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,884
- Like Job?
- Mmm.

531
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,431
We're asking about you.

532
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,976
I'm NOC. Was.

533
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,979
Now, disavowed.

534
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,481
Why, may I ask?

535
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,484
That is the question I want to ask Job.

536
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,324
I don't know Job any more than Job knows me.

537
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,950
Even so.

538
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,453
I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.

539
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,787
Why should I?

540
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,624
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.

541
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,167
The one you have is not only worthless,

542
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,044
it's certain to be equipped with a homing device

543
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,046

544
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,505
Mmm-hmm.

545
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,550
Mmm-hmm.

546
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,844
Boot it up.

547
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,180
In anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes...

548

It's easy to say the disk is worthless

550
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,358
when you say I can't look at the information

551
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,237
and see if it's worthless.
Not a tenable position, sir.

Okay, use it.

553

00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,035
not just Eastern Europe.

593
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,121
I won't do this piecemeal.
It's too dangerous.

594
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,790
- I want the entire list.
- $10 million.

595
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,377
$10 million in negotiable US Treasury certificates

596
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,546
in bearer form, coupons attached.

597
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:27,715
And one more thing.

598
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:34,430
Your personal assurance
that Job will be at the exchange.

599
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,265
Hmm.

600
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,527
Oh.

601
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,531
Max made a deal with you?

602
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,952
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.

603
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,627
We've got 75 rounds for your Beretta
but only 20 for the SIG Sauer.

604
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,755
One pair of Visco glasses with monitor,

605
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,299
plenty of passports, and...

606
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,305
What?

607
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,183
You said it yourself.

608
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,560
If I'm not dead, I'm with you.

609
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,563
Are you sure about this?

610
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,066
Jim was my husband.

611
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,860
I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.

612
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:33,822
We're gonna need some help.

613
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,700
We don't have a lot of time,
so they're gonna have to be local.

614
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,536
What kind of help?

615
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,405
Simple game.

616
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,699
Four players.

617
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,951
Exfil opens the pocket.

618
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,786
Cyber ops lifts the wallet.

619
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,372
Bank?

620
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,374
IMF mainframe.

621
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,460
Where exactly is it?

622
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:29,837
In Langley.

623
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,300
In Langley?

624
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,261
The one in Virginia, Langley?

625
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,348
Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?

626
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:43,976
Is he serious?

627
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,937
- Always.
- <font color="#00CDCD">(laughs)</font>

628
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:52,276
If we're going to Virginia,
why don't we drop by Fort Knox?

629
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,112
I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby

630
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,655
and set it down inside the vault,

631
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:00,784
and it would be a hell of a lot easier
than breaking into the goddamn CIA.

632
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,202
What are we downloading?

633
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,788
- Information.
- What kind?

634
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,040
Profitable.

635
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,001
Payment on delivery.

636
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:12,630
I don't know.

637
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,215
I just don't know.

638
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,387
This doesn't sound like
the Luther Stickell I heard of.

639
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,849
What did they used to call you, the Net Ranger?

640
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,726
Phineas Phreak?

641
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,647
The only man alive
who actually hacked NATO Ghost Com.

642
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:33,192
There was never any physical evidence
that I had anything to do with that.

643
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,527
With that...

644
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,989
That exceptional piece of work.

645

<font color="#00CDCD">(chuckles)</font>

646
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,328
You don't know what you're missing.

647
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:50,334
- This is the Mount Everest of hacks.
- Y'all are kidding yourselves.

648
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:55,130
Even with top of the line crypto,
Cray access, STU-III...

649
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,341
Krieger can get it, right?

650
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,594
May take a little time.

651
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,221
What the hell do you mean, "a little time"?

652
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,431
That's not what Claire tells me about you.

Look, I just can't hack my way inside.

663
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,798
See, there's no modem access to the mainframe.

664
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,509
It's in what we call the stand-alone,

665
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,972
which means I'd have to be physically
at the terminal.

666
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,516
Relax, Luther.

667
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,768
It's much worse than you think.

668
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,230

01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:54,600
But you left before I could get there,
and I could check just so many places.

887
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:57,436
Smaller countries don't computerize
customs records.

888
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:58,854
So I watched Europe.

889
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,816
Once you turned up in England, it was easy.

890
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,611
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.

891
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,571
Hey, I showed them to you.

892
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:08,947
<font color="#00CDCD">(chuckles)</font>

893
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:10,532
I remember.

894
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:12,993
<font color="#00CDCD">(coughing)</font>

895
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,913
Jim, look, who do you think you're kidding here?

896
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:18,332
A doctor's gotta look at that.
You can't sit up straight.

897
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:19,917
I can sit up straight.

898
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,378
I just can't sit up straight very well.

899
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,547
Sit down. Sit down. It's not important.

900
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:28,509
Ethan...

901
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,722
I saw who shot me. I saw the mole.

902
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:38,894
- It was Kittridge.
- Kittridge.

903
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:42,231
Kittridge, Ethan. <font color="#00CDCD">(chuckles)</font>

904
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:48,821
Kittridge is the mole.

905
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:51,698
My God, of course. You're right.

906
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,790
He was at the embassy that night.

907
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:07,172
First, he took out Jack at the elevator.

908
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,510
<font color="#00CDCD">(screams)</font>

909
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:14,513
<font color="#00CDCD">(clicks tongue)</font>

910
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:16,849
He shot you on the bridge.

911
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:18,559
<font color="#00CDCD">(gun fires)</font>

912
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,297
<font color="#E69138"><b>Jim:</b></font> <font color="#32D838"><i>Ethan!</i></font>

913
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,272
He must have had backup take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.

914
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,001
How did he do Hannah?

915
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:54,780
No. No,
he could have done Hannah himself.

916
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:22,975
Why, Jim?

917
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,353
Why?

918
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,483
When you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable.

919
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:32,776
No more Cold War.

920
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:34,319
<font color="#00CDCD">(chuckles)</font>

921
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:36,905
No more secrets
you keep from everyone but yourself.

922
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,200
Operations, you answer to no one but yourself.

923
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:44,871
And then one day, you wake up,
the President of the United States is

924
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,707
running the country without your permission.

925
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,626
The son of a bitch, how dare he?

926
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:53,046
Then you realize, it's over.

927
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:56,425
You're an obsolete piece of hardware
not worth upgrading.

928
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,595
You've got a lousy marriage and 62 grand a year.

929
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:02,931
Kittridge.

930
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:06,727
We'll go after
the no-good son of a bitch big time.

931
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:15,736
We won't have to. He'll come after us.

932
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,655
What's gonna make him do that?

933
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:22,909
What he didn't get in Prague.
The NOC list.

934
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:28,415
Whoa. Jesus, Ethan.

935
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,252
Good for you. <font color="#00CDCD">(whistles)</font>

936
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:36,006
I'm meeting him tomorrow
on the TGV en route to Paris.

937
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,383
Tight security. No guns.

938
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:40,510
A real plus.

939
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,597
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max...

940
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,557
Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.

941
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,393
I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell
with me on the train.

942
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,896
Krieger is gonna have
helicopter transport waiting in Paris.

943
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,484
Jim?

944
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,079
I was in a café waiting for you, Ethan.

945
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,042
And there she was...

946
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:16,463
standing in the rain, alive and beautiful...

947
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,382
thinking I'm dead and gone.

948
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:25,097
God knows what she's had to do to forget me

949
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,099
to keep going, get the job done.

950
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:33,438
<font color="#00CDCD">(sighs)</font> She can't know about me, Ethan.

951
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:35,774
No one can, not till this is over.

952
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:37,484
You're probably right.

953
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,612
There's too much at stake.

954
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,992
Once we leave the safe house, Jim,
you get in there and crash.

955
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:50,706
- I'll call you from Paris.
- You got it.

958
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,319
I sent the message to Max.

01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,284
We're on for tomorrow.

960
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:36,460

963
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,434
- What's this?
- Incoming, sir, for you.

964
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:37,145
X-ray's clean, electronics, and no explosives.

965
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:49,741
Gene?

966
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,916
- How long to the London Terminus?
- Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

967
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,626
You've got 10 minutes. Move!

It's him.

971
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:46,965
This was not what we discussed.

972

<font color="#32D838"><i>My apologies, Max.

01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:35,680
I hope this doesn't preclude a meeting in private.

<font color="#32D838"><i>Not as long as you tell me where the money is.</i></font>

978
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:41,394
The mere possibility is worth $10 million.

979
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:43,605
Baggage car, rack 3.

980
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:47,442
Silver briefcase, combination 3-1 -4.

Wouldn't worry about him.
When you get the money, he'll find you.

983
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:12,717
What's the matter?

984
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:15,387
- It's not transmitting.
- Try it. Try it again.

985

Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.

Mind telling me, Ethan?

1024
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:07,827
Before or after I showed up in London?

1025
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,580
Before London...

1026
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,000
but after you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

1027
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:19,088

Those damn Gideons.

Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why...

1029
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:26,971
Why the masquerade? Why take the risk?

1030
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,850
Well, Claire, you've asked the question.

1031

And you are the answer.

1032
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:35,939

having tasted the goods.

"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife," Ethan.

1038
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,879
Let's just get the money and get out of here.

1039
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:01,214
Yes, let's get the money.

1040
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:05,385
Ethan, the money.

1041
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:09,138
Give her the money.

1042
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:14,352
You've earned it.

1043
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,820
All $10 million.

1044
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:27,115
You know, Claire was wrong about one thing, Jim.

What's that?

1047
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:51,597
Good morning, Mr. Phelps.

1048
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,518
I'm not the only one who's seen you alive.

1049
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:01,149
You son of a bitch.

1050
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:02,608
It's over, Jim.

1051
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:12,285
Don't. Don't, Jim.

1052
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:13,369
"Don't, Jim."

No, no, don't! It'll crash into us!

I think this is what you're looking for.

Hello, Max.

1069
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,930
My lawyers are going
to have a field day with this.

Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict...

1071
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:54,103
Well, maybe we'll
just leave the courts out of this one.

1072
01:43:56,814 --> 01:44:01,402
I'm sure we can find
something I have that you need.

01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:22,965
About what?

1080
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:27,178
The apology from
the Justice Department, VIP treatment,

you know, the whole nine yards.

1082
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:32,433
Well, my mom was a little confused

1083
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:35,102
how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald

for a couple of dope smugglers
in the Florida Keys.

To you, Luther, for being off the disavowed list.

I just...

I just don't know why I'd be doing it.

Gotta go catch my flight.

1094
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:07,927
So how's it feel to be a solid citizen again?

1095
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:11,847
Man, I don't know.

1096
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,101
I'm gonna miss being disreputable.

1097
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:18,854
Well, Luther, if it makes you feel any better...

1098
01:45:19,688 --> 01:45:21,065
I'll always think of you that way.

Excuse me. Mr. Hunt?

1100
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,748
Would you like to watch a movie?

<font color="#00CDCD">(sighing)</font> Oh.

No, thank you.

1103
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:46,090
Would you consider the cinema of the Caribbean?

1104
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:50,177
Aruba, perhaps?
