1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,000
Where are we? Is this the Pulitzer?

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,300
Nope. I've just gotta ask these people
a few questions and then we can go.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,300
Can I stay in the car?

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
No, honey.

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,900
- Are we trespassing?
- No. Yes.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,800
Hello?

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,500
Hello?

8
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,600
I like the curly one.

9
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,300
Let's go. This was a bad idea.

10
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,100
Lex Luthor.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,100
Lois Lane?

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,900
You're bald.

13
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,500
And what is your name?

14
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

15
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,400
- Cute kid, and smart.
- Thanks.

16
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,600
We're not really strangers, are we?
This is kind of a little reunion.

17
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,700
Heck, I'm a fan.

18
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,300
I love your writing...

19
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,900
...and your dress.
- I love your boat.

20
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,600
How'd you get it?
Swindle some widow out of her money?

21
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,000
That's funny. Didn't you win
the Pulitzer Prize...

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,600
...for my favorite article of all time, "Why
the World Doesn't Need Superman"?

23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,500
Didn't you have a few more years to go
on that double life sentence?

24
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,900
Yes, well, we can thank
the Man of Steel for that.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,200
I mean, he's really good at swooping in
and catching the bad guys...

26
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,700
...but he's not so hot at the little things,
like Miranda rights...

27
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,400
...due process, making your court date.

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,900
Did you have anything to do
with the blackout?

29
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,900
Are you fishing for an interview,
Miss Lane?

30
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,200
It's been a while
since you've been a headline.

31
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,400
Maybe it's time
people knew your name again.

32
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,900
How about we turn this boat around,
call a cab for my son...

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,900
...and then you can do
whatever you want with me.

34
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,000
No, I don't think we'll be
turning around, Miss Lane...

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,700
...which means that
we do have some time to kill.

36
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
How about that interview?

37
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,700
Yeah, just call me if you hear anything.
Okay. Thank you.

38
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,500
So, what did the school say?

39
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,100
She picked him up at 3:15.

40
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,300
- Hi, I heard about Lois.
- Yes, come in, Clark, come in.

41
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,900
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah, you're a reporter.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,700
- Help Richard track her down.
- I'll check her computer.

43
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Excuse me, Clark.

44
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,100
What do you know about crystals?

45
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,900
They make great chandeliers.

46
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,300
This crystal may seem unremarkable,
but so is the seed of a redwood tree.

47
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,700
It's how our mutual friend in tights
made his Arctic getaway spot.

48
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,700
Cute. It's a little small for my taste.

49
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,300
You're building an island?

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,700
You're not seeing
the big picture here, Miss Lane.

51
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,100
Let me enlarge it for you.

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,800
Not just an island,
an entirely new continent.

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,100
An extinct world, reborn on our own.

54
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,600
Why?

55
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,300
Land, Miss Lane.

56
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,100
I mean... Kitty, what did my father
used to say to me?

57
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,700
"You're losing your hair"?

58
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,500
- Before that.
- "Get out"?

59
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,100
He said, "You can print money...

60
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,800
...manufacture diamonds,
and people are a dime a dozen...

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,900
...but they'll always need land."

62
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,800
It's the one thing
they're not making any more of.

63
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,600
But the United States...

64
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,600
Will be underwater.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
It's simple physics, Miss Lane.

66
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,400
Two objects cannot occupy
the same space at the same time.

67
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,000
And the rest of the world
will just let you keep it?

68
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,300
- They'll...
- They'll...

69
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,100
...what?

70
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,100
I'll have advanced alien technology...

71
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,100
...thousands of years beyond
what anyone could throw at me.

72
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Bring it on!

73
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,100
And eventually...

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,500
...the rest of the world
will be begging me...

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,100
...for a piece of high-tech
beachfront property.

76
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,500
In fact, they'll pay
through the nose for it.

77
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,600
But millions of people will die.

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,300
Billions! Once again,
the press underestimates me.

79
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,700
This is front-page news.

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,300
Come on, let me hear you say it
just once.

81
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,800
- You're insane.
- No! Not that. No, the other thing.

82
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,500
It's dangling off the tip of your tongue.
Let me hear it just once, please?

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,500
- Superman will never...
- Wrong!

84
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,700
What is that?

85
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,600
I think you know exactly what this is.

86
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,100
Mind over muscle, Miss Lane.

87
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,900
Mind...

88
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Who is that boy's father?

89
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,300
Richard.

90
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,100
Mr. Luthor, we're approaching
the coordinates.

91
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,200
Are you sure?

92
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,500
Yes, sir. Latitude 40 degrees north,
longitude 73 degrees west.

93
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,200
Don't let them leave this room.

94
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000
Kitty, come with me.
You're not gonna want to miss this.

95
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,400
- Damn it.
- What?

96
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,700
She has a password.

97
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,100
"Jason."

98
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,800
"Richard."

99
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,100
Try "Superman."

100
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,400
"Superman." Great.

101
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Don't touch that, honey.

102
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,800
Why don't you go play the piano.

103
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,700
Come on, come on, come on.

104
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Lex, this isn't like the train set.

105
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,800
I know.

106
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,300
Come on, come on.

107
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,100
Come on.

108
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,200
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

109
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

110
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,100
Open this door! Open it!

111
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,100
Could you help Mommy open the door?

112
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,500
I'm sorry.

113
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
It's gonna be okay.

114
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,900
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

115
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,100
We had a little problem downstairs.

116
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,700
Brutus is dead.

117
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,400
He got hit with the piano.

118
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,600
Where's the boy?

119
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,700
With the mother,
locked up in the pantry.

120
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,900
Oh, it's time for us to go.

121
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,100
My camera's not working.

122
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,900
And my phone's not working.

123
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,300
- Okay, I'm good.
- That was weird.

124
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,900
Hey, guys.
This just came through the fax.

125
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,300
It's Lois' handwriting,
I'd recognize it anywhere.

126
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,200
I just... No idea
what the numbers mean.

127
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,100
- They're coordinates.
- Coordinates.

128
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,300
That's just off the coast.

129
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Jimmy, tell Perry I'm taking the seaplane.
Keep trying her cell.

130
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,900
What are these, lottery numbers?

131
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,300
I think they're coordinates, chief.

132
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,600
Chief...

133
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,600
Come on! Move it!

134
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,100
Chief!

135
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,100
Great Caesar's ghost.

136
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,900
- Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

137
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,300
How did you get here?

138
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,000
I flew.

139
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,300
Look out!

140
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,300
Mom!

141
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,500
Mom! Mom!

142
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,900
Jason, come here! Jason!

143
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,500
Come here! Watch your head!
Come here!

144
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,300
Mommy! Mom!

145
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,300
Jason!

146
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,100
Jason, hold on!

147
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,700
- Have you got him?
- I got him! Go!

148
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,500
Hold on! Hold on!

149
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,900
- Mommy!
- Give him to me!

150
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,600
Mommy!

151
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,000
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Come on, Jason! Come on!

152
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,400
- Lois! Lois!
- Mommy!

153
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
Jason, get on my back.

154
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,700
Give me your hand.

155
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,000
- Have you got them?
- Yeah.

156
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,100
Get buckled in!

157
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,200
She'll be fine.

158
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,100
I can't take off in this.

159
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,100
- I'll point you in the right direction.
- Thank you.

160
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,700
See anything familiar?

161
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,700
I see an old man's sick joke.

162
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,500
Really? Because I see
my new apartment...

163
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,600
...and a place for Kitty,
one for my friends...

164
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,600
...and that place over there, I'll rent out.

165
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,900
But, you know, maybe you're right.
You know, maybe it is a little cold.

166
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,900
It's... What's the word I'm searching for?
It's a little...

167
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,100
...alien.

168
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,800
It lacks that human touch.

169
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,200
You have something that belongs to me.

170
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,200
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

171
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,900
Do you copy?

172
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,000
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

173
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,400
Do you copy? Damn it!

174
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,100
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

175
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,000
Do you copy?

176
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,300
Lois! Are you all right?

177
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah. What happened?

178
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,600
- Superman.
- Where is he?

179
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,200
He went back.

180
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,900
- Richard, we have to turn around.
- What? No.

181
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,500
- We have to turn around!
- We barely made it out of there.

182
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,200
- Now you want me to go back?
- Yes, please!

183
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,700
He'll die.

184
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,300
All right, hold on.

185
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,900
Kryptonite.

186
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,700
You're asking yourself, "How?"

187
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,200
Didn't your dad ever teach you
to look before you leap?

188
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,900
Crystals. They're amazing, aren't they?

189
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,200
They inherit the traits
of the minerals around them...

190
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,900
...kind of like a son
inheriting the traits of his father!

191
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,400
You took away five years of my life,
I'm just returning the favor!

192
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,700
I'm still Superman!

193
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,300
Get up! Come on!

194
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Now, fly.

195
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,900
So long, Superman.

196
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,200
Your leadership can stir others...

197
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,500
...to their own capacities
for moral betterment.

198
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,500
The human heart is still subject
to monstrous deceits.

199
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,700
Our destruction could have been avoided.
At this very moment...

200
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,400
...I could embrace you in my arms.

201
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,900
Your help would be called for endlessly.
Remember me.

202
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,300
Even for those tasks which human beings
could solve themselves.

203
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,000
Remember me, Kal-El.

204
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,000
Remember me.

205
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,200
Superman's down there.

206
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,400
- You sure?
- Yeah.

207
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,000
- Richard!
- Yeah, I saw him. Strap in.

208
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,300
Lois!

209
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,300
Don't move.

210
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,400
Come on, come on, come on.

211
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,700
Richard!

212
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,100
I'm trying! It's too choppy!

213
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,400
Oh, my God.

214
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,600
How did you find me?

215
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,500
Thank you.

216
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,700
What are you doing?

217
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,900
I have to go back.

218
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,200
You're hurt!

219
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,800
Goodbye, Lois.

220
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,600
The technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...

221
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,000
...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.

222
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,500
Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.

223
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,300
Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...

224
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,300
...would be indistinguishable from magic.

225
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,800
But imagine: cities, vehicles, weapons...

226
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,300
...entire continents, all grown.

227
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,200
Lex?

228
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,900
Are billions of people really going to die?

229
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,800
Yes.

230
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,300
Lex, what's happening?

231
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,600
Go, go, go. Get to the helicopter.

232
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,700
Go! Out, out! Now!

233
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,700
No, no, no, take nothing!
Take nothing! Go, go!

234
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,100
Got it.

235
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,900
Here.

236
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,700
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

237
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,400
No!

238
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,600
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

239
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,800
Watch it.

240
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,300
- Clear a path.
- Clear the way.

241
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,300
- Move!
- Trauma One.

242
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,900
- Where we going?
- Trauma One. Here it is.

243
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,100
Watch it!

244
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,000
Got him!

245
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,800
Okay, I think I got it.

246
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,900
Penetrating side wound
to right part of lower back.

247
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,300
No hemorrhage.

248
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,100
Shock at 200.

249
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,000
Is that enough? He's not human.

250
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,800
All right, charge to three, 360.

251
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,500
Clear!

252
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,100
It's kind of morbid, Perry.

253
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,300
Always be prepared.

254
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,200
How is she?

255
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,800
Thank you. Thanks, baby.

256
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,700
- Lois?
- Yeah.

257
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,600
We can leave whenever you're ready.

258
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,300
I mean...

259
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,700
...you don't have to be here.

260
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,600
Where else would I be?

261
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,200
Police have surrounded the area in order
to control thousands of visitors...

262
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,200
...who have arrived
to show their support.

263
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,100
Many are carrying signs and banners...

264
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,600
I could drive.

265
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,100
- no official announcements
over the past few hours...

266
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,700
...but unconfirmed reports
from inside tell us...

267
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,600
...the Man of Steel lies in a coma...

268
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,100
...his condition unchanged
since he was admitted late yesterday.

269
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,200
- Doctors have been vigilant in their...
- Foreign exchange markets...

270
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,600
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

271
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,500
I'd be careful down there, guys.
It's a madhouse.

272
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,800
- So much for parking.
- Do you think I can get in?

273
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,300
You're Lois Lane. They'll let you in.

274
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,900
I wanna go with Mommy.

275
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,900
Taxi.

276
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,400
I'll be right here.

277
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,500
Watch your head, okay? Here we go.

278
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,100
This way, Miss Lane.

279
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,300
Mommy? Is he gonna get better?

280
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,700
- I don't know.
- I want him to.

281
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,300
I like him.

282
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,500
Me too.

283
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't know if you can hear me.

284
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,900
They say sometimes
that when people are...

285
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,400
That sometimes they can hear you.

286
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,600
I don't know if you can hear me.

287
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,700
I wanted to tell you...

288
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,600
Come on, honey.

289
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
Step back, please!

290
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,600
Lex, we only have six of those!

291
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,600
Six?

292
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,400
I would trade 300,000 coconuts...

293
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,800
...and every ounce of your blood...

294
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,400
...for a quart of gasoline!

295
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,700
But what will we have to eat?

296
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,400
You will be different.

297
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,800
Sometimes, you will feel like an outcast.

298
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,500
But you'll never be alone.

299
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,300
You will make my strength your own.

300
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,700
You will see my life through your eyes...

301
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,700
...as your life will be seen through mine.

302
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,700
The son becomes the father...

303
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,900
...and the father becomes the son.

304
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,300
Good night!

305
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,100
I...

306
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,500
Will we see you?

307
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,000
Around?

308
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,500
I'm always around.

309
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,000
Good night, Lois.

310
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
