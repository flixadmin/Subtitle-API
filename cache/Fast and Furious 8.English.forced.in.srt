1
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:18,650
We swap in parts from Ford
Plymouths and Cadillac.

2
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:21,577
My grandfather bought it in 1957.

3
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,081
When he died he passed it to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.

4
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,357
Look at this,
this is an engine from a boat.

5
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:31,779
Whatever it takes to keep it running!

6
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:36,947
Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.

7
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:40,674
It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!

8
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:42,782
Come on, come on.

9
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,837
Please don't do this, understand my problem.

10
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,508
You should show your people some respect.

11
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,126
I am really scared.

12
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:44,580
Are you ready for this, family?

13
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:46,572
This is Havana!

14
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,578
Be fast!

15
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Be safe!

16
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:56,730
But don't be last.
Racers ready...?

17
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:58,385
Go...!

18
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,529
Stop.

19
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,359
Can I help you with that?

20
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:54,490
Look out...!

21
01:04:40,655 --> 01:04:42,779
We land back in Moscow by nine.

22
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:47,745
Here's the latest defense report,
All the items in yesterday's meet.

23
01:07:57,076 --> 01:07:58,168
What is going on?

24
01:08:03,407 --> 01:08:04,410
Drive fast!

25
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:31,066
Drive! Drive!

26
01:08:43,114 --> 01:08:46,062
There's more cars ahead of us.
Shoot their engines.

27
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:55,278
Oh God!

28
01:09:23,095 --> 01:09:24,426
Faster, faster!

29
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:09,240
- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?

30
01:11:12,552 --> 01:11:13,969
What the hell are you waiting for?

31
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:15,359
Shoot him!

32
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,699
Come on, come on!

33
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,431
I'm out.

34
01:11:29,937 --> 01:11:30,261
Shit.

35
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:32,707
Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.

36
01:11:32,986 --> 01:11:34,566
You'll be safe in here.

37
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,522
Give him the case.

38
01:11:40,686 --> 01:11:44,407
These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.

39
01:11:49,874 --> 01:11:51,311
What is he doing now?

40
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,695
He just cut a hole in our gas tank.

41
01:29:28,703 --> 01:29:29,891
See you later...

42
01:31:16,121 --> 01:31:17,972
We have a possible threat incoming.

43
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:20,755
Raise the barricade, As soon as possible.

44
01:31:38,111 --> 01:31:40,523
We've lost power, get to your positions now.

45
01:32:37,547 --> 01:32:39,879
Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.

46
01:32:46,137 --> 01:32:48,833
I'm losing control, mayday, mayday.
I'm going down.

47
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:38,677
You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.

48
01:46:38,747 --> 01:46:40,464
No way, I'm not driving.
