1
00:00:01,957 --> 00:00:03,035
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

2
00:00:03,059 --> 00:00:05,323
Mario could've lived a normal life.

3
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:06,414
Jim didn't have to kill him.

4
00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:07,782
James Gordon is one of them.

5
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:10,715
When I get out of here,
he'll be the first that I judge.

6
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:11,914
Now the Court's readying a weapon

7
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,988
- that could destroy the city.
- It's the virus, I'm sure of it.

8
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:17,458
I have just discovered
someone has been deceiving me.

9
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:19,478
I need you to kill him.

10
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,478
You've never left that alley, Bruce.

11
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:25,088
And for you to accept what
I have to teach, you need to.

12
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:26,901
Selina, wait, this city has been judged.

13
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:29,170
- You need to leave Gotham today.
- And why are you telling me?

14
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:31,439
- Because I care about you.
- You're not even a real person.

15
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:35,907
You're awake!

16
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,912
Selina, where are you going?

17
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:39,180
To kill someone.

18
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:41,349
What is this mysterious Court?

19
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:44,752
Ed went on television,
and voilà, he disappears.

20
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:47,188
- Oswald, drop it.
- No can do.

21
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,080
You cannot do this to me.

22
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,992
I demand to speak to
the person in charge!

23
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:54,895
Oswald.

24
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:02,309
You're alive?

25
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,465
How did you survive?

26
00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:26,621
In shooting me, Ed,

27
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:29,926
you gave me something to live for:

28
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:33,129
revenge.

29
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:35,693
Yes...

30
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:37,968
Unless...

31
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:41,876
What?!

32
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:43,611
Just making sure you're real.

33
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:47,681
Wow, you are difficult to kill.

34
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,650
More cockroach than penguin.

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,020
But don't... you...

36
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,620
dare call me "Ed."

37
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:57,958
I'm...

38
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:00,230
the Riddler.

39
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:02,930
And I became him when I killed you.

40
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,212
News flash, Ed!

41
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,502
I'm not dead!

42
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,376
That's true.

43
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:12,406
For now.

44
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:16,243
I came back from the dead
to kill you, Ed.

45
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,846
And ended up a prisoner yourself.

46
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:22,871
You really think a little steel

47
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,945
and concrete is gonna stop me?

48
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:26,654
The way I see it,

49
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:29,471
I have you just where I want you.

50
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:31,559
Perhaps.

51
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:34,695
But not for long.

52
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:00,554
Selina.

53
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,091
How?

54
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:06,026
I came here to do one thing.

55
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,828
And it ain't answering questions.

56
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:13,267
Strange as it sounds,
I'm glad you're alive.

57
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,548
That is strange.

58
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:17,736
'Cause you pushed me
out a four-story window!

59
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:21,837
What choice did I have?

60
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:23,664
You were gonna tell Alfred about me.

61
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,835
You mean how you're a freak?

62
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:27,915
How you're just the cheap

63
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,242
knock-off who kidnapped
the real Bruce Wayne?

64
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:42,963
Selina!

65
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,765
Selina, stop!

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,670
- Stop!
- He's not Bruce!

67
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,602
- Stop!
- He's not Bruce!

68
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,439
Oh, dear God. Selina! Selina.

69
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:54,157
She-She attacked me, Alfred.

70
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:56,143
- She's out of her mind.
- She needs a doctor.

71
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:58,245
You saw her, she... she was crazy.

72
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,781
Put the iron down, Bruce.

73
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,817
I said put the iron down!

74
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:05,957
Alfred...

75
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:09,723
You're cut.

76
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,736
You don't feel a thing, do you?

77
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,352
Do you?

78
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,752
Now, I'm gonna ask you nicely,

79
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,526
or I swear to God, you're gonna
feel a whole lot of pain.

80
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:25,306
Where is Bruce?

81
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,133
Bruce is serving
a greater purpose than himself.

82
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,570
As am I.

83
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,753
Last time!

84
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:42,146
Where is Bruce?

85
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:54,199
You were always kind to me, Alfred.

86
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:56,961
Even when you thought I wasn't Bruce.

87
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:00,795
Please.

88
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,199
Please.

89
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,535
Just tell me where Bruce is.

90
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:26,151
Welcome home, Bruce.

91
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,412
Lee. Lee.

92
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:52,416
Wake up.

93
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,889
Mario.

94
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:01,125
Are you okay?

95
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,365
I was having the worst dream.

96
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:09,674
Really? Tell me about it.

97
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,264
God, there was this virus
that was loose in the city.

98
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,882
It brought out a person's darkness,

99
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:19,757
whatever they had buried inside
and you had it.

100
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:21,733
Really?

101
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,429
And what dark part of me
did it bring to light?

102
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:28,072
You were jealous of Jim.

103
00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:29,286
Come on.

104
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,939
Me, jealous of Jim Gordon?

105
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,591
- I'm sorry. You were.
- But I'm taller than he is.

106
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,191
Hey. What is it?

107
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,269
On our wedding night...

108
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,899
he shot you.

109
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:45,336
God, it was so real.

110
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,391
I lost you.

111
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:48,906
You didn't lose me.

112
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,775
I'm right here.

113
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,110
Now take your medicine

114
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,025
and then off to bed.

115
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,151
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

116
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,220
Now drink.

117
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,573
Think about it, Harvey.

118
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,736
The Court's been around
since the last century.

119
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,272
It makes sense they
have secure locations,

120
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,830
safe houses all across the city.

121
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,407
And that's where
they're hiding the virus bomb?

122
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:36,497
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

123
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,244
So I dug deeper into Kathryn's holdings.

124
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,978
She owns a tenement building
near Miller Harbor.

125
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:43,486
But there's a discrepancy

126
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,826
between the square footage
listed in the city records

127
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,389
and the blueprints...
over 2,000 square feet.

128
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:50,373
You're saying they
got a secret room there.

129
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,725
Okay, but by your logic,

130
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:53,513
there could be dozens of secret
rooms throughout the city

131
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:55,629
and the virus bomb could
be in any one of them.

132
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,731
You're in the club now.

133
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,247
This Kathryn broad trusts you.

134
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,464
Why not just wait for her to call?

135
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:03,637
Because if I can do it
quietly, she'll never know.

136
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:05,720
And if the bomb is there,
I can end this.

137
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:08,321
Okay, where in this building
is the secret room?

138
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:10,310
- Lucius says the basement.
- Oh, Lucius says the basement.

139
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:12,110
Then I guess we should
check out the basement.

140
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,314
- What is your issue with him?
- He's smarter than me.

141
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,719
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

142
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:21,202
How come no one ever hides something

143
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:23,007
in a place I actually
would like to search?

144
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,492
You know, like a brewery
or a strip joint.

145
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,725
- Or a casino.
- Exactly.

146
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:30,130
All I'm asking for is a little, uh...

147
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:31,565
consideration.

148
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:34,115
This is more like it.

149
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,279
What's this?

150
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,149
There's a crease in the wall.
Think it's a door.

151
00:08:42,204 --> 00:08:43,376
Let me hit the lights.

152
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,751
Just need to find a way in.

153
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:51,740
I meant to do that.

154
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,567
Jeez.

155
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,793
I don't see a bomb anywhere.

156
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:06,221
Yeah. Why would it ever be easy?

157
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:10,058
What's that?

158
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:12,361
Looks like an owl.

159
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:16,565
Made out of...

160
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:20,070
- ...crystal.
- Whoa.

161
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:22,704
Whoa. It's Gotham.

162
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:25,007
That must be us.

163
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,942
That lower corner right there.

164
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:28,177
Yeah.

165
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:30,023
What do you think the white markers are?

166
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:33,965
- Secret locations of the Court?
- Makes sense.

167
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:35,884
If so, that could be where the bomb is.

168
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:40,956
- Holy mother of saints!
- Down!

169
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:51,310
I see you haven't lost a step, Jim.

170
00:09:54,357 --> 00:09:56,295
Can't say the same for Bullock.

171
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:06,642
Remember I promised you'd
be punished for your crimes?

172
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,284
Well, I've come here
to keep that promise.

173
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:19,988
No, I said Gordon. Detective Jim Gordon.

174
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:22,369
Well, have him call me

175
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:24,090
the minute he gets this message,
all right, you nancy?

176
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:30,507
You should see a doctor.

177
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,118
Mm-mm.

178
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,273
Fine, whatever. Listen.

179
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:37,246
Think. Can you remember anything else?

180
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,181
Only what I already told you, Alfred.

181
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:40,904
The clone came to me.

182
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,853
Talking about how Gotham's
gonna be judged

183
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:46,549
and a lot of people are gonna die.

184
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:49,580
It's the bloody Court of Owls, isn't it?

185
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:52,094
Mm-hmm. I warned you.

186
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:55,197
Warned you what would happen
if you poked the tiger.

187
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:56,757
What, do you want a medal, dear?

188
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:59,135
All that matters is they've got Bruce.

189
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,923
- Wait, you think he's still alive?
- My boy is still alive!

190
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:06,908
And you... you are
gonna help me find him.

191
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:11,564
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, don't-don't do that.

192
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,383
Then what? You're still angry with Bruce

193
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:16,685
'cause he never told you
your mom was a wonky con artist?

194
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,848
That boy has been loyal to you;

195
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,958
he's been good; he's been a friend,

196
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:23,325
and now he's in trouble
you're not gonna lift a finger?!

197
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,081
I don't know what good it'll do me.

198
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:30,366
You're a disgrace.

199
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:33,569
You're like your mum.

200
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,615
Go on then.

201
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,670
Run away.

202
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,342
And don't you ever come back here.

203
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:53,355
I-I'm good, thanks. I'm good.

204
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:55,103
Bullock,

205
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,401
got a kid who saw Barnes flee the scene.

206
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:58,492
All right, kid, talk.

207
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,031
I saw some guy in leather,
had an axe attached to his arm,

208
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:03,699
drove off in some delivery truck.

209
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,868
- What kind?
- For chopping stuff.

210
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,904
- What kind of truck?
- Oh, right.

211
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,998
Genovese Meats.

212
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:12,441
Put a BOLO out on that truck.

213
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,410
Barnes has Jim.

214
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,312
He's taken him somewhere.

215
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,137
You're making your blade too thin.

216
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:28,536
It's gonna snap off
when you try to stab me.

217
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:32,232
Well, we'll soon find out,
won't we, Edward?

218
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,767
I told you not to call me that.

219
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:41,212
What? Edward?

220
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:44,876
But that's your name, Edward.

221
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:48,795
Edward. Edward, Edward, Edward,
Edward, Edward, Edward, Edward...

222
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:49,774
Enough!

223
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:52,670
You're pathetic, you know that?

224
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,091
At least I'm in here

225
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:59,592
because I was trying
to figure out who runs Gotham.

226
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,286
You're here because what?

227
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:04,746
I didn't love you back?

228
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:09,067
Get over it.

229
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:18,897
No. You did not love me back,

230
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:21,064
but that's not why I'm here.

231
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,847
I'm here because you destroyed
the empire I built.

232
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:27,644
I'm here because you shot me.

233
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,652
And no one does what you did and lives.

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,423
Well, good luck exacting revenge
when I'm gone.

235
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:36,689
Oh, please.

236
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,879
Make one move to escape
and I call the guards.

237
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,066
Ah, I assumed as much,

238
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,772
which is why I bribed the guards
to poison your coffee.

239
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,216
- You're lying!
- Yes, I am,

240
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:52,720
but I did steal a dart

241
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:54,488
from the guards a couple days ago.

242
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:56,659
Was planning on using it on them, but...

243
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,527
Ow!

244
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,349
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that...

245
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:09,817
Ooh.

246
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:13,497
Help.

247
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:16,944
Help. Help.

248
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:22,550
Hey!

249
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,853
What are you doing? Stop that! Stop!

250
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,056
Okay. Come on, come on.

251
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,540
Stop that.

252
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:35,062
- Stop it!
- What are you doing?

253
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:36,998
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

254
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,570
I shall set you free, Bruce,

255
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:53,115
free from the blinding rage
of your darkest memory.

256
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:57,561
There is one final step to take.

257
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:01,055
My parents' murder.

258
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,108
You want to take away
the pain of that night.

259
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:06,671
Yes.

260
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:21,991
But you must be willing.

261
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:26,132
I cannot take what you will not give.

262
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,319
My mother's pearls.

263
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:36,257
Lock them away and be free of the pain.

264
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:39,452
Become strong.

265
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,130
Become the protector Gotham needs.

266
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:13,553
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:18,381
I want to. I... I just can't. I-I can't.

268
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,764
Then I think it's time...

269
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,355
I told you the truth.

270
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:38,550
You made a fool of me, Jim.

271
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:41,722
It's a shame.

272
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:45,318
I had such high hopes.

273
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:49,579
You could've played a pivotal
role in Gotham's future.

274
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:50,998
Listen to me...

275
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:54,623
Don't insult me further by lying.

276
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:59,588
I know you took my key card
to Professor Strange's lab.

277
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,674
Odd that Strange said nothing.

278
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:06,139
He and I will be having words.

279
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:09,383
Who else have you brought
into your confidence?

280
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:13,092
- Harvey Bullock, obviously.
- What is this, an exit interview?

281
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,918
If you like.

282
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:19,260
Who else have you spoken to?

283
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:23,144
Who else have you spoken to?

284
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,399
The Court ordered my father murdered.

285
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:28,274
You drove my uncle to suicide.

286
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,720
You can go to hell.

287
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:33,892
And what are you now, their lapdog?

288
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:36,043
I know you're a lunatic.

289
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:37,635
At least you used
to stand for something.

290
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,025
Your attempts to turn Captain
Barnes against me are tiresome.

291
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:45,786
He was following you not because

292
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:48,046
I asked him to, but because he knows,

293
00:17:48,163 --> 00:17:49,960
as I do...

294
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:53,427
that you are an enemy of Gotham.

295
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,118
You Gordons always were stubborn.

296
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,437
But I am sad you won't see the end

297
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:08,398
of our little story,
when the clock stops...

298
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:11,508
and Gotham falls.

299
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:18,839
Captain.

300
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:21,558
He's all yours.

301
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,590
Let the record show that the trial

302
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:31,756
of James Gordon has begun.

303
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:36,922
Nathaniel Barnes
presiding as judge, jury

304
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:39,664
and executioner.

305
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:50,741
Twinkle, twinkle, pretty doctor,
how I wish I could unlock her.

306
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:53,717
Here in Arkham, what a wonder.

307
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:56,607
Too bad her husband's six feet under.

308
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,678
Clever.

309
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:03,657
- How is life in the nuthouse?
- Oh, you know, it has its ups and downs.

310
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:05,901
Forgive me

311
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,572
for saying this, Leslie, dear,

312
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,931
but, uh, you don't look yourself.

313
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,221
Have you been sleeping?

314
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:16,416
Or are you plagued by nightmares?

315
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,607
You want to hear
the funny thing, Jervis?

316
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:20,998
Oh, do tell. I do so love funny things.

317
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:24,091
I never really blamed you
for infecting Mario.

318
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,318
I just thought, "Why blame the lunatic?"

319
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:28,936
So I blamed Jim.

320
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,585
Wise...

321
00:19:30,757 --> 00:19:33,461
though hardly sidesplittingly funny.

322
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:36,624
Why did you infect him?

323
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:41,803
Oh, Doctor, is that the question
that's been ruining your sleep?

324
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:44,139
You wanted to hurt Jim.
Why not infect me?

325
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,895
Why make Mario suffer?

326
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:52,236
Do you remember our tea
party at your lovely home?

327
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,382
When you shot Valerie Vale.

328
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:56,415
Yes! Good memory.

329
00:19:56,517 --> 00:20:00,859
Well, I saw the way that
you looked at James Gordon.

330
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:02,824
You loved him.

331
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:07,156
And that love doomed Mario.

332
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,223
That doesn't make sense.

333
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:11,765
It makes perfect sense!

334
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,501
Jim Gordon does not deserve love!

335
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:15,571
Jim Gordon does not get love!

336
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,906
I infect your husband.

337
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:21,343
You blame Jim.

338
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:24,613
Your love for him becomes hate.

339
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:29,851
It makes perfect sense.

340
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,672
And it worked.

341
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:36,274
But you know the funny thing?

342
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:39,973
There's poor Mario,

343
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,325
cold in the ground...

344
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,504
and here you are,
blaming Jim, even blaming me,

345
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:51,332
but guess who's really to blame?

346
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,613
I am.

347
00:20:56,513 --> 00:20:59,712
Now, see, that's funny.

348
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:23,150
My lockpick was confiscated!

349
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:28,883
Now we're both stuck in this
unnaturally damp hellhole.

350
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:30,476
I hope you're happy.

351
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:32,480
Did the guards club you?

352
00:21:33,507 --> 00:21:35,059
You know they did.

353
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:37,085
Then I'm happy.

354
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:41,729
Why are our captors
keeping us here, anyway?

355
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,657
- Why not simply kill us?
- I don't know.

356
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:48,727
Since my first meeting...
with some woman named Kathryn,

357
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:51,376
I've had no contact
with upper management.

358
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:52,781
But...

359
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:54,567
according to the guards' gossip,

360
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,438
Court's planning
some attack on the city.

361
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:00,008
Fine.

362
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:05,914
You want to kill me, I want to kill you.

363
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:09,440
But being locked in these cages
does neither of us any good.

364
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,415
We have to escape.

365
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:16,725
There's only one way
that's gonna happen.

366
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:19,546
We work together.

367
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:22,993
There have to be rules.

368
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:26,033
- No sabotage.
- Of course.

369
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:28,801
And no murder on the premises.

370
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:30,032
Agreed.

371
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,699
Also, there needs to be
a six-hour window, post-escape.

372
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,174
If I get outside
and I'm worrying about you

373
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:36,027
stabbing my neck,
I won't be able to concentrate,

374
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,511
and that's not good.

375
00:22:37,574 --> 00:22:40,273
Agreed, reluctantly.

376
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,062
Then we help
each other escape, together,

377
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:48,820
so that we may be free
to murder each other outside.

378
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,734
Deal.

379
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:04,191
What are you going to show me?

380
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:06,910
The truth, Bruce.

381
00:23:08,738 --> 00:23:10,512
My truth.

382
00:23:31,003 --> 00:23:32,644
This isn't one of my memories.

383
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,457
It's one of yours.

384
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:39,170
We had no choice.

385
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,537
The laws are clear. And you were gone.

386
00:23:41,623 --> 00:23:45,920
Thomas and Martha Wayne
were leaders of Gotham.

387
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,913
The city honored them. I honored them.

388
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,446
He threatened exposure.

389
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,790
What of their boy, Bruce?

390
00:23:53,027 --> 00:23:54,786
Their son.

391
00:23:55,676 --> 00:23:59,156
- He was not harmed.
- That, at least, is something.

392
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:05,233
All this time, Bruce,

393
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:08,666
the Court was never more
than a means to an end,

394
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:12,374
allowing us to maintain order in Gotham.

395
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:14,920
Us?

396
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,111
Who are you?

397
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:21,673
Mm. One thing at a time, Bruce.

398
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:25,677
The point is, the Court's day is over.

399
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:29,263
And they must finally
pay for their crimes.

400
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:30,908
My parents' murder.

401
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:32,567
Exactly.

402
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:36,052
This is your chance, Bruce.

403
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:38,372
Will you help me?

404
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,913
Things could've gone
so differently, James.

405
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,829
We could've cleaned
this town up together.

406
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:04,462
But when the moment came,
you stood against me.

407
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:07,735
You stood against Gotham.
Against justice.

408
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:11,564
- How do you plead?
- If you're asking

409
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:15,170
did I shoot your crazy ass and
send you to Arkham, then, yeah.

410
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:16,944
I'm guilty.

411
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:20,371
The sentence is death by beheading.

412
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,161
To be carried out immediately.

413
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,451
You do know your new masters

414
00:25:26,506 --> 00:25:29,632
are nothing but a pack
of murderers, don't you?

415
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,917
They're gonna unleash the virus
in a mass attack.

416
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:36,106
Infecting both the
innocent and the guilty.

417
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,590
You still think this virus is a curse?

418
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:44,684
Tell me.

419
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:48,957
What about strength is a curse?

420
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:52,691
What about clarity is a curse?

421
00:25:54,339 --> 00:25:56,746
You're just like Lee Thompkins.

422
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,918
What are you talking about?

423
00:25:58,998 --> 00:26:03,167
She came to me, just after you
blew her husband away.

424
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:05,941
She wanted to know
if he would've killed her.

425
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:09,152
I told her that the virus is a gift.

426
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:12,724
Just like you, she didn't understand.

427
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,253
If she did come to you,

428
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,425
the only thing she took away

429
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:20,816
is that Mario was totally
and completely insane.

430
00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:26,718
Any last requests?

431
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:28,960
Yes!

432
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:30,775
My badge.

433
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:34,204
If I'm gonna die,

434
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:36,407
I want to die wearing it.

435
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:38,361
I deserve that.

436
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:40,786
One soldier to another.

437
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,220
One soldier to another.

438
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:00,772
Fire in the hole, Captain.

439
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,778
You fool!

440
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:07,110
James Gordon.

441
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,954
I hereby...

442
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,337
- Don't move!
- Stop right there!

443
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:20,772
- I got you, buddy.
- He's running!

444
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:34,865
Alvarez. Any word on Barnes?

445
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,395
Nothing yet.

446
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:39,721
There's a nutjob running around
in a leather jumpsuit

447
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:41,055
with an axe for an arm!

448
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,128
Now I know this is Gotham,
but come on, people, do something!

449
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,604
Jim.

450
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:47,354
I'm heading over to Kathryn's townhouse.

451
00:27:47,572 --> 00:27:49,763
Maybe I can get there
before she realizes I escaped.

452
00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:51,792
In case I run into Barnes.

453
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:54,416
This is Bullock.

454
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,799
What?

455
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:58,579
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

456
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,095
That was O'Toole.
Strike Force beat you to it.

457
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:04,211
They're bringing Kathryn in now.
Finally some freaking good news, right?

458
00:28:04,344 --> 00:28:05,626
Gordon!

459
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:09,244
Where the bloody hell have you been?
I've been trying to call you all day.

460
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:10,718
Alfred. What's happened?

461
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:13,884
It's Bruce. He's been abducted.

462
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,553
Oh, why? Why can't anything be easy?

463
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:20,913
Don't know how,
but he's definitely gone.

464
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:23,507
And you're not gonna believe this,
but the people responsible

465
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:25,802
are this shadowy organization
that run the whole of Gotham,

466
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,974
- they're, they're called...
- The Court of Owls.

467
00:28:31,528 --> 00:28:33,583
We've been investigating the Court

468
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:35,801
and a woman named
Kathryn Monroe for months now.

469
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:37,701
Until this morning,
I was working undercover

470
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:38,866
inside the organization.

471
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:40,089
Did they ever mention Bruce?

472
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:41,949
Never. Why would they want
to kidnap him?

473
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,691
Well, we might've had a, a bit of a,

474
00:28:44,746 --> 00:28:46,387
a run-in early on in the year.

475
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:48,932
- How long has he been gone?
- I don't know.

476
00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:50,803
Could be several days, several weeks.

477
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:52,490
Weeks? How can the kid
be missing for weeks?

478
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,828
- That's your one freaking job.
- Don't you think I know that?

479
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:56,394
They replaced him, all right?

480
00:28:56,441 --> 00:29:00,033
With a... with an exact clone,
created in Indian Hill.

481
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:03,513
H-Hold on a second. Wait, back up,
I-I thought I heard you say "clone."

482
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:05,572
That's 'cause I did.

483
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:08,310
I got to sit down.

484
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:10,677
All right. Let's think
this through. Alfred.

485
00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:12,385
Is there anything
you and Bruce could've done

486
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:14,115
that would've drawn attention
from the Court?

487
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,552
Well, we did break in
to one of their houses

488
00:29:18,162 --> 00:29:20,535
to try and find something
to give us leverage against the Court,

489
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:24,927
and all we found was this ridiculous...
crystal owl thingamajig

490
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:27,820
- which I managed to break.
- Crystal owl?

491
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,718
Is there any way it
could be reassembled?

492
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,975
- Why?
- We found another owl this morning.

493
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,342
When you shine a light through it,
a map of Gotham appears.

494
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:39,256
We think this map indicates the
secret hideouts of the Court.

495
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:40,937
So Bruce could be in one
of those hideouts, right?

496
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:42,921
So where's your bloody owl?

497
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,640
Uh, well, due to circumstances
totally beyond our control,

498
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,818
the owl went kaboom.

499
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:50,521
But if we could reassemble
the owl that you stole,

500
00:29:50,615 --> 00:29:52,935
maybe we could find Bruce and the bomb.

501
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:55,443
Do you still have the pieces?

502
00:29:55,498 --> 00:29:56,763
You're having a laugh, ain't you?

503
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:57,921
After all the bloody trouble

504
00:29:57,946 --> 00:29:59,242
I went through to get it,
of course I do.

505
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:00,776
Right. I'll be back in a minute.

506
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,980
Help!

507
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:08,136
Help!

508
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:09,452
Let me out of here,

509
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:11,800
- or I kill him! Now!
- Easy.

510
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:13,884
What are you doing? Open my cell!

511
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,919
Shoot him! What are you waiting for?

512
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:18,094
Never mind.

513
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:25,053
Back. Get back.

514
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,711
Wait. Is that Jell-O?

515
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:30,679
Surprise.

516
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:43,439
Your death scene was quite convincing.

517
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:46,923
Well. I've had some practice, haven't I?

518
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,958
All right, if you see
anything, let me know, okay?

519
00:30:53,983 --> 00:30:55,114
Yeah. You got it.

520
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:01,366
Detective Gordon.

521
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,772
I suppose I really shouldn't
be surprised.

522
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:05,942
No, you shouldn't.

523
00:31:06,187 --> 00:31:07,699
Put her in the box.

524
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,598
I've seen the map.

525
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:13,723
I know the Court has secret
locations across the city.

526
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,879
Where are you hiding the bomb?

527
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:18,191
What bomb?

528
00:31:21,697 --> 00:31:24,402
What does Bruce Wayne
have to do with all of this?

529
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:26,673
Why did you kidnap him?

530
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:30,293
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

531
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:32,910
They're not all powerful, you know.

532
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:36,278
The Court, they can't keep you safe.

533
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,175
Besides, what are the members gonna think

534
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,247
when they see their leader behind bars?

535
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,630
You think I'm the leader?

536
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:46,734
All this time,

537
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:50,930
and you really
don't know anything, do you?

538
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:57,735
Right.

539
00:31:58,243 --> 00:32:00,017
Here we go.

540
00:32:00,883 --> 00:32:02,758
Wait, this is the owl? What
the hell happened to it?

541
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:06,492
Jerome Valeska smashed it to bits
when he broke into the Manor, didn't he?

542
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:08,004
Can you put it back together again?

543
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,672
I can't even do a jigsaw puzzle.

544
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:12,584
I just smash the pieces
in with my fists till they fit.

545
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:14,366
But wait a second, we
have, we have a guy here

546
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:16,979
who makes molds of murder
victims' faces out of clay.

547
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:19,023
- I'll give him a call.
- All right.

548
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:21,109
Where's Gordon?

549
00:32:21,165 --> 00:32:23,312
He's interrogating Kathryn Monroe.

550
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:25,714
The woman from the Court of Owls?

551
00:32:25,761 --> 00:32:27,026
Yeah.

552
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:29,190
- Right...
- I mean, no! No.

553
00:32:29,245 --> 00:32:32,542
Not the woman from the Court of Owls!
Oh, God, no. Not her.

554
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,034
Right.

555
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:35,987
Tell me where Bruce Wayne is,

556
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,533
or I guarantee you'll regret it.

557
00:32:37,568 --> 00:32:38,901
Alfred, I've got this.

558
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:40,994
Good cop, bad cop.

559
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:44,010
That routine's a bit tired,
isn't it, gentlemen?

560
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:47,043
Yeah, but I'm not a cop.

561
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,511
Am I?

562
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,752
I'm a butler.

563
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,888
Ladies and gentlemen...

564
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,426
Who is this guy?

565
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:07,664
Court is now in session.

566
00:33:17,076 --> 00:33:19,243
Alfred? Alfred!

567
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:21,239
- Alfred, that's enough.
- Is he out of his freaking mind?

568
00:33:21,286 --> 00:33:23,497
- It's his play.
- Now, you tell me where Bruce Wayne is,

569
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,036
you evil old trout, or I will gut you!

570
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:29,052
Or maybe I should try the other hand.

571
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,004
Alfred...

572
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:34,593
What the hell's going on?

573
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,369
Damn.

574
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:56,333
- Easy, easy!
- All right, I'm all right.

575
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:58,114
Hey, hey, you two, stop it right now.

576
00:33:58,216 --> 00:33:59,512
We got a bigger problem.

577
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:01,751
Barnes is out there.
He tore up the precinct,

578
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:03,239
used some kind of knockout gas.

579
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,189
I got to get you and her
out of here right now. Let's go!

580
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,003
- Take her.
- Get up. Up!

581
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,632
Where is he?

582
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:18,424
I don't know.

583
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:20,495
You.

584
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:22,729
You corrupted this house.

585
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:24,909
All of you, with your weakness,

586
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:26,917
your compromise.

587
00:34:26,976 --> 00:34:29,858
This place was a church to me.

588
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:31,489
All right, that's enough of this.

589
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:34,141
Bullock, you and Alfred take Kathryn
out through the garage.

590
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:35,901
I'm not leaving you alone with him.

591
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:38,868
All right, Alfred, you do it.
She's the key to finding Bruce.

592
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,162
Captain! Captain!

593
00:34:41,224 --> 00:34:42,935
- Help me!
- Shut up!

594
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:46,775
Barnes, this is your last chance!
Give yourself up.

595
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,775
You dare threaten me?

596
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:51,423
You destroyed the thing
I care most about.

597
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:55,775
And for that, the sentence is death.

598
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,643
- I don't think he's giving up.
- Yeah.

599
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:04,814
Hey Cap...

600
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:18,515
Captain!

601
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:24,357
Captain, stop this nonsense
and take me out of here now!

602
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:25,568
Nonsense?

603
00:35:25,786 --> 00:35:27,396
Nonsense?

604
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:33,545
This is justice.

605
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:35,328
No!

606
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:38,047
Barnes!

607
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:44,259
It's fitting, Jim.

608
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:47,337
That you should meet your end here.

609
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:50,560
The word will go out.

610
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:54,218
No one will escape

611
00:35:54,703 --> 00:35:57,015
from the executioner's blade.

612
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,519
No.

613
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,636
No!

614
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:10,128
You will face judgment.

615
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:12,206
You will be judged!

616
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,203
You know what, Captain?

617
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:16,066
This place is a church.

618
00:36:17,113 --> 00:36:18,212
Mine.

619
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:52,094
Our agreement still holds
for five hours.

620
00:36:52,368 --> 00:36:53,860
I am aware.

621
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:06,824
How do you expect to win, Oswald?

622
00:37:07,347 --> 00:37:09,621
Barbara Kean runs the underworld.

623
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:11,151
We have the gangs.

624
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:12,924
You have...

625
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:15,408
yourself.

626
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:19,889
Actually, I have an army

627
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:21,826
of Hugo Strange's monsters
at my command.

628
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:25,788
But even if I were alone,

629
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:28,655
you wouldn't stand a chance.

630
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,007
I suppose we'll see.

631
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:33,882
I suppose so.

632
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:52,092
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Yeah, okay.

633
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:56,980
Lee?

634
00:37:57,138 --> 00:37:58,229
What are you doing here?

635
00:37:58,254 --> 00:37:59,567
I just came to get some things.

636
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:03,955
You saw me, you thought
I'd heard about Barnes

637
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,293
and I came to help?

638
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:07,465
Is that such a crazy idea?

639
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:09,449
It's just bad timing.

640
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,007
And if I had heard I wouldn't have come.

641
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,296
- I'm done with this place.
- So you keep saying.

642
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:18,038
You know, Barnes loved the GCPD.

643
00:38:18,372 --> 00:38:20,272
But today he tried to destroy it.

644
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:21,653
It was the virus.

645
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:24,598
Or maybe he finally
discovered the truth:

646
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:27,075
there is no justice here.

647
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,540
Look at you... you still haven't paid

648
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:31,425
for the pain that you've caused.

649
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:33,288
But I guess that's the difference
between the two of us.

650
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:35,397
I'm willing to pay for what I've done.

651
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:38,398
What are you talking about,
what've you done?

652
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:40,593
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

653
00:38:41,562 --> 00:38:43,851
Hey, Jim, my guy worked on the owl,

654
00:38:43,885 --> 00:38:45,785
says he's gonna need another hour.

655
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:48,578
- What did Lee want?
- I have no idea.

656
00:38:49,303 --> 00:38:52,053
But, Harvey, if we do find
the location of the sites,

657
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:53,647
we've got to be ready to move.

658
00:38:53,818 --> 00:38:55,982
Kathryn's killing is only
gonna energize the Court,

659
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:57,857
- force their leader to act.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wai-wait,

660
00:38:57,888 --> 00:39:00,922
there's someone above her? Who?

661
00:39:01,427 --> 00:39:03,283
I don't know.

662
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:25,920
Go on, Bruce.

663
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:30,592
The Court of Owls
must pay for what they did.

664
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:33,121
It's the only way.

665
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:12,826
Thank you.

666
00:40:16,107 --> 00:40:17,670
Tell me,

667
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:23,615
how do you feel now when
you think of your parents' murder?

668
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:25,700
I feel...

669
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:30,575
...nothing.

670
00:40:33,574 --> 00:40:35,203
Hmm.

671
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:46,697
Talons have served the Court
since its inception.

672
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:49,799
The Court culls them from orphanages.

673
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:51,323
Trains them.

674
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:56,457
What I did to you, the Court has
done with them for 200 years.

675
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,764
But the process does more
than remove all feeling.

676
00:41:02,037 --> 00:41:06,490
Cut off the smallest finger
of your left hand.

677
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,388
Shall I tell him to eat it?

678
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:17,795
He will, if I say so.

679
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:21,296
Bandage that.

680
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:24,940
You see, Bruce, the pain of our memories

681
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:27,737
can scar us, but it also defines us.

682
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:29,494
Take away that pain

683
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:33,369
and your mind becomes clay
for me to mold.

684
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:35,502
I told you the truth.

685
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:38,281
We will destroy the Court of Owls.

686
00:41:38,344 --> 00:41:41,672
And in so doing, you will become
the perfect weapon.

687
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:45,617
For you will do whatever I say.

688
00:41:46,953 --> 00:41:48,765
Won't you?

689
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:53,880
Yes.

690
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:59,357
See? I told you it would work.

691
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,091
This is it, Alfred...
we can find Bruce and end this.

692
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:04,046
Alvarez, call Strike Force.

693
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:06,065
I want every cop
on the roster in uniform

694
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,014
and ready to roll in half an hour.

695
00:42:08,435 --> 00:42:10,022
What are you waiting for?

696
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:12,608
I was coming to tell you.
I just got word from Arkham.

697
00:42:12,858 --> 00:42:14,543
Barnes escaped his transport.

698
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:16,936
Took out three guards. He's in the wind.

699
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:19,083
We just busted that dude
five minutes ago.

700
00:42:19,473 --> 00:42:21,098
There's more.

701
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:28,597
What is this doing in here?
It's supposed to be in Lucius' office.

702
00:42:28,706 --> 00:42:31,277
He must have moved it. He said
he needed to run some tests.

703
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:34,112
The virus sample
we got from Hugo Strange...

704
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:36,026
- it's gone.
- Maybe Lucius took it.

705
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,462
You're the only two
with the combination, right?

706
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:38,738
Yeah.

707
00:42:40,376 --> 00:42:42,574
No. Lee has it, too.
