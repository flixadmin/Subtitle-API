1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,160
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,800
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,560
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,240
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,640
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed by the body.</i>

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,840
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance
to the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,040
<i>In the future, my friends may not be
heroes but if we succeed,</i>

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,200
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,040
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,800
Ray! Ray, I need you! Please!
I thought you were dead.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,600
Well, not only did you fail
to capture Savage.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,120
You also exposed yourselves
and your powers to him,

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,640
giving away the element of surprise
for now and all time.

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,720
I let you go,
you'll deliver the Waverider.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,440
Boys, ship's all yours.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,320
You're a liability to the team.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Only one of us is walking
out of here alive.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,360
{\an5}<i>One, two, 3.00, 4.00 rock</i>

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,040
<i>Five, six, 7.00, 8.00 rock</i>

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
<i>Nine, ten, 11.00</i>

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,960
Tommy, promise me
you won't go too fast.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,000
You got to hold on
to something, honey.

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,840
- Preferably me.
- Remember.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,320
Just because you stole
your grandma's wheels

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,640
don't mean you got to drive like her.

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,640
You run your mouth pretty fast.
Let's see if your car can keep up.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,360
Let's go!

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,520
Tommy, watch it!

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>When it's eight, nine, ten, 11 too</i>

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,240
<i>I'll be going strong
And so will you</i>

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,880
<i>We're gonna rock
Around the clock tonight</i>

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,440
<i>We're gonna rock, rock,
Rock till broad daylight</i>

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,680
<i>We're gonna rock, gonna rock</i>

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,080
<i>Around the clock tonight</i>

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,200
Yo, James Dean! Are you...

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
What's that?

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,720
I think that's a comet or something.

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,280
It's a meteorite...

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,560
in point of fact.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
I was drawn to it as well.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,920
Your presence out here
was unexpected.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
Or perhaps that's just
another word for

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,240
destiny.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm not the only one whose vision
is blurry in their left eye, am I?

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,680
- Oh.
- Seeing three of everything?

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
That's normal, right?

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,960
Yes, as I mentioned before,

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
the effect of time travel
on the human body

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
increases with the length
of each jaunt.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,720
- So, where are we?
- Harmony Falls, Oregon.

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,560
According to Captain Baxter's intel,

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,880
Savage makes an appearance
in this quaint little hamlet.

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,160
What the hell is Savage
doing in Pleasantville?

54
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,240
Murder, apparently.

55
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,160
Several denizens of Harmony Falls
have been brutally slain

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,320
and others have gone missing.

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,720
Kind of like Rory.

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,440
{\an5}Reports are vague but it seems like
the killer is an expert with knives.

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,000
- That sounds like Savage's MO.
- Yeah, but serial killing isn't.

60
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,520
Sounds pretty small-time for a guy
who's has coffee with Hitler.

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,760
{\an5}Yeah, well, clearly we have to assume
that Savage has a larger

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,080
more nefarious plan.

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,680
{\an5}But since we've jumped back in time,
Savage isn't expecting us here.

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,120
Savage is pretty good at hiding,
even in a small town

65
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,960
so how do you plan to find him?

66
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,920
By investigating these murders.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,440
{\an5}Now, there has to be a common link
between the victims

68
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,440
starting with the first.

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,280
A piano teacher was found
slain in her home

70
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,760
which is now on the market.

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,880
There is, of course, crown molding.

72
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,200
All original floors. Stucco ceiling.

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
{\an5}There's a small room
above the garage

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,960
suitable for live-in help.

75
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,320
Oh, well, we don't need a maid.

76
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,760
{\an5}My husband and I get along
just fine on our own.

77
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,360
{\an5}You know, I have a lovely
Tudor style in another town.

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,080
A more accepting one.

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,760
Forward-thinking.

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,640
No, that's... that's fine.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,800
I like my towns backward.

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
Dr. Matt Miller was found murdered

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,720
on the grounds of the asylum
where he worked.

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,080
{\an5}The sanitarium is in need
of a replacement.

85
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,520
It's a very impressive facility.

86
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,160
{\an5}I did my doctoral thesis
on socio-pathology in relationship

87
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,840
to serial murder, actually.

88
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,400
{\an5}Well, that'll certainly come in
handy around here.

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,040
{\an5}We've been short-staffed ever since
Dr. Miller's sudden demise.

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,480
{\an5}Of course, I could never consider
accepting a position here

91
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,080
without my faithful nurse/assistant.

92
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,960
{\an5}Yes, well, she looks like
she'll fit right in.

93
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,920
Meanwhile, Jefferson is the perfect
age to discern the facts

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
behind the disappearance
of three teenagers

95
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,920
who went missing a week
before these murders began.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
So, Raymond and Kendra
are shacking up

97
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,080
{\an5}Sara's Nurse ratched
and Jax's the new kid in town.

98
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,880
Where does that leave me?

99
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,880
We're looking for the sheriff.

100
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,200
Well, you found him. Bud Ellison.

101
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,160
How can I help you, folks?

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,520
Special Agent Rip Hunter.

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,880
This is my partner, Leonard.

104
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,760
{\an5}We are here to investigate
the serial murders

105
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,280
{\an5}which have plagued this
sleepy old town of yours.

106
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
Now, slow down there, buddy.

107
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,400
{\an5}There ain't no serial killer
anywhere.

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,640
{\an5}All we got is some
unexplained accidents is all.

109
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,360
{\an5}How about you hand over
those case files

110
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,160
so we can decide for ourselves?

111
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,680
{\an5}Or we can come back
with a court order

112
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,200
and a really nasty disposition.

113
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,480
{\an5}Anything for our friends
at the bureau.

114
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,520
Nice work, partner.

115
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
You're not my partner.

116
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,280
There's only one person
I ever trusted on this job,

117
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,280
and we all know how that turned out.

118
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,160
Schwinn Hornets.

119
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,360
I had the very same one
when I was their age.

120
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,640
Seeing white picket fences
and perfect family houses

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
it's enough to make one nostalgic.

122
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,880
- Or nauseated.
- Oh, come on, Ms. Lance.

123
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,760
Even someone as jaded as yourself
can't deny how idyllic this time was.

124
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,880
Yeah.

125
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
- If you're white.
- And a man.

126
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,360
- And straight. And...
- Okay, okay. I get the point.

127
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,480
Dude, even if this town
wasn't full of small-minded idiots

128
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,600
it'd still be creepy as hell.

129
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,880
I used to watch all these old
horror movies with my mom,

130
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,360
and they all started off
in places like this.

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,480
See, first it's all perfect
and then, boom,

132
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
some alien monster beast thing

133
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
starts killing kids on Lovers Lane.

134
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,000
- Oh.
- I'm telling you, man.

135
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
What is it?

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,320
An unhappy cheerleader.

137
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,040
Now, that is scary.

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,880
That girl was from the newspaper
articles Rip showed us.

139
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,440
She knows the guys that went missing.

140
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,920
Perhaps she can illuminate us
as to their whereabouts.

141
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,840
Dude, can you not just say,

142
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,760
"Hey, Jax, why don't you
go talk to her

143
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
and find out what she knows?"

144
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,440
Like a normal person.

145
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,920
Hey, Jax,
why don't you just go do that?

146
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,520
All right. We mustn't dawdle.

147
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,440
I believe our lunch hour
is nearly at an end.

148
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,560
Come along, Nurse.

149
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
Just so you know

150
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,280
Ra's al Ghul taught me
how to kill someone slowly,

151
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,760
over the course of days.

152
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,320
Hey, you mind if I sit?

153
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,200
- You can't sit with him.
- What is up with them?

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,440
I... I don't think
they've seen anyone.

155
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
Dip their fries in their milk
shake before?

156
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Oh.

157
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Don't knock it
till you tried it, girl.

158
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,040
No.

159
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,640
Okay.

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,240
- Okay, that's really good. Right?
- Yeah.

161
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,040
I'm Jax.

162
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,240
- Betty.
- Nice to meet you, Betty.

163
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,400
Hey, Betty.

164
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,280
Just because your boyfriend went AWOL

165
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,640
doesn't mean you have to slum it
with this loser.

166
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,800
Why don't you do yourself
a favor, Biff?

167
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,320
Keep walking before you really,
really embarrass yourself.

168
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,640
What? You want to take a swing at me?

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,720
Hey. Let's go.

170
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
This isn't over.

171
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,800
I am so sorry about that.

172
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,520
- Where were we?
- No, that was amazing.

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,520
Do you want to hang out
tomorrow night?

174
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

175
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,200
- It's a date.
- Okay.

176
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,120
<i>I was caught by your kisses</i>

177
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,040
Well, now that we're done moving in,
care to dance?

178
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Sure.

179
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,760
<i>Locked in your arms</i>

180
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,560
<i>There's no mistake</i>

181
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,560
So, yesterday, we kissed
and now, today, we're married.

182
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
Okay, I know it seems like
we're moving fast

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,520
but this is all pretend.

184
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,240
Soon as we get a divorce

185
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,160
we'll figure us out.

186
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,840
In the meantime

187
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,240
doesn't mean
we can't have fun with it.

188
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,080
This is a waste of time.

189
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,440
We should be out there looking
for Savage, not playing doctor.

190
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
You know what I mean.

191
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,920
I'd like to think that in a town
with multiple murders

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,560
and missing teenagers,

193
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,160
the local insane asylum would be
fertile ground for clues.

194
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,520
Let's start by reviewing
the files of every inmate

195
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,520
with a history of violence.

196
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,880
If you wouldn't mind getting me
those files, Nurse?

197
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,160
Literally for days.

198
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,640
Is that a new perfume I smell?

199
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,400
You know, if you're trying
to drive everyone crazy

200
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,680
I have to tell you, it's working.

201
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,040
I'm very busy right now.

202
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
You know what your problem is?

203
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,840
You don't know
how to have a good time.

204
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,600
Now, what you need is a man
who can show you one.

205
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,960
Thank you.

206
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,120
That was incredible.

207
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,920
Well, maybe next time,
he'll take no for an answer.

208
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,040
It's not just him.

209
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,880
Most of the doctors here
are looking for a good time

210
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
and most of the nurses all say yes

211
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,960
because they're looking
to get married.

212
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh. Not you, though.

213
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm not really looking for a husband.

214
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,040
Today's my first day.

215
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,400
Care to give the new girl a tour?

216
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,360
The files you asked for, Doctor.

217
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,280
Excellent, Nurse.

218
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,600
I could also go for a cup of coffee.

219
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,760
Me too. Black. Two sugars.

220
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,760
And the cafeteria's over there.

221
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,880
It's better than what we serve
the patients but not by much.

222
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,080
Oh.

223
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,440
What's down there?

224
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
Oh, that's Hall H,
the restricted ward.

225
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,240
It's for Dr. Knox's patients.

226
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,880
Violent psychotics.

227
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,680
That part of the tour
is worth skipping.

228
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,680
Coming!

229
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm coming.

230
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,360
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thank you.

231
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,960
- Thank you so much, Miss.
- Mrs. Knox.

232
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,960
Gail Knox and this is my husband,
Curtis.

233
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,360
Lovely to meet you.

234
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
I'm sorry, have... have
we met before?

235
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,280
I... I doubt it.

236
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,000
I, we just moved in
from way out of town.

237
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,800
I hope you like tuna surprise.

238
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,000
Are you kidding?
I love tuna surprise.

239
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,400
Oh, my God, Raymond!

240
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,040
These are our new neighbors,
Curtis and Gail.

241
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
- What a surprise.
- Tuna surprise.

242
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
So many surprises.

243
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,280
Well, another reason why we dropped
by was to let you know

244
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,000
that we are having a soiree tonight.

245
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,480
Stop by any time after 8.00.
We're just across the street.

246
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,400
- Don't bother to ring the bell.
- No, you just walk right on in.

247
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,040
It's that kind of neighborhood.

248
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,960
Savage doesn't think I recognize him,
which means he won't try to kill me.

249
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,680
He can't steal my powers
before I've found them.

250
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,080
Don't forget, we also have to figure
out why he's killing the townsfolk.

251
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,840
Are you really eating that?

252
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,320
Say what you want about Savage.

253
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,800
He makes one hell of a casserole.

254
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,680
Yes, well, Mr. Snart and I have been
analyzing these forensic files.

255
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,000
Which reveal nothing except
Savage is very good

256
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,400
at making people disappear.

257
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
Something you both have in common.

258
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,360
Are we just gonna pretend
like none of this happened?

259
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,920
That Mick Rory
wasn't a part of our team?

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,040
If you can just ice
your best friend like that

261
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,640
I hate to think
what you could do to us.

262
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,200
Right now, we need to stay
focused on the mission.

263
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,440
Look, Savage is going to be busy
with this little cocktail party.

264
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,400
Whilst you two keep an eye on him,
Sara and Martin have the opportunity

265
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,360
to find out what he's doing in
the secret wing of that asylum.

266
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,840
If you're looking for booze,
you're in the wrong office.

267
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,960
Dr. Knox doesn't drink.

268
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,640
But I know where Dr. Enbom
keeps the good stuff.

269
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,600
<i>It seems like everyone's in love</i>

270
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
<i>Everyone but me</i>

271
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,680
<i>I can't find a doggone soul</i>

272
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,320
<i>To share my company</i>

273
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,880
Oh, there you are, dear.

274
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,080
I could go for another
glass of bubbly.

275
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,480
Then I suggest you find a waitress.

276
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,160
- Well, I... I just assumed.
- You assume wrong.

277
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,160
So, why don't you go ahead
and get your own champagne?

278
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,360
Wow, I guess this whole interracial
marriage thing really is a novelty.

279
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,080
Well, go ahead and let them stare.

280
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I've got the most beautiful
woman in the room on my arm.

281
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,160
I couldn't agree with you more.

282
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,360
Oh, hello.

283
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,960
Thank you for inviting us.

284
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,960
Your home, is very normal.

285
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,120
Oh, we are just glad
that you could attend.

286
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,520
Let me fix you a drink.

287
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,320
Okay, we need to split up.

288
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,480
You check the back rooms
and I'll see what I can find up here.

289
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,640
You sure that's a good idea?

290
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,800
Leaving you up here
by yourself with Savage?

291
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm pretty sure he's not gonna
kill me next to the canapés, Ray.

292
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,880
Go. I'll let you know if I need help.

293
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,360
<i>Fall in love with me</i>

294
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,680
You've been so many places.

295
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,920
It's like you've had three lives.

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,240
Me, I've never left Harmony Falls.

297
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,000
That's your first mistake.

298
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,440
This town sucks.

299
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,120
Wow, you do not hold back.

300
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,360
I've learned life's too short.

301
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,560
So you have a girlfriend?

302
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,160
I just mean, seems pretty
obvious you're not into guys.

303
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,440
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

304
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,640
Okay.

305
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,080
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

306
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,840
But just so you know,

307
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,320
I'm really good at keeping secrets.

308
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,560
Funny you should say that.

309
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,280
I did kiss a girl once.

310
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,720
I didn't think that made me a...

311
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,160
- You know.
- A lesbian?

312
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,240
- What?
- It's not a bad word.

313
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,360
Well, it is around here.

314
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,880
Well, good thing
I'm not from around here.

315
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,880
Nurse Lance, may I have
a word with you, please?

316
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,920
Well, now I see what's been going on.

317
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,400
While I've been busy working,

318
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,360
you were busy seducing
that young woman.

319
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,560
Actually, I was liberating her.

320
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,880
- With an option to seduce her later.
- Then what?

321
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,400
This poor young woman

322
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,240
will have to remain in the sexually
repressive 1950s

323
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,000
long after you've returned
to a time ship

324
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,640
and disappeared
from her life forever.

325
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
You know what, Doc?

326
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,520
I would love for someone
to drop into my life and tell me

327
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
that the future's gonna be
a better place.

328
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,200
Get to Hall H!

329
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,320
Your husband must be a fool
to leave a woman such as yourself

330
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,760
alone at a party.

331
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,720
He doesn't seem like your type.

332
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,560
That's a rather interesting
thing to say.

333
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,960
You hardly know me.

334
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,680
And yet I feel like I do.

335
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,120
Let me ask you a question, Kendra.

336
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,920
Do you believe in past lives?

337
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,920
Do you believe in fate?

338
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,520
Fate is a prison.

339
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
When free will is gone, what's left?

340
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,080
Destiny.

341
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,960
Hello.

342
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,440
Yeah. I understand.

343
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
Of course. I'm on my way.

344
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,160
Looks like we have to finish
our discussion later.

345
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,440
One of my patients needs attention.

346
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,240
Enjoy the party.

347
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,760
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
I... I thought the two of us

348
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,320
had an understanding.

349
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,480
I've allowed you and your cohorts

350
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,800
the occasional freedom to run free

351
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,120
and to feed your thirst and then...

352
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,960
then you do something like this.

353
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Palmer.

354
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,520
I'm unfamiliar
with the term "man cave."

355
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,360
Oh, it's a room in a basement

356
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,560
where a dude goes to be alone
or watch football.

357
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,760
In Savage's case, it's kill people.

358
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,320
So Ray and I break in and find out

359
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,280
what Savage is doing
in Harmony Falls.

360
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,600
Is tonight the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance?

361
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I got a date tonight

362
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
with Tommy Fuller's
cheerleader girlfriend.

363
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,720
Turns out Betty's boyfriend

364
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,640
was one of the missing
high school kids.

365
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,800
I think she knows more than
she's letting on.

366
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,160
She's also a white girl

367
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,120
in a very, unenlightened community.

368
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,120
So please, be careful

369
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,560
when you're out in public with her.

370
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,720
An immortal psychopath and racists.

371
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm beginning to like this quaint
little town less and less.

372
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,800
How's it going over there?

373
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm in.

374
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,760
What do you see?

375
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,160
Nothing all that hideous.

376
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,480
Except for a terrible
collection of golf pants.

377
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,160
Hang on.

378
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,320
Ray?

379
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,520
Ray, it's Savage. He's back.

380
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,080
<i>Did you hear me, Ray?</i>

381
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,800
<i>You need to get out of there!</i>

382
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,800
I think I found something.

383
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,920
<i>No, no, no, no.
You don't have time.</i>

384
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,200
<i>He's already inside.</i>

385
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,200
Don't you ever get freaked out?

386
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,920
I mean, being in an insane asylum

387
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,720
by yourself in the middle
of the night?

388
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,960
Freaked out? No.

389
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,080
Lonely? Yes.

390
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,400
Actually, there is one place
in the hospital that scares me.

391
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,680
Dr. Knox's restricted wing.

392
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,240
Do you know what he's doing
to the patients down there?

393
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,640
No.

394
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,160
I don't like to think about it.

395
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,480
What do you like to think about?

396
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,080
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I thought you said...

397
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,120
I... I just have to get back to work.

398
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,160
You look great tonight.

399
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,600
<i>Don't have to tell me</i>

400
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,000
- I'm sorry. I thought that...
- No, don't be sorry.

401
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,440
It's just, I thought girls from 1958

402
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,800
moved a little bit slower.

403
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Girls from 1958?

404
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,480
I mean

405
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,680
I think we should
get to know each other

406
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,280
a little bit better first.

407
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,040
Okay.

408
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,840
What do you want to know?

409
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
Those guys back at the soda shop,

410
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,720
they mentioned something
about your boyfriend going AWOL?

411
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,800
Tommy.

412
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,240
What happened to him?

413
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,640
It's kind of a long story.

414
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,080
Well, I got all the time
in the world.

415
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,600
We were drag racing down on Route 7

416
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,280
with Davis and Billy

417
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,960
when Tommy's car went into a ditch.

418
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,160
- That's when they found it.
- Found what?

419
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,000
- This...
- Been looking all over for you.

420
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
- Get out!
- No!

421
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
Get out of the car!

422
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,240
Hey, get the hell off me, man!

423
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,200
Stop it! Stop it!

424
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
Get in! Get in!

425
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,400
Go!

426
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,920
Oh, come on!

427
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,920
Tommy?

428
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,920
I am not playing anymore!

429
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,520
Don't worry, Betty.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

430
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,840
Nice driving.

431
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,040
Hang in there.
Gideon's gonna fix you.

432
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,800
Who's Gideon?

433
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,760
- A doctor, of sorts.
- Okay.

434
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,440
You need to pull over, Jax.

435
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,920
Hey.

436
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,280
Relax.

437
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,880
Yeah, because it's not like
I'm a black kid in a small town

438
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,840
with a white girl bleeding
all over my seat.

439
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,040
You were driving to beat
the devil back there.

440
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,880
That explain why
your car looks like hell?

441
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,680
I need to get my friend
to a hospital.

442
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,400
- Friend?
- Yeah.

443
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,840
And there's more wounded
on Lovers' Lane.

444
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,440
Some... some kind of attack.

445
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,440
What were you doing with this girl
on Lovers Lane, boy?

446
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,320
There are kids back there
that could really use your help

447
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,440
and she needs medical attention
right now.

448
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,600
Put your hands on the car
and spread them.

449
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,440
Listen, you can play Boss Hogg
all you want

450
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,480
but I'm not gonna let
that girl bleed to death

451
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,600
so I tell you what,
I'm gonna get back in my car

452
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,280
and I'm gonna take her
to the hospital.

453
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,280
Gideon traced Jax's last
bio signature to this location.

454
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,440
Well, it seems you had good reason

455
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,760
to be concerned
for Mr. Jackson's safety.

456
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,560
Yeah, sucks being right all the time.

457
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,280
<i>She has suffered
several severe lacerations.</i>

458
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,120
<i>I am attempting
to cauterize the wound.</i>

459
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
- What happened?
- I don't know.

460
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,120
But I'm guessing Jax and Peggy Sue
had a pretty lousy first date.

461
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,520
Where is Jefferson?

462
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,200
There was no sign of him in the car.

463
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,680
These wounds don't appear
consistent with a knife.

464
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
<i>Correct.</i>

465
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,320
<i>I believe these lacerations
were made by talons.</i>

466
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,640
It was Tommy.

467
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,280
Tommy Fuller,
one of the missing teenagers.

468
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
He was like a bird.

469
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,640
He... he was like a bird monster.

470
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,880
<i>Captain, analysis
of Miss Seaver's blood</i>

471
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,080
<i>reveals traces of silicate minerals.</i>

472
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,320
Miss Seaver, do you recall
Tommy coming into contact

473
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,920
with a meteor of some kind?

474
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,920
The car crash...

475
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,640
it was...

476
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,920
it was glowing.

477
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
She's talking about
an Nth Metal meteorite.

478
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,160
Say something that makes sense.

479
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,200
It seems Mr. Fuller
has come into contact

480
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,480
with a meteorite
with mutagenic properties.

481
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
Try again.

482
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,080
Apparently, Miss Seaver's boyfriend

483
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,920
has been exposed
to the same type of meteor

484
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,320
that Kendra came into contact with.

485
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Me?

486
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,880
Well, you and Carter.

487
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,800
4,000 years ago.

488
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,280
The meteorite
which gave you your powers

489
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,080
appears to be of the same variety
that mutated Tommy Fuller.

490
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,080
And I'm guessing it's not curable.

491
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,360
Well, I... I suppose,

492
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,080
if the talons which lacerated her

493
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,840
left some mutagenic residue,
I could...

494
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,520
Yes or no?

495
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
Perhaps.

496
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,880
Why don't you get
to work on that, Martin?

497
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,960
Okay, so if Savage
isn't the one doing the killing

498
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,680
what is he doing in town?

499
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,960
Doesn't matter.

500
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
We can take him down.

501
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,200
- The Amon Dagger. Where did you...
- Savage's house.

502
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,840
All right, we need
to proceed on two fronts

503
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,800
locate Jefferson and make
an all-out assault on Savage.

504
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,920
A full-on attack only plays
to Savage's strengths.

505
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
If we want to get him...

506
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,760
We need to target his weaknesses.

507
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,200
Sadly, very few come to mind.

508
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,880
I can think of one.

509
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,840
Me.

510
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,000
He wants me and he always has.

511
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,520
So if I can get close enough
to him, then...

512
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,240
Then he'll kill you.

513
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,840
Thank you for the vote of confidence,

514
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,560
but I don't need your protection.

515
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,160
There's no reason to go alone.

516
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,480
We're part of a team for a reason.

517
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,160
Yes, and the team seems comfortable
with me doing this

518
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,280
so that makes it about you and me.

519
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,040
- Any updates?
- We're making progress.

520
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,320
In the meantime, we need
to get ready to back Kendra up.

521
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,200
She's going into the asylum
to meet Savage tonight.

522
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,760
Another opportunity for you
to see Nurse Carlisle.

523
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,800
Yeah, and apologize.

524
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,040
I warned you, Ms. Lance.

525
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,000
Rushing a repressed woman
from the 1950s into the freewheeling

526
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,400
sexual mores of the 21st century.

527
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,280
Actually, I was the one
who freaked out.

528
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,280
Ever since I got brought
back to life, I haven't really

529
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,040
experienced much
in the way of feelings.

530
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,200
And then when Lindsey kissed me.

531
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,320
It was like you were being kissed
for the first time.

532
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,480
- How romantic.
- It was more like terrifying.

533
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,320
That's the thing
that sucks about feelings is,

534
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,240
you realize how much
you can hurt someone

535
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,800
or get hurt.

536
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,360
Wakey, wakey.

537
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,480
Do the words "police brutality"
mean anything to you?

538
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,880
You think this is brutal?

539
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,400
You'll be begging for me
after he gets through with you.

540
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,000
That's enough, Sheriff.
Thank you. Leave us be.

541
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,360
This young man and I have a lot
to discuss.

542
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,240
Forgive my friend for his ignorance.

543
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,320
You will learn
that I'm much more enlightened.

544
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,680
Well, I'll take racist
over crazy any day.

545
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,520
Oh, I would hardly describe
what I'm doing here as... as "crazy."

546
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,560
Therapy is nothing more than
a process of self-discovery.

547
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,880
You're about to experience
an extraterrestrial power.

548
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,040
Shall we begin?

549
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,040
What a piece of work is man.

550
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,520
When I was exposed to a meteorite,

551
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,720
I was blessed with eternal life,
immortality.

552
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,200
But sadly, the effect of this
meteorite turned out quite different.

553
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,360
But no less advantageous.

554
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,440
Doc, you have a visitor.

555
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,600
What a pleasant surprise.

556
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,640
Is it a surprise

557
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
or fate?

558
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,320
We didn't get to finish
our discussion the other night.

559
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,280
What of your square-jawed
husband, Raymond?

560
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,400
I didn't come here to talk
about my husband,

561
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Doctor.

562
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
May I?

563
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,720
May I take your coat?

564
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,760
<i>Make yourself comfortable.</i>

565
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Nurse?

566
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,120
Nurse, I keep hearing
voices in my head.

567
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,840
My wife with another man

568
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,000
and it's driving me crazy.

569
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,960
Well, maybe you should learn
to trust your wife a little bit more.

570
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Orderly?

571
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,880
Show our new patient to his room.

572
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,880
And don't hesitate to give him
a sedative if he doesn't calm down.

573
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,240
Right away, Nurse.

574
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,880
I'm sure the kid is fine.

575
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,480
Jefferson and I, as you know,
share a psychic connection,

576
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,440
but for some inexplicable reason,
I can't seem to reach him.

577
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,600
I've grown so accustomed
to our partnership,

578
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,920
to suddenly be without him
is disquieting.

579
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,640
I know the feeling.

580
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,880
So have you tried
psychoanalysis before?

581
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
No.

582
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,720
- My husband thinks it's baloney.
- Oh, is that so?

583
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,920
Well, my specialty is
interpreting dreams.

584
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,320
What do you dream, Kendra?

585
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,720
To be honest,

586
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,400
I've dreamt of you before and me

587
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
together.

588
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,800
Well, that's interesting.

589
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,040
And what do we do in those dreams?

590
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,720
I'm afraid you'll think me forward.

591
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,560
Oh, but you are forward.

592
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Coming here in that dress?

593
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,240
Perhaps you should learn
to embrace your desires

594
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,440
so the two of us
can finally be together.

595
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,400
Did you lose something?

596
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,360
I was wondering how long you could
play out this little charade.

597
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,360
You show up on my doorstep
and then my dagger goes missing?

598
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,800
You must think me stupid not to
suspect that your powers had emerged.

599
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,720
Well, well, well.

600
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,080
An FBI agent moonlighting
at the loony bin.

601
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,760
I'm afraid both of you boys
have some explaining to do

602
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,080
down at the station.

603
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,400
Who else have you brought
to the asylum tonight?

604
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,960
No one. No one! It's just me.

605
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,240
I hope you're better at lying
in your next life.

606
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Oh, boy.

607
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,040
Just when you think
you've seen everything.

608
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,400
Guess those missing kids
are no longer missing.

609
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,160
What have you done?

610
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,400
I released my test subjects.

611
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,640
The energy from the meteorite
has changed them.

612
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,560
I set out to build an army
as powerful as you.

613
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,280
Pity they didn't turn out
nearly as beautiful.

614
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,400
Oh, my God.

615
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,880
It's Jefferson.

616
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,440
Jefferson, it's... it's us!

617
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
Jax, don't make me do this.

618
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
I'll deal with this lot.

619
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,760
Find Kendra now.

620
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,960
I can explain. Just not now.

621
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,880
Perhaps it will turn out better
in our next life, my love.

622
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,080
Are you okay?

623
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,960
It's time to go.

624
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,000
Not without Jefferson.

625
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,720
Or whatever's left of him.

626
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,000
Gideon was able to help me devise
a gene therapy that will hopefully

627
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,160
restore Jefferson and those at
the asylum to their former selves.

628
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,520
If genome bonding occurs,
we should know right away.

629
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,000
Course, we would never have had
the slightest chance of saving him

630
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
were it not for you.

631
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,800
Let's not get sentimental.

632
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,320
Another minute and things might have
gone down very differently.

633
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Despite your bravado, Mr. Snart

634
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,960
the actions that I witnessed last
night were nothing short of heroic.

635
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,840
It's working.

636
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,160
Hey.

637
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,000
How are our friends
doing over in Hall H?

638
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,440
Whatever Dr. Stein gave those
creatures seemed to have worked.

639
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,720
They're back to normal.

640
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
And you?

641
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,080
Not sure if I'm ever gonna get
fully back to normal.

642
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Good.

643
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
Thank you

644
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,320
for rescuing me.

645
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,280
Well, you rescued me first,
so now we're even.

646
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,920
You have to go, don't you?

647
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
I get it.

648
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,040
Should've known better
than to fall for a ninja.

649
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,560
Who knows?
Maybe I'll be back one day.

650
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,760
And if so...

651
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,440
You know where to find me.

652
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,480
So, I felt bad about trashing
your dad's.

653
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,160
I thought this might make up for it.

654
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,200
- You bought me a car?
- I souped it up too.

655
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,240
In case of future monster attacks.

656
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,960
I wish you didn't have to go.

657
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,440
I don't belong here.

658
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,160
And neither do you.

659
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,840
Promise me you'll
get out of this town.

660
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,960
The both of you.

661
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,160
Tommy!

662
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,680
It's a great big world out there,
Betty.

663
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,120
And it's changing fast.

664
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,920
Maybe we'll catch up down
the road somewhere.

665
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,720
Hey. I was just packing up.

666
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,160
I thought you were back
at the Waverider.

667
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,480
I just forgot something.

668
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,840
I forgot to say I'm sorry.

669
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,840
Look, I was wrong to think

670
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,360
that I could actually end
Savage by myself.

671
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,680
Just slow down.

672
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,680
I made a mistake too.

673
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,120
I got so caught up playing house

674
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,200
that I forgot about why
we were really here.

675
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,960
And you will end Savage someday.

676
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,840
I guess the last thing
a 4,000-year-old demigoddess needs

677
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,720
is an overprotective husband.

678
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,480
What she needs is a partner.

679
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
What do you say?

680
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Partner.

681
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,080
Well, look who's up and around.

682
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Yeah.

683
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,240
I guess I owe you an apology.

684
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,560
Grey told me about what happened
back at the asylum.

685
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,400
You had the chance to kill me
and you didn't.

686
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,640
After last night, I know enough
about being a monster

687
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
to know that you're not one.

688
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,120
Stop. I'm getting misty eyed.

689
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,640
I just want you to know

690
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,400
about what happened with Rory?

691
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
I get it.

692
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,720
You were protecting us.

693
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,840
And that doesn't make you a murderer.

694
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,760
It makes you a part of this team.

695
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,560
Jefferson, you should be resting.

696
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,440
Man, I'm... I'm done laying around.

697
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,080
I just want to get
the hell out of Mayberry.

698
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,360
Agreed, we're still waiting on Sara
and the two lovebirds to get back.

699
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,200
Seems they've taken quite
a shine to 1958.

700
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,760
- What on earth?
- Gideon?

701
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,640
Not this guy again.

702
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,920
<i>Captain, Chronos has breached
the starboard hatch.</i>

703
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
How is that possible?

704
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Clearly, he's received some new toys

705
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,080
from his Time Master friends
since our last encounter.

706
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,960
Gideon, seal the bulkheads
from here until...

707
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,760
Grey, come on. Let us do this.

708
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,840
If we merge on the Waverider,
we could destroy the entire ship!

709
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,440
Are you not paying attention
to what Chronos is doing?

710
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,680
Fall back!

711
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,280
Get to the jump ship!

712
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,640
1958's swell and all
but I miss the Internet

713
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,720
and cell phones.

714
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,440
What are they doing?

715
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,240
- Hey.
- Hey!

716
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,200
Where did they go?

717
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,960
Better question,
why did they leave us?
