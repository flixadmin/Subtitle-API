1
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:01,950
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,495
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:14,170
Now listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,380
I know.

5
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:17,382
How do I look?

6
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,967
Perfect.

7
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:20,802
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:22,387
It's great.

9
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:24,556
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:27,142
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:29,185
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:31,604
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:34,190
Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:35,316
Coming.

15
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:37,694
All right.

16
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:39,070
I'm ready.

17
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,046
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:58,173
Roz.

19
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:03,344
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:06,264
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:08,683
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:11,394
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch The Nutcracker?

23
00:02:11,644 --> 00:02:13,438
- What time's it on?
- 9:00.

24
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:16,191
- You can watch that.
- Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:19,319
- No, darling.
- It'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,696
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:24,449
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,326
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

29
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:29,120
- I'll hold our cab to take you home.
- Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,663
You be good, baby.

31
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:34,125
- Good night, sweetheart.
- See you in the morning.

32
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,179
- Victor, Illona.
- Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:48,807
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:53,436
- Thanks so much for coming.
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:56,606
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

36
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:58,650
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

37
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:00,527
- Yes, he does.
- He does?

38
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:03,613
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:07,033
- You ought to see my serve now.
- He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:09,661
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:12,163
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:14,958
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:29,389
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,059
Not a soul.

45
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,863
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,285
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:03,047
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:06,634
I went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:08,136
Really?

50
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:13,683
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:17,896
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,193
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:26,738
The band's going to take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

54
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,364
Thank you.

55
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:37,082
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,626
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:43,630
You go and say hello, and I'll
meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,173
Good.

59
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:56,559
Nightingale.

60
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:58,478
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:00,897
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:04,150
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:07,654
- How long has it been?
- I don't know. 10 years?

64
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,114
And a couple.

65
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,449
- Do you have time for a drink?
- Sure.

66
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:17,455
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:20,417
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,211
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,630
I see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:28,258
Oh, yes, well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:31,553
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:35,640
You know what they say:
"Once a doctor, always a doctor."

73
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:39,978
Yes, or in my case:
"Never a doctor, never a doctor."

74
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,106
I never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:46,067
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

76
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:47,402
Cheers.

77
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:51,239
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

78
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:52,991
Be right with you.

79
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,785
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

80
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:59,622
...I'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata Café.

81
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,375
- Stop by if you get a chance.
- I'll be there.

82
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:06,004
- It's great seeing you.
- Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:49,089
I think that's my glass.

84
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:52,300
I'm absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,567
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

86
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:22,080
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:24,374
I'm American.

88
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,835
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:32,924
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on The Art of Love?

90
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:38,430
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

91
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:41,307
...crying his eyes out...

92
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:45,103
...in some place
with a very bad climate?

93
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:49,065
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,734
A very good time.

95
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,781
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:01,744
With my husband.

97
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:03,913
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:09,335
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:16,092
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:19,846
Well, at the moment...

101
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:22,891
...I'm looking for a job.

102
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:27,604
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,273
But it went broke.

104
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,777
What a shame.

105
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,864
I have some friends in the art game.

106
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,617
Perhaps I can be of some help.

107
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:45,830
Thank you.

108
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:05,767
Someone you know?

109
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,106
My...

110
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:13,108
...husband.

111
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,490
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage...

112
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,161
...is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

113
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:31,418
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

114
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:35,422
...who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

115
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:40,176
Why wouldn't she?

116
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,888
Is it as bad as that?

117
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,392
As good as that.

118
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:49,811
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

119
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:54,441
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

120
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,319
How do you spell Nuala?

121
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:03,658
N-U-A-L-A.

122
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:07,954
You don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,583
You were very kind to me once.

124
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,378
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

125
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:20,717
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

126
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:22,469
...on a very windy day...?

127
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:26,681
- And you got something in your eye.
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

128
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:30,435
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

129
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:33,062
...which was also clean.

130
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:38,193
That is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

131
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,113
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

132
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:45,742
Why don't you tell me?

133
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,246
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

134
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:54,084
...and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

135
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:57,212
The ones they really wanted.

136
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,593
Fascinating.

137
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,017
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

138
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,939
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

139
00:11:17,565 --> 00:11:20,110
They always seem so...

140
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:22,445
...knowledgeable.

141
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:27,075
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

142
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:30,036
...about all sorts of things.

143
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:33,957
But I bet they work too hard.

144
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:38,086
Just think of all they miss.

145
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:41,214
You're probably right.

146
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:46,761
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

147
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:48,888
Exactly?

148
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,685
Where the rainbow ends.

149
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,062
Where the rainbow ends?

150
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:59,566
Don't you want to go
where the rainbow ends?

151
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,735
Now that depends where that is.

152
00:12:02,944 --> 00:12:04,529
Well, let's find out.

153
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:07,449
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

154
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:11,786
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

155
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:15,123
Fine.

156
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,168
To be continued?

157
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:42,066
Bill, thanks for coming.

158
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:46,738
We had a little accident here.

159
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:48,406
What happened?

160
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,784
Well, she was...

161
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:55,246
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

162
00:12:56,998 --> 00:12:58,124
What did she take?

163
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,462
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

164
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,422
It's heroin and coke.

165
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:09,177
Heroin and coke?

166
00:13:11,554 --> 00:13:12,847
Anything else?

167
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:17,560
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

168
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:19,646
How long has she been like this?

169
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:23,149
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

170
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:24,442
What's her name?

171
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:26,736
Mandy.

172
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,705
Can you hear me, Mandy?

173
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:42,460
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

174
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:46,840
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

175
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:48,550
You can hear me.

176
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:52,804
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

177
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:56,683
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

178
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:59,769
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

179
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,689
Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:06,443
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

181
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:09,028
Good.

182
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:11,781
Good.

183
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:16,828
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

184
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:22,375
It's wonderful.

185
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:26,671
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

186
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,469
I haven't.

187
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:37,807
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

188
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:41,978
Do you like the period?

189
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,649
I do.

190
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:49,319
I adore it.

191
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,698
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

192
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,993
Would you like to see it?

193
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:01,706
I can show it to you.

194
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:06,961
We won't be gone long.

195
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:15,804
Maybe...

196
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,351
...not just...

197
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:23,853
...now.

198
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:45,250
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

199
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:48,044
Sorry.

200
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,721
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

201
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:01,766
Better.

202
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:15,280
You are a very, very lucky girl.

203
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:17,699
You know that?

204
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:21,369
I know.

205
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,622
You're gonna be okay this time.

206
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,918
But you can't keep doing this.

207
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,087
You understand?

208
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:39,053
You're going to need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

209
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:42,307
I know.

210
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:54,152
Well, Victor...

211
00:16:56,237 --> 00:16:57,781
...I'll leave the rest to you.

212
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:00,617
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

213
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:04,370
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

214
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,997
Another hour?

215
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:10,668
Then I'd have someone take her home.

216
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:17,884
Good night, Mandy.

217
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,847
I can't thank you enough for this.

218
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:25,683
- You saved my ass.
- I'm glad I was here.

219
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:28,269
Bill, I probably...

220
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,440
I know I don't have to mention this...

221
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,443
...but this is just between us.

222
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,112
Of course.

223
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:38,863
Thanks.

224
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:03,430
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

225
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:09,853
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

226
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:14,482
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

227
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:18,236
Yes...

228
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:21,156
...but will I?

229
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,450
Of course you will.

230
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:32,041
I really have to go.
I have to go.

231
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,960
You don't, you know.

232
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,131
Yes, I do.

233
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,013
I must see you again.

234
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,267
- That's impossible.
- Why?

235
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:52,353
Because...

236
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:57,025
...I'm married.

237
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:00,630
Good morning, Lisa.

238
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,882
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

239
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:05,885
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

240
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:07,637
- Sure.
- Thank you.

241
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:11,057
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, doctor.

242
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:14,185
"'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...

243
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:17,147
...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse."

244
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:23,611
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

245
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:29,784
Hold this for Mommy.

246
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:32,996
Looking forward to Christmas?

247
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:35,707
Does this hurt?

248
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:50,638
Right there?

249
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:03,026
Daddy's gonna like that.

250
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:05,320
Very good choice.

251
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,323
"before me...

252
00:21:08,823 --> 00:21:13,578
...when I jump into my bed."

253
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:19,501
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

254
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:22,170
I've taken care of that.

255
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:25,048
Good.

256
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,219
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

257
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:32,931
Let's do that tomorrow.

258
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,144
Tell me something.

259
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,068
Those two girls...

260
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,322
...at the party last night...

261
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:38,830
Did you...

262
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:42,083
...by any chance...

263
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,711
...happen to...

264
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:48,965
...fuck them?

265
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:52,761
What?

266
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:58,141
What are you talking about?

267
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:05,482
I'm talking about the two girls...

268
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:09,486
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

269
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,032
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

270
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:18,870
Who were they?

271
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,585
They were just a couple of models.

272
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:33,802
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

273
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,887
Wait a minute.

274
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:43,937
I didn't disappear with anybody.

275
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:49,150
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

276
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:52,695
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

277
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:59,160
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

278
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,836
A friend of the Zieglers.

279
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:11,756
What did he want?

280
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:13,967
What did he want?

281
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:21,975
Sex...

282
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:25,812
...upstairs.

283
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:28,648
Then and there.

284
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:32,444
Is that all?

285
00:24:32,861 --> 00:24:35,238
Yeah, that was all.

286
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:38,116
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

287
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:43,747
That's right.

288
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:46,249
Well, I guess that's understandable.

289
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:51,212
Understandable?

290
00:24:52,046 --> 00:24:54,132
Because you are a very...

291
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:57,218
...very beautiful woman.

292
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,473
Wait.

293
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,936
Because I'm a beautiful woman...

294
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:11,232
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

295
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:17,197
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

296
00:25:19,657 --> 00:25:24,370
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

297
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:31,086
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

298
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:34,923
So on that basis...

299
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:39,928
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

300
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:44,682
There are exceptions.

301
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:50,021
And what makes you an exception?

302
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:56,152
What makes me an exception is that...

303
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,697
...I happen to be in love with you.

304
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,242
And because we're married...

305
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,579
...and because I would never
lie to you...

306
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:08,748
...or hurt you.

307
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:19,968
Do you realize that
what you're saying...

308
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:23,430
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

309
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:26,099
...is out of consideration for me?

310
00:26:26,307 --> 00:26:29,227
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

311
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:32,230
Let's just relax, Alice.

312
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:34,899
This pot is making you aggressive.

313
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,361
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

314
00:26:38,611 --> 00:26:41,072
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

315
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:43,783
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

316
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,036
I don't even know
what we're arguing about here.

317
00:26:47,245 --> 00:26:49,372
I'm not arguing.

318
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:54,419
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

319
00:26:54,753 --> 00:26:56,296
Where I'm coming from?

320
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:05,096
Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

321
00:27:05,472 --> 00:27:09,267
...standing in your office naked...

322
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:12,020
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

323
00:27:12,228 --> 00:27:13,938
Now, what I want to know...

324
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:18,943
I want to know what you're thinking
about when you're squeezing them.

325
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:23,073
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

326
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:25,784
It's all very impersonal...

327
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,412
...and you know
there's always a nurse present.

328
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:34,626
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

329
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:35,794
Exactly.

330
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:40,381
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

331
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:45,595
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

332
00:27:45,804 --> 00:27:47,972
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

333
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:52,310
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

334
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,399
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

335
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,695
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

336
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:04,739
And what makes you so sure?

337
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:11,496
If for no better reason...

338
00:28:11,996 --> 00:28:14,833
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

339
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:20,296
So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

340
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:22,632
What then?

341
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:26,136
I don't know, Alice...

342
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:28,847
What then?

343
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:34,436
Women don't...

344
00:28:35,562 --> 00:28:38,982
They basically just don't
think like that.

345
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:44,571
Millions of years of evolution, right?

346
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:48,700
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

347
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:51,953
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

348
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,330
...and whatever the fuck else!

349
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:58,126
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

350
00:28:58,668 --> 00:29:02,130
If you men only knew.

351
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:07,427
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

352
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:10,597
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

353
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:12,849
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

354
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,184
No, I'm not.

355
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,352
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

356
00:29:16,603 --> 00:29:17,520
No, I haven't.

357
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:20,148
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

358
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:24,110
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

359
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,613
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

360
00:29:26,821 --> 00:29:29,491
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

361
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:33,828
You are very, very sure of yourself...

362
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:35,246
...aren't you?

363
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:36,831
No.

364
00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:39,250
I'm sure of you.

365
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:52,806
Do you think that's funny?

366
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:03,108
All right. Fuck it.

367
00:30:03,817 --> 00:30:07,487
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

368
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,874
Do you...

369
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,505
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

370
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:35,098
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

371
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:37,350
...there was this young naval officer...

372
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,980
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

373
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:44,399
No.

374
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:50,989
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

375
00:30:51,156 --> 00:30:53,742
Nothing rings a bell?

376
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,374
Well...

377
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:07,130
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

378
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:10,467
He was checking into the hotel...

379
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:14,053
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

380
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:16,598
...to the elevator.

381
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:25,190
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

382
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:28,067
Nothing more.

383
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:38,078
But I could hardly...

384
00:31:39,704 --> 00:31:41,164
...move.

385
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,925
That afternoon...

386
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:58,014
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

387
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:03,645
...and you and I made love.

388
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:10,944
And we made plans about our future...

389
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,907
...and we talked about Helena.

390
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:19,119
And yet...

391
00:32:20,203 --> 00:32:22,831
...at no time...

392
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,626
...was he ever...

393
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,381
...out of my mind.

394
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:41,349
And I thought if he wanted me...

395
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:45,478
...even if it was only...

396
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:48,773
...for one night...

397
00:32:52,902 --> 00:32:56,448
...I was ready to give up everything.

398
00:32:58,116 --> 00:32:59,409
You.

399
00:33:01,953 --> 00:33:03,371
Helena.

400
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:09,461
My whole fucking future.

401
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:13,173
Everything.

402
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:23,641
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

403
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:27,395
...you were dearer to me than ever.

404
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:34,694
And at that moment, my love for you...

405
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,406
...was both...

406
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:45,622
...tender and sad.

407
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:58,635
I barely slept that night...

408
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:04,599
...and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

409
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:10,438
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

410
00:34:11,856 --> 00:34:15,110
...or that he might still be there.

411
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,367
But by dinner...

412
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:28,623
...I realized he was gone...

413
00:34:33,086 --> 00:34:36,881
...and I was...

414
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:39,759
...relieved.

415
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,330
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

416
00:35:15,587 --> 00:35:17,046
When did it happen?

417
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:25,180
I have the address.

418
00:35:25,972 --> 00:35:27,223
Thank you.

419
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:36,733
Lou Nathanson just died.

420
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:47,786
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

421
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:42,132
- Hello, Rosa.
- Good evening, Dr. Harford.

422
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:47,095
- How is Miss Nathanson?
- Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

423
00:36:47,303 --> 00:36:48,388
Thank you.

424
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:04,195
Come in.

425
00:37:10,118 --> 00:37:11,286
Marion...

426
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,873
Oh, Dr. Harford...

427
00:37:15,665 --> 00:37:18,209
How good of you to come.

428
00:37:18,418 --> 00:37:20,754
I came as soon as I got the message.

429
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:22,172
Thank you.

430
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,217
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

431
00:37:26,426 --> 00:37:28,136
Your father was...

432
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:31,931
He was a very brave man.

433
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:34,142
Oh, thank you.

434
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,436
How are you holding up?

435
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,273
I'm a bit numb.

436
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,485
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

437
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:46,780
Would you like to sit down?

438
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:17,435
It's so unreal.

439
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:20,647
Daddy had such a good day.

440
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,986
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

441
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:31,950
Then he had a little dinner...

442
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:35,453
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

443
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:41,418
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

444
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,672
...and when I went to see how he was...

445
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,091
...I just thought he was asleep.

446
00:38:52,887 --> 00:38:56,766
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

447
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:03,857
From what you've said...

448
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:07,944
...I'm sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

449
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:11,781
Oh, God, I hope so.

450
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:18,621
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

451
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:21,291
...than his death itself.

452
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:25,670
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

453
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,010
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

454
00:39:32,552 --> 00:39:35,305
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

455
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:38,224
...and he'll be coming over soon.

456
00:39:42,604 --> 00:39:45,565
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

457
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,778
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

458
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,946
A math professor.

459
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:58,369
We're going to get married in May.

460
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:04,042
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

461
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:09,047
Thank you.

462
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:15,053
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

463
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:17,347
We'll be moving out there soon.

464
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:21,893
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

465
00:40:28,274 --> 00:40:31,152
It really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

466
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:52,048
Oh, my God, no...

467
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:12,861
I love you.

468
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:16,698
I love you.

469
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:19,451
I love you, I love you, I love you.

470
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:22,495
I don't want to go away with Carl.

471
00:41:22,787 --> 00:41:24,748
Marion, I don't think you realize -

472
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:26,166
I do.

473
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:31,212
Even if I'm never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

474
00:41:32,005 --> 00:41:34,841
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

475
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,722
You're very upset, and I don't think
you realize what you're saying.

476
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,767
I love you.

477
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:47,896
We barely know each other.

478
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,358
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

479
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:54,194
I love you.

480
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:01,910
That's probably Carl.

481
00:42:02,952 --> 00:42:05,205
Please don't despise me.

482
00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:12,670
- Hello, Rosa.
- Hello, Mr. Thomas.

483
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:17,509
- Is she in the bedroom?
- Yes, she is.

484
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:18,802
Thank you.

485
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:30,688
Come in.

486
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:36,986
Darling.

487
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,784
I'm so very sorry.

488
00:42:43,618 --> 00:42:45,120
Are you all right?

489
00:42:45,703 --> 00:42:47,122
I'm okay.

490
00:42:49,082 --> 00:42:52,335
- Dr. Harford, good evening.
- Good evening, Carl.

491
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:55,296
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

492
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:58,341
- It's the least I could do.
- It means a lot to us.

493
00:42:58,591 --> 00:42:59,676
Thank you.

494
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:07,100
I was actually on my way out.

495
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:10,937
Marion...

496
00:43:12,313 --> 00:43:14,774
...your father was very proud of you...

497
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:19,779
...and I know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

498
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:22,323
Thank you.

499
00:43:28,663 --> 00:43:30,790
I'll show you out.

500
00:43:33,293 --> 00:43:34,502
Good night.

501
00:44:20,465 --> 00:44:22,759
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

502
00:44:22,967 --> 00:44:25,386
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

503
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:28,807
I'm serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

504
00:44:29,015 --> 00:44:30,809
What team's this switch hitter
playing for?

505
00:44:31,017 --> 00:44:33,311
- Looks like the pink team.
- Look at this faggot!

506
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,230
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

507
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:37,649
Merry Christmas, Mary!

508
00:44:37,857 --> 00:44:40,318
- Your butt-brothers are back there!
- Prime cut of meat!

509
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:43,905
You want to take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

510
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:47,742
You should have tits,
you're standing so close!

511
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,830
- I got dumps that are bigger than you!
- Come on, macho man!

512
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:55,166
- You want a piece of this, baby?
- Exit only, honey.

513
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,795
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

514
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:23,153
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

515
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:25,697
Ten past 12.

516
00:45:27,907 --> 00:45:29,743
Going anywhere special?

517
00:45:30,118 --> 00:45:32,996
No, I'm just taking a walk.

518
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:39,878
How'd you like to have a little fun?

519
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,672
I'm sorry?

520
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:45,717
Have a little fun?

521
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:49,345
I just live right down there.

522
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,557
Would you like to come inside with me?

523
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:55,769
Come inside with you?

524
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:01,775
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

525
00:46:08,865 --> 00:46:10,366
You live in there?

526
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:14,662
By yourself?

527
00:46:14,913 --> 00:46:17,499
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

528
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,335
Hey, it's okay.

529
00:46:21,086 --> 00:46:23,046
Listen, no one will bother us.

530
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,507
It's okay. Come on.

531
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,258
Come on.

532
00:46:52,492 --> 00:46:53,660
This is it.

533
00:46:57,664 --> 00:46:59,082
That's a nice tree.

534
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,716
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

535
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:24,190
It's...

536
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:27,110
...cozy. It's a...

537
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:29,320
...cozy place.

538
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,781
It's okay.

539
00:47:46,921 --> 00:47:51,176
Do you suppose we
should talk about money?

540
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:53,344
Yeah, I guess so.

541
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:56,931
That depends on what you want to do.

542
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,729
What do you want to do?

543
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:08,568
What do you recommend?

544
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,824
What do I recommend?

545
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:31,591
I'd rather not put it into words.

546
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:36,387
How about you just leave it up to me?

547
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:38,556
I'm in your hands.

548
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,812
And how does 150 sound?

549
00:48:44,813 --> 00:48:47,190
Sounds wonderful.

550
00:48:51,027 --> 00:48:54,823
Don't worry. I don't
keep track of the time.

551
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:03,206
Thank you.

552
00:49:03,415 --> 00:49:04,374
Prego, prego.

553
00:49:04,624 --> 00:49:06,751
- Grazie.
- You're welcome.

554
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,088
If I was Italian, he'd have
answered me in Italian.

555
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:53,840
Shall we?

556
00:50:11,483 --> 00:50:12,776
Excuse me.

557
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:28,208
Is everything all right?

558
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:35,090
I was just wondering if you
were going to be much longer?

559
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:41,346
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

560
00:50:42,138 --> 00:50:43,932
It could be awhile.

561
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,393
Any idea how long?

562
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:50,563
No, I don't really know.

563
00:50:50,939 --> 00:50:53,566
We're still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

564
00:50:55,568 --> 00:50:59,614
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now.

565
00:51:17,173 --> 00:51:20,760
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

566
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:41,656
Do you have to go?

567
00:51:42,907 --> 00:51:44,909
Do I have to go?

568
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:50,999
I think I do.

569
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,044
Are you sure?

570
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:03,094
Yes, I'm afraid so.

571
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:09,017
But listen, I want to pay you anyway.

572
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:13,688
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

573
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,862
But you know what? You don't
have to bother about that.

574
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:22,447
No, it's all right.

575
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:26,326
- No, really. You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

576
00:52:28,828 --> 00:52:29,746
Really?

577
00:52:32,207 --> 00:52:34,084
Well, thank you very much.

578
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:18,128
Thank you.

579
00:53:32,058 --> 00:53:35,228
Would you like a table,
or would you like to sit at the bar?

580
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:38,148
- I'd like a table.
- Please follow me.

581
00:53:45,947 --> 00:53:48,032
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

582
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,077
Could I get you anything to drink?

583
00:53:52,203 --> 00:53:54,456
- I'd like a beer.
- Certainly.

584
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,926
One, two, one-two-three-four.

585
00:54:08,136 --> 00:54:10,263
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

586
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,976
On the bass, Mr. Larry McVey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

587
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:19,105
And on the guitar,
the one, the only, Mr. Bobby Berman.

588
00:54:19,272 --> 00:54:23,318
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

589
00:54:23,568 --> 00:54:26,029
I'm Nick Nightingale. Good night.

590
00:54:35,997 --> 00:54:38,458
- Nick, that was great.
- Thanks.

591
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:42,003
- Nightingale.
- Hey, Bill, you made it.

592
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,590
I'm sorry, I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

593
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:48,718
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

594
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:52,388
- What are you drinking?
- A vodka and tonic, please.

595
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:54,891
Thank you.

596
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,770
So what brings you out at this hour?

597
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:02,023
- I have a patient in the neighborhood.
- You live in the Village?

598
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,026
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

599
00:55:05,193 --> 00:55:06,569
You're married?

600
00:55:07,153 --> 00:55:08,488
Nine years.

601
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,741
- Any kids?
- Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

602
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:12,951
How about you?

603
00:55:13,118 --> 00:55:15,662
I've got a wife
and four boys in Seattle.

604
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,163
You're a long way from home.

605
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:20,166
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

606
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:21,918
Thank you.

607
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:30,093
- Is this your band?
- No, it's a pick-up band.

608
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:34,180
- Who do you normally play with?
- Anybody, anywhere.

609
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,766
I got another gig later tonight.

610
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:38,810
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

611
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:40,645
They only get started around 2.

612
00:55:41,396 --> 00:55:42,564
In the Village?

613
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:47,986
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

614
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:49,362
You don't?

615
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:54,576
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

616
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:57,454
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

617
00:55:57,662 --> 00:56:00,206
- A different place every time?
- So far.

618
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,459
What's the big mystery?

619
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:06,337
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

620
00:56:09,883 --> 00:56:13,011
Nick, I'm sorry.
Is there something I'm missing here?

621
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:18,641
I play blindfolded.

622
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:20,852
What?

623
00:56:22,604 --> 00:56:25,106
I play blindfolded.

624
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,445
You're putting me on.

625
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,031
No, it's the truth.

626
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:38,411
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

627
00:56:40,705 --> 00:56:42,332
Oh, man.

628
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:47,629
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

629
00:56:47,962 --> 00:56:49,589
...but never...

630
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:52,258
...never anything like this...

631
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:55,887
...and never such women.

632
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:06,940
Excuse me.

633
00:57:10,652 --> 00:57:13,571
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

634
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,912
I know where that is.

635
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,129
Right.

636
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,467
Well, I'm on my way right now.

637
00:57:35,176 --> 00:57:37,595
Okay, sir. Thank you.

638
00:57:39,931 --> 00:57:41,182
What is this?

639
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:45,228
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

640
00:57:49,816 --> 00:57:51,401
It's the password.

641
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,570
The password?

642
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:58,283
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

643
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,954
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

644
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:11,629
You know there is no way on earth...

645
00:58:12,046 --> 00:58:15,425
...that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

646
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:19,554
- Come on, buddy, give me a break.
- Nick, I'll tell you what.

647
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:22,891
I've already got the password.

648
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:26,811
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

649
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:30,440
...and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

650
00:58:33,068 --> 00:58:37,030
Listen, let's just say
for one second...

651
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:40,075
...that I was prepared to do that.

652
00:58:40,408 --> 00:58:43,620
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

653
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:45,997
Why not?

654
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:50,585
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

655
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:54,881
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

656
00:59:14,025 --> 00:59:16,111
Thanks. Keep the change.

657
00:59:28,706 --> 00:59:30,875
Yes? Who is it?

658
00:59:31,084 --> 00:59:32,752
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

659
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:37,215
I apologize for disturbing you
at this hour, but I need your help.

660
00:59:38,299 --> 00:59:40,135
Who is it that you want?

661
00:59:41,636 --> 00:59:44,472
I'm very sorry.
I'm looking for Peter Grenning...

662
00:59:44,722 --> 00:59:47,100
...the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

663
00:59:49,144 --> 00:59:50,562
What's your name?

664
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:53,022
My name is Bill Harford.

665
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:55,316
I'm Mr. Grenning's doctor.

666
00:59:56,276 --> 00:59:58,111
You are Grenning's doctor?

667
01:00:01,156 --> 01:00:02,282
Okay.

668
01:00:02,824 --> 01:00:04,200
Just a moment.

669
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:20,759
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

670
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:22,510
Yes, I am.

671
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:26,681
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

672
01:00:27,432 --> 01:00:29,559
He moved to Chicago?

673
01:00:32,145 --> 01:00:34,105
I wasn't aware of that.

674
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:39,402
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

675
01:00:39,611 --> 01:00:41,154
Yes, I am.

676
01:00:41,613 --> 01:00:42,489
Well, first of all...

677
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:47,410
...please let me apologize again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr...

678
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:48,787
Milich.

679
01:00:48,953 --> 01:00:52,957
Mr. Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr. Harford...

680
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:56,044
...this is my New York State
Medical Board card.

681
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,756
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

682
01:00:59,964 --> 01:01:03,259
If I see Peter, I tell him
you were looking for him.

683
01:01:03,468 --> 01:01:05,470
Oh, no, wait. Please, please...

684
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:09,432
Listen, the reason that
I came here tonight was...

685
01:01:11,393 --> 01:01:16,147
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

686
01:01:16,564 --> 01:01:20,193
And I'd be happy to pay you
$ 100 over the rental price...

687
01:01:20,402 --> 01:01:22,028
...for the inconvenience.

688
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,989
A hundred dollars?

689
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:29,953
I don't think so.

690
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,083
How about $200?

691
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:38,128
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

692
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,682
Come in.

693
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:57,480
Can't be too careful these days.

694
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:01,693
Please.

695
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,115
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

696
01:02:10,034 --> 01:02:14,789
I need a tux, a cloak with a hood
and a mask.

697
01:02:15,248 --> 01:02:18,168
A cloak with a hood and a mask?

698
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,340
I think we'll find something for you.

699
01:02:25,049 --> 01:02:26,634
Follow me, please.

700
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:28,136
Good.

701
01:02:36,728 --> 01:02:38,813
Looks like alive, huh?

702
01:02:40,482 --> 01:02:42,400
- It's wonderful.
- Come.

703
01:02:43,401 --> 01:02:45,612
So what color cloak?

704
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,656
Red, brown, red?

705
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:50,992
Black.

706
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:54,621
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

707
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:57,332
- I don't think so.
- Clowns, officers, pirates?

708
01:02:57,582 --> 01:03:00,085
No, just the tux, the black cloak -

709
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:02,462
With a hood and a mask.

710
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:06,257
May I take your coat?

711
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:11,221
- You are medicine doctor, yes?
- Yes, I am.

712
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:15,809
- I have some problem with my hair.
- Your hair?

713
01:03:16,017 --> 01:03:17,977
It's starting to fall down too fast.

714
01:03:18,186 --> 01:03:20,980
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

715
01:03:21,189 --> 01:03:23,108
Look at this. Here.

716
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:25,443
You see?

717
01:03:26,111 --> 01:03:27,237
And?

718
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:30,240
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

719
01:03:30,448 --> 01:03:32,367
What? You can't help me?

720
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:35,995
No. You should see a trichologist.
It's a hair specialist.

721
01:03:36,204 --> 01:03:39,707
Mr. Milich, I've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

722
01:03:39,874 --> 01:03:41,543
So if you don't mind -

723
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:43,711
I'm in hurry too, to get back to bed.

724
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,171
I understand.

725
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:47,632
So black cloak?

726
01:03:52,387 --> 01:03:53,721
Did you hear something?

727
01:03:56,891 --> 01:03:58,393
What is this?

728
01:04:07,736 --> 01:04:09,446
What is it?

729
01:04:14,325 --> 01:04:16,202
What is this?

730
01:04:29,382 --> 01:04:31,926
What on earth is going on here?!

731
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:34,179
Milich, I can explain everything.

732
01:04:34,387 --> 01:04:36,556
You! What are you doing here?

733
01:04:36,765 --> 01:04:38,475
I promise I'll kill you!

734
01:04:38,725 --> 01:04:42,437
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

735
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:46,274
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?!

736
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:49,986
Milich, are you crazy? We were
invited here by the young lady.

737
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:54,365
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

738
01:04:54,616 --> 01:04:57,243
- You will have to explain to police!
- To the police?!

739
01:04:57,452 --> 01:05:00,163
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

740
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:03,792
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

741
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,086
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

742
01:05:06,294 --> 01:05:10,090
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

743
01:05:10,298 --> 01:05:12,300
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

744
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:14,094
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

745
01:05:14,302 --> 01:05:16,971
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

746
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,682
You will please stay here
until I return.

747
01:05:19,891 --> 01:05:21,434
Let us out of here!

748
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,478
That's out of the question.

749
01:05:23,728 --> 01:05:27,190
Doctor, sorry.
What color did you say?

750
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:28,942
- Black?
- Black.

751
01:05:29,484 --> 01:05:32,987
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

752
01:05:33,154 --> 01:05:35,323
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

753
01:05:35,573 --> 01:05:36,449
Sorry.

754
01:05:36,991 --> 01:05:40,412
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

755
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,956
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

756
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,334
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

757
01:07:28,853 --> 01:07:30,897
Okay, that's $74.50.

758
01:07:31,606 --> 01:07:35,235
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

759
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:37,862
There's 80.

760
01:07:38,279 --> 01:07:41,032
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

761
01:07:43,243 --> 01:07:46,538
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

762
01:07:46,746 --> 01:07:48,206
Just let the meter run.

763
01:07:48,415 --> 01:07:51,668
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

764
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:54,379
- Okay?
- How long you gonna be?

765
01:07:54,629 --> 01:07:57,799
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 10 minutes.

766
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:00,844
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

767
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:19,320
Good evening, sir.

768
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:21,489
Good evening.

769
01:08:22,073 --> 01:08:23,408
Can we be of any help?

770
01:08:25,076 --> 01:08:26,911
I suppose you'd like the password.

771
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,705
If you'd like, sir.

772
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:29,831
Fidelio.

773
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:33,001
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

774
01:09:11,456 --> 01:09:13,041
Good evening, sir.

775
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,584
Good evening.

776
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:16,377
Password, sir?

777
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:18,129
Fidelio.

778
01:09:18,671 --> 01:09:20,090
Thank you, sir.

779
01:15:10,565 --> 01:15:13,234
I'm not sure what you
think you're doing.

780
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:15,570
But you don't belong here.

781
01:15:16,362 --> 01:15:21,076
I'm sorry, but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.

782
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:27,248
Please! Don't be foolish.

783
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:29,626
You must go now.

784
01:15:34,214 --> 01:15:35,423
Who are you?

785
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:37,717
It doesn't matter who I am.

786
01:15:38,426 --> 01:15:40,553
You are in great danger.

787
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:44,140
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

788
01:15:48,269 --> 01:15:51,189
Would you be so good
as to excuse us for a moment?

789
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:45,155
Have you been enjoying yourself?

790
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:50,493
Well, I've had a very
interesting look around.

791
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:56,416
Do you want to go somewhere
a little more private?

792
01:18:59,711 --> 01:19:00,670
Private?

793
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:04,924
That might be a good idea.

794
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:09,679
Here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

795
01:19:11,473 --> 01:19:13,475
May I borrow him
for just a few minutes?

796
01:19:13,725 --> 01:19:16,102
I promise to bring him right back.

797
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:28,656
I don't think you realize
the danger you're in now.

798
01:19:28,865 --> 01:19:30,825
You can't fool them for much longer.

799
01:19:30,992 --> 01:19:33,870
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

800
01:19:35,747 --> 01:19:37,749
Why are you telling me this?

801
01:19:37,957 --> 01:19:39,751
It doesn't matter.

802
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,044
Who are you?

803
01:19:42,712 --> 01:19:46,716
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

804
01:19:48,426 --> 01:19:49,969
Will you come with me?

805
01:19:50,178 --> 01:19:51,846
That's impossible.

806
01:19:52,055 --> 01:19:53,056
Why?

807
01:19:53,264 --> 01:19:57,310
Because it would cost me my life
and possibly yours.

808
01:19:58,645 --> 01:20:00,230
Let me see your face.

809
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:02,941
Go!

810
01:20:05,068 --> 01:20:06,611
Excuse me, sir.

811
01:20:09,656 --> 01:20:12,951
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

812
01:20:14,327 --> 01:20:15,453
Yes.

813
01:20:15,703 --> 01:20:19,749
Your driver's at the front door and
would urgently like a word with you.

814
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:22,729
Please, come forward.

815
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:56,846
May I have the password, please?

816
01:21:58,056 --> 01:21:59,766
Fidelio.

817
01:22:02,477 --> 01:22:05,897
That's right, sir.
That is the password...

818
01:22:06,022 --> 01:22:07,774
...for admittance.

819
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:13,196
But may I ask, what is the password
for the house?

820
01:22:18,576 --> 01:22:21,413
The password for the house?

821
01:22:32,298 --> 01:22:33,800
I'm sorry, I...

822
01:22:40,181 --> 01:22:41,683
I seem to have...

823
01:22:43,309 --> 01:22:44,811
...forgotten it.

824
01:22:46,521 --> 01:22:48,815
That's unfortunate.

825
01:22:49,566 --> 01:22:54,320
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

826
01:22:54,738 --> 01:22:57,282
...or if you never knew it.

827
01:22:58,533 --> 01:23:02,412
You will kindly remove your mask.

828
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:23,349
Now...

829
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:25,518
...get undressed.

830
01:23:31,649 --> 01:23:34,819
Get undressed?

831
01:23:35,945 --> 01:23:38,990
Remove your clothes.

832
01:23:50,126 --> 01:23:53,254
Gentlemen, please...

833
01:23:56,007 --> 01:23:58,635
Remove your clothes.

834
01:23:58,843 --> 01:24:02,514
Or would you like us to do it for you?

835
01:24:04,015 --> 01:24:05,100
Stop!

836
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:13,400
Let him go.

837
01:24:15,318 --> 01:24:16,945
Take me!

838
01:24:18,405 --> 01:24:21,866
I am ready to redeem him.

839
01:24:27,747 --> 01:24:31,334
You are ready to redeem him?

840
01:24:33,253 --> 01:24:34,671
Yes.

841
01:24:37,507 --> 01:24:41,428
Are you sure you understand
what you're taking upon yourself...

842
01:24:41,761 --> 01:24:43,680
...in doing this?

843
01:24:52,731 --> 01:24:54,065
Very well.

844
01:24:59,028 --> 01:25:00,697
You are free.

845
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:04,159
But I warn you...

846
01:25:04,784 --> 01:25:07,162
...if you make any further inquiries...

847
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:11,207
...or if you say a single word
to anyone...

848
01:25:11,416 --> 01:25:14,002
...about what you have seen...

849
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:18,548
...there will be the most
dire consequences for you...

850
01:25:18,757 --> 01:25:20,675
...and your family.

851
01:25:22,343 --> 01:25:24,387
Do you understand?

852
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:04,969
What is going to happen to that woman?

853
01:26:05,762 --> 01:26:08,681
No one can change her fate now.

854
01:26:09,557 --> 01:26:12,102
When a promise has been made here...

855
01:26:12,977 --> 01:26:15,355
...there is no turning back.

856
01:26:16,564 --> 01:26:17,816
Go!

857
01:28:22,524 --> 01:28:23,942
It's okay.

858
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:26,486
I'm sorry.

859
01:28:27,028 --> 01:28:31,366
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

860
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:33,326
Oh, God.

861
01:28:34,369 --> 01:28:37,163
I just had such a horrible dream.

862
01:28:38,873 --> 01:28:40,417
What time is it?

863
01:28:40,834 --> 01:28:42,669
It's a little after 4.

864
01:28:45,255 --> 01:28:47,173
Did you just get home?

865
01:28:49,759 --> 01:28:53,388
It took longer than I thought.

866
01:28:53,763 --> 01:28:55,849
You must be exhausted.

867
01:28:56,433 --> 01:28:59,686
Come on, lie down.

868
01:29:08,069 --> 01:29:09,779
What were you dreaming?

869
01:29:15,702 --> 01:29:18,496
Just these weird things.

870
01:29:18,788 --> 01:29:20,165
What was it?

871
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:26,254
It was so weird.

872
01:29:28,757 --> 01:29:29,966
Tell me.

873
01:29:50,236 --> 01:29:53,281
We were in a deserted city...

874
01:29:58,078 --> 01:30:00,455
...and our clothes were gone.

875
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:04,125
We were naked...

876
01:30:09,422 --> 01:30:12,008
...and I was terrified...

877
01:30:16,805 --> 01:30:19,140
...and I felt ashamed.

878
01:30:20,183 --> 01:30:21,768
Oh, God...

879
01:30:25,939 --> 01:30:29,818
And I was angry because
I thought it was your fault.

880
01:30:32,278 --> 01:30:36,449
You rushed away to go
find clothes for us.

881
01:30:40,703 --> 01:30:44,499
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

882
01:30:48,586 --> 01:30:50,505
I felt wonderful.

883
01:30:54,801 --> 01:30:59,305
Then I was lying
in a beautiful garden...

884
01:30:59,806 --> 01:31:02,851
...stretched out naked
in the sunlight...

885
01:31:07,564 --> 01:31:10,358
...and a man walked out of the woods.

886
01:31:14,404 --> 01:31:18,533
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

887
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:22,871
The naval officer.

888
01:31:27,584 --> 01:31:29,711
He stared at me...

889
01:31:34,466 --> 01:31:36,509
...and then he just laughed.

890
01:31:39,345 --> 01:31:41,389
He just laughed at me.

891
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,782
But that's not the end...

892
01:31:59,824 --> 01:32:00,950
...is it?

893
01:32:06,539 --> 01:32:08,750
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

894
01:32:14,422 --> 01:32:16,299
It's too awful.

895
01:32:18,051 --> 01:32:19,844
It's only a dream.

896
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:46,287
He was kissing me...

897
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:55,171
...and then we were making love.

898
01:32:59,968 --> 01:33:03,346
Then there were all these
other people around us...

899
01:33:03,513 --> 01:33:06,266
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

900
01:33:06,433 --> 01:33:08,893
Everyone was fucking.

901
01:33:14,482 --> 01:33:15,984
And then I...

902
01:33:18,945 --> 01:33:21,322
I was fucking other men.

903
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:23,658
So many...

904
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,871
...I don't know how many I was with.

905
01:33:30,874 --> 01:33:35,587
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

906
01:33:38,339 --> 01:33:41,092
...just fucking all these men.

907
01:33:45,388 --> 01:33:47,974
I wanted to make fun of you...

908
01:33:49,642 --> 01:33:51,978
...to laugh in your face.

909
01:33:55,148 --> 01:33:59,903
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

910
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:16,461
That must have been
when you woke me up.

911
01:34:58,878 --> 01:35:00,296
Shit!

912
01:35:35,832 --> 01:35:37,834
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

913
01:35:45,008 --> 01:35:46,217
Anything else?

914
01:35:47,469 --> 01:35:49,137
No, thank you.

915
01:35:55,643 --> 01:35:57,020
Excuse me.

916
01:35:57,979 --> 01:36:01,024
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Café?

917
01:36:01,191 --> 01:36:04,486
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

918
01:36:08,865 --> 01:36:13,161
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

919
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:16,206
He's playing piano
over there right now.

920
01:36:16,498 --> 01:36:17,916
Nick Nightingale?

921
01:36:18,333 --> 01:36:20,794
Sure, he comes in here.

922
01:36:23,505 --> 01:36:26,174
Look, maybe you can help me...

923
01:36:26,383 --> 01:36:29,844
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

924
01:36:31,012 --> 01:36:32,680
Do you know where he's staying?

925
01:36:36,226 --> 01:36:39,187
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

926
01:36:39,354 --> 01:36:41,648
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

927
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:44,275
I'm actually an old friend of his.

928
01:36:45,819 --> 01:36:47,237
Well, doctor...

929
01:36:49,656 --> 01:36:53,118
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

930
01:36:55,995 --> 01:36:57,831
To be perfectly honest...

931
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:01,710
...it's a medical matter.

932
01:37:02,127 --> 01:37:06,256
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

933
01:37:32,407 --> 01:37:33,283
Excuse me.

934
01:37:34,909 --> 01:37:37,036
Hi! How can I help you?

935
01:37:37,245 --> 01:37:40,832
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

936
01:37:41,374 --> 01:37:44,836
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

937
01:37:45,086 --> 01:37:46,546
He checked out?

938
01:37:50,467 --> 01:37:54,220
- Did he leave a forwarding address?
- No, I'm afraid not.

939
01:37:55,472 --> 01:37:57,265
When did he check out?

940
01:37:58,683 --> 01:38:00,560
About 5:00 this morning.

941
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:02,103
5:00?

942
01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:05,565
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

943
01:38:05,774 --> 01:38:08,443
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

944
01:38:12,363 --> 01:38:15,158
Did you notice anything...

945
01:38:15,492 --> 01:38:16,910
...I don't know...

946
01:38:17,535 --> 01:38:20,455
...unusual about him when he left?

947
01:38:22,373 --> 01:38:23,750
Unusual?

948
01:38:25,251 --> 01:38:27,170
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

949
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:29,964
No, I'm an old friend of his.

950
01:38:30,173 --> 01:38:31,257
Really?

951
01:38:31,674 --> 01:38:33,134
I'm a doctor.

952
01:38:36,304 --> 01:38:40,433
- Well, Bill...?
- Sure.

953
01:38:42,727 --> 01:38:45,522
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

954
01:38:45,772 --> 01:38:48,983
...because there was something
a little strange...

955
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:51,569
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

956
01:38:51,903 --> 01:38:54,155
Really? What was that?

957
01:39:01,996 --> 01:39:06,376
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a.m...

958
01:39:06,918 --> 01:39:08,753
...with two men.

959
01:39:09,713 --> 01:39:11,381
Big guys.

960
01:39:11,881 --> 01:39:14,718
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

961
01:39:14,926 --> 01:39:18,430
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

962
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,390
...if you know what I mean.

963
01:39:23,059 --> 01:39:24,436
Anyways...

964
01:39:25,729 --> 01:39:30,275
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

965
01:39:31,025 --> 01:39:35,739
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

966
01:39:36,698 --> 01:39:37,824
Scared?

967
01:39:40,452 --> 01:39:41,995
He said he wanted to check out.

968
01:39:42,203 --> 01:39:45,957
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

969
01:39:46,249 --> 01:39:49,961
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

970
01:39:50,670 --> 01:39:54,674
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

971
01:39:54,883 --> 01:39:56,509
But they saw it and took it...

972
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,512
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

973
01:39:59,763 --> 01:40:04,142
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

974
01:40:04,934 --> 01:40:07,312
And then they just
took him off in a car.

975
01:40:08,563 --> 01:40:10,815
Do you have any idea where they went?

976
01:40:11,191 --> 01:40:13,026
No, not a clue.

977
01:40:24,662 --> 01:40:26,748
I certainly appreciate your help.

978
01:40:26,915 --> 01:40:28,500
Anytime, Bill.

979
01:41:03,076 --> 01:41:05,745
Oh, the good doctor!

980
01:41:07,372 --> 01:41:12,127
- Was your outfit a success?
- Yes, it was. Thank you.

981
01:41:12,669 --> 01:41:13,878
Good, good.

982
01:41:14,087 --> 01:41:18,883
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

983
01:41:21,386 --> 01:41:24,973
I think you forgot the mask.

984
01:41:26,224 --> 01:41:27,642
It's not there?

985
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,020
Maybe you left it at the party?

986
01:41:35,859 --> 01:41:37,360
I don't think so.

987
01:41:39,237 --> 01:41:42,657
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

988
01:41:42,866 --> 01:41:43,825
Sure.

989
01:41:47,912 --> 01:41:49,748
Here we are.

990
01:41:51,207 --> 01:41:55,128
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

991
01:41:55,336 --> 01:41:58,631
...25 for the mask. Sorry...

992
01:42:01,301 --> 01:42:02,886
Three hundred seventy-five.

993
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:06,639
Yes, dear?

994
01:42:06,973 --> 01:42:08,349
Come, come.

995
01:42:09,559 --> 01:42:12,395
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

996
01:42:21,321 --> 01:42:24,032
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

997
01:42:24,949 --> 01:42:26,785
Goodbye, gentlemen.

998
01:42:27,035 --> 01:42:30,163
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
- And you too.

999
01:42:31,081 --> 01:42:33,249
Well, Dr. Harford...

1000
01:42:34,459 --> 01:42:35,960
...here is your receipt.

1001
01:42:37,253 --> 01:42:39,422
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1002
01:42:40,548 --> 01:42:42,759
...and thanks for the business.

1003
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:50,350
Mr. Milich, last night...

1004
01:42:53,019 --> 01:42:55,313
...you were going to call the police.

1005
01:42:56,815 --> 01:43:00,735
Things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1006
01:43:00,944 --> 01:43:05,698
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1007
01:43:06,282 --> 01:43:07,951
...anything at all...

1008
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:11,371
...it needn't be a costume.

1009
01:43:37,731 --> 01:43:38,940
Come in.

1010
01:43:40,567 --> 01:43:43,194
- Tuna salad and black coffee.
- Thanks.

1011
01:43:44,195 --> 01:43:47,115
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1012
01:43:47,323 --> 01:43:52,078
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1013
01:43:52,454 --> 01:43:56,499
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not going to be able to see them.

1014
01:43:56,750 --> 01:44:00,253
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1015
01:44:00,462 --> 01:44:02,297
- ... and make new appointments.
- Sure.

1016
01:44:02,714 --> 01:44:06,634
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1017
01:44:06,843 --> 01:44:08,136
No problem.

1018
01:47:48,481 --> 01:47:51,067
Any calls for me?

1019
01:47:51,234 --> 01:47:55,029
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1020
01:47:56,281 --> 01:47:58,658
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, Daddy.

1021
01:47:59,492 --> 01:48:01,369
Look, I got all these right.

1022
01:48:01,578 --> 01:48:03,496
You got all of those right?

1023
01:48:03,997 --> 01:48:05,707
Every single one of them?

1024
01:48:06,041 --> 01:48:07,292
That's good.

1025
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,002
You hungry?

1026
01:48:10,045 --> 01:48:11,337
Sort of.

1027
01:48:11,546 --> 01:48:13,256
Want to eat at 7?

1028
01:48:13,465 --> 01:48:15,675
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1029
01:48:15,884 --> 01:48:19,679
I have some appointments
at the office.

1030
01:48:19,888 --> 01:48:21,848
You have to go out again tonight?

1031
01:48:22,057 --> 01:48:23,016
I'm afraid so.

1032
01:48:23,224 --> 01:48:26,561
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1033
01:48:27,187 --> 01:48:29,522
We'll see about that, okay?

1034
01:48:32,025 --> 01:48:34,027
He could be a watchdog...

1035
01:48:34,194 --> 01:48:35,653
We'll see.

1036
01:48:35,862 --> 01:48:38,490
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1037
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:42,160
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1038
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:46,790
And Mike has $ 1.75.

1039
01:48:46,998 --> 01:48:50,543
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1040
01:48:50,710 --> 01:48:52,962
$0.75?

1041
01:48:54,798 --> 01:48:58,051
So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

1042
01:49:01,638 --> 01:49:04,766
"How much more" means that
it would be a subtraction.

1043
01:49:04,974 --> 01:49:07,894
Yeah, because you're going
to be taking. Right.

1044
01:49:08,186 --> 01:49:11,314
And there were all these
other people around us.

1045
01:49:11,689 --> 01:49:14,067
Hundreds of them, everywhere.

1046
01:49:14,526 --> 01:49:16,694
Everyone was fucking.

1047
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:20,949
And then I...
I was fucking other men.

1048
01:49:22,242 --> 01:49:23,868
So many...

1049
01:49:24,285 --> 01:49:27,122
...I don't know how many I was with.

1050
01:51:00,632 --> 01:51:03,259
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1051
01:51:32,664 --> 01:51:33,498
What is it?

1052
01:51:33,748 --> 01:51:34,874
Domino?

1053
01:51:35,208 --> 01:51:37,001
No, she's not in.

1054
01:51:40,797 --> 01:51:42,924
Are you expecting her back soon?

1055
01:51:43,133 --> 01:51:44,551
No, I'm not.

1056
01:51:50,932 --> 01:51:54,227
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

1057
01:51:55,061 --> 01:51:56,271
Just a minute.

1058
01:52:03,069 --> 01:52:04,779
Can I say who it's from?

1059
01:52:06,197 --> 01:52:08,491
Well, just tell her it's from...

1060
01:52:09,492 --> 01:52:10,452
...Bill.

1061
01:52:10,994 --> 01:52:12,203
You're Bill?

1062
01:52:13,747 --> 01:52:17,584
The Bill? You're the doctor
who was here last night?

1063
01:52:18,585 --> 01:52:20,920
Well, I suppose I am.

1064
01:52:21,254 --> 01:52:23,465
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1065
01:52:24,716 --> 01:52:25,759
Did she?

1066
01:52:28,470 --> 01:52:30,430
Why don't you come in for a second?

1067
01:52:33,349 --> 01:52:34,350
Sure.

1068
01:52:54,245 --> 01:52:55,705
I'm Sally.

1069
01:52:56,414 --> 01:52:58,208
Hello, Sally.

1070
01:53:01,127 --> 01:53:05,924
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

1071
01:53:09,344 --> 01:53:11,221
I have no idea.

1072
01:53:12,097 --> 01:53:14,015
You have no idea?

1073
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:24,067
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

1074
01:53:26,194 --> 01:53:28,947
She may not even be coming back?

1075
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,926
I...

1076
01:53:53,221 --> 01:53:54,305
You...?

1077
01:53:54,514 --> 01:53:58,727
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

1078
01:53:59,185 --> 01:54:00,270
Really?

1079
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:04,649
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

1080
01:54:04,858 --> 01:54:08,027
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

1081
01:54:11,906 --> 01:54:14,075
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1082
01:54:19,497 --> 01:54:22,250
Why don't you have a seat?

1083
01:54:22,917 --> 01:54:24,669
Let's sit down.

1084
01:54:40,143 --> 01:54:44,272
- I don't quite know how to say this.
- You don't quite know how?

1085
01:54:48,485 --> 01:54:52,113
Well, considering that you
were with Domino last night...

1086
01:54:54,574 --> 01:54:58,828
...I think it would be only fair to you
to let you know...

1087
01:55:01,790 --> 01:55:04,959
...that she got the results
of a blood test this morning...

1088
01:55:05,168 --> 01:55:08,296
...and it was HIV-positive.

1089
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:20,642
HIV-positive?

1090
01:55:35,448 --> 01:55:40,120
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1091
01:55:47,043 --> 01:55:49,921
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1092
01:56:02,392 --> 01:56:05,019
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1093
01:56:05,478 --> 01:56:07,313
A cup of coffee maybe?

1094
01:56:15,655 --> 01:56:16,990
No, thank you.

1095
01:56:21,578 --> 01:56:23,079
I think...

1096
01:56:24,372 --> 01:56:26,207
...maybe I'd better be going.

1097
01:58:10,687 --> 01:58:12,230
- Taxi!
- Off duty.

1098
01:59:57,544 --> 02:00:00,463
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1099
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:02,382
I'll bring it over to you.

1100
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:03,675
Thank you.

1101
02:01:39,646 --> 02:01:40,897
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1102
02:01:41,106 --> 02:01:42,482
I'm Dr. Harford.

1103
02:01:42,732 --> 02:01:46,903
One of my patients was admitted
this morning. Miss Amanda Curran.

1104
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:49,072
Could you please
give me her room number?

1105
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,951
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

1106
02:01:53,284 --> 02:01:55,787
Curran. Amanda Curran.

1107
02:01:55,954 --> 02:01:58,039
C-U-R-R-A-N?

1108
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:04,212
Miss Amanda Curran?

1109
02:02:04,963 --> 02:02:06,214
That's right.

1110
02:02:06,923 --> 02:02:10,260
I'm sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

1111
02:02:14,139 --> 02:02:15,932
She died this afternoon?

1112
02:02:16,307 --> 02:02:19,477
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

1113
02:02:19,936 --> 02:02:21,312
I'm sorry.

1114
02:03:07,525 --> 02:03:10,070
Because it could cost me my life...

1115
02:03:10,987 --> 02:03:12,947
...and possibly yours.

1116
02:04:54,466 --> 02:04:56,176
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

1117
02:04:58,261 --> 02:04:59,471
Tonight?

1118
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:02,223
No, no, that's okay.

1119
02:05:06,144 --> 02:05:09,022
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

1120
02:05:31,669 --> 02:05:32,921
Come in.

1121
02:05:34,881 --> 02:05:38,468
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

1122
02:05:38,718 --> 02:05:41,346
- Let me have your coat.
- I was out anyway. Thank you.

1123
02:05:41,513 --> 02:05:42,889
How about a drink?

1124
02:05:43,390 --> 02:05:45,225
- Are you having one?
- Sure.

1125
02:05:45,642 --> 02:05:47,018
What would you like?

1126
02:05:47,435 --> 02:05:48,686
Just a little scotch.

1127
02:05:48,895 --> 02:05:49,896
Good.

1128
02:05:51,815 --> 02:05:52,941
How do you take it? Neat?

1129
02:05:53,149 --> 02:05:54,192
Please.

1130
02:05:55,902 --> 02:05:57,987
That was a terrific party
the other night.

1131
02:05:58,154 --> 02:06:01,825
- Alice and I had a wonderful time.
- Well, good.

1132
02:06:02,742 --> 02:06:04,452
It was great seeing you both.

1133
02:06:04,661 --> 02:06:06,037
Cheers.

1134
02:06:06,746 --> 02:06:08,081
Were you playing?

1135
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:11,710
No, I was just
knocking a few balls around.

1136
02:06:12,877 --> 02:06:15,505
- Beautiful scotch.
- That's a 25-year-old.

1137
02:06:15,714 --> 02:06:18,091
- I'll send you over a case.
- No, please.

1138
02:06:18,299 --> 02:06:19,259
Why not?

1139
02:06:22,554 --> 02:06:24,639
You feel like playing?

1140
02:06:24,848 --> 02:06:28,059
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

1141
02:06:30,478 --> 02:06:31,896
I was just...

1142
02:06:34,566 --> 02:06:35,650
Listen...

1143
02:06:41,990 --> 02:06:46,745
The reason I asked you
to come over is...

1144
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:50,874
...I need to talk to you
about something.

1145
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:52,917
Sure.

1146
02:06:56,004 --> 02:06:57,589
It's a little bit awkward.

1147
02:07:00,133 --> 02:07:02,886
And I have to be completely frank.

1148
02:07:05,013 --> 02:07:06,973
What kind of problem are you having?

1149
02:07:11,394 --> 02:07:13,396
It isn't a medical problem.

1150
02:07:18,902 --> 02:07:20,195
Actually...

1151
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:23,907
...it concerns you.

1152
02:07:36,419 --> 02:07:39,339
I know what happened last night.

1153
02:07:43,176 --> 02:07:46,638
And I know what's been
going on since then.

1154
02:07:51,142 --> 02:07:54,312
And I think you just might...

1155
02:07:55,688 --> 02:07:58,983
...have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

1156
02:08:11,746 --> 02:08:14,082
I'm sorry, Victor, I...

1157
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,087
What in the hell
are you talking about?

1158
02:08:21,131 --> 02:08:23,675
Please, Bill, no games.

1159
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:27,178
I was there.

1160
02:08:29,055 --> 02:08:30,515
At the house.

1161
02:08:33,977 --> 02:08:36,938
I saw everything that went on.

1162
02:08:48,324 --> 02:08:52,120
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1163
02:08:55,665 --> 02:08:58,835
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1164
02:08:59,961 --> 02:09:01,588
...how you'd heard about it...

1165
02:09:01,755 --> 02:09:05,258
...let alone got yourself
through the door.

1166
02:09:08,928 --> 02:09:13,683
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

1167
02:09:13,892 --> 02:09:17,020
...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1168
02:09:17,937 --> 02:09:20,815
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1169
02:09:25,070 --> 02:09:26,863
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1170
02:09:28,573 --> 02:09:30,033
It was mine.

1171
02:09:30,492 --> 02:09:32,410
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1172
02:09:32,786 --> 02:09:36,122
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1173
02:09:36,331 --> 02:09:38,917
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

1174
02:09:39,125 --> 02:09:41,961
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

1175
02:09:49,344 --> 02:09:51,179
What can I say?

1176
02:09:57,268 --> 02:09:58,520
I had...

1177
02:09:59,979 --> 02:10:01,481
...absolutely...

1178
02:10:02,357 --> 02:10:06,861
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

1179
02:10:08,196 --> 02:10:10,198
I know you didn't, Bill.

1180
02:10:12,033 --> 02:10:13,993
But I also know that you...

1181
02:10:14,953 --> 02:10:17,455
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

1182
02:10:17,706 --> 02:10:19,374
...and talked to the desk clerk.

1183
02:10:20,875 --> 02:10:22,460
How do you know that?

1184
02:10:24,379 --> 02:10:26,339
Because I had you followed.

1185
02:10:32,011 --> 02:10:33,638
You had me followed?

1186
02:10:35,932 --> 02:10:38,184
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1187
02:10:38,518 --> 02:10:40,353
All right? I owe you an apology.

1188
02:10:40,562 --> 02:10:43,189
This was for your own good, believe me.

1189
02:10:43,565 --> 02:10:47,402
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1190
02:10:47,652 --> 02:10:50,739
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1191
02:10:51,072 --> 02:10:54,743
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1192
02:10:55,243 --> 02:10:57,078
...banging Mrs. Nick.

1193
02:10:58,371 --> 02:11:01,499
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1194
02:11:03,501 --> 02:11:06,546
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1195
02:11:07,589 --> 02:11:10,425
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1196
02:11:11,217 --> 02:11:15,180
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1197
02:11:16,514 --> 02:11:18,558
Who do you think those people were?

1198
02:11:19,225 --> 02:11:21,269
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1199
02:11:21,436 --> 02:11:24,647
If I told you their names -
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1200
02:11:24,856 --> 02:11:28,443
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1201
02:11:31,946 --> 02:11:33,990
Was it the second password?

1202
02:11:35,283 --> 02:11:36,951
Is that what gave me away?

1203
02:11:38,995 --> 02:11:41,164
Yes, finally.

1204
02:11:43,166 --> 02:11:45,418
But not because you didn't know it.

1205
02:11:47,253 --> 02:11:50,048
It's because there was
no second password.

1206
02:11:51,216 --> 02:11:55,512
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1207
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:58,139
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1208
02:11:58,390 --> 02:12:01,935
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1209
02:12:02,143 --> 02:12:05,146
...made out to you-know-who.

1210
02:12:22,122 --> 02:12:25,458
There was a woman there...

1211
02:12:31,005 --> 02:12:32,716
...who tried to warn me.

1212
02:12:38,179 --> 02:12:39,389
I know.

1213
02:12:44,894 --> 02:12:46,563
Do you know who she was?

1214
02:12:59,993 --> 02:13:01,661
She was a hooker.

1215
02:13:10,795 --> 02:13:12,422
Sorry, but...

1216
02:13:13,548 --> 02:13:15,467
...that's what she was.

1217
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:20,805
A hooker.

1218
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:37,405
Suppose I told you...

1219
02:13:38,990 --> 02:13:41,826
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1220
02:13:43,244 --> 02:13:47,207
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1221
02:13:47,415 --> 02:13:50,043
...her last-minute intervention...

1222
02:13:50,251 --> 02:13:53,880
...suppose I said that all of that...

1223
02:13:55,215 --> 02:13:57,759
...was staged.

1224
02:13:59,803 --> 02:14:03,515
That it was a kind of charade.

1225
02:14:05,058 --> 02:14:06,935
That it was fake.

1226
02:14:11,314 --> 02:14:12,649
Fake?

1227
02:14:14,317 --> 02:14:16,820
Yes. Fake.

1228
02:14:27,831 --> 02:14:29,708
Why would they do that?

1229
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:31,710
Why?

1230
02:14:32,919 --> 02:14:34,546
In plain words...

1231
02:14:35,422 --> 02:14:37,841
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1232
02:14:38,967 --> 02:14:42,262
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1233
02:14:42,721 --> 02:14:44,389
...and what you'd seen.

1234
02:15:03,658 --> 02:15:05,160
Have you seen this?

1235
02:15:21,801 --> 02:15:23,720
Yes, I have.

1236
02:15:28,975 --> 02:15:31,978
I saw her body in the morgue.

1237
02:15:40,403 --> 02:15:43,490
Was she the woman at the party?

1238
02:15:55,293 --> 02:15:56,669
She was.

1239
02:16:10,350 --> 02:16:12,852
The woman lying dead in the morgue...

1240
02:16:14,771 --> 02:16:16,564
...was the woman at the party.

1241
02:16:24,906 --> 02:16:29,577
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1242
02:16:30,412 --> 02:16:33,790
You called it a fake, a charade.

1243
02:16:35,333 --> 02:16:38,586
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1244
02:16:38,795 --> 02:16:42,507
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1245
02:16:48,179 --> 02:16:52,600
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1246
02:16:52,809 --> 02:16:55,478
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1247
02:16:55,729 --> 02:16:59,065
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1248
02:17:00,233 --> 02:17:03,778
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1249
02:17:03,987 --> 02:17:08,366
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1250
02:17:08,575 --> 02:17:12,037
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1251
02:17:12,245 --> 02:17:15,165
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1252
02:17:16,541 --> 02:17:20,754
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1253
02:17:21,379 --> 02:17:23,006
...and the rest is in the paper.

1254
02:17:23,214 --> 02:17:26,760
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1255
02:17:26,968 --> 02:17:31,014
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1256
02:17:32,348 --> 02:17:37,103
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1257
02:17:37,395 --> 02:17:39,022
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1258
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:42,942
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1259
02:17:59,125 --> 02:18:03,088
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1260
02:18:03,505 --> 02:18:06,049
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1261
02:18:07,467 --> 02:18:09,677
But life goes on.

1262
02:18:10,095 --> 02:18:11,429
It always does...

1263
02:18:11,679 --> 02:18:13,098
...until it doesn't.

1264
02:18:14,641 --> 02:18:16,434
But you know that, don't you?

1265
02:21:32,714 --> 02:21:35,133
I'll tell you everything.

1266
02:21:40,346 --> 02:21:42,515
I'll tell you everything.

1267
02:22:32,232 --> 02:22:34,359
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1268
02:22:50,583 --> 02:22:54,671
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1269
02:23:18,445 --> 02:23:19,487
That's nice.

1270
02:23:19,738 --> 02:23:22,198
I could put Sabrina in here.

1271
02:23:22,949 --> 02:23:25,243
It's really pretty.

1272
02:23:25,452 --> 02:23:27,370
It's old-fashioned.

1273
02:23:36,129 --> 02:23:37,338
He's big.

1274
02:23:37,547 --> 02:23:40,800
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1275
02:23:41,009 --> 02:23:42,218
You do?

1276
02:23:44,471 --> 02:23:46,514
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1277
02:24:00,111 --> 02:24:02,072
What do you think we should do?

1278
02:24:07,035 --> 02:24:08,453
What do I think we should do?

1279
02:24:08,703 --> 02:24:09,913
Look, Mommy!

1280
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:21,466
What do I think?
I don't know.

1281
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:25,261
I mean, maybe...

1282
02:24:36,773 --> 02:24:40,110
Maybe I think...

1283
02:24:40,819 --> 02:24:43,029
...we should be grateful.

1284
02:24:48,827 --> 02:24:50,328
Grateful...

1285
02:24:50,870 --> 02:24:55,667
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1286
02:24:56,501 --> 02:24:58,128
...adventures...

1287
02:25:00,463 --> 02:25:02,716
...whether they were real...

1288
02:25:03,216 --> 02:25:05,385
...or only a dream.

1289
02:25:14,269 --> 02:25:17,939
Are you sure of that?

1290
02:25:21,693 --> 02:25:23,236
Am I sure?

1291
02:25:38,418 --> 02:25:40,086
Only as sure as I am...

1292
02:25:40,295 --> 02:25:44,007
...that the reality of one night...

1293
02:25:45,258 --> 02:25:47,969
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1294
02:25:50,388 --> 02:25:52,724
...can ever be the whole truth.

1295
02:25:59,230 --> 02:26:01,149
And no dream is ever...

1296
02:26:02,942 --> 02:26:04,652
...just a dream.

1297
02:26:12,786 --> 02:26:14,788
The important thing is...

1298
02:26:16,581 --> 02:26:18,208
...we're awake now...

1299
02:26:19,501 --> 02:26:21,711
...and hopefully...

1300
02:26:24,631 --> 02:26:26,758
...for a long time to come.

1301
02:26:30,303 --> 02:26:31,721
Forever.

1302
02:26:33,807 --> 02:26:35,225
Forever?

1303
02:26:37,435 --> 02:26:38,895
Forever.

1304
02:26:41,189 --> 02:26:44,651
Let's not use that word. You know?

1305
02:26:45,944 --> 02:26:47,821
It frightens me.

1306
02:26:57,664 --> 02:27:00,667
But I do love you...

1307
02:27:03,670 --> 02:27:05,255
...and you know...

1308
02:27:06,381 --> 02:27:08,466
...there is something very important...

1309
02:27:08,633 --> 02:27:11,261
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1310
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:13,763
What's that?

1311
02:27:16,808 --> 02:27:18,226
Fuck.
