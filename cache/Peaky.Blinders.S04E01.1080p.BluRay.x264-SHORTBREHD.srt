00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,558
Michael?

164
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,191
Look,

165
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,636
sometimes I have a sniff of snow,
so what?

166
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,952
How's your mother?

167
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,079
I drove past her house,
the drainpipe was hanging off.

168
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,353
Look, the cocaine keeps me awake.

169
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,031
Very long hours these days
and when I do sleep

170
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,316
I dream about what happened.

171
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,756
I wasn't asking about you,
Michael, was I?

172
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,951
I was asking about your mother.

173
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,870
Since she was pardoned
she's been on these fucking tablets

174
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,031
the doctor gave her
when she was in the prison.

175
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,191
She says that
when she was inside the noose

176
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,278
she saw spirits.

177
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,680
She's running séances

178
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,997
but people just come into the house
to steal things.

179
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,715
- Tommy, it's bad.
- All right, all right.

180
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,791
All right, listen to me, Michael.

181
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,200
The spirits she sees...

182
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,111
are real.

183
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,475
Believe they're real.

184
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,590
Believe it with her.

185
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,232
And eventually,

186
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,879
you can take the remembered noose

187
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,556
from around her neck,

188
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,069
like a horse
that's been choked off.

189
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,513
Keep her off whiskey,

190
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,829
throw away the tablets,

191
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,919
and stop giving her fucking snow.

192
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,678
Fuck, Tommy,
sounds like family advice.

193
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,272
You coming back?

194
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,352
Nothing to come back to.

195
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,394
Truth is they're all fucked.

196

197
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,958
Yeah.

198
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,553
Find out about that woman, Jessie Eden.

199
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,195
Don't let your mother
keep cash in the house. And oi,

200
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,916
no cocaine on the registered premises.

201
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,394
Did you see they all came?

202
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,873
Yeah, I saw you at the back.

203
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,472
It's funny they don't notice.

00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,920
and I will cut the pay
of the male cutters

326
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,390
in the Rover by five shillings,

327
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,154
thereby achieving
your sacred fucking parity.

328
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,273
And I will tell the men

329
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,760
with families to feed

330
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,870
whose idea it was to cut their pay.

331
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,510
You do that, I will bring
all my members out on strike.

332
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,399
Oh, yeah?
A week after Christmas, you think so?

333
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
You know, everything
you've said here today

334
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,278
and the fact that
we're having this meeting today

335
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,834
tells me that you're a woman
without a family.

336
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,120
And everything I hear about you tells me
you're a man without a family as well.

337
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,158
My comrade brothers and sisters
are not afraid of you, Mr Shelby.

338
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,679
I will call an extraordinary meeting
of my executive committee

339
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,353
as soon as Boxing Day.

340
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,591
You will hear the whistles blow
all across Birmingham.

341
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,030
I've heard
lots of whistles blow, sweetheart.

342
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,711
(EXHALES)

343
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,800
The post has arrived, Mr Shelby.

344
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,870
I'm sorry to keep asking

345
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,236
but chef needs to know
how many for dinner tomorrow.

346
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,271
He's new,

347
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,598
he's foreign, he gets very upset.

348
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,075
Right. Well, you tell chef

349
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,755
there'll be 27 guests
for Christmas dinner tomorrow.

350
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,240
Twenty-seven?

351
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,152
- Family?
- Yep.

352
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,118
I thought Charlie could do
with some company

353
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,193
so I asked Johnny Dogs
if he knew anyone who liked to eat goose

354
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,999
and he said he knew 26.

355
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,876
Tell chef I want ten geese,
a buck cut into steaks,

356
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,600
some trout from the river,

357
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,594
fetch whisky, brandy and wine
from the cellar, best we have.

358
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,875
There will be children?

359
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,670
Lots of children.

360
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,874
With Johnny's tribe, new ones
might be born on the floor,

361
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,234
so have...
have mops and buckets ready, eh?

362
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,594
And I want you at the table, Frances,
so make it 28.

363
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,920
I will be busy.

364
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,515
You've put up with me this past year,

365
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,398
looked after Charlie
when I've been on business,

366
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,154
tomorrow you will eat at my table.

367
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,192
Things will get better,
I think, next year.

368
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,435
Uh-huh.

369
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,510

summer, much colder in the winter.

But parts of it
are just like Birmingham.

Yeah. Shit and smoke
the same everywhere.

373
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,197
Hmm. What about you, Linda?
You working?

374
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,438
I've been seeking work as a teacher.

375
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,273
- ARTHUR: Teacher.
- Hmm, but you know,

376
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,832
it's quite difficult. The Shelby name
is always in the papers.

377
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,031
And, uh, what do you get up to
all day, Arthur?

378
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,231
As you know Arthur's previous endeavours
have left us with no need for a salary.

379
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,438

He drives old people and cripples.

- Oh.
- Yeah, well, something to do.

383
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,069
I wanna open a garage.

384
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,713
- Someday.
- Fixing cars, you know?

385
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,792
Sometimes cars attract ambitious men.

386
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,674
Yeah, but...

387
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,717
- I like fixing cars.
- Hmm.

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,993
I just got served a black hand.

394
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,956
I just got delivered
a black fucking hand to the house

395
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,395
from Luca Changretta.

396

Wait a minute, John, which one's Luca?

399

<i>The old man's oldest son.</i>

400

<i>He was gonna get done
for killing a bank clerk in a robbery.</i>

sent him back to New York.</i>

You know what the black hand
means among the wops, Arthur?

403
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,990
It's Mafia shit.

404

The Sicilian fucking Mafia.

- Arthur?
- It's all right, Linda.

Stay here. Ada, please?

Esme, I need to make a call.

- No.
- I need to make a fucking call.

- Give it here!
- What the fuck is this?

- What is it?

It's from Luca Changretta,
All right? We killed his dad.

419
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,834
I remember.

420
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,910
It was Tommy who killed him.

It was fucking...
Arthur pulled the trigger.

All right, it was mercy,
but it was Arthur.

He saw that your drainpipe was broken.

486
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,517
He's worried.

487
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,874
Is that it?
Is that all he asked about, drainpipes?

488
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,350
No, he said that I'm to accept
that you have a gift.

489
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,034
That you've always had a gift.

490
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,190
What gift?

491
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,919
Second sight.

492
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,319
Spirits, all that gypsy stuff.

493
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,754
He said that I'm to believe you.

494
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,435
You think I don't hear
his voice in yours?

495
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,432
You don't think
I recognise his strategies?

496
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,112
- I'm still a match for him.
- Yes,

497
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,520
you are.

498
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,156
And you still can be.

499
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,919
Me and Lizzie decided

500
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,560
that this new year
we're all to turn a page.

501
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,233
You can't spend
another year like this, Mum.

502
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,720
Mum.

503
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,079
Mum.

504
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,511
Word is like a bullet to me.

505
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,311
See your sister in that chair sometimes.

506
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,317
Look,

507
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,153
me and Lizzie decided.

508
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,518
It's time.

509
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,194
I bought these.
One for you and Ada...

510
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,718
One for you and me.

511
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,039
So Tommy said, keep her off the whisky?

512
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,236
I'll drink champagne

513
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,199
the day my son leaves the employment
of Shelby Company Ltd.

514
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,319
You tell him that next time
he mentions fucking drainpipes.

515
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,319
Right, now, this is your job, Charlie.

516
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,996
Now, give those to Santa,

517
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,480
and Rudolf.

518
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,755
Good boy.

519
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,192
Leave this out for Santa,
that's whisky.

520
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,079
Now, night-night. Merry Christmas.

521
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,791
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right? Sleep well.

522
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,872
Come on, Charlie.

526
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,195
Mr Shelby, it's your sister.

527
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,439
I know. Send her in.

528
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,998
I've had a card, Ada. I'm guessing
Arthur and John have had one as well.

529
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,435
"Hello, Tommy."
"Hello, Ada, welcome home."

530
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,194
"Thanks, it's nice
to be back." (CHUCKLES)

531
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,431
I've spoken to Moss.

532
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,680
Moss says that Changretta
is a soldier for the Spinetta family,

533
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,956
which means that he'll have men
with him, professional men.

534
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,999
They usually operate
in units of around ten.

535
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,874
Moss is checking Cunard records
to see if they're already in England.

536
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,398
This one's for you.

537
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,874
What is it, a time machine?

538
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,519
My God, Tommy Shelby, is that regret?

539
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,913
I'll open it tomorrow.

540
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,953
So, boss, in light of the changed
circumstances, what are your orders?

541
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,759
Changretta knows where we all live.

542
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,839
If we stay out in the open, isolated,
he'll pick us off one by one.

543
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,475
We need to be together in a place
even they won't dare to come.

544
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,749
You mean, back home?

545
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,679
Within a four-mile radius
of the Garrison,

546
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,752
every man is a guard
and a soldier for us.

547
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,479
I'm calling a family meeting.

548
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,199
Charlie Strong's yard, Boxing Day.

549
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,440
Finn's already there.

550
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,716
You tell Polly and Michael,
I'll deal with John and Arthur.

551
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,200
And Esme and Linda?

552
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,632
Anyone who wants to live
to see another Christmas

553
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,758
needs to come where it's safe.
These bastards will kill kids as well.

554
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,316
When this business is finished we can...

555
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,119
go our separate ways.

556
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,154
Go and see Polly and explain.
She'll have had a card as well.

557
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,233
Do you think I'm on the list?

558
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,752
We're all on the list, Ada.

559
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,080
I gave my gun to Arthur.

560
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,595
Welcome home.

561
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,555
Hm.

562
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,318
Holy shit.

563
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,234
- It's Father Christmas.
- Yeah.

564
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,437
And if you're good

565
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,477
you get what you deserve.

566
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,199

Boxing Day, midday.

575
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,399
I can't raise John
but I'll send Michael to get him.

576
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,635
If you have to pull a gun
on Linda, do it.

00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,518

578
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,432
Merry Christmas, Tom.

579
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,114
What did you do with them?

580
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,555
My tablets were in the bathroom cabinet.
What did you do with them?

581
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,032
I threw them in the lavatory.

582
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,080
- Tommy's orders?
- No. My own decision.

583
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,433
How am I gonna get through Christmas
without them? They close everything.

584
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,593
How am I gonna get through Christmas
without them?

585
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,751
- I'll help you.
- They don't open anything.

586
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,240
Fucking no apocethary, nothing.

587
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,677
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

588
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,117
How am I gonna get through
fucking Christmas,

589
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,078
without... without anything?

590
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,718
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

591
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,398
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

592
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,838
Fuck off. Fuck off.
Fuck off, Thomas Shelby. Fuck off.

593
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,116
It's all right, it was me.
I just want you to stop, just stop.

594
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,032
- I just want the tablets.
- This has got to stop!

595
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,589
Tommy said to believe in spirits
with you but I can't.

596
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,831
Hello, Polly. Hello, Michael.

597
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,360
Merry Christmas.

598
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,400
Door was wide open.

599
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,350
Fuck.

600
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,512
I spent the whole day tidying up,
I wanted it to be nice.

601
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,554
I wanted it to look nice.

602
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,871
All right, Poll, it's only me.

603
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,270
It's okay. It's okay, we can sit.

604
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,440
Sit and talk, we'll put things
back together. It's okay.

605
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,876
- I'll leave you two to it.
- No, you stay.

606
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,595
Now listen, something's happened.

607
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,399
Things have changed.

608
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,469
Today, everyone in the family

609
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,312
received one of these.

610
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,794
- What does it mean?
- Tommy's called a family meeting.

611
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,558
He wants you both to come.

612
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,839
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

613
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,998
Come.

614
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,200
I'm really sorry
to bother you again, sir,

615
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,795
but chef insists on knowing
what time the guests will arrive.

616
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,798
Frances, for the last time,

617
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,473
it's Johnny Dogs,

618
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,789
they're gypsies,

619
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,234
they're camped down by the river.

620
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,710
When they're ready they'll walk up.
All right?

621
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,315
- He says it's about preparation, sir.
- What is?

622
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,710
He's asked specifically,

623
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,110
will they arrive
before the King's speech or after?

624
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,392
You said he was new, this chef.

625
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,790
- When did he join us?
- October.

626
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,078
October.

627
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,920
And he's foreign?

628
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,480
- He's Italian, sir.
- Oh.

629
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,756
He's the best chef
we've ever had in the house.

630
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,950
No shouting or swearing or blaspheming.

631
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,397
- Do we know his references?
- Yes.

632
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,717
The only problem has been his assistant.

633
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,276
What assistant?

634
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,592
He brought an assistant with him,
he calls him his sous chef.

635
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,272
Are they still working, Frances?

636
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,033
They'll be there till midnight, sir.

637
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,632
All right, thank you.
Goodnight, you can go to bed.

638
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,429
Merry Christmas, sir.

639
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,120
And I thought about your offer,

640
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,118
I'd be happy to sit at your table.

641
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,719
All right, thank you.

642
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,878
Mr Shelby.

643
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,955
What's your name?

644
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,713
- Max, Mr Shelby.

Hello, sir.

00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,960
I haven't taken time
to introduce myself.

Antonio.

What have you done that's so wrong, eh?

Excuse me?

Oh, late notice.

All right.

Here, £10.

Just... worried about tomorrow.

Yeah, I'm worried about Antonio.

He's been here two months
and we've not met before, it's my fault.

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,157
Must be a lot.

676

I just gave him £10,

didn't mean a fucking thing to him.

678

Maybe it isn't you that pays him.

- No.

Darby Sabini facilitated.

692
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,189
He passed him onto you,
told you to bring him into my house,

693
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,351
threatened to kill you
if you didn't do it.

694
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,071
Do you want me to dress you
like you dressed that fucking stag?

Please, don't...

- You know what I do?
- Mmm.

You wanted to know
when my guests would arrive

700

'cause Antonio needed me alone.

701
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,238
He's an assassin,
the plan is to kill me tomorrow.

I don't know.

They just said bring him here.

704

Well, bring him here.
