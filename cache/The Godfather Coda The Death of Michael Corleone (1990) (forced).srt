1
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:03,051
<i>The Vatican announced today...</i>

2
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:07,016
<i>that Pope Paul VI has canceled his
Sunday blessing...</i>

3
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,018
<i>due to ill health.</i>

4
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,097
<i>His physician has ordered total bedrest...</i>

5
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,058
<i>and cessation of all activities.</i>

6
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,649
The purpose of this meeting is to ratify...

7
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,400
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

8
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,800
What do you think about Altobello?

9
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:13,602
A very talented man.

10
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:17,982
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

11
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,315
The saint of reason.

12
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:44,293
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

13
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:49,927
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

14
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:57,018
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

15
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:02,818
And still pressure the Vatican deal?

16
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:08,233
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

17
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:41,391
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

18
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,148
Someone we can tell our problem to?

19
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,481
Cardinal Lamberto.

20
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:54,158
A wise and good man... very influential.

21
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,744
He will see you.

22
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:36,954
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

23
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:57,152
Burns the moon in the sky,
and I burn with love

24
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:04,451
Fire that wastes away like my heart

25
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:11,128
My soul cries in pain

26
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:18,715
It has no peace,
what a terrible night

27
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:26,056
Time passes, but day never comes

28
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:33,230
There is never sun,
if she doesn't return

29
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:40,404
Burns my earth and burns my heart

30
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:48,203
She is thirsty for water,
and I am thirsty for love

31
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:54,501
To whom can I sing my song

32
01:22:55,762 --> 01:23:03,762
If no one appears at the balcony.

33
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:22,757
<i>Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church...</i>

34
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,923
<i>died last night at 9:40 p.m.</i>

35
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:31,135
<i>The Pope was 81 years old,...</i>

36
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:35,636
<i>and had been in poor health
for the last several months.</i>

37
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:26,770
I am honored, Don Altobello, that you've
come from Palermo to visit me.

38
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:34,610
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

39
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:36,984
Do the donkey for me.

40
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:58,680
It's been some time since we
did business together.

41
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:07,731
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

42
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:13,608
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

43
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:23,113
Only one stone?

44
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:07,540
"Oh father, my father!"

45
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:10,586
"Give me some time to pray
to the Lord."

46
01:45:11,764 --> 01:45:14,722
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

47
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:18,180
and fallen in love with her cousin.

48
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:20,512
"There will be no forgiveness!"

49
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:24,474
Her father stabbed her
through the heart.

50
01:46:49,987 --> 01:46:54,402
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

51
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:07,744
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

52
01:47:09,298 --> 01:47:12,711
You were an assassin then,
and you're an assassin now.

53
01:47:13,052 --> 01:47:16,295
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

54
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,926
I will pass through the gates with you.

55
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:38,912
What is it? What's wrong?

56
01:52:39,378 --> 01:52:42,086
They found Don Tommasino shot.

57
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:45,505
Is he dead?

58
01:52:47,344 --> 01:52:50,803
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

59
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:54,257
I must have revenge!

60
01:52:58,063 --> 01:53:03,274
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

61
01:53:03,568 --> 01:53:05,058
Command me.

62
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:10,405
I will avenge him!

63
01:53:25,549 --> 01:53:27,039
Totals...

64
01:53:29,136 --> 01:53:31,468
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

65
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:35,097
Siri, 11 votes.

66
01:53:35,934 --> 01:53:38,972
Lamberto, 99 votes.

67
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:49,737
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

68
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:56,281
Oh, God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

69
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:58,738
I accept.

70
01:53:58,999 --> 01:54:01,491
By what name do you wish to be called?

71
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:04,873
John Paul the First.

72
01:54:34,534 --> 01:54:39,370
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

73
02:09:48,489 --> 02:09:51,106
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

74
02:09:52,702 --> 02:09:56,912
I bring a message
from Michael Corleone.

75
02:09:58,332 --> 02:09:59,663
Let him in.

76
02:16:51,078 --> 02:16:54,366
Tea, Your Holiness?
It will help you sleep.

77
02:17:18,147 --> 02:17:21,139
This is from Vincent Corleone.

78
02:19:10,425 --> 02:19:11,915
Your Holiness?

79
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:19,465
Eminence.

80
02:19:35,409 --> 02:19:38,026
The Holy Father is dead!

81
02:22:22,576 --> 02:22:24,533
Speak... tell me.

82
02:22:26,163 --> 02:22:32,409
You have lost the faith of the people.

83
02:22:33,879 --> 02:22:38,294
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

84
02:22:38,759 --> 02:22:42,468
And Michael Corleone's message?

85
02:22:59,446 --> 02:23:05,818
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

86
02:23:09,623 --> 02:23:11,660
He's clean.

87
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:32,722
Power wears out those who don't have it.
