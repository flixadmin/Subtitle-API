1
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:10,416
<i>Palermo,</i>

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,791
<i>this is a war.</i>

3
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,625
<i>Act accordingly.</i>

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,583
Denver!

5
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,958
Fire!

6
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,625
<i>Everything can to go hell
in less than a second.</i>

7
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,583
<i>In moments like this,
you feel death creeping in,</i>

8
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,250
<i>and you know nothing
will ever be the same.</i>

9
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,666
<i>But you need to do
whatever it takes to survive.</i>

10
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,458
<i>Nairobi, hold on!</i>

11
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,666
Hang in there.

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,583
Hang in there, Nairobi.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,208
- It's gonna be okay.
- Come on!

14
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:28,791
Come on!

15
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:32,208
<i>Everyone has a sniper
aiming at their heart.</i>

16
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,708
Let's go!

17
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,791
<i>But true terror...</i>

18
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,000
<i>- isn't when the bullet hits you.</i>
- We're almost there!

19
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,083
<i>It's when it takes away
someone you love.</i>

20
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,166
Come on! Come on!

21
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,375
Rio, Saline.

22
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,625
Come on!

23
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,625
Okay. Exhale.

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
That's it.

25
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,625
<i>The Professor was feeling
that true terror more than any of us.</i>

26
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,750
<i>His heart held two words
that should never be together:</i>

27
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,375
<i>love and death.</i>

28
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,125
<i>And that fucked with his head.</i>

29
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,125
<i>While running through the forest,</i>

30
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,666
<i>he could only think...</i>

31
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,041
<i>"They've killed the love of my life."</i>

32
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,666
<i>But there was Lisbon.</i>

33
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,125
<i>Very much alive.</i>

34
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,458
<i>The two gunshots of her fake execution</i>

35
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,375
<i>were pointed directly
at the Professor's mind.</i>

36
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,666
<i>The Professor was drowning
in his own grief.</i>

37
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,333
<i>And with him,</i>

38
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,875
<i>we were sinking too.</i>

39
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,166
Pulse is 155 and going up.

40
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,750
Blood pressure, 85/40.
It's dropping.

41
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,083
Okay, we need two units
of blood and saline.

42
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,291
Nairobi,

43
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,958
stay strong. I'm here with you.

44
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,208
<i>In the tent,</i>

45
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,083
<i>Tamayo felt the same way I did.</i>

46
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,375
<i>Horror from being face to face with death.</i>

47
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,416
<i>A dry mouth with the taste of metal.</i>

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,000
<i>Shortness of breath, anxiety,
and lots of pain.</i>

49
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,666
<i>But as long as the game was on,</i>

50
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,208
<i>we all had to keep standing.</i>

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,208
Blood's at 30 degrees.
Ready for transfusion.

52
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,250
It's right here, the bullet.

53
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,208
Behind the seventh rib.

54
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,041
It's in the lower part of the lung.

55
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,958
My love, that's good news.

56
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,458
She can't breathe.
It's a pneumothorax.

57
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,541
- Make a puncture.
- She's choking.

58
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,208
Tokyo. Surgical kit six.

59
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,041
Okay. I'm going. Surgical kit six.

60
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,291
Her air is between the lungs
and chest wall.

61
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,791
Hurry, Helsinki!

62
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,125
- Tokyo!
- I got it.

63
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,458
That's it.

64
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,750
You have to get me out of here.

65
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,708
I'd rather be in jail, alive.

66
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,333
I don't wanna die in here.

67
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,583
Tokyo...

68
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,916
Just give me up to the police, please.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,250
Please.

70
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,833
Get me out.

STAGE 3

81
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,125
RESISTANCE

82
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:57,250
Once Rio's been released,
we'll begin phase three of the plan...

83
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,375
resistance.

84
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,291
No one can get out
of the Bank of Spain alive.

85
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,375
It's impossible.

86
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,791
But I will get you out of there.

87
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,958
Once we have begun phase three,

88
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,875
the only thing that matters is the gold,
and our only goal is...

89
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
to melt it.

90
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,916
Because the gold is our only key.

91
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,916
If we don’t get the gold,
I can't get you out of there.

92
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,500
The police...

93
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,625
will strike back at us with everything,
but no matter what...

94
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,833
whatever happens,

95
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,125
whatever it is they do,

96
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,916
we need to be able to keep... control.

97
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,333
Otherwise,
all our lives will be in danger.

98
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,958
Did we kill any police?

99
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,458
I don't know,
we sent one up in flames.

100
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,809
When they come back, they'll bring
everything they've got,

101
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:10,913
and we're not in a position

102
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,541
<i>to defend ourselves, Sergio.</i>

103
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,875
And Nairobi needs a surgeon.

104
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,095
We fired an antitank at them.
They’re not going to give us a surgeon.

105
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,375
She's got a fucking bullet
inside her lung.

106
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,541
<i>We can't do it ourselves.
You have to try, Sergio.</i>

107
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,833
<i>We need to get
the surgeon in Pakistan.</i>

108
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,208
How much time do I have?

109
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,750
She's dying.

110
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,875
He has climbing equipment,
dog deterrent and camouflage clothes.

111
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,916
He could be in the treetops.

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,208
Shoot up,
and aim at the crowns of the trees.

113
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,083
Raquel, don't let them get you alone.
Tell them I surrender.

114
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,500
Raquel!

115
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,750
Get out of there!

116
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,458
Get out of there!

117
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,000
Just get out!

118
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,291
I'm gonna try.

119
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,083
Ssh. Easy now.

120
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:55,958
Easy.

121
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,291
Easy.

122
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,166
Easy.

123
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,083
Good little bull.

124
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,583
Easy.

125
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,083
Easy.

126
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,083
Easy.

127
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,916
<i>The Professor attacked the police,</i>

128
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,208
<i>but nobody is moving
from the Bank of Spain.</i>

129
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,458
<i>The protesters are in a state of shock,</i>

130
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,166
<i>and the big question is: what'll happen
with the support from the Dalís?</i>

131
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,291
<i>For the moment, nobody can say,</i>

132
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,750
<i>but we could be witnessing
the first big problem</i>

133
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,833
<i>for supporters of the Professor's cause.</i>

134
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,791
It's like a movie.
Best thing to happen to us.

135
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,875
Those men out there have
second and third-degree burns.

136
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,708
That's normal.
Now what we need is another armored van.

137
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,208
Don’t you care about anything?

138
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,083
I'm not sending more men
to have their faces disfigured

139
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,286
for the rest of their lives.

140
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,041
They fired two rockets at us,
and all of Spain saw it.

141
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,541
I am not starting a war
in the center of Madrid.

142
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,833
The war has started!

143
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,208
Tamayo. Tamayo, don't fuck this up.
Don't make the worst mistake of your life.

144
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,250
The mistake was you torturing that kid.

145
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,791
If we'd just taken him to court,
we wouldn't be here.

146
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,795
We made them stronger and gave them
an argument. I'm not doing that again.

147
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,083
You're scared.

148
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,666
You’re just like Prieto...

149
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,458
a Viagra box on the bedside table
for your limp erection. Ugh!

150
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,625
And you think that the law will save you.
Hm!

151
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,750
The law can't help us now.

152
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,166
I am the law.

153
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,958
And limp erection, my ass!

154
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,875
We need to keep our composure.

155
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,916
I want to de-escalate the situation.
Everyone understand?

156
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,333
Dialogue and truce. Truce and dialogue.

157
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,458
Is that clear?

158
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,708
Crystal clear, boss.

159
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,500
Antoñanzas?

160
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,416
Antoñanzas!

161
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,625
Yes, Inspector?

162
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,750
You heard him, no?

163
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,500
That guy is the law. Like John Wayne.

164
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,958
I want a surgical ambulance and a surgeon.

165
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,291
Now!

166
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,666
Let's get out there and make them
hand over their wounded.

167
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,915
The Governor took three medical courses
in the army.

168
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,791
He's gonna help with the operation.

169
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,708
I didn't finish my studies,
and I didn't pursue it as a career,

170
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,458
but I remember some principles.

171
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,875
Great. Put your scrubs on.

172
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,291
I'll get 'em.

173
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,833
So where's the surgeon?

174
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,791
I'm trying to make contact,
but they have to allow access.

175
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,250
Bogotá, anesthetic.
Nairobi, we're putting you to sleep.

176
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,791
You're not putting me to sleep! Tokyo!

177
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,875
Tokyo...

178
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,583
Tell him it's my life,

179
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,541
and I decide.

180
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,416
Please!

181
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,583
It is your life. That's why we're doing
the surgery here, so relax.

182
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,083
Tokyo, please.

183
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,791
Please.

184
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,541
She decides.

185
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,541
That's final.

186
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,000
Helsinki, put her to sleep.
That’s a fucking order.

187
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,833
You don't give me orders.
You're not my boss.

188
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,583
You let her get the phone.

189
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,166
You're supposed to protect us.

190
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,916
She can make mistakes, but you can't!

191
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,666
Shut your mouth, fat ass,
or I'll kill you right now,

192
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,750
you son of a bitch!

193
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,333
You're my little whore, not my mama.

194
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:52,125
It's her fault she's like that
because she chose to be a fucking idiot.

195
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,541
If Nairobi says she's leaving,
I'm walking her to the door.

196
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,208
And you, you piece of shit,

197
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,208
you're gonna shut your mouth

198
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,166
because from now on,
you're no longer my boss.

199
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,916
- Tokyo, lower the fucking pistol.
- Denver...

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,625
If Nairobi talks, they'll kill us all.
We're doing the operation in here.

201
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,916
What do you know about operations,
you idiot?

202
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,166
Nairobi needs a surgeon.

203
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,166
Are you all fucking crazy or what?

204
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,208
I swear on my son...

205
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,583
I won't tell them anything.

206
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,083
That’s what you think, but when they
start torturing you, it changes.

207
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,916
Go fuck yourself.

208
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,250
Nairobi's leaving.

209
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,916
I don't think so.

210
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:42,333
Do you really think that now is a good
moment to play the rebel leader? Hmm?

211
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,375
One of us is dying,
so just stop fucking around!

212
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,208
Another one of us.

213
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,541
What do you mean, "another"?

214
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,708
They executed Lisbon half an hour ago.

215
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,166
If I could show you all
my magnificent democratic side,

216
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,083
we could vote and get her out,
but I'd be killing her.

217
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:11,041
Lisbon was executed on her knees, unarmed.

218
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:15,375
They brought Nairobi's son with his teddy
bear so they could shoot her in the head.

219
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,916
Do you think a couple of nuns
from the Red Cross are waiting outside?

220
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,291
Stop fucking around!

221
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,333
Palermo is right.

222
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,208
You're gonna have to cut me open...

223
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,916
and take the bullet out.

224
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,791
Maybe...

225
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,541
cut out part of my lung.

226
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,833
And all that without me bleeding to death.

227
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,541
You're gonna kill me!

228
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,250
You're gonna kill me.

229
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,541
Helsinki...

230
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,083
It's too complicated.

231
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,416
Helsinki, it's too complicated.

232
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,708
Take me to the door.

233
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,500
- Take me...
- Stay calm.

234
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,750
- Take me to the door!
- Stay calm.

235
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,625
- Stay calm.
- Take me to the door!

236
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,958
- It's gonna be okay.
- Thank you.

237
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,000
- It's gonna be okay.
- No!

238
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,375
No! I don't want to! No!

239
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,916
No, no, no, no!

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,333
- Ssh.
- No!

241
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,583
No!

242
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,666
No!

243
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,541
No! No! No!

244
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,916
No, no, no, no!

245
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,291
Forgive us, Professor,
uh, we just had an argument tonight.

246
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,458
I'm going to sleep with Tokyo.

247
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,208
Is this okay with you, Tokyo?
Do you mind that I'm sleeping here?

248
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,333
It's totally fine.

249
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,791
So you know, when someone in my bed,

250
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,041
I get really horny.
You don't care, do you?

251
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,541
- Uh, I don't care about what?
- You and I getting rid of our stress.

252
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,041
Rubbing our clams together.

253
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,000
I knew that was a joke.

254
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,000
Can somebody please explain to me
why the fuck Palermo...

255
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,708
is leading this?

256
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,500
Because it was his idea?

257
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,541
- And he's the genius.
- <i>He's </i>the genius?

258
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,333
The same guy that was fondling
his balls in the hallway

259
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,500
like a fucking creep?

260
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,916
Oh, come on!

261
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,625
You know who should be
in charge of this?

262
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,041
You!

263
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,791
Yeah, you.

264
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,708
I think so too.
If there's anyone who cares

265
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,708
about this heist going well, it's you.

266
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,625
Don't put ideas in my head, huh.

267
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,125
Don't put ideas in my head.

268
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,958
I'm going to bed.

269
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,458
Good evening.

270
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,208
I'm gonna talk with the Professor.

271
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,041
Don't wait up!

272
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,416
Professor,

273
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,708
I wanna take charge...

274
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,458
of the heist. I'll be better than Palermo.

275
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,958
Tokyo, can we talk about it
in the morning?

276
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,416
The morning? No, now.

277
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,000
Why does he have to be in charge?
- Let's see, Tokyo. He...

278
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,125
is in charge because this heist has been
in development for a long time, and...

279
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,791
he's been on it since the beginning.
He has the plan in his head.

280
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,875
So?

281
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,833
I can learn the plan.
I'm a quick learner.

282
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,933
"Platero is a small, soft, hairy donkey.

283
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,541
So soft, one would say
he's made of cotton with no bones."

284
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,083
<i>Platero and I </i>by Juan Ramón Jiménez.

285
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,416
We know.

286
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,125
I don’t know if you noticed,
but you're ruining an intimate moment.

287
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,208
Hmm?

288
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,416
What's wrong?

289
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:21,916
Are you horny?

290
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,750
I was. I was, yeah.

291
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,625
- Oh, yeah?
- Hm-mmm.

292
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,416
You don't seem very imaginative.

293
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,000
You might be a little shocked.

294
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,625
- Please! For God's sake...
- Oh, wow! Is that right?

295
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,708
Hm-mmm.

296
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,041
Oh!

297
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,708
Do you want me to stay?

298
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,916
No.

299
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,750
And you?

300
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,750
Why are we talking about this?

301
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,041
Because I'm proposing a threesome.

302
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,916
Palermo, you and me.

303
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,250
He handles the numbers and calculations.

304
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,166
You handle our strategy,

305
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,041
but I'm the best fucking captain
you can have in there.

306
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,625
Because when things
start getting fucked up,

307
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,708
I react.

308
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,833
That's not something you learn
by studying. You're born with it.

309
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,416
Gentlemen,

310
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,416
I'm assuming command.

311
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,083
Let's operate.

312
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,875
Assuming command. The brains.

313
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,250
The intelligent and temperate one.

314
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,250
The crazy bitch that got us in here

315
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,625
is who you'll lose your lives for. Great.

316
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,125
I'm gonna let you all
play little doctors...

317
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,791
while I think about my next move.
Careful, huh?

318
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,125
<i>That half hour was our darkest time.</i>

319
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,250
<i>In 30 minutes,</i>

320
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,291
<i>the police covered lots of ground
shooting at the trees.</i>

321
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,083
<i>They kept us isolated and desperate.</i>

322
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,791
<i>And the Professor,
inside the drinking trough,</i>

323
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,333
<i>was thinking about those 30 minutes</i>

324
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,416
<i>and how if he could've made this call
half an hour earlier...</i>

325
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,666
<i>...Lisbon would be alive.</i>

326
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,958
It's time to begin phase two of Hamelin.

327
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,041
<i>Copy that.</i>

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,500
PRIVATE NUMBER

329
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,875
Alicia, empathy, dialogue and truce.

330
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,250
Professor.

331
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,666
<i>Five minutes as a widower,</i>

332
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,333
and you're calling other women.

333
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,000
Naughty boy.

334
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,333
You're a real horn dog, aren't ya?

335
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,416
- Did you order her execution?
- I didn’t have time. She executed herself.

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,458
<i>Raquel Murillo
violently resisted her arrest,</i>

337
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,250
firing against her ex-colleagues,

338
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,416
- just like a traitor.
- Colonel.

339
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,791
The signal isn't in Madrid.

340
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,125
Looks like a highway.

341
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,208
Close to Huelva.

342
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,638
<i>Ángel, he's getting away from us.</i>

343
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,291
That bastard is on the move 42 kilometers
away from your position.

344
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,333
You sure? What if it's another trap?

345
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,375
I'm completely sure.
The signal bounced off three repeaters.

346
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,416
He's on National 435, north. Go after him.

347
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,541
Okay.

348
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,500
Inspector Rubio to all units.
We're leaving.

349
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,833
The target is escaping
along National route 435, northbound.

350
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,416
Listen to me, Sierra.

351
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,916
Before we get out of the Bank of Spain,

352
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,833
I will burn you to the ground.

353
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:25,000
You're so boring.

354
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,250
Weren't you a professor of ethics?

355
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,791
Oh, no. You fired two rockets
in the center of Madrid,

356
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,000
and now you're the same as al-Qaeda. Huh.

357
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,166
Bing, bang, boom. Made a joke out of you!

358
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,041
I'm going to fix my mistakes,

359
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,708
and now I’m giving you the chance
to do the same.

360
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,583
- Nairobi...
<i>- No.</i>

361
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,958
I'm not sending a surgeon in.

362
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,625
But I can give you an easy solution.
Send Nairobi out,

363
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:51,000
and I'll have an ambulance waiting here.

364
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,583
I'm not going to leave Nairobi

365
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,041
in the hands of the one
who tried to kill her.

366
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,416
- You'll face the consequences.
- Oh, yes. I'm trembling with fear.

367
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,708
Okay, fine. I will show off my goodwill
by offering you a truce.

368
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,166
For 48 hours.

369
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,958
This way, you can assess

370
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,000
<i>how serious the wound is.</i>

371
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,500
- Or just let her die in there.
<i>- I accept the truce.</i>

372
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,833
But listen to me.

373
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,666
Nairobi is going to survive...

374
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,250
with or without your help.

375
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,625
Good.

376
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,750
Let's go catch that motherfucker!

377
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:57,708
Come on!

378
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,833
<i>How do we get out of the epicenter?</i>

379
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,666
By following Plan Hamelin.

380
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,625
Let's hear it.

381
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,541
Marseille will play on his flute,

382
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,083
and all of the mice
will start to chase him.

383
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,041
<i>We'll make them believe
Operation Cage failed?</i>

384
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:53,875
- Exactly.
- Hm.

385
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,583
<i>We’re going to leave false tracks, but...</i>

386
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,916
we'll make it believable
by supporting it with evidence.

387
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,625
And the trees where we were hiding
will be empty.

388
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,125
<i>And when the predators are gone,</i>

389
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,125
we'll climb down from the trees
like monkeys.

390
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,375
Won't it be the greatest reunion
of your entire life?

391
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,541
Why'd you call me Mr. Potato Head?

392
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,666
- I don't know. Your walk?
- My walk? What does that mean?

393
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,041
Maybe because you're... tender.

394
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,541
So, are you calling me tender,
or calling me fat?

395
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:12,750
Okay, okay.
I prefer you don't answer that.

396
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,958
You really crossed a line
with Potato Head.

397
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:19,166
See, now everybody knows about it...

398
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,875
homicide, internal affairs,
even the judiciary.

399
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,500
I didn't know what a meme was

400
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,458
until I got a bunch of memes
of Potato Head.

401
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm really sorry, Ángel.

402
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:38,875
You're not gonna ask me...

403
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,083
why I did all this?

404
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,166
No.

405
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,458
No. I know you did it for love.

406
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:57,125
When we get to Madrid, they're gonna
offer you a deal for your cooperation.

407
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,333
Yeah.

408
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:01,875
Strong-arm robbery,

409
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,541
breach of the public peace,

410
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,000
resistance to authority,

411
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,458
possession of weapons,

412
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:07,666
disclosure of secrets,

413
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,416
collaboration with armed groups
and abduction...

414
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,458
of the hostages...

415
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,458
and of my own daughter.

416
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,125
So, no matter what the deal is,

417
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,833
even if the judge and the system
is empathetic,

418
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,458
I won't be out for 30 years.

419
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,291
So I'm really fucked,

420
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,416
Mr. Potato.

421
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,267
Try to be clear and very concise
with your instructions.

422
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,291
Okay? Good.

423
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,191
<i>How many units of blood do we need?</i>

424
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,875
Have three ready
at the proper temperature.

425
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,708
Denver, how many do we have?

426
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:53,291
- Three units.
- Go get more.

427
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:56,291
O negative and A negative.
Draw blood for three operations,

428
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,291
and ask if anyone's a doctor.

429
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,833
Bogotá, downstairs.

430
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,583
It's our only way out of here.
Keep melting gold.

431
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Being in charge suits you.

432
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,625
Nobody trusts you anymore.

433
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:16,125
Do you know what your only way out
is gonna be when I'm not here?

434
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:21,291
To walk out with your hands
on the back of your head,

435
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:25,375
and pray they don't shoot you because
of all the cameras and people outside.

436
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,500
<i>Messieurs...</i>

437
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,125
<i>au revoir.</i>

438
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,416
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

439
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:36,583
Go ahead, doctor.

440
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:41,958
<i>Make an incision 15 centimeters
between the sixth and the seventh rib.</i>

441
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,041
Scalpel.

442
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,833
Should anyone get injured,

443
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,083
we'll be more than ready
to save their life.

444
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:54,583
We'll learn the protocols for the most
common cases of gunshot wounds.

445
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,333
And in the military truck with all
the equipment we need for the heist,

446
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:03,625
we'll include medical equipment in case
any type of surgery is necessary.

447
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,833
<i>Dr. Ahmed will be the brains,
but he'll be 7,000 kilometers away,</i>

448
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,166
<i>so you will be his hands.</i>

449
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,291
<i>It won't be easy.</i>

450
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:14,541
You can't hesitate.

451
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,458
You can't fail.

452
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,208
Because it's not gonna be
a dead pig on the table.

453
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,375
It'll be one of you.

454
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:31,916
<i>- Aspirator. I can't see well.</i>
- Bring the camera closer.

455
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,916
Always keep the surgical area clear.

456
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,250
- Better.
- So what's next?

457
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:39,291
<i>We need to separate the ribs.</i>

458
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,916
<i>It's possible</i>

459
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,166
<i>you will have to remove part of the lung.</i>

460
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,250
Separate the ribs?
Are you kidding?

461
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,875
Go get me the rib spreader.

462
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:56,333
- Is this it?
- Yes. Bring it here.

463
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:09,125
Those with blood type O negative
and A negative, put your hands up now.

464
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,208
Are you gonna make us
check your medical records, or what?

465
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,416
Paquita.

466
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,958
You were a nurse, weren't you?

467
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,625
Yes, sir, and a midwife.

468
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:28,166
Then follow me.

469
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,500
Everyone who raised their hands
come with me now!

470
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:02,916
Hey...

471
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,208
Hey, Professor!

472
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,208
Marseille?

473
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,541
Yeah, it's me. Keep calm.

474
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,833
- Come on. There's no police.
- And the bull?

475
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,000
- What bull?
- Help me get up. My body's numb.

476
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,583
That bull?

477
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,583
That bull.

478
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,208
Oh!

479
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,500
Step back

480
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,000
really slowly, Marseille.

481
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,208
Don’t stop staring him in the eye.

482
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,875
Backwards.

483
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,958
Doesn't this remind you of something?

484
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,041
San Fermín?

485
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,250
No.

486
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:45,291
Italy.

487
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:47,833
The time we met... at the wedding.

488
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:50,000
<i>Come on. Farther back!</i>

489
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:53,458
This bouquet thing,
don't single women catch it?

490
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,041
Martín, do you see any single woman here?

491
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,916
The closest thing we have is you.

492
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,208
It's tradition!
The bride throws the bouquet,

493
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,541
so just move a little further back.

494
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,000
Come on! Let's go!

495
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,625
A welder, a gay,

496
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,875
a mute, and even a librarian.

497
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:13,333
The fun never stops. Gotta love Italians.

498
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,666
I'm not mute. I just keep quiet.

499
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,916
And I'm not... I am not a librarian.

500
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,125
Please limit yourself
to calling me Sergio.

501
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,416
Ladies, stay focused!

502
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,916
- The bride is about to throw the bouquet!
- Girls, a little farther back!

503
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,166
Farther back!

504
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,041
Farther back!

505
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:49,708
<i>Ready?</i>

506
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:51,833
Whoo!

507
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,625
Little brother!

508
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,541
<i>Bravissimo, </i>little brother!

509
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,541
I'm so happy for you.

510
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:04,291
Well, Mrs. Fonollosa, we must begin
the wedding dance, but first...

511
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,875
- I have a surprise.
- What?

512
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:08,583
Ooh!

513
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,833
Come on! Everybody sing! Come on!

514
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,625
<i>Like people
with no sense of rhythm that can't dance,</i>

515
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:53,000
<i>the Professor just sat at the table,</i>

516
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:54,708
<i>and he asked himself,</i>

517
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,375
<i>what weighs more?</i>

518
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,208
<i>Love or death?</i>

519
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,791
Life weighs more, little brother.

520
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,583
Life.

521
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,958
Then there’s me. Even though I'm dying,
I'm getting married.

522
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,708
Isn't it a beautiful contradiction?

523
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,625
Does she know you're sick?

524
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,500
Ah, of course she knows. Hmm.

525
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,625
She's very smart.

526
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,875
And if you look on the bright side,
it's good luck.

527
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,791
People have no idea
when their time's gonna come.

528
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:36,208
But we get to stay
in the honeymoon period forever.

529
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:42,375
People buy a bottle of champagne
for a special celebration,

530
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,166
but go back to their mundane days.

531
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,166
Tatiana and I are gonna live our lives

532
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,666
burning through barrels of champagne
from France!

533
00:36:57,208 --> 00:37:00,375
Death can be the greatest opportunity
of your life, Sergio.

534
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,291
You're sad, Professor?

535
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,416
If you want,
you can talk to me about feelings.

536
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:33,125
Do you want to listen to some music?
Music tends to cheer people up.

537
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,958
This is a stolen car.
This music is not mine!

538
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,833
It doesn’t matter, Marseille.
Just keep driving.

539
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,000
Excuse me.

540
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,708
Um, who's the blood for?

541
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,458
Why do you care who the blood's for?

542
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:17,125
I saw two people going upstairs
with the teddy bear,

543
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,528
but there's only one of them now.

544
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,541
Well, now you know who it's for.

545
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:22,666
So let's stay quiet.

546
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,791
- Denver.
- What?

547
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:36,166
Thanks, man.

548
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,958
- For what?
- I wanted to get in here

549
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,708
so I could talk to you in person.

550
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:45,708
I know we didn't exactly start off
on the right foot,

551
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,208
but at the end of the day,
the only thing that's important

552
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:49,875
is that you raise my son.

553
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,583
- Thank you.
- What are you doing, you moron?

554
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,208
It's fine, Paquita. That's enough.
That's enough. Thank you.

555
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,916
I know at your age
with all the money you've got...

556
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,833
Pft!

557
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:09,916
I’m pretty sure changing shitty diapers
wasn't in the cards.

558
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,320
That’s why you've got my respect.

559
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:16,083
Because you've gotta be a real man
to take care of a kid that was born

560
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,583
from the sperm of another guy.

561
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,166
Listen, you motherfucker.

562
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:23,875
Shut up, and don't fuck with me,
or I'll beat the teeth out of your face.

563
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,000
He's not...

564
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:27,708
He's not A negative.

565
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:29,291
Arturo is A positive.

566
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,750
Arturo, what have you done?

567
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,458
What have you done?
What if I didn't check these?

568
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,781
This could have killed Nairobi.

569
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,458
I’m sorry.

570
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,583
I’m sorry. I was wrong.
I swear I'd never do that on purpose.

571
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,625
I knew I was A something,
but I didn’t know what,

572
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,468
positive or negative.
Who knows these things?

573
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,980
It's not something you use every day.

574
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,250
Oh, okay. So you're confused now.
Is that it?

575
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:58,511
- What the fuck, Denver?
- What do you mean?

576
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:01,541
What are you doing?
Maybe he was actually confused. Fuck.

577
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,666
- Help him, for Christ's sake!
- Get up. You’re okay.

578
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,875
Get up!

579
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:10,208
You can't go around
punching people like that. Jesus!

580
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,586
It's enough
that they're already trapped in here.

581
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:15,166
Now it's over.
He's okay. It’s over. I'm sorry.

582
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,750
It's no problem.

583
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,583
It's no problem.

584
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,583
You see...

585
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,166
I know why you're so pissed at me, buddy.

586
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,458
- Why? Why?
- It's okay. I get it.

587
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:31,166
Monica told you
what happened in the bathroom, didn't she?

588
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,333
What bathroom?

589
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,916
What bathroom? What is he talking about?

590
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,708
I really apologize.

591
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:41,250
I'm sorry. God, I don't know
what was going through my head, really.

592
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,750
It was so long since I'd seen her.
She was so close.

593
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,875
I don't know.
I guess I didn't read the signs right.

594
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:52,500
She told me that we would meet somewhere
after this so I could see my son.

595
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,333
One thing led to another, and I jumped.

596
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:56,625
You jumped?

597
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,291
He jumped for what?

598
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,041
Denver, nothing happened.

599
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,458
Just let it go. Let it go.

600
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,875
You were gonna meet this piece of shit
to show him our son?

601
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:10,166
He tricked me. He said he was his father.
He was emotional.

602
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,291
Yeah, but what did he jump for?
I don't understand this.

603
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,750
She didn't do anything.
Leave Monica out of it.

604
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,333
The person at fault is me.

605
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,125
We hugged, I got aroused,

606
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,666
- things got heated.
- Shut up!

607
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:23,666
Is this true?

608
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,291
This dumb motherfucker

609
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,333
rubbed himself against you with a hard-on?

610
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,625
I pushed him away
in a second with the gun, Denver.

611
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,541
Listen to me.

612
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,666
I defended myself, Denver.

613
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,416
So it is true.

614
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,750
Stop! Please stop!

615
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,833
Stop! You're gonna kill him!

616
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,416
Stop! You're gonna kill him!

617
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,791
Stop!<i> </i>Stop!

618
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,833
What the fuck is this?

619
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:21,208
What the fuck do you have inside of you?

620
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:23,291
So much rage.

621
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,583
So much violence.

622
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,625
You shot a hostage.

623
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,291
And now you beat him up.

624
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,000
Like a maniac.

625
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,291
I can't do this.

626
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,208
I don't know what your trauma is.

627
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:44,500
I don't know what your trauma is
or where it comes from, but...

628
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,250
I can't, Denver.

629
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,083
I can't, and I don’t want to.

630
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,125
I don’t want to.

631
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,500
I don’t want my son...

632
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:59,750
to feel that irrational violence
you carry inside of you.

633
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,250
I don't want that.

634
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,666
That's right. Go on.

635
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,333
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

636
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,916
- Is it him?
- The car rolled several times.

637
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,416
There's traces of blood, we can't find
the driver. It's gotta be him.

638
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,625
Or a drug dealer,
or a random criminal, no?

639
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:42,166
The car was stolen
two and a half hours ago in Salvatierra,

640
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:45,333
the closest village
to the place where we found Murillo.

641
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,041
And he climbs trees.

642
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,333
Right.

643
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:51,916
Excuse me.

644
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,875
- Yes, Colonel.
- <i>Was it him?</i>

645
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:03,791
I think so. He can't be far.
Looks like he lost a lot of blood.

646
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:07,166
We'll leave it to Suarez.
I need you here with Murillo.

647
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,125
Bring her to Madrid.
That's what's most important. Got it?

648
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,500
- Yeah, copy that.
<i>- And make sure Suarez</i>

649
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,666
sends units to all the area hospitals,

650
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,500
every veterinarian,
even the fucking monasteries.

651
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,458
I want everyone on high alert.

652
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,250
The only way he's getting away from us
is if he's dead.

653
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:31,541
Pamuk.

654
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:37,125
What?

655
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,125
My dog's name was Pamuk.

656
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,125
It was with me during the whole war.

657
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:43,875
I know what you feel.

658
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,666
Marseille, are you trying to create
a metaphor

659
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,208
or something between your dead dog
and my wife?

660
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:50,833
She was a female dog.

661
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:57,166
After the war,
all of my friends were dead.

662
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,458
And I...

663
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,583
spent my nights in a bar.

664
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,125
One day, another day.

665
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,916
Pamuk was always outside waiting. Always.

666
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,458
So you two were also in love,
and was she executed in front of you?

667
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yes.

668
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,208
What happened to Pamuk?

669
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:30,791
The boys from the village...

670
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,458
liked to play war.

671
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,458
So after a while,

672
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:41,833
without an enemy,
they got all bored of playing war.

673
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:43,375
One day,

674
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,625
they found some rocks.

675
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:49,291
They broke bottles...

676
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,375
and said my Pamuk

677
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:55,166
was the enemy.

678
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:00,916
I'm sorry.

679
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,958
She was a good dog.

680
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,083
Marseille, can you stop for a moment?
I need to... urinate.

681
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,541
Good piss?

682
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:48,625
Mmm-hm.

683
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:53,291
Pissing is a relief sometimes.

684
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:08,083
<i>Even though we were all in pain,
we couldn't lose sight of one fact:</i>

685
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:13,708
<i>our lives depended on what was happening
48 meters below the ground.</i>

686
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,958
<i>The plan had a very simple rule:</i>

687
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,416
<i>either we got the gold out,</i>

688
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:20,583
<i>or we were all dead.</i>

689
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,958
<i>No matter what was going on above,</i>

690
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:26,000
<i>the gold had to be taken out.</i>

691
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:30,000
<i>No matter what was going on above,
the gold had to be taken out.</i>

692
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:35,791
Move the lung.

693
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:37,916
<i>I want to see the lower part.</i>

694
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,416
<i>Lift it up.</i>

695
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:45,625
Colonel!

696
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:50,916
There's been an increase
in the flow of the electromagnetic signals

697
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,500
coming in and out of the bank.

698
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:55,416
Martínez, in clear terms, please.

699
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,250
They're communicating
with someone outside.

700
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:05,208
<i>Move the image closer. Good.</i>

701
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:08,500
Okay. We need to remove
the lower part of the lung.

702
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,791
<i>There's a risk of infection and necrosis.</i>

703
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,166
<i>It could cost her life.</i>

704
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,500
How are we gonna cut
part of her lung?

705
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:17,250
<i>- Do you have an electric scalpel?</i>
- Yes.

706
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:19,208
From the bandwidth,
it looks like a video call.

707
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:21,041
Can we see it?

708
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,625
The signal is encrypted.

709
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,000
I'd say
it’s going through a Kazakh satellite.

710
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,916
And from there, probably through
the deep web, but I'm not sure.

711
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,333
So let's take it down.

712
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:40,375
<i>Let's do it.
There's no time to waste.</i>

713
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:43,166
<i>Listen and follow my instructions
very closely.</i>

714
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:47,083
<i>- We're going to move slowly. Understood?</i>
- Understood.

715
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:48,166
Colonel...

716
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,267
If the satellite belonged
to a phone company in Spain,

717
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,934
- we'd have to request a temporary jam...
- I don't need you to tell me

718
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,083
what we can't do.

719
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:57,416
I told you to cut off
their little phone call.

720
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,750
<i>If a vessel gets cut,
we remove the scalpel</i>

721
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:04,000
<i>- and close with Kocher forceps.</i>
- Understood.

722
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,625
We'd have to jam every signal in the area,

723
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:09,833
take down the Internet and anything
going through satellites.

724
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,291
Like in Egypt in 2011.

725
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,375
Do it.

726
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,583
<i>Let's make the first incision.</i>

727
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:18,833
<i>- Can you see the lingula?</i>
- What's a lingula?

728
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,750
<i>It's the lower part of the lung...</i>

729
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:23,416
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What happened?

730
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,750
You've gotta be kidding!

731
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:29,958
What happened?

732
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,750
- There's no return signal.
- What?

733
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:35,916
Oh, fuck!

734
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:42,000
We can't reach the doctor! It's down!

735
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,083
What do we do?

736
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,958
Her blood pressure's dropping.
We're about to lose her!

737
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:49,041
No, no, no, no. Fuck!
