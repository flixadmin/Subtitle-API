1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,388
- Hey, Darla. How you doing today?
- Hey, Dan.

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:18,310
- I'm looking for something in a Markowski.
- That'd be Dennis Markowski?

3
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,187
That's the one.

4
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,610
Oh, and I've got my paralegal
with me today.

5
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,029
Paralegal? Coming up in the world.

6
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,739
You know it.

7
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,093
Hey, Dennis.

8
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,052
Have a seat.

9
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,163
You hear about Chow?

10
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,960
- Yeah, people say he skipped town.
- He's dead.

11
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,462
It wasn't me.

12
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,299
It wasn't a message.
It wasn't payback.

13
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,386
It was a mistake made by a third party
who has since been dealt with.

14
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,679
You got it?

15
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,347
- Yeah.
- Second thing.

16
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,601
The deal you had with Fring,
it's still in place.

17
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,019
Okay.

18
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,812
Don't "okay" me.

19
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,897
You got something to say?

20
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,694
Mike, I'm keeping my mouth shut.

21
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,654
The laundry was right above the lab.

22
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,864
There's no way I could say
I wasn't in on it.

23
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,159
I'm looking at eight years minimum.

24
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,162
But I'm doing my time
like I'm supposed to.

25
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,289
I'm no rat, and you know it.

26
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,541
I mean, what else is there to say?

27
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,043
All due respect,
what are we talking about here?

28
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,338
The deal is the deal.

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,093
How's the deal the deal?

30
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,471
The feds took away my hazard pay.

31
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,683
My wife asks me where the mortgage
is coming from. I got nothing to tell her.

32
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,393
I knew the risks. We all did.

33
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,145
But that wasn't the deal.

34
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,231
And I know for a fact
they got Holt and Perez yesterday.

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,140
Now, it's not gonna be me,
but absent the hazard pay

36
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,529
- sooner or later, someone's gonna flip.
- No one's flipping.

37
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,199
Everyone gets their hazard pay,
including you.

38
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,536
I appreciate what you're saying and all,
but the man is dead.

39
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,955
Okay? The lab's a hole in the ground.

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,250
- I just don't see it.
- I've got something new.

41
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,379
It's just starting up.
It's gonna make you whole.

42
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,714
Something new?
With the feds looking at you?

43
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,800
- How?
- "How" is my business.

44
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,052
Hanging tight's your business.

45
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,431
Your family's gonna be fine.
You will be made whole.

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,684
Now, you got my word.

47
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,811
You need more?

48
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,817
No, Mike. I'm good.

49
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,781
- Who's next?
- That's your choice.

50
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,867
A.P.D.'s got Martinez across town.
McGann's up in Sandoval.

51
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,620
The Sandia tribal cops
are holding him for the feds.

52
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,874
And Holt and Perez
are in lockup in Los Lunas.

53
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,419
You don't mean to get to them all today?

54
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,254
Yeah, I do.

55
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,507
Hey, let's go! Open up!

56
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,636
{\an8}Back here.

57
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,784
{\an8}Oh, hi. How was your day?

58
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,413
{\an8}Are you moving back in?

59
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,958
{\an8}Yeah. I'll keep the condo for now.

60
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,628
{\an8}Selling it in this market,
I'd get killed.

61
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,089
{\an8}But, yeah, I'm home.

62
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,800
{\an8}It's time.

63
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,555
Do you really think that's a good idea?

64
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,683
{\an8}Yes.

65
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,588
{\an8}So you bring him here? Come on.

66
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,797
The three of us, we're the three amigos.

67
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,218
All for one, one for all.

68
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,054
{\an8}We don't need a fourth amigo.

69
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,933
{\an8}Saul, Mike knows the business.
He knows distributors.

70
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,561
- Mike's okay.
- He's okay?

71
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,479
{\an8}He said he was gonna break my legs.

72
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,023
{\an8}And don't tell me
he didn't mean it, okay?

73
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,932
{\an8}Because he gave me
the dead mackerel eyes. He meant it.

74
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,445
{\an8}Saul, Mike threatened me.
He threatened Jesse.

75
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,615
He probably threatened someone
before breakfast this morning.

76
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,702
It's what he does.
Come on. Grow a pair.

77
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,374
{\an8}Let it be noted
that I do this under duress.

78
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,793
Duly noted.

79
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,631
{\an8}All right. Let him in, Huell.

80
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,105
{\an8}Mike, I'm extending you...

81
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,943
{\an8}Now that we're all together,
here are the ground rules.

82
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,322
{\an8}Division of labor.
I handle the business.

83
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,949
{\an8}Making the stuff, that's your end.

84
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,369
I don't tell you how to mix
your chemicals and whatnot,

85
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,624
and you do not tell me
how to take care of business.

86
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,668
Is that absolutely clear?

87
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,053
{\an8}- Sure.
- All right. Let's take the tour.

88
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,532
Hey, you're okay with that?

89
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,519
Yes.

90
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,607
He handles the business,
and I handle him.

91
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,906
Clearly, we're talking
about renting, not buying.

92
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,826
{\an8}You need an ongoing business,
someplace you can slide in

93
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,330
{\an8}do your thing and remain anonymous.
I'm not gonna mince words.

94
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,666
{\an8}This is your best bet.

95
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:42,170
{\an8}Got machines running, forklifts,
people coming and going.

96
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,881
{\an8}You're gonna stay way under the radar.

97
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,635
{\an8}And the owner's solid. He can't
wait to throw up a curtain wall

98
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,929
{\an8}stack some boxes in front of it,
give you the space you need.

99
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,640
{\an8}After that, he's got his business,
you've got yours,

100
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,434
{\an8}and never the twain shall meet.

101
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,728
It's outstanding. Am I right?

102
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,773
Machines like this,
gotta be plenty of power.

103
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,191
What about the smell?

104
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,901
More good news.

105
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,321
I've been here when it's up and running.
This place stinks already.

106
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,573
{\an8}- You'll blend right in.
- How many employees?

107
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,741
{\an8}I knew you'd ask.

108
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,455
{\an8}Sixteen illegals, all highly motivated
to stay deaf, blind and dumb.

109
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,374
{\an8}You'll want to vet them, I'm sure.

110
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,751
{\an8}Yes, indeed.

111
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,878
{\an8}So, what do you say, maestro?

112
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,714
{\an8}Is it unanimous?

113
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,072
You know, I worked in a box factory
one summer in high school,

114
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,679
and I haven't seen one of these in years.

115
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,737
Trip down memory lane.
That's perfect.

116
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,224
You know what this is?

117
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,226
It's a corrugator.

118
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:42,272
It uses steam and salt to crimp
kraft paper for cardboard.

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,859
And it makes a hell of a racket doing it,
which is great. Right?

120
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,527
No.

121
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,779
Steam and salt.

122
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,074
When this thing is running,
it's like a jungle in here.

123
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,036
Shit. It'll ruin the product.

124
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:02,083
You can't just pop down to Costco
and get a couple dehumidifiers?

125
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,212
What...? Fine. Fine. Moving on.

126
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:15,346
Spacious, isolated location, no humidity,

127
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,099
and you get all
the free tortillas you want.

128
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,560
That's the special feature of this place.

129
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,771
I don't know.

130
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,231
It'll make the tortillas
smell like cat piss.

131
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,859
Somebody's bound to notice that.

132
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,279
All right. Well, there's gotta be
some kind of workaround, right?

133
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,115
It's a technical problem.
You guys are technical guys.

134
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,492
You know, be creative.
Put your heads together.

135
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,497
Anything food-related is gonna have
unannounced government inspections.

136
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,175
All I'm asking
is that you keep an open mind.

137
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,720
Danny's already set some space aside
behind the Skee-Ball games.

138
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,599
- No.
- Hell, no.

139
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,068
I know it's a long shot.

140
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,279
{\an8}All I can say to recommend this

141
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:18,493
{\an8}is we're talking about an owner here who
is, how should I put it, highly amenable.

142
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,542
Look, I get it. Just say no
and we'll go get dinner.

143
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,961
All right. So I'll start.

144
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,838
No way we're cooking in here.

145
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,841
No space, nowhere for the smell to go.

146
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,594
Look at that door. That thing rolls up
and we're open to the world.

147
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,503
I don't know if anybody noticed,

148
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,057
but there's a cop shop
a quarter of a mile away.

149
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,894
The hammer comes down,
it's gonna be Custer's Last Stand.

150
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,401
- It's perfect.
- What?

151
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,778
How are we gonna fit a lab in here?

152
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,157
Who said here?

153
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,840
A house is infested.

154
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,968
Termites, cockroaches, whatever.

155
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,430
Homeowners hire a pest control company.

156
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,683
Truck rolls up, homeowners leave.

157
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,810
The crew tents the house.

158
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:29,480
They bomb the place with poison.

159
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,524
The house stays like that for days.

160
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,943
No one looks twice at a tented house.

161
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,653
Now, maybe there's a strange smell
coming out of it.

162
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,637
Does someone think to investigate? No.

163
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,033
Does anyone go inside? Hell, no.

164
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,914
And that's where we'll cook.

165
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,711
They tent, what,
three, four houses a week?

166
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,172
So we pick the one that's best for us.

167
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,383
Enough floor space, easy access.

168
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:01,136
Once the tent is up,
we go in, we cook a batch

169
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,473
we bomb the place and leave.

170
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,935
So we gotta move
in and out for every cook?

171
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,772
Set up a lab, cook,
and then take everything down?

172
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,109
It's challenging, but doable.

173
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,487
Tell me about these guys.

174
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:24,159
Mr. Ponytail on the sidewalk, that's Ira.
He's the owner. On the roof is Sandor.

175
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,246
The ladder's Fernando,
and down below, that's Todd.

176
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:31,249
The pest control operation is legit.
I mean, they're licensed, they're bonded.

177
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,627
They do as good a job as anyone in town.

178
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,547
But they're also top-drawer
second-story men.

179
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,758
- "Second-story"?
- B and E artists.

180
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,885
They're burglars.

181
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,993
Yeah. I mean, hey, they play it smart.

182
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:46,556
They don't boost anything
while they're on the job.

183
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,852
They copy the keys,
locate the valuables and alarms,

184
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,273
and they sell that information to other
crews. Or, after a decent interval

185
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:58,027
- they'll lift the goods themselves.
- And you know them how?

186
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:03,407
Oh, I've been pulling their chestnuts out of
the fire, legally speaking, for five years.

187
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,202
Ira and his guys are good. I mean,
they know how to keep their mouths shut.

188
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,579
And if you buy them,
they're gonna stay bought.

189
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,665
You can check into them yourself.

190
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,294
I will, if it comes to that.

191
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:18,297
So do we take a vote?

192
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,426
Why?

193
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:03,174
- We sound great.
- Rock on, man. Solid.

194
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,761
That Yamaha's got a real nice touch.

195
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:08,472
You like the sound? It's huge, huh?

196
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,808
Yeah, it's real nice, but we're looking
for something else today.

197
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,185
- You got any roadie cases?
- For sure. What size?

198
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,646
Biggest you got.

199
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,304
That'll fit through, like,
a regular-size doorway.

200
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,067
You got it. Follow me.

201
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:24,905
Top of the line.

202
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,659
Recessed hardware, foam lining,
quarter-inch laminated walls

203
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,661
3-inch casters.

204
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,998
Height is good, width is good.
How much weight will this hold?

205
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,959
It's rated for 900 pounds.

206
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,254
So unless your band plays lead bricks,
you should be okay.

207
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,425
We're gonna need...

208
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,636
Hey, man, I'm trying to do business
over here, bitch.

209
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,848
Sorry. He's, like, overly enthusiastic.

210
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,268
Anyway, I'm gonna need four of them.

211
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,176
Four? That gonna be layaway? Because
I need to see a bunch of IDs for that.

212
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,940
No, man, cash.

213
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,817
Okay. Hey, you know what?

214
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:05,154
I'll throw in stenciling.
What's your band called?

215
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,666
Damn, brother.

216
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,378
Not asking no questions, but it sure
looks like you're back in business.

217
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,922
No joke.
You way back in business, man.

218
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,632
Look at this.

219
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,676
Yeah.

220
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,138
You're stacking the benjies
till the rubber band pops.

221
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,432
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,351
All's we're saying is
we know you're major league now,

223
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,937
but if there's ever anything else
you need from us...

224
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,440
Any way we can get in on this at all.

225
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,942
Little stuff, big stuff...

226
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,236
We would be all over it.

227
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:51,200
You know, maybe someday.

228
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,623
That's cool.
I guess we better hit it then.

229
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,750
Yeah. Keep on keeping on, brother.

230
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,251
Later.

231
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,757
<i>Okay, it is the same job as always.</i>

232
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:10,552
You go out, you inspect, you deal
with the customers, regular drill.

233
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:15,182
Everything's the same,
except for one important detail.

234
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,857
- No stealing.
- No stealing.

235
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,277
Not a toothpick, not the spare change
between the couch cushions

236
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,611
not the panties out of the hamper.
Nothing. And I mean nothing.

237
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:34,576
If you're out with your buddies and they
ask if you got a hot tip on a B and E

238
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,287
you tell them you got nada.
You're out of the game.

239
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:41,291
The bottom line is that these houses
are out of bounds, now and forever.

240
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,002
Got it?

241
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,546
All right.

242
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,465
From time to time,
you're gonna see these two.

243
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,093
Now, as far as you're concerned,
they are ghosts.

244
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,293
You don't see them.
You don't hear them.

245
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:54,878
You don't say "good morning."

246
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,267
You don't speak unless you're spoken to.

247
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,479
On the other hand,
if they tell you to jump

248
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,941
you don't ask what for, you jump.

249
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:07,693
Now, you need a name for them?

250
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,572
You call them "Yes, sir" and "No, sir."

251
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,369
You got any problems, you come to me.

252
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,789
Here's the deal.
The finishing tank's a tight fit.

253
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,293
- And with this motor you've got on top...
- The agitation motor.

254
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:28,213
The agitation motor here on top,
the tank's not gonna fit in the box.

255
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,466
It's just... It's just too tall.

256
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,225
You know, I thought we'd put
a collar on the tank,

257
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,806
and carry the motor in separately,
alongside the condenser.

258
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,727
And on the day,
we just kind of twist it into place

259
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,062
you know, while we're setting up.

260
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,316
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

261
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,651
- That's good.
- Yeah.

262
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,278
That will work.

263
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:53,739
And Joe and his guys can build it, right?

264
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,659
Yeah. You know, they're up for it.

265
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,495
Joe already bought a TIG welder
for the aluminum work.

266
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:05,709
And, you know, I figure if they can
pull off the magnet, they can handle this.

267
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,587
Now, listen, about the smell...

268
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:12,090
About keeping it out of people's drapes
and furniture and whatnot...

269
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,967
When I was down in Mexico

270
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,638
there was this big, big,
plastic hospital tent

271
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,057
they set up inside of the...

272
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,100
Oh, shit. Sorry.

273
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,771
Oh, hi. Sorry.

274
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,898
No, no, no. We were just wrapping up.

275
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:31,485
- This is my...
- Friend. Hi. Walt.

276
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,195
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

277
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,948
This is Brock.

278
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,908
Hi, Brock. I'm Walt.

279
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,910
I've heard a lot about you.

280
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,161
- Hi.
- Hi.

281
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,270
I understand you were in the hospital.

282
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,708
And Jesse told me
that you were very brave.

283
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,087
Yeah. A man of few words.

284
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,695
I'm sorry. He mostly just wants
to play his game.

285
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,257
Oh, I know that.

286
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,594
I have two of my own. A boy and a girl.

287
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,847
Well, I should go.

288
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,850
I was thinking I could make us
all some dinner.

289
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,727
Are you sure you don't wanna...?

290
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,689
Yeah. Why don't you stay
for a beer at least?

291
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,734
Sure. Why not? A beer sounds good.

292
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,319
Thank you.

293
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:14,671
- How are you today, sir?
- We're good. Good. How are you?

294
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,029
- Family all packed up, ready to go?
- Yeah.

295
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,470
Here you're acknowledging
that you've removed all pets,

296
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,514
and plants from the house
and that food has been removed,

297
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:27,767
or double-sealed in the bags we provided.

298
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:32,022
This acknowledges you've removed or
bagged any medicine, tobacco, pet food.

299
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,815
Better make sure
you got any medicine you might need.

300
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,484
- It's already in the car.
- Okay.

301
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,696
Holy crap.
How much poison are you using?

302
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:42,574
It's not how much,
it's getting it where it's needed.

303
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:44,492
Those are your foggers.

304
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,994
They disperse the fumigate
into the structure

305
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:49,428
where it'll eliminate any nymphs
or larvae

306
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,791
as well as the full-grown blattodea.

307
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,836
So do we have all your keys?

308
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,213
Any extras on here
you might wind up needing?

309
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,882
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

310
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,140
This last one here acknowledges
that you have been informed

311
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,387
that you may not reenter the premises

312
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,171
until it has cleared
the post-fumigation inspection.

313
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,482
So you're gonna get them all, right?

314
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:12,604
We'll kill them dead.
That's a guarantee.

315
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,937
Sir? Sir?

316
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,148
Yes?

317
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:01,194
There's a nanny cam
in the living-room clock.

318
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,780
I disabled it.
I just thought you should know.

319
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,869
- What's your name?
- Todd, sir.

320
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,052
Cheers.

321
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,936
You know, I've gotta say

322
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:26,274
seeing you with Andrea
and that little boy...

323
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,776
It was nice.

324
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,571
- Yeah. It's good, right?
- Yeah.

325
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:33,865
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

326
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,326
And the way she looks at you...

327
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,996
- You think?
- Oh, definitely.

328
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:49,964
So is it moving
in any particular direction?

329
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:53,760
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah.
You know, sometimes I think

330
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:55,428
you know

331
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,056
if it feels right, then...

332
00:25:58,264 --> 00:26:00,016
If it feels right, it feels right.

333
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,770
Sometimes you just
gotta listen to your gut.

334
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:07,940
I mean, instant family.

335
00:26:08,524 --> 00:26:10,443
What more can you ask, right?

336
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,403
Absolutely.

337
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,239
<i>Cut the cards.</i>

338
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:19,577
Have you thought about what your plan is?

339
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,998
You know, vis-à-vis honesty?

340
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,252
You mean how much she knows about this?

341
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,384
She doesn't know anything.

342
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,721
I mean, you know, she's not stupid.
She knows I'm into something, but...

343
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,307
She could make a pretty good guess.

344
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,267
But I never told her anything.

345
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,645
I'm not gonna.

346
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:47,605
Okay.

347
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:51,067
I mean it.

348
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,736
I know you do.

349
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,074
Jesse, I can't pretend that this
doesn't affect me. It does.

350
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:02,912
But with everything that
we've been through, the two of us

351
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,332
this has to be your decision.

352
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,126
I mean, you've earned that.

353
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,878
Seriously?

354
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,256
Yeah.

355
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:20,430
Secrets create barriers between people.

356
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:24,642
I'm speaking from experience, believe me.

357
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:28,438
All that you've done

358
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:31,315
it's a part of you, and...

359
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,994
I mean, if you choose to spend
the rest of your life with this person

360
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:44,244
then you'll have to decide
how much you'll share with her.

361
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,625
Meaning what? Like everything?

362
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:53,963
Like Gale?

363
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,806
I'm just trying to say that I trust you...

364
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,400
and I know you'll make the right call.

365
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:19,071
If she loves you

366
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,532
she'll understand.

367
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:26,370
They're leaving streaks.

368
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:30,249
This more ethnic-looking one,
he's doing a great job,

369
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,378
but the other one is going back
and forth like he's scrubbing a wall.

370
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:38,174
They have to go in circles,

371
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:40,218
or you're going to leave streaks.

372
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:42,845
That's pretty basic, right?

373
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:46,516
I don't mean to tell you your business.

374
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:50,978
It's just... It's simple quality control.

375
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:57,985
So I've got some good news.

376
00:28:58,277 --> 00:28:59,445
Guess what.

377
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,364
What?

378
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,575
No, really. I want you to guess.

379
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,830
- Marie, I really...
- Okay. Hank's back at work.

380
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,541
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

381
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,918
Sure, they love him now, but where
were they when he needed them?

382
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:18,005
Merkert and all the rest,
they laughed him out of the office

383
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,425
when he told them about that chicken man.

384
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,554
As far as I'm concerned,
too little too late.

385
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:27,062
If it were me, I'd tell them all
to go to hell.

386
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,433
Do I sound bitter?

387
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,519
But it's what he wants, right?

388
00:29:31,727 --> 00:29:33,396
Yeah, it's doing him good.

389
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:37,191
I mean, his PT is going gangbusters.

390
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,110
He's hardly using his cane at all.

391
00:29:39,318 --> 00:29:42,071
And thank you for that, really.

392
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,326
I mean, God knows where he'd be
if we had to go through his health plan.

393
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,620
I'm just glad he's feeling better.

394
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,374
So, speaking of which,
we have another big event coming up.

395
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,733
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

396
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,087
Walt's birthday.

397
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,506
Whatever you need, I'm here.

398
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,676
Yeah. I...

399
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,178
I don't think we're gonna
do anything this year.

400
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,097
What are you talking about?

401
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,099
Of course we're gonna do something.

402
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,811
Skyler, he was diagnosed
around his birthday, right?

403
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,354
I...

404
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,398
So it's been a whole year.

405
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,557
Listen, I've had my problems with Walt.

406
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,778
Why he wouldn't come to the house
when we were all practically...

407
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,512
Whatever. Water under the bridge.

408
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,164
But at this point, every year is precious.
We are...

409
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,743
What are you doing?

410
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,873
You don't smoke.
You haven't smoked since college.

411
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,458
You can't be serious!

412
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,252
With the baby and Walt?

413
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,797
You're not smoking around the baby,
are you? And you can't smoke here.

414
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,381
There's gotta be some rule
or regulation, I'm sure.

415
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,302
You can't force your employees
to breathe secondhand smoke.

416
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:51,349
- I know for a fact that that is illegal.
- Marie, shut up.

417
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:53,809
What? I'm sorry

418
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,854
please don't speak to me like that.
I am simply saying...

419
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,690
Will you shut up?
Shut the hell up.

420
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,443
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

421
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,570
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Please stop...

422
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,281
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

423
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,408
Shut up! Shut up!

424
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,619
Shut up!

425
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,550
That's 5.23.

426
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,053
Five-point-two-three.

427
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,555
Last one.

428
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,726
Five-point-two-six.

429
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,770
Five-point-two-six.

430
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:42,067
That comes to 49.27.

431
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,444
Good yield, right?

432
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,364
That is an excellent yield.

433
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,909
All right.

434
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,448
Hey, Marie.

435
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,869
How you doing?

436
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,918
- Where is Skyler?
- In the bedroom. She's resting.

437
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,505
Is everything okay?

438
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:49,592
- Breakdown? What does that mean?
- It means I don't know what else to call it.

439
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,096
But I've never seen her like that, ever.

440
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,517
Well, what did she say
when she was yelling?

441
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,935
Nothing.

442
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:03,982
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up,"
over and over again.

443
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,665
Did you know she's smoking?

444
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,612
Occasionally, maybe.
It's not a regular thing.

445
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:15,201
- I just wish I had gotten your message.
- Messages, Walt.

446
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,830
Plural. I probably called you five times.

447
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,767
I'm not leaving here until I know
what's got her so upset.

448
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,216
Are you gambling again?
Is that what this is?

449
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,221
Please, God,
tell me the cancer isn't back.

450
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,474
No.

451
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,311
- It's not the cancer.
- Well, something happened.

452
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,107
I don't mean to point the finger,
but this didn't just come out of nowhere.

453
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,959
It's time to tell me the truth, Walt.
All of it.

454
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,572
I mean it.

455
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,700
You're right.

456
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,502
You heard about Ted Beneke?

457
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,128
The accident?

458
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,339
What accident?

459
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:18,515
A couple weeks back,
Ted took a fall, a bad one.

460
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,808
He gave himself a concussion,

461
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,394
and fractured a couple vertebrae.

462
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,480
He's still in the hospital.

463
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,940
He may never walk again.

464
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:32,195
Oh, my God. I didn't know.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

465
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,655
Yeah.

466
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:39,661
But that couldn't explain Skyler's...

467
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,790
Yes. Yes, it could.

468
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,589
You do know, right? You...

469
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,841
You must know.

470
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,096
Oh, God.

471
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,809
She was having an affair.

472
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,228
With Ted Beneke.

473
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,897
Listen. It wasn't...

474
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,652
It wasn't ongoing or anything, and...

475
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,157
Skyler and I have been trying

476
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,535
to put things back together.

477
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:25,123
And then the accident happened,
and she got...

478
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,378
Marie, I'm begging you.
Please keep this to yourself.

479
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,924
I don't want Hank to think less of her.
Or me.

480
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,054
When did you...?

481
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,059
Was she...? I'm gonna go.

482
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,811
Okay. All right.

483
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,586
Thank you.

484
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,338
- I'm sorr...
- No.

485
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,624
<i>That looked nasty.</i>

486
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,437
Hey, you okay?

487
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,606
I'm good.

488
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,986
Really?

489
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,697
Yeah.

490
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,689
<i>Come on. You wanna fuck with me?
Okay.</i>

491
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,525
<i>You little cockroaches.</i>

492
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,110
Dad, wait.

493
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:03,406
<i>You wanna play games?
Okay. I play with you. Come on.</i>

494
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,950
- This is it.
- Wait. Wait for it.

495
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,580
- Ready?
- <i>You wanna play rough? Okay!</i>

496
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,250
- <i>Say hello to my little friend!</i>
- "Say hello to my little friend."

497
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,170
Nice. Just...

498
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,173
Hey, Mom, feeling better?

499
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,031
Hey. Hey, why don't you join us,
if you feel up to it?

500
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,762
We have popcorn.
I think there's some pizza left.

501
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,555
If you're up to it.

502
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,141
Yeah, Mom. Join us.

503
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,520
- Oh, my God. Look. Look.
- <i>You whores!</i>

504
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,773
Everyone dies in this movie, don't they?

505
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,205
Okay.

506
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,081
For you and you and me.

507
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,293
Three hundred and sixty-seven thousand
dollars each.

508
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,504
Wait a minute.

509
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,506
After the dealers got their cut

510
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:08,221
we should be looking at 1,379,560.

511
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,890
Mike, you're short.

512
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,975
You're almost 300,000 short.

513
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,234
You're forgetting about the mules.
They get a flat 20 percent.

514
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,688
- The what?
- The drivers.

515
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,234
They're the ones that take the product
from us to the dealers.

516
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:27,156
And so transportation
is worth 20 percent?

517
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,325
They're taking a risk.

518
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,497
Two hundred and seventy-five thousand
dollars' worth of risk?

519
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,294
What did Gus pay his mules?

520
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,005
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.

521
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,423
He didn't need them.

522
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,593
He spent 20 years
building his own distribution.

523
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,013
He had 16 refrigerator trucks
running his product.

524
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,349
And do you know where they are now?

525
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,226
Government impound.

526
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,979
You don't like paying 20 percent?
Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.

527
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,024
Hey, hey. There's still over
a million bucks here, all right?

528
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,151
That's for one cook.

529
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,737
And since you're putting on
the green eyeshade

530
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,990
my supplier and I came to an agreement.

531
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,284
The methylamine is free this time.

532
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,621
But brace yourself, because
the next barrel is gonna cost big.

533
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,209
Can we continue, or you got any more
burning questions?

534
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,714
Okay, kid.

535
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,466
You fronted us 120 to get us going.

536
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:33,180
So that's 40 from him and me.

537
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,266
One hundred and twenty.

538
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,310
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.

539
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,520
Okay.

540
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:43,691
Now, Ira gets 110
for our piece of the business,

541
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,068
and 25 per cook.

542
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,155
That is 45

543
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,824
from each of us.

544
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,875
Ira's guys get 10 each per cook.

545
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,843
Goodman's cut, 18,000 from each.

546
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,230
Legacy cost, $351,000.

547
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,274
That's 117,000 each.

548
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,984
"Legacy cost"?

549
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,778
I got nine guys.

550
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,239
You don't know them, but they were
part of the previous operation,

551
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,534
and they know a lot.
And right now, some of them are in jail,

552
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:39,205
and more will be soon.
The feds RICO-ed their hazard pay.

553
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,792
So we are gonna make them whole.

554
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,753
We are gonna make them whole?

555
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,546
What is this "we"?

556
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,132
These were Gus' employees, not ours.

557
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,636
They might have been Gus' employees,
but they're my guys.

558
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:58,265
So, what are they doing
to further our interests?

559
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,560
The cops are looking at them
very closely.

560
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,064
We don't want them
furthering our interests.

561
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,776
So we are paying them, why?

562
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:13,072
Because it's what you do.

563
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,535
It's what you do.

564
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,832
My guys are keeping their mouths shut.

565
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,500
We make them whole.

566
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:28,462
One hand washes the other.
It's as simple as that.

567
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,298
It sounds like a simple shakedown

568
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,551
simple as that.

569
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,762
We're paying for their silence.
That's blackmail.

570
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,641
Business is my end.

571
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,228
This is business. End of story.

572
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,192
This is your problem.
It should come out of your end.

573
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,154
Hey. Hey. Just take it out of mine.

574
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,407
All right? Go for it.

575
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,160
I don't care. Just take it.

576
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,338
No. Jesse, thank you,

577
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,674
but no.

578
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,342
I'll pay my share.

579
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,928
Go ahead.

580
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,853
Let me tell you something.

581
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,523
This

582
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:35,071
is how it's gonna be from here on out.

583
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,742
My guys are an ongoing expenditure,

584
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,245
so you best get yourself
comfortable with it.

585
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,508
A hundred and thirty-seven thousand.

586
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,888
That's less than with Fring.

587
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,519
Listen, Walter.
Just because you shot Jesse James

588
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,106
don't make you Jesse James.

589
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,115
Tomorrow.

590
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,757
How are you feeling?

591
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,676
Okay, I guess.

592
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,513
Broke it off with Andrea.

593
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,890
I had to.

594
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,351
She's gonna tell Brock.

595
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,147
I'm still gonna take care
of the rent and stuff.

596
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,943
- It's the right thing to do, but, you know...
- I meant this.

597
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,362
How are you feeling about the money?

598
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,630
You're looking at it wrong.
When we worked for Gus

599
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,035
we were cooking 200 pounds a week.

600
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,664
This last batch was great,
but we didn't even crack 50 pounds.

601
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:13,294
We maybe cleared less money,
but we got a bigger piece of the pie.

602
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,632
It's like you said, we're owners,
not employees.

603
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,388
I've been thinking about Victor.

604
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,724
Yeah?

605
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,934
Yeah.

606
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,104
All this time

607
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:35,441
I was sure that Gus did what he did

608
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,526
to send me a message.

609
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,072
Maybe there's another reason.

610
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,575
Like what?

611
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,914
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

612
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,374
Taking liberties
that weren't his to take?

613
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,588
Maybe he flew too close to the sun

614
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,299
got his throat cut.
