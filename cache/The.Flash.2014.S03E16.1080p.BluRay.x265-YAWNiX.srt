1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,847
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,811
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,281
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,091
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,525
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,728
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,882
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,645
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,770
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,361
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,927
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,050
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,727
<i>The night that Savitar kills you,
you didn't have a ring on your finger.</i>

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,881
<i>We weren't engaged yet.</i>

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,804
So you thought that if we were...

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,325
<i>That it might change the future.</i>

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,000
Now there's always gonna be a part of us
that's tainted.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,646
<i>Why is Savitar hiding
in the Speed Force?</i>

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,569
- That's where the future you trapped him.
- That's right.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,485
I have what I need
to escape my hell, Wallace.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,120
Not everything,
we still have a piece of that Stone.

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,209
It's gone?
If Savitar gets a hold of the Stone...

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,361
He'll escape for sure.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,921
You cannot get rid of that Stone, Wallace.

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,045
You're not fast enough to throw it
into the Speed Force by yourself!

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,487
Wally has taken up my place
in the Speed Force.

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,810
We have to bring him back.
We have to save him.

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,167
My fear's the reason for all of this.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,843
<i>Savitar was right.
This is all because of me,</i>

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,609
<i>because of my weakness, Flashpoint.</i>

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,570
<i>And because of it,
everyone's lives have changed.</i>

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,569
<i>Everyone I love is suffering.</i>

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,366
<i>This has to stop.</i>

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,527
<i>I can't let anyone hurt anymore
because of me.</i>

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,207
<i>No one else should have to pay
for my sins.</i>

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,120
<i>And they won't.</i>

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,085
<i>Never again.</i>

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,281
Cisco,

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,890
get the breach room ready.

40
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,283
Okay, for what?

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,885
I'm gonna save Wally.

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,561
How exactly are you gonna do that?

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,329
I'm going back into the Speed Force.

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,806
I'm just trying to wrap my mind around
you going into the Speed Force again.

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,204
Savitar said he was there for years.

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,290
- You said it was like being in space.
- I know.

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,169
So what are you gonna do?
You're gonna run in there

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,850
and run around till you find him?

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,809
- It's endless.
- I know.

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,169
- And this is the only way to save Wally.
- Yeah, yeah, just...

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,164
We need a plan. I...

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,330
I don't wanna lose both of my sons.

53
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,207
Look, gang,
I don't understand the Speed Force,

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,409
but there are plenty of people
in this room who do.

55
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,642
Am I correct in assuming
there's a point coming?

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,241
My point is,
why can't you use your knowledge

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,210
to fashion some kind of safety precaution
for young B.A. right here,

58
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,091
so that while he's in the Speed Force,
he doesn't get lost?

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,882
So you're saying I can just whip up
some kind of inter-dimensional tether

60
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,610
to just anchor him to the universe?

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,081
Yeah.

62
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,966
- That's exactly what I can do.
- Yeah!

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,451
Now we're cooking with helium.

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,728
<i>Yes, and I can add a biological component</i>

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,604
that will measure his vitals
when he's in the Speed Force.

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,649
- That's a great idea.
- Thank you, Caitlin.

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,370
Because if we can monitor Barry's vitals,

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,648
we'll know if they fluctuate,
and we can pull him out.

69
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,086
You mean, pull us out.

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,842
Yeah, if you're going in there
to save Wally, so am I.

71
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,286
Jesse, you're gonna stay here.

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,444
Because if your father finds out
you're lost in some negative world,

73
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,126
the first person to get
a broken schnoz is me.

74
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,163
- Did you say, "Negative world"?
- A negative world.

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,721
Really?

76
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,723
- They have <i>Super Mario</i> on Earth-19?
- Yeah. Challenge me.

77
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,242
Barry, you need my help.
Your shoulder is still broken.

78
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,129
It's okay. It's almost healed.

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,248
- No, look, I can do this.
- I know.

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,609
But I need you to stay here,
keep this city safe while I'm gone.

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,328
And this is something
I have to do alone, okay?

82
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,605
- Fine.
- Thank you.

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,649
Okay, let's get to work.

84
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,921
Can I talk to you?

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,126
Yeah.

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,051
I'm gonna find Wally.

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,247
Whatever's holding him,
Whatever's keeping him trapped in there,

88
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,606
I'm gonna get him back.

89
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,121
Okay.

90
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,521
Okay.

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,081
Iris,

92
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,801
did I lose you?

93
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,366
Barr.

94
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,121
What's going on?

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,730
Nothing, nothing. I'm just trying
to make her not worry so much.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,651
About Wally or you?

97
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,210
Joe, now is not the time, all right?

98
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,206
Look, you are about to risk your life

99
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,050
<i>to save her brother.</i>

100
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,887
I think now is the perfect time.

101
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,210
She's having doubts about us,

102
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,051
about marrying me.

103
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,004
Did she call off the engagement?

104
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,641
Guess I changed the future
one too many times.

105
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,005
I think that's gonna do it.

106
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,487
We should be able to use this
to keep track of Barry's vitals.

107
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,529
He'll play astronaut,
and we'll play Houston.

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,042
Right, but how exactly are you gonna track
his location when he's in the Speed Force?

109
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,043
Well, this is just a simple modification

110
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,089
from what we used
to get Barry out last time, so...

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,404
The electrode halo?

112
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,409
- Julian wasn't part of the team last time.
- Not yet.

113
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,688
Oh, right. You know that thing
we used to talk to Savitar?

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,921
<i>Yes.</i>

115
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,450
Meet the electrode halo.

116
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,287
So, basically, these two are linked
electromagnetically via Goldtooth.

117
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,601
“Goldtooth”?

118
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,765
Yeah, it's kind of the Cisco Ramon
inter-dimensional equivalent of Bluetooth.

119
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,921
Kind of proud of it.

120
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,481
Anyway, it gives us
all the relevant locus information,

121
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,409
no matter what corner
of the multi-verse Barry's stuck in.

122
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,291
And if Barry needs our help,
it'll stimulate Cisco's prefrontal cortex.

123
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,442
And I'll open a breach
and suck him back in.

124
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,291
Good Lord! Multi-verses, breaches, halos!

125
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,086
Easy-bloody-peasy.

126
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,523
By George, I think he's got it.

127
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,370
<i>Cisco, you about ready?</i>

128
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,926
Born ready.

129
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,806
Okay.

130
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,691
Here's to winging it.

131
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,931
"Winging it"? Wait. What do you mean?

132
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,651
Well, I mean, I don't really have a map
of the Speed Force,

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,847
so when I vibe Barry into it...

134
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,280
You have no idea where I'm gonna land.

135
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,131
But the good news is, if he gets stuck
on the wrong side of the tracks,

136
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,611
now we can fish him out.

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,006
Find my boy.

138
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,090
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

139
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,481
Thank you.

140
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,525
I love you, Iris.

141
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,126
I love you, too.

142
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,681
Are we ready?

143
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,120
Good to go.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,844
To infinity and beyond.

145
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,170
Okay, once I let go you're on your own.

146
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,086
Do it.

147
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,086
Good luck.

148
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,966
Wally?

149
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,406
Wally?

150
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,281
Hello?

151
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,445
Hey, Barr.

152
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,287
Why are you here?
Why did you come back to this place?

153
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,324
I'm here to save Wally West.

154
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,204
Ever the hero, huh, Barry?

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,764
It's my fault that he's trapped here.

156
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,121
Is it?

157
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,331
Where is Wally West?

158
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,242
He's not exactly here, per se.

159
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,529
<i>He's in the prison you created.</i>

160
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,084
Well, your future self, that is.

161
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,800
How do I get him out?

162
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,006
How do I get him out?

163
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,162
I think you'll find
we're not gonna be as accommodating

164
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,084
as we were the last time you visited us.

165
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,761
What the hell does that mean?

166
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,002
It means, things have changed.

167
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,650
We gave you your speed back

168
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,804
because you said you'd come to terms
with your mother's death.

169
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,561
But you lied to us.

170
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,009
- I...
- You went back in time and saved her.

171
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,642
And, in doing so, you created Flashpoint.

172
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,643
Zoom had just killed my father.

173
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,929
We know, and we understand,

174
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,244
which is why we allowed you to do that.

175
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,688
But choices have consequences,

176
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,890
and I'm afraid we can't let you make
any more choices like that.

177
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,964
Wally is just a kid.

178
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,360
He's a Flash.

179
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,886
He made his choice.

180
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,648
Now he has to live with it.
Just like you do.

181
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,040
I'm not going anywhere until Wally's free.

182
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,046
Then be prepared to spend
an eternity in here.

183
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,850
<i>Why would you order
a single espresso?</i>

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,047
It's got to be at least a double espresso.

185
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,202
I can go triple. Doesn't affect me at all.

186
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,880
- Frightening.
- I can have a quadruple, a sextuple.

187
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,284
Oh, there you are!
I'm gonna get us all coffees

188
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,851
because we got a lot of work to do,
you know.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,367
A lot of stuff to do.
It doesn't affect me, though.

190
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,887
- It doesn't affect me at all!
- Okay.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,809
- He scares me.
- Yeah.

192
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,047
I was wondering, do you think

193
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,641
you could use this
to track Savitar's location?

194
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,480
That's not a bad idea.

195
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,002
You know, I couldn't before
because he was in the Speed Force,

196
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,366
but now that he's out of it...

197
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,568
Feeling footloose and fancy-free,
I'm sure.

198
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,763
I'm sorry. You know what?
That was insensitive of me.

199
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,729
- It's fine.
- Okay, so,

200
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,041
let's say I find Savitar right now.

201
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,961
What are you gonna do about it?

202
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,921
I'm gonna go after him.

203
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,766
Jesse, are you out of your mind?

204
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,321
No, okay? I can't just sit here waiting.

205
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,806
You can, and you will.

206
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,007
We all will, and soon enough,

207
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,929
Barry's gonna get Wally
out of the Speed Force.

208
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,440
You don't know that.

209
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,126
Okay, we don't know anything.

210
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,681
The only thing we actually know
is that Savitar is out there,

211
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,325
and if we can, we have to find him

212
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,609
and send him right back
where he came from.

213
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,166
You're staying here.

214
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,801
Iris.

215
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,241
<i>I wrote that article.</i>

216
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,205
That used to be my byline,
but not anymore.

217
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,803
Well, 2024 is a long ways away.

218
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,564
Things could still change.

219
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,171
What if it's too late?

220
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,649
What if some things can't be undone?

221
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,930
You having second thoughts?

222
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,569
I guess I'm just worried...

223
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,889
that I made the wrong decision.

224
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,526
And what?

225
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,162
You think that calling things off

226
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,171
sent Barry running into the Speed Force?

227
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,841
I mean, please,

228
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,851
we both know that he was gonna go
save Wally, no matter what.

229
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,642
Yeah, that's just the kind of hero he is.

230
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,604
Sweetheart, I know... I know how you feel.

231
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,001
You can't figure out
which Way's up right now, can you?

232
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,405
Do yourself a favor.

233
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,246
Look deep inside
that big beautiful heart of yours.

234
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,930
You'll find the answer you're looking for.

235
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,011
Eddie Thawne's life
was almost so different.

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,048
Iris was about to be his wife.

237
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,527
Joe was about to be his father-in-law.

238
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,045
<i>But things didn't turn out that way,
did they, Barry?</i>

239
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,327
Instead of that life being his legacy,

240
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,526
this is.

241
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,321
So the only reason you came back
is to save Wally?

242
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,561
Yes.

243
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,925
There's no other reason?

244
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,886
No.

245
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,766
All right, then, Barr,

246
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,408
if you want Wally, all you need to do
is go through those doors.

247
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,042
But you're gonna have to outrun
that thing first.

248
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,531
Time Wraith.

249
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:30,555
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

250
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,920
Caitlin.

251
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,205
That baby...

252
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,881
is she...

253
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,801
<i>Beautiful.</i>

254
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,520
Just like her mother.

255
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,041
Ronnie.

256
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,926
Hello, Barry.

257
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,881
We need to talk.

258
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,281
Perhaps, some sort of new metal,
akin to a Luttinger liquid?

259
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,967
What do you think?

260
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,401
Man, I don't know what this is.

261
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,201
All I know, it just came off the armor
of some Hindu speed god, so...

262
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,050
It's like the box
the Philosopher's Stone came in.

263
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,607
It simultaneously exists
and doesn't exist.

264
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,330
Like Schroeder's cat!

265
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,761
Remember Schroeder,
the guy with the cat in the box,

266
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,241
both dead and alive at the same time?

267
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,529
Which, by the way, seems like
cruelty for animals half the time.

268
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,327
Okay, I think you're thinking
of Schrodinger maybe?

269
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,931
- "Schroding..." No.
- Yeah.

270
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,684
Because Schroeder's the guy from Peanuts.

271
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,411
Mmm, I don't think so.

272
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,244
- Yeah, the one with the piano.
- Yeah.

273
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,731
Charlie Brown has the piano on my Earth.
That's the whole gag

274
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,410
'cause he can't play the piano.
He's terrible!

275
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,806
- No!
- Oh, my God!

276
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,885
Who cares about cats or pianos
or the freaking <i>Peanuts?</i>

277
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,361
It's not <i>"The Peanuts."</i>
It's just <i>"Peanuts."</i>

278
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,602
You have been studying
this thing for hours,

279
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,762
can we or can we not use it
to track Savitar?

280
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,922
Okay, all right, wind it in.

281
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,603
As far as we can tell, the shard
is made of a near frictionless material

282
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,250
that's in a constant state of flux.

283
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,607
So while it's utterly motionless
on the outside, it...

284
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,922
It's constantly moving on the inside.

285
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,647
Yes, it's as if it's being affected
by some sort of external source,

286
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,446
<i>much like the tides are affected
by the phases of the moon.</i>

287
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,726
Okay. Okay, then it has to be Savitar.

288
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,725
I mean, this was part of his armor.

289
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,167
Maybe it's trying to reconnect
with its other pieces.

290
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,125
That's it! It's just like <i>The Iron Giant.</i>

291
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,963
If this is true, then this shard
could lead us right to him.

292
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,801
It's an idea.

293
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,281
Okay. All right,
so what are we waiting for, let's...

294
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,531
Hold your roll, Jesse Quick.

295
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,889
This hesitation that you feel
on behalf of the group

296
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,004
is our realization
that this go-for-broke attitude

297
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,801
is the very attitude that got Wallace
in his predicament in the first place.

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,889
- Am I right?
- I can't believe I'm uttering the words,

299
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,123
but I actually agree with H.R.

300
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,321
- Ditto.
- Thanks, boys.

301
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,882
A lone speedster,
it's just no match for Savitar.

302
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,488
- Yeah, but...
- Jesse, we're gonna find him.

303
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,327
- When?
- When the real Flash gets back.

304
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,091
That came out wrong.

305
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,521
Um...

306
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,761
Wow.

307
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,606
Put my foot in it.

308
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,005
Jesse! Jesse!

309
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,521
Jesse. Jesse.
Quick question, merlot or cabernet?

310
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,171
- What?
- What wine do you think would go best

311
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,842
with a big, old man size-11 shoe
stuffed in his mouth?

312
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,371
- H.R.
- Yeah?

313
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,646
Just leave me alone.

314
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,281
<i>I get it. I get it. Savitar...</i>

315
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,610
Savitar hurt the one you love.
Now you wanna hurt Savitar.

316
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,006
Yeah, bet your ass, I do.

317
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,771
No, I get it. I love it. I respect it.

318
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,169
I'm a little worried, though,
that in your zeal for payback,

319
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,209
you might be the one
who ends up getting hurt.

320
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,731
- On my Earth...
- Yeah?

321
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,206
I am the real Flash.

322
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,603
I know. That's why
I shouldn't have said what I said.

323
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,404
No. No, you shouldn't have, okay,

324
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,688
'cause I've fought
plenty of monsters before.

325
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,001
Yeah, absolutely.

326
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,289
Like Savitar, though? Because...

327
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,686
Look, here's the thing,

328
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,922
if your father were here, what...

329
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,771
He would do everything
in his power to stop Savitar,

330
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,770
and that is exactly what I'm gonna do.

331
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,649
Okay. Okay.

332
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,043
I mean, hats off to you, you really are
Hard-Hat Harry's little girl, aren't you?

333
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,486
Yeah, I am, and you're not him.

334
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,522
So just do us both a favor
and stop trying to be.

335
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,685
This troubles you.

336
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,882
Another life that could've been
but never was.

337
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,724
Caitlin and Ronnie should've had that.

338
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,440
A family, a future.

339
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,771
Future doesn't always turn out
as we want it to.

340
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,806
I see what you're doing.

341
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,410
First Eddie, now Ronnie.

342
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,325
Showing me all the people

343
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,369
who've sacrificed themselves
for the greater good.

344
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,966
No, Barry, their sacrifices were for you,

345
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,010
as was Wally's
when he attempted to stop Savitar.

346
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,205
Savitar tricked Wally,
and now he's trapped.

347
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,961
Wally doesn't belong in the Speed Force.
You have to let me take his place.

348
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,846
And that's why I'm here.

349
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,650
No, the other reason, Barry.

350
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,165
I wanna sacrifice myself for Wally.

351
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,567
- We can't allow that.
- Why not?

352
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,530
Because where Wally's gone
is a hell all his own.

353
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,245
Savitar said, "One will suffer a fate
far worse than death."

354
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,325
And it's not for you.

355
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,081
Leave, Barry, while you still can.

356
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,641
No.

357
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,124
Whatever hell Wally's trapped in,
I'm gonna set him free.

358
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,330
And I'm not leaving here until I do.

359
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,890
Very well. But you were warned.

360
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,603
Hunter Zolomon.

361
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,169
Come on! Come on!

362
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,530
- Is it Barry?
- Did something happen to him?

363
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,927
We don't know. One second,
the telemetry was perfectly normal, and...

364
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,844
Then his vitals,
they just started crashing.

365
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,331
We warned you.

366
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,364
Why are you doing this?

367
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,765
You speak of sacrifice,

368
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,561
yet you still let others bear the burdens
that should be on your shoulders.

369
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,761
Okay. All right. You're right.

370
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,840
You're right. I never should've asked
Wally to save Iris.

371
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,411
It should've been me.

372
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,924
Please, let me save him.

373
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,243
There's only one way to free Wally West
from his eternal torment.

374
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,400
You must free yourself first.

375
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,685
I love you, Iris.

376
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,487
No!

377
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,369
- Cisco, is he...
- I don't know. I don't know.

378
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,926
Find out!

379
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,761
I can't.

380
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,970
- The tether's gone.
- What?

381
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,521
That was him and Wally's lifeline
out of the Speed Force.

382
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,966
How are we gonna get them back?

383
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,884
I don't know that we can.

384
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,446
Hello?

385
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,766
Wally?

386
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,841
Wally.

387
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,681
Wally!

388
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,241
Wally!

389
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,241
I'm gonna get you out, okay? Just hang on!

390
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,366
Visiting hours are over, Flash.

391
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,646
So,

392
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,371
that's not yours.

393
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,687
Get out of my way.

394
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,841
Can't do that.

395
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,725
Not if you're planning on using that
to find Savitar, I can't.

396
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,690
You're not gonna talk me
out of this, okay?

397
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,564
- I already told you, you're not...
- Not your dad?

398
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,491
That message was received loud and clear.

399
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,761
Now hear mine.

400
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,407
Taking on Savitar all alone,

401
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,682
it's not gonna bring Wallace back.

402
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,411
Jesse, it's just gonna get you killed,
and that,

403
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,327
my friend, that is not happening.

404
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,885
Not on my watch.

405
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,731
- You done?
- Yeah.

406
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,406
I've said my piece.

407
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,166
And guess what. I'm still not...

408
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,561
Moving.

409
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,565
That was oddly satisfying.

410
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,645
What's happening to him?

411
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,402
Wally West is caught
in an endless temporal loop,

412
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,241
just like Savitar after you imprisoned him
here in the future.

413
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,967
No wonder he hates you.

414
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,045
What's he seeing?

415
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,207
<i>He's reliving the single
most painful moment of his life</i>

416
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,080
over and over again.

417
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,890
His mother's death.

418
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,241
Wally.

419
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,771
He doesn't deserve this.

420
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,928
Let me guess. You do.

421
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,089
I know what my hell is.

422
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,647
I've already seen it in the future.

423
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,207
You don't like the future, Flash,
change it

424
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,285
I can't! Don't you get it? I can't.
I'm not fast enough. He is!

425
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,161
That's why you have
to let me take his place.

426
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,450
Wally can save Iris.

427
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,243
You're not learning your lesson, Barry.

428
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,171
You keep telling us one thing
and then doing another.

429
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,441
You wanna know what inspired Leonard Snart
to sacrifice himself?

430
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,651
It was you, Barry Allen.

431
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,488
You inspired him to be better.

432
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,169
You inspired him to be selfless,
to sacrifice himself for others,

433
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,967
to be a hero just like you.

434
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,730
I'm no hero, not lately.

435
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,970
So, what,

436
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,001
had enough, Scarlet Speedster?

437
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,326
Time to hang up the cowl
and give it all up?

438
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,291
Well, if you're out...

439
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,806
you're out.

440
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,051
- I'm done fighting.
- We know, and that's exactly the problem.

441
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,366
You think seeing Iris' death is hell?

442
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,523
You ain't seen nothing yet.

443
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,210
Let's get you out of here.

444
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,049
Okay, you stupid piece of metal,

445
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,050
take me to your leader.

446
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,486
Gotcha!

447
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,369
Jesse Quick, I knew you would come for me.

448
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,161
How'd you know I was coming here?

449
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,644
Because I know everything that happens.
I've already lived it.

450
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,491
- I'm not afraid of you.
- You should be.

451
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,767
Jesse.

452
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,726
H.R.?

453
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,690
It's a little late to talk me
out of this, okay?

454
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,161
I'm not gonna try and talk you out
of anything. I learned that lesson.

455
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,563
You have something that belongs to me!

456
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,165
I need a little help here, H.R.!

457
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,243
- I'm thinking.
- Think faster!

458
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,971
What have we got? We're fighting Savitar.
Savitar's a speed god.

459
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,889
<i>He's omnipotent. He's invulnerable.</i>

460
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,441
Then why does he need a suit of armor?

461
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,443
<i>Jesse, he's vulnerable
somewhere under the suit!</i>

462
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,409
Find a gap, find an opening,
and go for it!

463
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,851
I have such plans for you in the future,
Jesse Quick.

464
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,969
Well, I have plans for you, too.

465
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,731
This is for Wally!

466
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,121
Yeah!

467
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,526
- Jay.
- Yeah?

468
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,681
Is this really you,

469
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,162
or is this just another Speed Force test?

470
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,487
Yeah, kid, it's really me.

471
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,286
How?

472
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,369
As soon as the team lost contact with you,

473
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,648
Cisco came to my Earth and told me
what was happening.

474
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,126
<i>I came hereto help.</i>

475
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,080
Let's get Wally.

476
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,489
Afraid I can't let you do that.

477
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,843
<i>Getting a little slow
in your golden age there, Garrick.</i>

478
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,849
- Stop!
- Can't do that, either.

479
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,927
Enough!

480
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,647
I'm taking Wally.

481
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,569
We can't let you do that, Barry.

482
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,522
Yeah? Try and stop me.

483
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,721
Wally?

484
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,361
Hey.

485
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,480
Wally?

486
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,247
Barry? Jay?

487
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,250
- I saw my mom.
- I know.

488
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,961
- I know. Look at me.
- My mom's...

489
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,202
I know. Look at me now, okay?

490
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,806
It's over.

491
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,880
You're free now.

492
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,960
Okay? We're going home.

493
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,005
All right? It's okay.

494
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,603
We're going home.

495
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,767
Jay, let's go.

496
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,686
Sorry, kid.

497
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,849
This is where I stay for a while.

498
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,001
What?

499
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,441
What are you talking about?

500
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,168
We both know that a speedster
needs to take Wally's place.

501
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,122
- That's why I'm here.
- No.

502
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,850
No, Jay, you already lived your hell
when you were Zoom's prisoner.

503
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,401
And you set me free,
and I owe you for that.

504
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,528
- Jay...
- I've run a hell of a race,

505
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,362
but every marathon has a finish line.

506
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,284
Time has finally come for me to cross it,
but you...

507
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,966
You, Barry,

508
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,131
need to put an end to this
once and for all and stop Savitar.

509
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,041
How?

510
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,804
Do what you do best.

511
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,086
Be the Flash.

512
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,568
Cisco said that he could use this
to track you

513
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,365
and bring you home.

514
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,529
I'm gonna get this back to you again

515
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,604
when I break you out of here.

516
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,250
See you soon, Flash.

517
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,441
What's happening?
Do you think you can reel them in?

518
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,881
I don't know.

519
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,202
I've never felt this much
harmonic feedback.

520
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,488
It feels like the Speed Force
is about to...

521
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,320
<i>- Wally!</i>
<i>- Barry!</i>

522
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,080
Oh, my God!

523
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,008
- Are you okay?
- We will be.

524
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,207
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

525
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,611
Three speedsters go in,
but only two come out.

526
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,801
<i>Jay...</i>

527
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,604
Jay stayed back

528
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,891
to save Wally.

529
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,448
Come on, Wally, let's get you checked out.

530
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,684
I thought I lost both my boys.

531
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,889
- Thanks for bringing them back.
- You're welcome.

532
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,251
Thank you.

533
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,171
I thought I'd lost you, too.

534
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,160
I'm right here.

535
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,251
The Speed Force.

536
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,930
And it just appeared to you
in the form of Eddie Thawne?

537
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,129
- And Ronnie?
- And Snart.

538
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,245
All to teach me another lesson.

539
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,647
Which was what?

540
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,525
Saving Iris is my responsibility,
mine alone.

541
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,321
It's why the Speed Force
didn't let me take Wally's place,

542
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,763
why Jay sacrificed himself to do it,

543
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,326
so I could finish this.

544
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,281
Jay,

545
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,643
a hero among heroes.

546
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,881
Yeah.

547
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,923
We can't just leave him in there.

548
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,249
We won't.
I'll beat Savitar. We'll get him out.

549
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,889
Good, because it seems to me
the Speed Force

550
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,202
is a little bit of a crazy place.
Just ask Wallace.

551
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,403
Yeah, yeah, what...

552
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,450
What Wally saw,

553
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,805
it's gonna haunt him for a while,

554
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,129
so until he can get past it,

555
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,924
and he's really ready
to go back out there,

556
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,011
Kid Flash is gonna need
to take a break for a while.

557
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,761
<i>Hey.</i>

558
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,727
You okay?

559
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,486
Are you?

560
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,325
Right.

561
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,004
You should see the other guy.

562
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,571
Caitlin said I'll be fine.

563
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,690
Jesse, I can't believe you went
after Savitar by yourself.

564
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,451
What were you thinking?

565
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,361
The same thing you were when you did it.

566
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,530
Yeah, that was a mistake,

567
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,849
one that I will never make again.

568
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,807
Yeah, yeah, me, either.

569
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,003
Not on this Earth anyway.

570
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,522
Wait. What?
You're going back to Earth-2 already?

571
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,610
Earth-3, actually.

572
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,366
But you just got here, Jesse.

573
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,291
I know. I know, and I wanna be with you.

574
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,921
It's just Savitar said he had plans
for me in the future.

575
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,962
I can't let that happen.

576
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,931
Besides, until Barry can get Jay
out of the Speed Force,

577
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,328
Earth-3 needs a Flash to protect it.

578
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,565
I love you, Jesse.

579
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,246
I love you, too.

580
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,763
You show those villains on Earth-3,
nobody messes with our Jesse Quick.

581
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,281
- That's right. You give them hell.
- You know I will.

582
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,925
We're here if you need us, all right?

583
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,170
- Safe travels.
- Thanks.

584
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,482
Sorry, for the, uh...

585
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,289
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.
Good left hook.

586
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,650
- Thanks.
- I shouldn't be surprised, us Wellses,

587
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,289
we are forces to be reckoned with.

588
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,125
- That we are.
- Mmm.

589
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,965
Thank you, H.R.

590
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,126
For what?

591
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,886
Just being a friend.

592
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,441
Thank you.

593
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,961
Yeah.

594
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,124
- Ready?
- Yeah.

595
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,491
This isn't goodbye.

596
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,408
No, more like, see you later.

597
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,206
Can't wait.

598
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,608
So, fun fact
uncovered by our intrepid Jesse Quick

599
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,164
in her latest dust-up
with the so-called god of speed.

600
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,887
Guess who feels pain?

601
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,930
What exactly are you saying?

602
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,128
You're saying that underneath
the suit of armor, that he's...

603
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,364
Yes, James, he's not a god.

604
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,650
He's just a man, baby!

605
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,401
- A man?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

606
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,170
- Hey.
- Hey.

607
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,050
Thank you for saving Wally.

608
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,081
Of course.

609
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,851
Um...

610
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,645
So, I just...

611
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,890
You told me that you only wanted
to marry someone

612
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,243
because they love you and not because
they were trying to save you,

613
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,521
<i>and I get that.</i>

614
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,520
I just...

615
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,442
You know, I've lived with a lot of death,

616
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,244
tragedy in my life, and seeing you die?

617
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,844
It's impossible
not to be consumed by that.

618
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,924
Yeah. No, I get that.

619
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,760
<i>I do.</i>

620
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,205
It just...

621
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,411
It made me question if you were asking me
for the right reasons, you know?

622
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,647
If it was out of love or responsibility.

623
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,045
But, look,
while you were gone, I realized something.

624
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,008
I don't have to doubt
why you wanna marry me.

625
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,003
It's the same reason
that I wanna marry you.

626
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,841
Mmm-hmm.

627
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,929
I wanna be your wife, Barry.

628
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,009
Um...

629
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,561
I love you.

630
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,207
<i>But...</i>

631
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,720
Uh...

632
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,811
You were right.

633
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,044
I proposed

634
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,002
because I thought it would save you.

635
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,884
I thought Wally would save you.

636
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,606
I...

637
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,286
I was wrong.

638
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,128
I alone have to save you in the future,
and I'm going to,

639
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,010
but not by changing it,

640
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,206
by embracing it.

641
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,689
Okay, um...

642
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,444
What does that mean?

643
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,609
It means that I think we need
some space for a while.

644
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,400
I'm sorry. I don't know
how we can move forward like this with...

645
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,681
Okay.

646
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,571
I guess I'll go to my dad's.

647
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,163
No, you stay here,
and I'll stay with Cisco.

648
