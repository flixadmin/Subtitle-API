00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:42,125
Till the big move in.

168
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:44,025
You know, I've never had a roommate.

169
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:46,525
But it did occur to me
that if we ever get in a fight,

170
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,696
I can't just storm away and go home,

171
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:51,129
because home will be with you.

172
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,229
Are you predicting many arguments?

173
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,397
Have you met me?

174
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,464
I remember the night we met.

175
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:00,367
I stopped a mugger who stole your bag.

176
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,403
My hero.

177
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:08,543
Hey.

178
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:10,011
Hey.

179
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:11,645
Eddie, you know where Joe is?

180
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:14,348
Uh...I think he's upstairs in your lab.

181
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,385
Okay, thanks.

182
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:27,399
No second thoughts
about moving in together?

183
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,034
None.

184
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,238
Joe, hey.

185
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,139
Hey. I'm glad you're back.

186
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,940
I've been going over Snart's file.

187
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:40,646
Thanks. Yeah, I need to talk to you.

188
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:44,116
As CSI, my work on this case is done.

189
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:46,649
And as the Flash,

190
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:50,087
I don't think
I can focus on Snart right now.

191
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,759
You mind telling me
what brought about this change

192
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,494
of heart?

193
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:58,699
This man in yellow,
the man that killed my mom,

194
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,534
is still out there.

195
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:01,934
I have to be ready to face him,

196
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,500
which means amping up my speed.

197
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:07,573
- It's a question of priorities.
- Your mom's killer

198
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:09,609
isn't the only reason
you've been doing this.

199
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:12,176
You told me that if you
could use your powers

200
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,047
to save someone from a burning
building, you would.

201
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:18,449
Look, Dr. Wells and S.T.A.R.
Labs are gonna work with you.

202
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,050
Cisco thinks he has a way

203
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,918
to protect the police
against Snart's cold gun.

204
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,653
Barry, I can understand if you're scared.

205
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:26,823
- We talked about this.
- Of course I'm scared, Joe.

206
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,423
This guy could run into the precinct

207
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:30,491
and kill everyone in here in seconds.

208
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:32,358
He threatened Iris.

209
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,129
I won't let him hurt
the most important people

210
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:35,397
in my life again.

211
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,865
If that means devoting every second

212
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:40,035
I have outside this place to getting faster

213
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:42,335
and to stopping him,
then that's what I'm gonna do.

214
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,704
I'm sorry. I've made up my mind.

215
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:03,806
Aw. McSnurtle the turtle.

216
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:05,135
How you been?

217
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:07,371
When did you stop sleeping with this?

218
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:09,174
- It was your favorite.
- He was.

219
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:10,939
But if I remember correctly,

220
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:14,642
you took him away from me after
I broke your<i> Duke Ellington:</i>

221
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:16,545
<i>Live at the Blue Note</i> vinyl.

222
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:18,213
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

223
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:23,252
- You can have him back now.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

224
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:27,623
Oh, dad.

225
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,859
I'm going to miss you, baby.

226
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,661
Dad, I'm only ten minutes away.

227
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:35,831
I know. Don't you worry about me.

228
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,966
I'll be fine, just like always.

229
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:41,638
- Hey.
- Hey.

230
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,341
You came to help her pack?

231
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:44,880
Oh, no. No, no, no.

232
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:48,484
Iris said that she had something for me.

233
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:50,552
Oh, um...

234
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:53,221
I found this in my closet.

235
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:55,759
[İris and father laughing]

236
00:11:55,761 --> 00:11:58,030
I haven't seen this in years.

237
00:11:58,032 --> 00:12:02,466
Well, the nerd survival kit
is still intact.

238
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,172
Wow.

239
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,842
I thought those might be worth something.

240
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,513
I am so late for work.

241
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:23,121
I promise I will clean this
up when I get back, okay?

242
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:25,924
- Bye.
- Bye, yeah.

243
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,195
Okay.

244
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:34,436
You mind telling me what's
going on with you and Iris?

245
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:36,372
- Nothing.
- Hmm.

246
00:12:36,374 --> 00:12:39,174
That's funny, because I have
these two things called eyes,

247
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,409
and it doesn't look like you two are fine.

248
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,547
I told Iris.

249
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:46,883
You told Iris you're the Flash?

250
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:49,218
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

251
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,956
No. [Laughs]

252
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:56,794
I told her how I felt about her.

253
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:58,595
- Oh, God.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:00,530
What did she say?

255
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:04,502
Well, I mean, she's still
moving in with Eddie, isn't she?

256
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:07,836
I just want to pretend
like it never even happened.

257
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:10,274
I mean, that's what we're both doing, so...

258
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:14,077
Well, not saying how you feel
is what got you in this mess

259
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,145
in the first place.

260
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:18,013
Speaking of which,

261
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:21,516
we both know she's not gonna
clean this mess up anytime soon.

262
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:23,419
Nope.

263
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:27,760
Sure.

264
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:40,477
Uh, excuse me.

265
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,515
If I could have
everybody's attention, please.

266
00:13:43,517 --> 00:13:47,120
You have our attention, Mr. Ramon.

267
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:49,189
Okay, check it.

268
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:50,892
So Dr. Wells and I,

269
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:53,530
we took your ballistic shields and...

270
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,769
and we lined them with a pretty
sweet compacted heating ribbon

271
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,205
designed to repel temperature attacks

272
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,842
especially those reaching absolute zero,

273
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,809
like Captain Cold's gun.

274
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,476
And that's supposed to keep us from getting

275
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:09,409
- turned into popsicles?
- Um, yeah.

276
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:11,245
Yeah, they will.

277
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,480
How are we supposed to trust
anything from S.T.A.R. Labs

278
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:15,716
after you nuked the city?

279
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:20,958
You're right.

280
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,757
You're right, you shouldn't trust us.

281
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,729
What happened a year ago...
that was our fault.

282
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:32,636
And we can't change the past,
as much as we wish we could.

283
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,304
But tomorrow is a different story.

284
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:37,972
Tomorrow's a different thing.

285
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:41,544
We just want the chance
to make things better.

286
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,544
Observe.

287
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,430
[Chatter]

288
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,109
Dummies are one thing.

289
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:18,379
My officers are another.

290
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:26,019
You seem pleased with yourself, Doctor.

291
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:29,021
Well, I'm just happy to help
the police catch Snart, Joe.

292
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,956
Barry might be able to help too.

293
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,559
I think Cisco's heat shields
are more than up to the task.

294
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:36,860
And, Joe, if Barry
feels he's gonna endanger lives

295
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:38,628
by taking on Snart and, conversely, feels

296
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,430
he's gonna save lives by training

297
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:44,265
to take on the man in yellow...

298
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:46,134
That's ultimately his call.

299
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:49,403
You know what makes Barry so special?

300
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:53,408
He wants to help everyone
he can, however he can.

301
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,144
Always has.

302
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:56,844
Until now.

303
00:15:56,846 --> 00:16:00,047
I guess it's just a question
of priorities then.

304
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:04,852
You know, Barry
said the exact same thing to me.

305
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:07,855
And I thought, “doesn't sound like him.”

306
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:10,759
I guess because it sounds like you.

307
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,908
- Hey.
- [Gasps]

308
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,945
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

309
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:26,146
No, it's okay. I was just kind of focused.

310
00:16:26,148 --> 00:16:27,847
Gotcha.

311
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:30,416
- What's firestorm?
- It's one of the last things

312
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:33,517
Ronnie said to me before he... Flew away.

313
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,085
My dead fiancé can fly.

314
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:38,121
I haven't broke that to my parents yet.

315
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,758
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

316
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,027
No, I just...

317
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,595
I told Iris how I felt about her.

318
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:48,163
Bold choice.

319
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:51,064
I knew where we stood before.
We were best friends.

320
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,468
And...I don't know. Now I just don't know

321
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,504
what's normal for us anymore.

322
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:57,843
Before I met Ronnie,

323
00:16:57,845 --> 00:17:01,446
I knew exactly what was going
to happen every day of my life.

324
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:03,851
It was predictable. I like predictable.

325
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:06,655
But when Ronnie and I started dating,

326
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:09,125
everything started to change.

327
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:14,932
He made me try Indian food

We got you.

659
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,864
Congratulations.

660
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:14,130
Get him out of here.

661
00:36:18,937 --> 00:36:20,138
Nice work, Eddie.

662
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,973
It wasn't me.

663

It was the Flash.

We're not gonna
be needing these for the trial.

Thank you.

He was like a lightning bolt,
zipping through the streets.

- I wonder who he is.

If you ask me, he's a hero.

I'll miss you.

You know you can come around anytime, Joe.

682
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,880
Just give us a heads-up.

683
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,417
Or not.

I'll wait... In the truck.

Why don't I give you two a minute?

689
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:06,586
Well... Look, I know things have been

690
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:09,021
really weird between us recently.

691
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,291
Yeah, they have.

692
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:18,560
Well, did you know
that I can see into the future?

693
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,726
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

694
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:21,127
Did I forget to tell you that?

695
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:22,928
You did not mention it, no.

696

- Wow.

697

So what do you see?

698
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:36,248
I see you and Eddie
being really happy together.

699
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,917
And things aren't weird between us anymore.

700
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:44,022
It took a little time,
but everything's back to normal,

701
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:48,027
and we're still best friends.

702
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:51,130
The future doesn't sound so bad.

703

No.

Yeah.

Besides, the laundry machines
in my building

have been broken for, like, a month, so...

moved into that deathtrap
in the first place,

725

since you still got
a perfectly good room here.

You said you were turning it into a gym.

We both know I'm not turning it into a gym.
