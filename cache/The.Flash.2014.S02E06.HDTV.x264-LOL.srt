1
00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:02,803
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:05,589
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:07,040
To the outside world,

4
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,926
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

5
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:10,811
but secretly, with the help of my friends

6
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:12,846
at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime

7
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:15,516
and find other meta-humans like me.

8
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,484
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

9
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:19,520
but in doing so, I opened up our world

10
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,155
to new threats,

11
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:24,324
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

12
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:27,528
I am The Flash.

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,363
<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

14
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:32,332
There is, indeed, a hole in our universe

15
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:36,069
which leads to his Earth.

16
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,089
Meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

17
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:43,410
Do you think we've reached
the good-night kiss stage?

18
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:47,080
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

19
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,850
He has been sending
meta-humans from your world

20
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,685
through the breaches to fight me.

21
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:53,554
Her name is Doctor Light.

22
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:54,588
Hello, gorgeous.

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,756
What do you want from me?

24
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:59,393
Your life.

25
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,777
I saw myself.

26
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:03,947
Sounds like you have an evil meta-twin.

27
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,700
Where are you?

28
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:08,702
I'm right here.

29
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,708
I'm here to kill you, Flash,
so get ready to fry.

30
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:17,461
Bring it on.

31
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:20,247
Hmm.

32
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:40,067
Told you.

33
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,769
Zoom always wins.

34

_

36
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:57,200
Zoom sent me here to kill you,

37
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,369
but I didn't want to.

38
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:01,488
But you were fine with killing Linda Park.

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,958
It was the best bad idea
I could come up with.

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,710
Leave her body for Zoom to find,

41
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,846
he'd think I was dead, and I'd be free.

42
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:12,633
How was he supposed to know
where to find her body?

43
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:15,135
Just let me go.

44
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:17,638
Let me disappear.

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,889
You would spend the rest of your life

46
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:19,973
looking over your shoulder,

47
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,675
never knowing when Zoom is coming.

48
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:26,063
Okay. And what's your great idea?

49
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,481
How were you supposed to contact him

50
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:28,615
after you killed me?

51
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:31,017
I was supposed to get something...

52
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,203
something I could only get
if you were dead...

53
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,372
and then throw it
through the breach as proof.

54
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,074
- And then what?
- Then he'd come for me.

55
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:39,409
Confirm the kill and bring me home.

56
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,662
- Why do you want to know?
- Because I want to find him.

57
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:42,879
You really don't.

58
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,881
He's gonna keep coming for me.

59
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,667
He's gonna keep kidnapping people like you,

60
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,919
forcing them to do what he wants.

61
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:52,222
I have to stop him before more people die.

62
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,891
- You can't stop Zoom.
- Yes, I can.

63
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:58,345
I will, but I need your help.

64
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,437
Zoom wants Doctor Light
to send him your new emblem.

65
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,155
Yes. We need it for bait.

66
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:10,375
If we can get Doctor Light
to take my emblem,

67
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,189
throw it through the breach,
then Zoom will come

68
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,224
to collect my body, and we can trap him.

69
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,309
You know it took a lot of work

70
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,860
to make that emblem, right?

71
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,729
This is the woman
who was willing to kill Linda

72
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,197
in order to escape Zoom,

73
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,399
but now she's willing to help us catch him?

74
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,984
She knows it's the only way.

75
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,620
Before I left Earth-2,

76
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:29,189
I worked on a serum to dampen Zoom's speed.

77
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,907
All we would need is for Ramon

78
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,576
to develop a weapon to deliver it.

79
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,028
Oh, great, that could be
this year's cold gun.

80
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,413
Maybe another criminal can get it,

81
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,031
and then we'd have Sergeant Slow.

82
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,549
I would never let that happen.

83
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,301
Sergeant Slow is a terrible name.

84
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:44,254
Are we forgetting how much more powerful

85
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,505
than Barry Zoom seems to be?

86
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:47,391
I mean, if Barry can catch bullets,

87
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,843
what's to say Zoom can't catch
whatever you shoot at him?

88
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,230
Surprise... the element of surprise.

89
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,731
All we would do is rig a projectile

90
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,184
to fire as Zoom crosses into the breach.

91
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,552
He can't stop what he can't see coming.

92
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:00,720
- That's great.
- Thanks.

93
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,106
Joe, voice of reason here?

94
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:06,076
We need a plan. That's as good as any.

95
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,411
As long as he can deliver.

96
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,528
Don't underestimate me, Detective.

97
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:13,200
Oh, Patty needs us back at the station.

98
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,619
I'll meet you there, all right?

99
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,010
Are you just forgetting
everything Jay told us

100
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,294
and supporting Wells now?

101
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,929
Oh, no, I don't trust Wells at all.

102
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,514
I just want to see what he's up to.

103
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:29,466
I figure we give him some rope,
he'll hang himself.

104
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,718
Yeah, I'm totally with you.
I think he's hiding something.

105
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,688
Look, my hunch after interrogating suspects

106
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,109
all these years, something's
not right with this dude.

107
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,145
Barry told me about this thing you can do?

108
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,481
- Vibing.
- Oh, God, just relax.

109
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,950
Can you do it with Wells?

110
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,902
I can try.

111
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,544
Incapable?

112
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,329
Well, let me tell you something.

113
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:03,583
If you are incapable
of aligning the quantum helix

114
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,302
and, by the way, the sole purpose

115
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,087
of your employment here at S.T.A.R. Labs,

116
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,255
could you save me some time and effort?

117
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,140
Could you go out there and find someone

118
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:14,478
who can actually do your job for you?

119
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,180
There it is.

120
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,983
Work voice.

121
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,668
When I was little and you used to bring me

122
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,869
to S.T.A.R. Labs with you,

123
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:24,521
it used to freak me out

124
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:26,823
how differently you talked here
than when you were at home.

125
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,526
You and your mother both.
Shouldn't you be at school?

126
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,912
I graduated high school when I was 15, Dad.

127
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,997
- Right.
- Can miss a day of college.

128
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:38,368
Ah, that's my Jess, always so quick.

129
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,505
- So?
- So?

130
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,457
Is it true?

131
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,092
Is what true?

132
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,161
What The Flash said about you
at the press conference?

133
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:52,299
That your particle accelerator
created the meta-humans?

134
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,307
- It is... Jesse...
- Why didn't you just tell me?

135
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,890
Jay Garrick, it turns out,

136
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,493
is much faster at assigning blame

137
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,523
than he is at actual heroics.

138
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:07,725
- Dad, The Flash is a hero.
- Uh-huh.

139
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,061
Okay, I've never understood
why you disliked him so much,

140
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:13,331
but now I know it's because
he knew what you'd done.

141
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,866
What I've done at S.T.A.R. Labs

142
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,785
is change the world, Jesse,

143
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:19,871
unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

144
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:23,291
And when you don't have the key to the lock,

145
00:06:23,293 --> 00:06:27,245
sometimes you have to kick in the door.

146
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,247
You should get to school.

147
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:33,351
Don't worry. I got my education today.

148
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:43,094
You're my joy, Jesse Quick.

149
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,769
- All right. Talk to you later.
- See you, Joe.

150
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,488
Great, you're here.

151
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,706
Good morning to you too, Patty.

152
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,740
Yes, I was up all night

153
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,908
working on the Doctor Light case.

154
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,126
I... I've been trying to anticipate

155
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,627
all the powers she might throw our way,

156
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:00,829
you know, on the premise

157
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,380
that she can manipulate light energy.

158
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:03,998
- I appreciate it, but...
- Did you know

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,301
that light energy
can be turned into hard light?

160
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:07,552
I mean, that doesn't even sound
like a thing, but it is.

161
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:09,137
Seriously, Patty...

162
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,222
No, and on the other end
of the spectrum is invisibility.

163
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:13,458
Look, it... it's just
hypothetical, but I think that...

164
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,262
The Doctor Light case is closed.

165
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:20,231
Oh, uh, okay.

166
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,183
Can you tell me why?

167
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,801
No.

168
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:28,106
No?

169
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,691
- Okay.
- Hey.

170
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,025
- Hi!
- Are you good?

171
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,360
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

172
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:34,496
Your dad just shut me down in a big way.

173
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:37,365
- What do you mean?
- I... I don't know. It just...

174
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:42,787
You don't think it's because
you and I kissed?

175
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:43,922
Uh, no, I don't think he knows.

176
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,457
I didn't say anything,

177
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,875
but I can talk to him if you want.

178
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:48,326
No, no, no, I'll talk to him.

179
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:49,594
You know, he's my partner.

180
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,212
We should have trust and communication.

181
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,214
Are you sure? I don't mind
talking about that kiss.

182
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:54,466
It was a good kiss.

183
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:58,720
Yeah, yeah, although the memory...

184
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,722
it's a little foggy.

185
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:02,307
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

186
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:06,010
I might need, like, a reminder soon.

187
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:09,013
Okay.

188
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:19,207
- Hey.
- Hey.

189
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,742
Have you had any word from The Flash

190
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:24,329
about the meta-human that killed Larkin?

191
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:27,999
No, not yet, but I know he's working on it.

192
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,918
You know, maybe I could talk to him.

193
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,170
Linda, I don't think that's a good idea.

194
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:34,055
Look, Larkin is dead,

195
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,723
which makes it really hard
for me to concentrate

196
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,875
on field goals and doping scandals.

197
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:39,677
I don't want to sit around
being told not to worry

198
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,146
my pretty little head about it.

199
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:44,048
I get that. Believe me, I do.

200
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,733
Then tell him I want to help.

201
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,153
Please, I can't let this woman
who looks like me

202
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:50,155
hurt anyone else.

203
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:52,157
I'll ask again.

204
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,110
But trust me, Flash has
everything under control.

205
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,370
Crap.

206
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,593
Doctor Light's gone invisible.

207
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:30,645
Lock the doors.

208
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:33,481
Shut the doors!

209
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:35,650
The doors aren't responding.

210
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:38,069
None of the security protocols
are responding.

211
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,287
She's hacked the system.

212
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,272
Barry, Doctor Light is escaping.

213
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,745
Where is she?

214
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,188
Doctor Light managed to hack
into the lights of her cell.

215
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,924
The whole building runs on fiber optics

216
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,842
that operate on pulses of light,

217
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:05,428
so she turned off the dampeners
and used her powers.

218
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,896
I told you how dangerous she was.

219
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,431
You should have listened to me
and sedated her.

220
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,166
I thought I had convinced
her that helping us

221
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:11,568
was the only way
she'd free herself from Zoom.

222
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,602
- Well, you thought wrong.
- Yeah.

223
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,187
Okay, look,

224
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,972
Doctor Light is gone,
so instead of assigning blame,

225
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,690
let's try to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

226
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,659
Do you think she's gonna try
and take Linda again?

227
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,327
I had Iris bring Linda to the house,

228
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,196
just in case, to keep an eye on her.

229
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,647
How are we doing with the speed-dampener?

230
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,249
I think we isolated the composite.

231
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,533
And we're modifying the dart The Arrow used

232
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:28,785
to take down Wells.

233
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:31,320
He's not Wells. I'm Wells.

234
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:32,922
Whatever, Harry.

235
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,707
But we don't even really know
if this thing works.

236
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,342
Until we try it, no.
This will be a field test,

237
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,460
so can we end
this scintillating staff meeting

238
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,045
and get back to work?

239
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:40,713
Or how about I say
what everybody's thinking?

240
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:42,432
Maybe it's a good thing
that Doctor Light is gone.

241
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,833
Maybe it's the universe stopping us

242
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,385
from doing something really stupid.

243
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:48,271
No. No. Keep going.

244
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,525
I'm gonna figure out
another way to get Zoom.

245
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,527
Hey, slow your roll. I want to talk to you.

246
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,447
Joe, look, I know what I'm doing.

247
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,482
Okay, I don't, so why don't you clue me in?

248
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,984
I'm trying to stop Zoom.

249
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,184
I thought you were on board with that.

250
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,203
I'm keeping my options open.

251
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,289
I don't understand
why you think we have a choice.

252
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,957
Zoom wants me dead.

253
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,659
The meta-humans that
he's sending from Earth-2,

254
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,494
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

255
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,579
Look at what happened
to Iris and Linda's boss.

256
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:15,882
He was just collateral damage in Zoom's war.

257
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,051
The next time, that could be you or Iris.

258
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,753
I'm just wondering if going
after him now is premature.

259
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,672
I mean, we barely know anything
about his abilities.

260
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:23,890
Wells does.

261
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:24,891
You're putting a whole lot of faith

262
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:25,975
in the man wearing the face

263
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,727
of your mother's killer.

264
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,346
I think we should find Jay,
get him to help us on this.

265
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:32,348
Yeah, Jay made it pretty clear
that he doesn't want to help

266
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,600
get me killed, and we can't just sit around

267
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,602
and wait for Zoom
to make his next move anymore.

268
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:38,071
We can't.

269
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,272
Aren't you the one who told me

270
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,690
life isn't about playing defense,

271
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:41,941
sometimes the only way to succeed

272
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:43,359
is by working the offense?

273
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,577
I think at the time we were talking about

274
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,995
your high school football tryouts.

275
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,698
You said you'd never bring that up again.

276
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:57,674
Hey.

277
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:01,427
I just wanted to say using
the, uh, tungsten composite

278
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,464
to dampen vibrations, that was, uh...

279
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,799
that was pretty brilliant.

280
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,521
What are you doing?

281
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:14,640
I'm congratulating you.

282
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:15,858
Don't touch me.

283
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,310
Wow, try to give a guy a compliment.

284
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,728
You're not trying to give me a compliment.

285
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,862
You're trying to meddle into things

286
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,147
that are none of your business.

287
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,648
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

288
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,118
- What did you vibe about me?
- Nothing.

289
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,403
God, why? What's there to vibe on?

290
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,326
Don't touch me.
If you have questions, ask them.

291
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,912
Otherwise stay away from me.

292
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,421
So?

293
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:48,141
God, you'd think the serial killer version

294
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,926
would've been the bigger jerk.

295
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:50,977
What happened when you touched him?

296
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,095
What did you see?

297
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:53,229
Oh, I didn't see anything.

298
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,964
Go touch him again.

299
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,316
No, he's onto me now.

300
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,634
Well, you have to keep trying.

301
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,020
I mean, I think Joe's right.

302
00:13:01,022 --> 00:13:04,607
Something must have happened
between Wells and Zoom,

303
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,243
made this personal.

304
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:16,202
The Arrow of Starling City
formerly known as The Hood,

305
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:19,488
has been unmasked
as billionaire Robert Queen.

306
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,990
Robert was marooned on an island

307
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,759
when his boat went down in the Pacific,

308
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,761
an accident that ended with the tragic death

309
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,129
of his son, Oliver.

310
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:27,547
Robert Queen was thought dead when...

311
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:32,001
Excuse me, I'm receiving word.

312
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:35,438
There has been an attack
at Central City College.

313
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,506
The science building was the focus

314
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:39,442
of another meta-human attack.

315
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,010
We are just receiving video.

316
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:42,612
Please be advised, I'm being told

317
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,113
that the footage you're about to see...

318
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,566
Hey, Jesse, it's Dad. Can you...

319
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:49,351
I just... I saw on the news...

320
00:13:49,353 --> 00:13:50,620
Just call me, all right?
Let me know that you're okay.

321
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,238
That you weren't...

322
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,874
Witnesses report that
The Flash arrived on the scene

323
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,742
but not before the hostile meta-human

324
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:59,078
escaped with a hostage, a female student.

325
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,696
We have not yet ID'd her,

326
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,915
and there is no indication
as to why she has been

327
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,133
specifically targeted.

328
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,587
No.

329
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,535
Joe... Detective...
can we talk for a minute?

330
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,070
If this is about Doctor Light...

331
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,005
No, yeah... No.

332
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,541
Uh, maybe, but okay, look.

333
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:46,909
I think I figured out why you've been

334
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,761
a bit shut down the last couple of days.

335
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,963
Really?

336
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,098
Yeah, I feel like you're not being

337
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,349
completely transparent with me,

338
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,768
but I think that it's my fault.

339
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,438
Look, you're a great...
excellent... wonderful detective,

340
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,274
and I think you can sense I'm not being

341
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,892
completely transparent with you.

342
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:04,527
And you're right. Look, we're partners.

343
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,362
We need to be completely
honest with each other.

344
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,980
- No secrets...
- Patty.

345
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:10,149
Barry and I kissed.

346
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:16,438
There's something to being too transparent.

347
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,242
No, no, no, no, I think that it's great

348
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:21,827
that everything's just out
there, right out in the open.

349
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,579
Whatever you and Barry do in private

350
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:27,583
is your own business.

351
00:15:27,585 --> 00:15:31,254
Okay.

352
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:32,505
So you're not mad at me?

353
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:35,391
I promise you, I could care less.

354
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,846
Great, I feel so much better.

355
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,067
Is there anything, you know,

356
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,070
maybe you've been meaning to tell me?

357
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,405
We're partners...

358
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,608
totally transparent with each other.

359
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,745
Uh...

360
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,313
nope.

361
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,951
Cool.

362
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,011
- Hey.
- Hey.

363
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,796
Are you guys having a dinner party?

364
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:14,764
You would think.

365
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,966
I know, I know.

366
00:16:16,968 --> 00:16:19,051
It's just, sometimes
cooking helps me to relax.

367
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:20,519
Oh.

368
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,104
Have you heard anything about Doctor Light?

369
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,389
Am I still in danger?

370
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:25,391
- We're not really sure.
- Come on.

371
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:28,110
I'm going crazy here, Barry. Yeah, she is.

372
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,613
That is the cake.

373
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,783
Hope you're hungry.

374
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,151
She's not kidding.

375
00:16:35,153 --> 00:16:36,953
There's enough food in
there to feed an army.

376
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,788
She must be terrified.

377
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,873
Uh, more like furious.

378
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,375
Larkin died trying to protect her,

379
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,826
and it only makes it worse
that the person who did it

380
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:45,461
looks just like her. I mean, trust me.

381
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,363
If Linda had Doctor Light's
powers right now...

382
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,252
What?

383
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:56,088
I just, uh, Linda and Light...
They're identical.

384
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,058
So identical that Light even
thought she could fool Zoom.

385
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,061
Now we have Light's suit.

386
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,712
You don't even have to say anything, I know.

387
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:06,732
- It's a terrible idea.
- No, no, no, it's not.

388
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,435
We make Zoom think
that Linda is Doctor Light

389
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:11,604
and use her to draw him out.

390
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,606
It's too dangerous, right?

391
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,441
Let Linda decide.

392
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,076
I mean, she's desperate to catch the person

393
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,695
who's responsible for Larkin's death,

394
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:21,364
and she deserves the chance to help us.

395
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:26,452
Okay.

396
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:30,256
I still don't understand why we're here.

397
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,258
I thought your dad said
not to leave the house.

398
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,545
- Someone wants to talk to you.
- Who?

399
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:40,633
Ms. Park, I need your help.

400
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:41,767
Whoa.

401
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,212
Heh, dude.

402
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,311
How long you been sitting on this?

403
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:58,079
It's important to have hobbies.

404
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:05,237
This is ridiculous.

405
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,289
No, it's not.

406
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,040
You look just like Doctor Light.

407
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,025
And with these gloves that Cisco rigged up,

408
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:12,878
you'll be able to do what she does.

409
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,196
Don't worry, they are totally safe.

410
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:16,715
- Ish.
- Ish?

411
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:18,166
Well, come on, it's gotta be believable,

412
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:21,386
so they really do fire and explode things.

413
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:23,171
And you are going to have to let her

414
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:25,307
hit you with those blasts
when she gets the hang of it.

415
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,894
Who exactly came up with this terrible idea?

416
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:31,096
Okay, it's not a terrible idea.

417
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:33,348
The suit can absorb the blasts.

418
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,983
For real or ish?

419
00:18:34,985 --> 00:18:37,602
What does a terrible idea
look like to you, Cisco?

420
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:39,554
Okay, you know what? I like to think

421
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:42,357
I can see the bright side of things, okay?

422
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,225
Positivity, people.

423
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:47,529
All right, all right.

424
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:52,250
So just hit the ones of me. Okay?

425
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,286
- Got it.
- Great.

426
00:18:54,288 --> 00:18:56,237
Doctor Light.

427
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,544
Oh! Oh! Oh!

428
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:03,911
Uh, you know what?

429
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:05,013
I'm just gonna adjust those a little.

430
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,181
Screwdriver.

431
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:07,882
Coming. Coming.

432
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,768
Just...

433
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,471
Okay, so, um, do the opposite of that,

434
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:16,975
and we'll have it.

435
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:34,459
It's on fire.

436
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,611
Ooh, sorry.

437
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:39,464
My bad.

438
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:11,446
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

439
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,081
I did it! Did you see that?

440
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,149
Yeah!

441
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,702
Ooh!

442
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:21,923
You all good? You okay?

443
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,291
Sorry.

444
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:26,761
Okay, no offense to Linda,
but there is no way

445
00:20:26,763 --> 00:20:28,380
she can pull this off.

446
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:30,515
Well, maybe if she didn't
scream every time she fired.

447
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:32,667
Yup, Linda had a rocky start,
but she can pull this off.

448
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,135
I know she can.

449
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,887
All right, did you find
someplace near breach where

450
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,188
we don't have to worry about
civilians getting in the way?

451
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,058
Yeah, there's a place by the docks
that's usually deserted at night.

452
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,843
Awesome. How are we doing
with the speed-dampener?

453
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:44,612
- My tests indicate that it should work.
- It will work.

454
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:46,815
I'll tune up Ramon's gloves,
makes sure they work better.

455
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,566
Okay, great.

456
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,952
Hey, we're actually gonna
go through with this?

457
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:52,287
Yeah, we're doing this.

458
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,689
I'm gonna have Iris get Linda ready.

459
00:20:57,793 --> 00:21:00,078
Yeah, I'll go talk to him.

460
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,531
Barry, hold up.

461
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,383
Hey, what?

462
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,034
You saw what happened in there.

463
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:08,336
Linda's not ready.

464
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:09,971
She is. She's ready enough.

465
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:12,090
Why are you pushing this?

466
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:14,142
What... why do you think? I want to get him.

467
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:15,760
Get who, exactly?

468
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,345
Is that a real question?

469
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:18,763
You tell me.

470
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,899
I'm... I'm not sure this is even about Zoom.

471
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,216
I'm starting to feel like
you're still chasing

472
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:23,718
the Reverse Flash.

473
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,186
Reverse Flash is dead.

474
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:26,654
Yeah, but after all he did to you,

475
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,657
you weren't the one that stopped him.

476
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:30,992
We all worked together.

477
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:33,945
Yeah, and Eddie got him in the end.

478
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,413
I mean, did that make you feel cheated,

479
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:36,865
like you didn't get your revenge,

480
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:41,119
and stopping Zoom is the next best thing?

481
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:42,787
Look, all I'm saying is,

482
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:44,339
if you're gonna ask people like Linda

483
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:45,907
to risk their lives, you better be sure

484
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:47,292
of exactly why they're doing it.

485
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:03,925
Look, I'm sorry I'm a terrible supervillain.

486
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,644
I don't need you to come here
and make me feel worse.

487
00:22:06,646 --> 00:22:09,397
That's not why I'm here.

488
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:13,201
Doesn't matter, I... I can't do this.

489
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:14,702
I just don't have it in me.

490
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:16,404
That's not true.

491
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:18,289
You're one of the strongest
women I've ever met.

492
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,824
You can do anything.

493
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:22,127
And you know that about me
based on what exactly?

494
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:25,630
Linda,

495
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:29,116
you are trusting me.

496
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:32,303
So I need to trust you fully.

497
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:35,456
I know that you can do this...

498
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,650
Because I know you.

499
00:22:45,652 --> 00:22:48,236
Barry. Holy crap.

500
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:53,775
I've made out with The Flash.

501
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:10,744
Listen, I just want to bury the hatchet

502
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:13,963
and say thank you for all your work.

503
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:17,200
You're welcome.

504
00:23:17,202 --> 00:23:19,302
Okay.

505
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:23,390
I think maybe the trigger
mechanisms are just sticking.

506
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,041
It's not the trigger mechanisms.

507
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:26,259
- I think...
- It's not the... don't, no...

508
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:27,260
It's just a little bit of oil.

509
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:31,181
Ugh, I'm just gonna
clean this up really quick.

510
00:23:31,183 --> 00:23:33,683
- Do not touch me.
- I'm just trying to help.

511
00:23:47,231 --> 00:23:51,234
I know Wells went to the other Earth.

512
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:52,952
Why?

513
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:55,255
I don't know, I swear.

514
00:23:55,257 --> 00:24:00,460
Your loyalty is admirable,

515
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:01,461
Jesse.

516
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:12,188
I'm sorry.

517
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:23,666
Joe, Doctor Light.

518
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:25,235
- I thought we settled that.
- No, we didn't.

519
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:26,453
She's still out there on the loose...

520
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:27,937
a meta-human who just murdered a man.

521
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:29,772
Why aren't we doing something about it?

522
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:30,957
Look, none of this makes any sense,

523
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,308
and you're not talking to me.

524
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,409
All right, all right, all right, look.

525
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:35,044
It's a bit complicated,

526
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:38,381
but we're not going after
Doctor Light right now.

527
00:24:38,383 --> 00:24:40,383
I need you to trust me, Patty,

528
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:42,669
for a few days or so.

529
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:45,421
Are you somehow involved in this?

530
00:24:45,423 --> 00:24:48,007
If you're asking if I'm dirty, no,

531
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:52,095
but I need some time
to take care of some things.

532
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:53,513
I trust you, I do.

533
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:56,149
I wouldn't be your partner if I didn't.

534
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,817
This is about you not trusting me.

535
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:02,405
- Patty, I trust you.
- Not enough.

536
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:06,025
A few days.

537
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:12,582
- Hey.
- Hey.

538
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:14,000
Do you want to maybe grab dinner tonight?

539
00:25:14,002 --> 00:25:15,618
I could use your opinion about something.

540
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,836
I can't tonight. I'm sorry.

541
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:17,921
Sure.

542
00:25:17,923 --> 00:25:20,173
I... I would. Joe and I actually...

543
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:23,293
Joe and I have a thing
that we've gotta do tonight.

544
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:24,844
Some other time.

545
00:25:24,846 --> 00:25:27,380
I would much rather be
spending the evening with you.

546
00:25:27,382 --> 00:25:31,935
Seriously, if I could cancel
these plans, I would.

547
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:34,521
Can we do dinner tomorrow?

548
00:25:34,523 --> 00:25:35,671
Yeah, I would like that.

549
00:25:35,673 --> 00:25:37,473
All right, I'll see you.

550
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:39,192
Good luck with your thing.

551
00:25:39,194 --> 00:25:42,228
Thanks. I think I'll need it.

552
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:02,415
I'm here to kill The Flash,
and no one can stop me!

553
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:03,583
How's that?

554
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:05,084
Uh, it's a little too much.

555
00:26:05,086 --> 00:26:06,719
Uh, stop messing with the earpiece.

556
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:09,222
Yeah, you don't want to dislodge it.

557
00:26:09,224 --> 00:26:11,540
Right, you... you told me that. I'm sorry.

558
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:15,845
No, no, you're doing great, Linda.

559
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:19,098
All right, Doctor Light, here I am.

560
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,934
But we're gonna skip the part where you say

561
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:23,019
you're gonna kill me
and go right to the part

562
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:24,387
where I don't let you.

563
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,606
I'm here to kill you, Flash.

564
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:27,857
Wait, what are you doing?

565
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:28,741
We're skipping that?

566
00:26:28,743 --> 00:26:30,660
Yes.

567
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:35,064
Uh, I am loyal to Zoom,

568
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:37,400
so get ready to fry.

569
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:39,002
Next time we're doing this,

570
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:40,620
I'm writing better dialogue.

571
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:41,621
- Next time?
- Next time?

572
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,044
Uh...

573
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:50,263
- Oh!
- Gotcha.

574
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:52,015
- Yeah, you did.
- Real good.

575
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,434
All right. Ugh.

576
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:56,752
Bring it on. Hmm.

577
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:20,960
Told you,

578
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:24,163
Zoom always wins.

579
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:28,835
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

580
00:27:28,837 --> 00:27:32,388
I had to make it look good.

581
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,892
Here it is, Zoom, I did what you wanted.

582
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:38,845
Now bring me home.

583
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,563
Come on.

584
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:09,480
Come on. Come on.

585
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:25,138
This is everything he wants, right?

586
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,389
Come on, Zoom.

587
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:33,062
Hey, stop fidgeting.

588
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,547
Sorry, it's been an hour.

589
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:36,266
I landed in a ridiculous position,

590
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:38,101
and my foot fell asleep.

591
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:40,186
He's probably just waiting
to see if you're really dead.

592
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:43,022
Any minute now, he's gonna strike.

593
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:46,276
No.

594
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:54,450
Sorry, I probably screwed up somehow.

595
00:28:54,452 --> 00:28:56,903
No, Linda, you did great.

596
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,240
Ugh.

597
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:07,430
So Wells ain't taking this well.

598
00:29:07,432 --> 00:29:09,081
- Mm-hmm.
- How about you?

599
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,968
Yeah, it just sucks, you know.

600
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,220
You were right a little bit

601
00:29:14,222 --> 00:29:16,272
about this not being just about Zoom...

602
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:19,475
about it being about the Reverse Flash.

603
00:29:19,477 --> 00:29:20,760
Okay.

604
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:21,978
But not for the reason that you think,

605
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,780
not because I didn't beat him.

606
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:26,933
It's... Wells...

607
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:29,452
he said something to me on that video

608
00:29:29,454 --> 00:29:31,120
before he confessed to my mom's murder.

609
00:29:31,122 --> 00:29:34,908
He said that even if he was dead,

610
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:39,245
that he still won because I wasn't happy,

611
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:41,581
that I'd never really be happy.

612
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,082
How the hell would he know?

613
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:45,919
He knew me. He knows future me.

614
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:47,887
That's future you.
This is the you here and now.

615
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:50,590
I still think that Wells is right.

616
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,959
Ever since I went back to that night

617
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,794
and I didn't save her...
I didn't save my mom,

618
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:58,264
I just... there's just been this void in me.

619
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:03,636
You know, I just feel like that
is always gonna be there.

620
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:07,974
For better or worse, Wells... He knew me.

621
00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:09,525
Better than I know you?

622
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:12,612
He may have stalked you
for 15 years, but I raised you.

623
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:16,282
Look, Wells said what he said
to you to mess with you...

624
00:30:16,284 --> 00:30:17,784
to get in your head one last time.

625
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:20,370
If you listen to him, you let him win.

626
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:22,255
I know. I don't want that.

627
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:25,208
You're responsible for your
own happiness, Barry.

628
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,093
Forget about Wells.

629
00:30:27,095 --> 00:30:29,128
Think hard about what you want

630
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,631
and what makes you happy.

631
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,600
Go out and get it.

632
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:35,468
Simple as that.

633
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,304
- All right?
- Yeah.

634
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:45,478
And look at their eyes.

635
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,314
Amazing.

636
00:30:48,316 --> 00:30:50,867
Oh, good to see you guys.

637
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:53,486
- Bye.
- Bye, Patty.

638
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,656
- Hey!
- Hey.

639
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,374
Have you seen this video
of babies' expressions

640
00:30:58,376 --> 00:30:59,375
as they go through tunnels?

641
00:30:59,377 --> 00:31:01,794
Their faces are priceless.

642
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:04,196
I'm not baby crazy or...

643
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:19,762
Wow.

644
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:21,931
What did I do to deserve that?

645
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:24,434
I've just been thinking
about what makes me happy,

646
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:28,771
and getting to know you makes me happy.

647
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:31,357
We should do more of that then.

648
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:46,405
Hey.

649
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:48,791
I wish I could have kept
the gloves at least.

650
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:50,877
What would you have done with them?

651
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:54,263
Raves, duh.

652
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:57,350
That is not what you were thinking about.

653
00:31:57,352 --> 00:31:59,886
I was thinking about a lot of things.

654
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:01,471
Like how everything that's happened to me

655
00:32:01,473 --> 00:32:03,589
the past few days is the best story

656
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:04,757
I can never write.

657
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,860
Ooh, tell me about it.

658
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:11,263
Do you ever get used to it?

659
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:15,702
Keeping a secret that big? No.

660
00:32:15,704 --> 00:32:17,770
It's pretty heavy.

661
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,874
I need a good night's sleep.

662
00:32:23,078 --> 00:32:25,211
I'm gonna head out.

663
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:27,780
I'll see you tomorrow.

664
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:30,883
Oh, hey, if we're gonna be
The Flash's sidekicks,

665
00:32:30,885 --> 00:32:33,720
we should probably join
CrossFit or something, you know?

666
00:32:33,722 --> 00:32:36,723
- Oh, yeah, girl.
- Yeah.

667
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:38,057
Bye.

668
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:51,187
Linda!

669
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:00,530
There you go.

670
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:02,999
It's like you think these things
just grow on trees or something.

671
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,984
And we threw away the last one for nothing.

672
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:08,421
You've been going over
this footage dozens of times.

673
00:33:08,423 --> 00:33:10,489
Everything went exactly according to plan.

674
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:12,959
If it had, Zoom would have shown up.

675
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:14,377
Maybe Light was wrong.

676
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:15,828
Maybe he can't see through the breaches.

677
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,713
Or maybe he finally decided to give up.

678
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:21,834
Hey.

679
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:22,835
Iris, slow down.

680
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:24,003
I can't understand you.

681
00:33:28,443 --> 00:33:29,442
Zoom has Linda.

682
00:33:29,444 --> 00:33:32,562
He's on the roof.

683
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:39,402
Put her down.

684
00:33:39,404 --> 00:33:43,122
You like to fish with bait?

685
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:45,074
I do too.

686
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,419
Come on. Come on.

687
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,758
You need to get out of here, okay?

688
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,060
No, you can't fight that thing.

689
00:34:04,062 --> 00:34:05,094
It's a monster.

690
00:34:05,096 --> 00:34:07,180
Just go.

691
00:34:29,058 --> 00:34:30,407
Zoom cannot be human.

692
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,326
He is... Or was.

693
00:34:32,328 --> 00:34:35,830
How the hell is Barry
supposed to defeat that?

694
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:40,084
Why is he running away?

695
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:42,453
He's not. He's not scared.

696
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:50,410
Ooh, he's gonna thunderbolt him!

697
00:34:50,412 --> 00:34:51,629
What?

698
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,849
Jay taught him how to throw lightning.

699
00:35:13,368 --> 00:35:14,601
Did you guys see that?

700
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:16,487
See him catch a bolt of lightning

701
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,156
with his demonic claws? Yeah, saw that.

702
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,208
Jay was right. He cannot do this alone.

703
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,160
He's not alone.

704
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,612
- Run, Barry.
- No.

705
00:35:25,614 --> 00:35:28,883
I'm gonna see if Wells'
speed-dampening serum works.

706
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:30,134
What do you want from me?

707
00:35:30,136 --> 00:35:31,952
Everything.

708
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:35,005
You want to be me? Is that it?

709
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,140
You want to be a hero?

710
00:35:36,142 --> 00:35:38,893
Heroes die.

711
00:35:38,895 --> 00:35:41,979
Only if you can catch them.

712
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:55,075
How is Barry gonna match Zoom's speed?

713
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:56,810
Genius. He's not gonna match it.

714
00:35:56,812 --> 00:35:58,445
He's gonna take it out
of the equation altogether.

715
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,364
- What are you talking about?
- Terminal velocity.

716
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,833
The highest velocity attainable
by a falling object.

717
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:05,452
- Falling through the air?
- Yeah, freefall fight.

718
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,004
Their drag force equals
the downward force of gravity,

719
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:09,039
making the net force zero, making...

720
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,925
Equal velocities. That is genius.

721
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:42,406
Never forget,

722
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:46,076
I am the fastest man alive.

723
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,866
- He's killing him.
- Barry.

724
00:36:57,756 --> 00:37:00,040
You're next.

725
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:15,739
Barry.

726
00:37:15,741 --> 00:37:19,693
Look at your hero.

727
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:28,085
This man is no god.

728
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:31,238
He is nothing!

729
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:44,301
The days of The Flash
protecting this city are over.

730
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,220
- No, hold your fire.
- Put him down.

731
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:50,891
Now what will you do
without your precious hero?

732
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,977
Shoot that thing, now.

733
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:10,177
Nice try.

734
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:23,273
- Anything?
- No.

735
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:25,392
- Do you have him?
- No.

736
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:35,836
Barry!

737
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:37,705
Harrison Wells,

738
00:38:37,707 --> 00:38:41,792
you thought you could defeat me

739
00:38:41,794 --> 00:38:44,428
with this?

740
00:38:47,015 --> 00:38:48,215
I made a mistake.

741
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:53,187
Yes, a costly one.

742
00:38:57,425 --> 00:39:00,527
Goodbye, Flash.

743
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:04,064
You, too, weren't fast enough.

744
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:07,218
Ah!

745
00:39:17,046 --> 00:39:21,331
No. No!

746
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,784
Stay with me. Stay with me, Barry.

747
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:27,671
Stay with me. Please, Barry, please.

748
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:32,726
This is all you! If Barry dies, you die.

749
00:39:32,728 --> 00:39:34,144
Joe, Barry's vitals have stabilized.

750
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:35,962
- Let's let him go.
- No, Caitlin.

751
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:38,298
Why? What good does that do for Barry?

752
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,634
It's gonna help me.

753
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:44,938
Joe, stop. Who's Jesse?

754
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,409
How do... Jesse's my daughter.

755
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:51,278
Zoom has her. You've... you did vibe me.

756
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,146
- Yes.
- What did you see?

757
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,199
I saw your daughter.

758
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:57,317
She was with Zoom.

759
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:00,003
But she's alive?

760
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:02,673
Yeah.

761
00:40:03,926 --> 00:40:05,876
Zoom sent you here like the others?

762
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:08,796
You kill The Flash, and you
get your daughter back?

763
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:10,163
The only way I get my daughter back is,

764
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:11,465
I capture Zoom.

765
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:15,519
Do you understand? You love Barry.

766
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:17,771
I love my daughter.

767
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:20,357
And none of these children are
safe as long as Zoom is here.

768
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:23,477
I tried on my Earth to capture him.

769
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:24,778
I failed.

770
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,115
I thought I could bring him down here

771
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:32,202
with Barry's help.

772
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:34,455
I was wrong.

773
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:49,536
Hey, I think he's waking up.

774
00:40:49,538 --> 00:40:53,307
Barry. Barry?

775
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:56,560
Can you hear me?

776
00:40:56,562 --> 00:40:58,095
Hey.

777
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:02,816
You scared the crap out of us.

778
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:04,852
You were gone for a long time.

779
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:06,553
How bad is it?

780
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:08,272
Bad.

781
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:11,742
If you didn't heal so quickly,
I'd be very worried.

782
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:14,394
- Linda... how is she?
- She's fine.

783
00:41:14,396 --> 00:41:17,498
She's staying with some
friends out in Coast City.

784
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,733
Zoom?

785
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:24,588
Let's... Let's worry about Zoom
when you're up and about, okay?

786
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:28,125
Oh, no, you're staying put.

787
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:30,627
Yeah, seriously, you got your ass kicked.

788
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:34,047
No, guys, I can't feel my legs.

789
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:40,587
I can't feel my legs.

790
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:44,781
