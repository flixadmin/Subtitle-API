1
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:13,296
Barry, please!

2
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:15,932
That's not me!

3
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:23,714
This can't be happening.

4
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:25,566
Are you real?

5
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:28,260
No, of course you're not.

6
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,267
That's it. That's it.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,315
I've finally lost it.

8
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:34,659
It's okay. I-I'm real.

9
00:00:42,193 --> 00:00:43,251
Oh, my...

10
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:47,163
I...

11
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:50,425
Oh, I-I...

12
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:52,835
I can't believe I'm
talking to another person.

13
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:55,036
It's been so long.

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,370
Wait, I know you...

15
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,016
you and your husband, Joseph Carver,

16
00:00:58,018 --> 00:00:59,675
you founded McCulloch Technologies.

17
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:02,211
You're Eva McCulloch.

18
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,680
But you're supposed to be dead.

19
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:06,590
No.

20
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,351
Not dead.

21
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:10,094
Just trapped.

22
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,765
Now so are you.

23
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:34,376
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

24
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:37,638
You see, until now, this
place was a whole world

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,250
with one inhabitant...

26
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:43,311
- Me.
- This must be another Earth.

27
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:46,046
Same Earth. Another dimension.

28
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:48,483
You see, a mirror-version
of Central City.

29
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:52,362
Same city, same buildings, just empty.

30
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:57,767
Who are you anyway?

31
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,219
I'm Iris West-Allen.

32
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:01,240
I'm a reporter for "The CC Citizen."

33
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:02,909
Never heard of it.

34
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:04,728
Not that it matters.

35
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:06,741
God, it feels so good
to have a conversation

36
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,986
that's not one-sided.

37
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:12,048
Everything is backwards.

38
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,490
Eva, you said that this place

39
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:15,837
was a mirror-version of our own.

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,995
How is that possible?

41
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:20,848
Think of it like this:

42
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,333
our reality is observed
by three dimensions:

43
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,927
width, depth, and length.

44
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,521
The superstring theory posits

45
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:29,029
that there are other realities,

46
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:32,080
fractal dimensions humans can't see.

47
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,175
So...

48
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:36,345
Two sides.

49
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,348
One, our world.

50
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:42,120
The other is just some empty reflection.

51
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:45,822
I'm a quantum engineer.

52
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,734
It's... it's my wheelhouse.

53
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:57,835
Yeah, that is a side-effect
of this dimension.

54
00:02:57,837 --> 00:03:01,556
I... I barely notice them anymore.

55
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,917
How did you end up here, Eva?

56
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,543
Six years ago,

57
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:09,764
I was developing the technology

58
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,308
to open doors to other
planes of existence.

59
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,301
I was in my office

60
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:17,897
the night Harrison Wells'
dream went up in smoke.

61
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,776
I've been here ever since.

62
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,903
Dark matter must have
washed over that mirror

63
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:34,922
and created a doorway.

64
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,758
I was in this office
when I got pulled in too.

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,692
But that's not all.

66
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:42,054
There is someone else on the
other side of that mirror,

67
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:43,073
another me.

68
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,932
How is that possible, Eva?

69
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:48,293
A fractal variable caused by the mirror.

70
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,513
A duplicate of you.

71
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:52,265
You mean the mirror
left a fake clone of me

72
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,603
in the real world?

73
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:54,888
We're getting out of here.

74
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:57,093
I've tried. For six years,

75
00:03:57,096 --> 00:03:59,596
I've been in my own personal hell.

76
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,857
Eva, I have to go home.

77
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:04,527
I'm sorry you're stuck here, but...

78
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:10,482
I thought I was gonna die here alone.

79
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,960
At least now there's two of us.

80
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,780
Investigation into the disappearance

81
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:18,800
of socialite Sue Dearbon.

82
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:22,995
Day 274

83
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,290
since her parents first
hired me to find her.

84
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:30,794
Status update.

85
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:32,296
Nothing.

86
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,056
Sue's trail went cold in Midway City

87
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:36,967
after Remington Meister
provided a dead end.

88
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:39,562
However, she was there.

89
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:41,847
Meister confirmed that much.

90
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,601
Hey, what are you still
doing here... oh, seriously?

91
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,138
Ralph. When I left last night,

92
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:49,488
you were standing here staring
at the exact same board,

93
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,870
same as the night before.

94
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,108
Honey, don't you think maybe

95
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:53,402
it's time you got a little help?

96
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:56,652
- And a shower?
- Cecile, this is my process.

97
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:58,673
I work things out with the only person

98
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:01,158
that can keep up with my
beautiful detective mind.

99
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,868
- Me.
- You could work with me.

100
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,037
We took down the FEMA guy
together, that was so great.

101
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,847
You're not loving that, all right.

102
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,257
- Um...
- Cecile, you know me.

103
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,542
I-I like doing things my own way.

104
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,177
Ralph...

105
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,212
every Holmes needs a Watson.

106
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,316
- Hang on.
- Mm-mm.

107
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:20,942
What is it?

108
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,055
So a couple months ago,
I put up these alerts

109
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,833
on Sue's bank accounts,
trusts, and credit cards.

110
00:05:25,836 --> 00:05:29,353
Apparently, she just
made a small deposit on..

111
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:32,064
an apartment in Central City.

112
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,616
See? Told you.

113
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:36,193
- Only partner I need is...
- This guy.

114
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,695
- Mm-hmm.
- See you.

115
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,901
Oh, wow, something
definitely just died in here.

116
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,210
Kara and Lex Luthor?

117
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,391
Man, this post-Crisis world

118
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:56,972
gets harder to understand every day.

119
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,757
Right?

120
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,529
- Man.
- What's wrong?

121
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:02,302
I'm still sore

122
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:05,222
from our little double date
with Amunet and Goldface.

123
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:06,556
So, so weird.

124
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:07,891
Maybe you should stay home today.

125
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:10,027
No, no.

126
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,246
Are you working on
more Black Hole stuff?

127
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,040
Yeah, I think I am getting

128
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:17,109
really close to taking
this son of a bitch down.

129
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,211
Yeah.

130
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,534
That's the mirror gun?

131
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,446
Yeah, it contains bleeding-edge

132
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,907
reflective micro-chip technology.

133
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,575
If I can examine the gun up close,

134
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:27,503
then maybe I can find
some kind of small clue

135
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:29,788
that connects the gun to Black Hole

136
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,624
since McCulloch created it.

137
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,085
It's still in the Starchives, right?

138
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:37,012
Yeah, yeah, it is.

139
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:40,270
Could you, um, get it for me?

140
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:42,774
Uh...

141
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,593
I-I mean, unlocking a weapon like that

142
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,346
sounds like a bad idea.

143
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:48,616
Barry, it's me.

144
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:51,101
I-I know, but I mean,
after what just happened

145
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,811
with you and Carver...
w-what if the gun

146
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:53,937
fell into the wrong hands?

147
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,364
Just like the cold
gun fell into Snart's.

148
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,291
It won't, trust me.

149
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:59,609
Iris, I... look, you I trust,

150
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,278
but, um, the guy who just tried to

151
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,155
to have you assassinated,

152
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,361
not so much.

153
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:07,116
I mean, and if Black Hole had a weapon

154
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,636
as powerful as the mirror gun,

155
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:10,996
I mean, there's no
telling what could happen.

156
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,054
Yeah, you're right. I will... um,

157
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,332
I'll try a different angle.

158
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:18,220
I'm just being cautious.

159
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,648
Yeah, I know, I get it.

160
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,507
Have fun.

161
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,801
Okay.

162
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,544
Not exactly the Ritz.

163
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,968
Get down!

164
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,542
What the hell, lady?

165
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,377
Hey, I just saved your life.

166
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,096
You're welcome, by the way.

167
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:06,694
Oh, my God.

168
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:09,012
It's you.

169
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,031
You're Sue Dearbon.

170
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,558
In the flesh.

171
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,269
And you are?

172
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,448
No one followed us. We're clear.

173
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:25,028
Sue, I... I have been looking for you

174
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,209
- for nine months.
- Ouch.

175
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:28,716
I hope you don't bill by the hour.

176
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:29,824
Where have you been?

177
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:32,293
A-and why did your
apartment explode in my face?

178
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:33,721
Yeah, hate it when that happens.

179
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,539
Look, I'm serious.
Now who set that bomb?

180
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,040
Why are they trying to kill you?

181
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,084
And how long has this been going on for?

182
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,637
Uh, my ex. Because I know too much.

183
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,898
About nine months. You done?

184
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,641
No, I'm most certainly not done.

185
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:48,760
Why is your ex sending
you explosive candy grams?

186
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,888
Ooh, the cheap stuff.

187
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:57,435
Look. Drinks later.

188
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,771
Spilling your guts to
tell a tragic story?

189
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,582
- That'd be now.
- Fine.

190
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,984
I fell in love with a murderer.

191
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:06,253
Happy?

192
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,426
John Loring.

193
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:16,096
Turns out Mr. Dreamy Muscles
and charisma-for-miles

194
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,975
was also a major arms
dealer on the black market.

195
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:20,584
So why does Loring want you dead?

196
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:23,846
Because I stumbled
across his client lists,

197
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,630
weapons inventory, and everything else

198
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,133
that exposes him for the
bag of crap that he is.

199
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,302
The first time he tried to kill me,

200
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,154
I was asleep.

201
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,805
All right, well...

202
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:37,290
- Who are you calling, Slick?
- Your parents.

203
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,862
To let 'em know you're safe.

204
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:41,479
Hmm.

205
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,700
What... come on, I just switched plans.

206
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:46,568
John can track your phone.

207
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,820
You call my parents, they're dead.

208
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,548
All right, then, uh,
we'll go to the police.

209
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,449
I know a Precinct
Captain who can help us.

210
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:55,327
The last time I tried that,
they tried to kill me too.

211
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,786
John's got cops on the payroll

212
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:58,881
in every city he does business.

213
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,719
Then what's your plan
to get out of this?

214
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:07,806
Sue, you can't run forever.

215
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,174
Who says I'm running?

216
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:13,320
You and Loring are hunting each other.

217
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,051
That's why you're in Central City.

218
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:17,157
John's in town for a massive sale.

219
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,235
If I can get damning
evidence on what he's doing,

220
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:21,996
he goes to jail.

221
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,355
And I go home.

222
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:26,166
I smell a mystery.

223
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,243
I smell...

224
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:29,670
Expired milk.

225
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,246
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

226
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:32,915
Your parents hired me
to do whatever it takes

227
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:34,175
to bring you home safely.

228
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:36,326
And that's what I'm gonna do.

229
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:38,578
- How?
- Easy.

230
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,872
I'm gonna find Loring, I'm
gonna get your evidence,

231
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,374
then I'm gonna take it to CCPD.

232
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,676
And after I do that,
I'm gonna take you home.

233
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,522
John's a killer. You'd
be risking your life.

234
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,482
For me.

235
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:55,553
If you get killed...

236
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,198
my parents are out good money.

237
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,150
I'm coming with you.

238
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:06,398
1,322. 1,322.

239
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,620
- 1,322. 1,322.
- Okay.

240
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:13,956
Eva, there has got to
be a way out of here

241
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,123
that we haven't thought of yet.

242
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,033
There isn't.

243
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:19,577
There's only two options in this place:

244
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,470
survival or madness.

245
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,790
1,322...

246
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,560
Eva, my husband will be
looking for me, please.

247
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:30,230
This is how it all starts!
Don't you understand?

248
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,724
You sit here and you think
everything's gonna work out.

249
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,977
You can't possibly stay here forever,

250
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:39,622
and then 1,322.

251
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,192
That's how many times I've
tried to escape this place.

252
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:45,440
That's how many times I've failed.

253
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:48,231
1,322 reminders

254
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,876
that I'm never leaving this place.

255
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:56,757
So please don't...

256
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,926
give me another one.

257
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,003
I'm having a really bad hair day.

258
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,851
I'm sorry. I...

259
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:19,304
I've been alone for a very long time.

260
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,740
Well, you're not anymore.

261
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,225
We just need one way out of here, Eva.

262
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:25,861
That's it.

263
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,784
Sam Scudder.

264
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,486
Who?

265
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,372
He was one of the bad
guys. He trapped...

266
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:40,423
someone in a mirror a few years ago.

267
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,018
And my friends got him out by
bringing it to absolute zero.

268
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,370
We...

269
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:46,706
Eva, we just need to
find some liquid nitrogen.

270
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,611
Well, I-I have a lab down the hall.

271
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:49,977
There should be some in there.

272
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,504
The nitrogen should slow
down the mirror's molecules

273
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:55,180
to the lowest enthalpy state possible.

274
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:57,109
Oh, my God.

275
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,153
This could work.

276
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:07,569
Hey, Barr. Morning.

277
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:09,145
- Hey.
- You got a sec?

278
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,374
Yeah, what's up, Captain?

279
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:11,831
- Eh.
- Yeah, that never gets old.

280
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,909
Yeah, it kinda does. Um, listen.

281
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:17,422
There was a house fire on
Batton Street last month.

282
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:18,800
- Okay.
- The occupant died

283
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:20,415
of smoke inhalation.

284
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,085
I'm wondering if you
could take a second look.

285
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:25,142
Joe, this case was already
declared an accident.

286
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:27,181
Yeah.

287
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:30,726
I need, uh, fresh pair of eyes on it.

288
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,998
Okay, I mean, what am I looking for?

289
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:35,547
Whatever you find.

290
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,409
Joe, I mean, I've got
a mountain of cases

291
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:38,675
I need to go through.

292
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:40,385
Ones that haven't been solved already.

293
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,388
Okay, all I can say

294
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,682
is that you'd be doing me a favor.

295
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:47,442
And whatever you find, Barr,

296
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:50,153
bring it directly to me.

297
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:52,272
Okay.

298
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:54,157
Thank you.

299
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:01,072
John owns that warehouse.

300
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,363
That's where the deal will go down.

301
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,458
Where are you going?

302
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:07,704
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

303
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,482
Oh, look, I get it.

304
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:10,915
Chivalry's your brand.

305
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,787
You're an MIT grad, speak six languages,

306
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,806
and you play polo.

307
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,617
You belong in a country
club, not in the field.

308
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:18,881
You belong in the 19th
Century with your Victorian,

309
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:20,717
save-the-damsel-in-distress crap.

310
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,811
Loring doesn't know that I'm coming,

311
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:25,072
so I have the element of surprise.

312
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,478
You, on the other hand,

313
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:27,908
he might kinda know that you're coming.

314
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,485
Translation: stay in the car, please.

315
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:55,576
I hope Loring looks good in orange.

316
00:14:57,923 --> 00:15:01,758
Uh, I don't suppose you're
a fellow bird watcher?

317
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,820
Huh.

318
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:18,754
Hey, Vin Diesel!

319
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,916
You still want me to wait in the car?

320
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:40,003
So you mind telling me
how you know martial arts?

321
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,011
My parents sent me
to Kyoto for a summer.

322
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:43,725
Trained with a blind sensei.

323
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:45,894
- Taught me everything I know.
- Really?

324
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:47,080
No.

325
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,156
I trained with a guy
named Frank at a YMCA.

326
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,808
Will you relax?

327
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,018
We're safe here. John's not stupid.

328
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,515
Killing me in a public place?

329
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:56,813
Uh-uh, it's not gonna happen.

330
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:59,333
I'm sorry, I believe
he blew up an apartment

331
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:01,043
- to get to you.
- That building was scheduled

332
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,619
for demolition next month.

333
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:05,513
But he does know that
someone's after him now.

334
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:07,365
It'll make him harder to get to.

335
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,583
Thanks to you.

336
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:11,981
Where are you going?

337
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:13,150
Sorry, Slick.

338
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:14,536
I can't partner up with someone

339
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:15,924
who doesn't think I
can pull my own weight.

340
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:17,875
Hang on a second, Sue. Hang on.

341
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,262
Will you just hang
on one second, please?

342
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:22,022
Look, when I take a case,

343
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,358
I see it through to the end.

344
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,768
And this doesn't end until you're safe.

345
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,445
Do you trust me, Ralph?

346
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,440
I just met you.

347
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:34,276
But you did save my keister.

348
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:37,612
Twice. And that means I owe you.

349
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:39,037
And I always pay my debts.

350
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,208
I'll take that as a yes.

351
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,951
So...

352
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:45,453
- without those pictures...
- We are back to square one.

353
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:47,381
Fortunately, we still
have John's ledger.

354
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,124
He keeps a detailed record of every deal

355
00:16:49,126 --> 00:16:50,516
he's ever made in it.

356
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,743
Years of evidence against him.

357
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,249
But his office is still
on the seventh floor

358
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:54,016
of that warehouse.

359
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,678
Which has probably doubled
its security by now.

360
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,222
But the sewer system,
that's a good way in.

361
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,775
Those tunnels, they lead
directly to the center

362
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:00,357
- of the building.
- And then we time our entry

363
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:02,436
- for when the guards...
- Change shifts.

364
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,666
And then we mosey up the
stairs into Loring's office,

365
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:05,715
we get the prize.

366
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:07,383
Well, you are slick.

367
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:11,646
Oh, my God, Ralph, you found her!

368
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,573
Oh, technically, I found him.

369
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,299
Sue Dearbon.

370
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,436
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,988
Cecile Horton. Meta-human attorney.

372
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,934
But I also have 20 years of experience

373
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:24,108
defending non-meta-humans.

374
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,777
The law is my game, Cecile is my name.

375
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,829
I can cover you no matter
what you've had going on

376
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,080
- all this time.
- Just need a quick word.

377
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:33,284
Oh, gotcha. Just one sec.

378
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,170
Listen, we're... we're...

379
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:37,284
we're kind of in the
middle of something.

380
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,281
Uh, Sue's been on the
run for the last year.

381
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:41,268
It turns out that someone's after her.

382
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,588
And you're her knight in shining armor?

383
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,108
Ralph, I love it!

384
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,444
By the way, you two? Hmm.

385
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,304
When I read the both
of you with my powers,

386
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,431
I could barely tell you apart.

387
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:57,951
Like, emotionally speaking,

388
00:17:57,953 --> 00:18:02,136
you and Sue are definitely
surfing the same wave.

389
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:03,522
Just trying to keep her safe.

390
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:05,607
I mean, it's not like we're dating.

391
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:15,209
I can't believe I didn't
think of this before.

392
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:19,473
You would have, eventually.

393
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:34,052
What's happening?

394
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,781
No.

395
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:46,357
It should've worked.

396
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,859
No.

397
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:51,703
No.

398
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,814
I really thought I was
going back to my old life.

399
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:10,774
Eva, you will.

400
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,860
It doesn't even matter anymore.

401
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:19,056
My sweet Joseph.

402
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,766
We were so in love.

403
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:26,998
I saw him in the mirror.

404
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,616
I watched him for five years

405
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:34,197
as he mourned, grieved, and...

406
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,991
moved on.

407
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:40,220
And I can't... I...

408
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,639
I can't move on.

409
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,694
- Gah!
- Oh, my gosh. Nash.

410
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:17,448
I didn't think anyone
else would be down here.

411
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,451
I-I lost something down here, so.

412
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,429
Oh, right. Well, that makes sense.

413
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,006
These Starchives are so massive.

414
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:27,100
- Okay.
- Okay.

415
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm sorry, what were
you doing down here?

416
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,847
Cisco asked me to hold down the fort

417
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:34,298
while he, uh...

418
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,722
He wanted me to take the inventory,

419
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,760
so I gotta do that. It sucks.

420
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:38,970
That's a lie.

421
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,452
Uh, what are you doing here?

422
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,162
I lost Nora's journal.

423
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,239
I haven't seen it for a couple weeks.

424
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,999
And, um...

425
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,792
you know, it's the
only thing I have left

426
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,610
of my daughter, so.

427
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:58,590
- Ah, must be hard.
- You would know, wouldn't you?

428
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,117
Now that I think about
it, that's probably...

429
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,994
I am digging up the past,

430
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,213
and, you know, maybe I should

431
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:08,383
start living in the present.

432
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:09,884
- So should we all.
- Mm-hmm.

433
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:12,062
But it's difficult for you.

434
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:14,222
Isn't it, Nash?

435
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:17,275
There's so much unfinished business.

436
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,051
- Look, Nash.
- Right.

437
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:21,804
Barry doesn't know about this.

438
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:23,156
He'll be crushed if he knew

439
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,316
that I lost anything of Nora's, so.

440
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:29,020
Could you maybe not mention

441
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:30,688
me being down here?

442
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,066
Maybe you should mention
why you're down here.

443
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,484
It'll be our little secret.

444
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:37,837
I always knew I liked you.

445
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,610
Loring's office is
right up those stairs.

446
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:12,396
Last one there buys the Gingold.

447
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,873
Hey!

448
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,950
Freeze! Stop or we'll shoot!

449
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:25,751
- At least he's not a pack rat.
- Focus.

450
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:26,952
Um...

451
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,346
- Not finding it.
- Search faster.

452
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,137
- Think I've got something.
- That's not a ledger.

453
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:38,398
No, it's a key for a safety deposit box

454
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,049
at the CC Mercantile Bank.

455
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:43,970
Where I'm guessing your ex hid
the ledger for safe keeping.

456
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:46,825
Good point. Time to go.

457
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,105
Whoa!

458
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,990
Uh, we have a problem.

459
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:58,918
- Do you trust me?
- Define trust.

460
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,444
Hang on.

461
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:01,904
Are you crazy?

462
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:03,256
Sometimes?

463
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,832
Don't let go.

464
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:19,630
We just...

465
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:22,091
You just...

466
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:23,759
You're the Elongated Man?

467
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:25,945
Yeah, I'm just full of surprises.

468
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,995
How... how did you become

469
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,865
the Elongated Man, anyway?

470
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:39,200
I was brutally experimented on

471
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:41,020
by a covert organization for years.

472
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:44,113
They forced me to consume
rubber-based polymer compounds.

473
00:23:44,115 --> 00:23:46,782
- Seriously?
- No.

474
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:49,326
I rode a bus.

475
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:54,572
So you're, like, an
honest-to-God superhero.

476
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:56,024
What's that like?

477
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:57,542
It's like any other job you love.

478
00:23:57,545 --> 00:24:01,005
It's rewarding as hell.

479
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,650
But boy, the hours? Let me tell you.

480
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,259
Seriously.

481
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:08,252
You're like a...

482
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:09,564
good person.

483
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:10,740
I helped you get a key.

484
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,807
It's no ledger.

485
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:13,017
Well, Loring's ledger

486
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,902
will definitely be in the box

487
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:16,404
that goes with this.

488
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:18,022
Now we know where the box is located.

489
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,120
All we have to do is open it.

490
00:24:20,123 --> 00:24:22,794
And then you can get back to your life.

491
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,529
Listen...

492
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,365
I want you to know how
much I appreciate you

493
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,919
trusting me with your secret.

494
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:33,481
It means a lot.

495
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:38,667
Uh...

496
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:40,211
I can call my friends at CCPD

497
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:42,522
and get a warrant for
Loring's deposit box.

498
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,672
Shouldn't take more than a day.

499
00:24:43,674 --> 00:24:45,246
We don't have a day.

500
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:46,444
Loring's already spooked.

501
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,343
He could move that box at any minute.

502
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:50,530
I feel like our only chance at...

503
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,056
- nah, it's too crazy.
- Come on.

504
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,775
Share your thoughts with the class.

505
00:24:55,353 --> 00:24:57,078
What if...

506
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:02,116
We break into CC Mercantile Bank now?

507
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:03,526
Just us.

508
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:04,931
And take the ledger for ourselves.

509
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:06,403
Believe that's called stealing.

510
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,715
Oh, come on, Slick.

511
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,550
You're also a P.I.

512
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,886
You can't tell me you've
always operated by the book.

513
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:16,181
No, but I can't commit a crime.

514
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:20,417
I get it.

515
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,378
And I respect that.

516
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,278
But Ralph, I'm not a hero.

517
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:27,174
So if this is the only chance I have

518
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:29,811
to see my parents again,

519
00:25:29,813 --> 00:25:32,188
I have to take it.

520
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,223
Sue...

521
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:35,608
being a hero,

522
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,186
it's about helping innocent people.

523
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:42,106
I'm not gonna let you do this alone.

524
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,750
- You're not?
- No.

525
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:46,160
But we do this my way.

526
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:48,379
We get inside, get the ledger,

527
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:51,740
and immediately bring
it to my friends at CCPD.

528
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:54,385
Deal or no deal?

529
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,681
Deal.

530
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,294
So? What did you find out?

531
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:05,588
- These scorch marks.
- Mm-hmm.

532
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,856
They're giant burns like

533
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,308
sunlight through a magnifying glass.

534
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,778
So in your expert CSI opinion...

535
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,522
The fire was started by UV light rays.

536
00:26:14,524 --> 00:26:18,526
Same way Dr. Light
torched "The Citizen."

537
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,412
All right, Joe.

538
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,989
What's going on?

539
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:26,108
Look, this isn't the only file I found

540
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:29,704
where it looks like something
had fallen through the cracks.

541
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:33,824
All of these cases
involve accidental deaths.

542
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,367
All the victims are associated

543
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:37,712
with this guy Joseph Carver.

544
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:41,332
I'm start to think that
somebody here in CCPD

545
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,667
is helping him cover this up.

546
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,023
You think there's a mole here?

547
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,484
Carver's influence runs deep, man.

548
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:54,395
Governors, mayor, CEOs.

549
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:57,306
Okay, all right, um,

550
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:00,472
look, this is what Iris
is already investigating.

551
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:03,062
Her lead had to do with the mirror gun

552
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:05,331
that we stole from McCulloch
Technologies last year.

553
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,761
It fell through because
I wouldn't give it to her.

554
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:09,208
Why didn't you give it to her?

555
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,069
- I mean, was it dangerous?
- Yeah, yeah.

556
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:12,275
I mean, it could put her in danger.

557
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:13,868
Yeah, I don't trust
what the world might do

558
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,950
if that gun got out there.

559
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:16,452
Yeah, well, the world is crazy,

560
00:27:16,455 --> 00:27:19,827
but it's clear that
Carver is really dangerous.

561
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,348
Iris is your partner and family,

562
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,183
and I don't think we
can trust this right now

563
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:27,836
with anybody other than family.

564
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,388
I'm sorry you're not gonna
see your husband again,

565
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:35,219
but it's easier if you just accept it.

566
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:39,848
Eva, you said that you wanna
go back to your old life.

567
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,952
Look, maybe it's gone, but
you can start a new one.

568
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,664
I'm glad it's broken.

569
00:27:48,284 --> 00:27:50,701
I'm glad it's broken.

570
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:56,907
I'm tired of looking at a world
that doesn't want me anyway.

571
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:00,911
I'm tired of waiting for
someone to come and rescue me.

572
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,747
And I'm sick and tired of people

573
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:06,559
telling me that everything
is gonna be all right.

574
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,460
Because it isn't.

575
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:11,472
It's never gonna be all right!

576
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:13,590
Never!

577
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:25,853
What just happened?

578
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:28,731
I think we just found
our way out of here.

579
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,901
And you're sure this is necessary?

580
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:35,063
A credible tip came in to CCPD

581
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:38,067
saying this branch was a
target for robbery, so yes.

582
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,076
Well, this is the only
way in or out of the vault.

583
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:42,281
The inner gate is fitted

584
00:28:42,284 --> 00:28:44,246
with an anti-theft electrical system.

585
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:47,149
Opening or closing it
without the manager's key

586
00:28:47,152 --> 00:28:49,918
automatically activates
a 50,000 volt fail-safe.

587
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,879
An electric fence to keep the cattle in.

588
00:28:51,881 --> 00:28:53,422
- Yeah.
- Smart.

589
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:54,840
Thanks, pal.

590
00:28:56,927 --> 00:29:00,596
Sweet Fancy Moses.

591
00:29:00,598 --> 00:29:03,432
Mmm.

592
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:07,194
Huh, I understand why people
are grossed out when I do that.

593
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:08,621
Your turn, Slick.

594
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,314
Oh, right.

595
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:17,797
You know, besides a
passion for fisticuffs

596
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,823
you've got a real knack
for detective work.

597
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,543
You ever think about
getting behind a desk?

598
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:25,496
Ugh, that sounds worse
than my boarding school.

599
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:27,048
Or the times my parents made me take

600
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,645
horseback riding lessons.

601
00:29:28,648 --> 00:29:30,885
Or learning French every Saturday

602
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:34,397
at the US Embassy in Paris.

603
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:40,862
Gee, your childhood sounds just awful.

604
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,823
I didn't say it was awful.

605
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,867
It just wasn't me.

606
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,323
The truth is,

607
00:29:48,326 --> 00:29:52,003
I always hated the
whole socialite scene.

608
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:54,817
Which is why, one day,
I woke up and realized

609
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,670
I had no idea who I was.

610
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:00,864
Guess I still haven't figured
out exactly where I belong.

611
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:03,501
Poor little rich girl.

612
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:05,536
How could she be so lost?

613
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:09,590
No, I... I get it.

614
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:12,334
I used to wear that
uniform you've got on.

615
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:15,212
I was a cop. A damn good one.

616
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:19,383
And then that ended
abruptly, and I got lost too.

617
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:23,437
And I rode that bus,
and found where I belong.

618
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:26,014
So you're saying there's hope for me?

619
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:28,993
There is from where I'm standing.

620
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,099
So, partner.

621
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:40,779
It's a big moment. You
mind if I do the honors?

622
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:43,582
Of course.

623
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:45,742
You earned it.

624
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,064
- Found it.
- Must be a tiny ledger.

625
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,899
Now what do you say we get out
of here and play "Mario Kart"...

626
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:06,322
What the hell?

627
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,572
I guess you're not the only
one that's full of surprises.

628
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:22,279
We are this close to taking down Loring.

629
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:27,835
Sue, why are you doing this?

630
00:31:27,837 --> 00:31:30,954
Who cares about Loring?
I don't even know the guy.

631
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,645
I do, however,

632
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:34,934
know where he keeps his valuables.

633
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:41,089
There never was a ledger.

634
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:42,591
- Keep going.
- That's why you rented

635
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:44,685
an apartment in Central City.

636
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:47,304
You knew I was keeping tabs on you,

637
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:50,449
so... so you lured me in.

638
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:53,185
You rigged your own
apartment to explode for...

639
00:31:53,187 --> 00:31:55,103
for what? Just to sell the story of...

640
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:57,531
of sympathetic socialite
running for her life?

641
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:00,034
You bought it.

642
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,277
But don't feel bad.

643
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,796
You're a good guy.

644
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:05,539
And a hero.

645
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,658
You probably see the best in everyone.

646
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,286
Me, I see what I want

647
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:13,047
and I take it.

648
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:14,498
You used my detective mind

649
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,435
to track down Loring's deposit box.

650
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,479
You... you played everyone.

651
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:24,984
Your parents are desperate to find you.

652
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,510
Do they even know what you really are?

653
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:29,680
No. That's our little secret.

654
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:34,518
If they found out their
only daughter was a thief,

655
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,186
they'd be devastated.

656
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,313
So you keep your mouth
shut about who I am,

657
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,833
I keep mine shut about who you are.

658
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:44,194
Deal, Elongated Man?

659
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:48,249
Sue, was anything you told me real?

660
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:50,534
Yes.

661
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:51,868
And no.

662
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,161
See you around, Slick.

663
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,721
CCPD.

664
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:12,014
You're all under arrest.

665
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:13,640
Nice try, officer.

666
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:16,369
But I have a silent
alarm on my deposit box.

667
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,729
So I know you stole that from me.

668
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,323
No phone.

669
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:23,834
Can't stretch through these bars

670
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,403
without getting seriously toasty.

671
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:32,668
Always come prepared.

672
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,078
- You don't wanna do this.
- Yeah, I do.

673
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,797
I'm that guy.

674
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:52,137
You're not getting
rid of me that easily.

675
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:56,141
- Give us a minute.
- Kill 'em both.

676
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,110
I'm inside you?

677
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:02,823
Do you have any idea
how disgusting this is?

678
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:05,275
- I'm saving your life.
- No, you're not.

679
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:06,220
We are not partners.

680
00:34:06,223 --> 00:34:07,752
I have handled being shot at before.

681
00:34:07,755 --> 00:34:09,139
Why does that not surprise me?

682
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:11,165
- Let me out.
- Sure, I'll let you out.

683
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,385
And then I'll take you to Iron Heights

684
00:34:12,387 --> 00:34:14,362
as soon as these idiots run out of ammo.

685
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:19,081
Ugh, do you ever shut up? Do something.

686
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,289
I am doing something.

687
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:22,250
What's your contribution to
this quaint little scenario?

688
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:23,436
Oh, wait, nothing.

689
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,587
This is all your fault.

690
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:30,425
Always come prepared.

691
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,132
_

692
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:53,706
_

693
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:55,704
Is there anyone that
doesn't want to kill you?

694
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:57,332
Not really.

695
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,477
_

696
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,510
I have really gotta learn Spanish.

697
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:20,684
You want the diamond?

698
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:21,744
Come and get it.

699
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:24,075
_

700
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:27,663
_

701
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:29,920
_

702
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:32,674
_

703
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:18,116
Looks like we've both been had.

704
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,748
She softened him up.

705
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:27,226
Let's finish the job.

706
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,226
It's all yours, Captain West.

707
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:38,929
Thanks, Flash. Clear this out, guys.

708
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:41,124
- Hey, bud.
- Flash.

709
00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:42,302
- Yeah.
- It's him.

710
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:43,696
He's the one who robbed us.

711
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:44,712
Excuse me?

712
00:36:44,715 --> 00:36:46,467
That's a case of mistaken identity, sir.

713
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,438
I'm sure Captain West can explain.

714
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,659
It's all right.

715
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:54,462
Hey man, I'm sorry I got word late,

716
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,830
but I searched the whole
area. Ultraviolet's gone.

717
00:36:56,832 --> 00:36:59,427
- Couldn't stop her.
- But don't worry, we'll get her.

718
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,763
I promise.

719
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:03,073
I wasn't talking about Ultraviolet.

720
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:11,493
Loring's in custody,

721
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,796
but facial recognition
isn't picking her up anywhere

722
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,682
in Central City.

723
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:18,426
Looks like Sue Dearbon has vanished.

724
00:37:18,428 --> 00:37:19,945
Again.

725
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:22,097
That's on me.

726
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,157
She played me, Iris.

727
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,619
Like... Coltrane's soprano sax.

728
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,210
Ralph, you can't beat yourself up.

729
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:30,623
I mean, it's not like you
knew who you were dealing with.

730
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,534
I'm supposed to be a master detective!

731
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:35,536
Ralph, we've all put our trust in people

732
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:38,088
who have betrayed us. God knows I have.

733
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,874
I'm gonna go tear down my crime board.

734
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,641
It's gonna take him a
while to get over this one.

735
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,720
Hey, Joe told me that
you came by CCPD today.

736
00:37:53,722 --> 00:37:55,463
I think I know why
you didn't come say hi.

737
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:11,229
What happened to it falling
into the wrong hands?

738
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:14,333
These are the right hands.

739
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:17,277
Joe and I found evidence
linking Carver's assassins

740
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:18,695
to more killings.

741
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:21,656
Crimes that CCPD thought were accidents.

742
00:38:21,658 --> 00:38:25,794
Black Hole is a lot more
dangerous than I even realized.

743
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:28,997
But if you can use this in
your investigation in any way

744
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:31,041
to bring down Carver
and his people faster,

745
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:35,020
then that's a good thing.

746
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:39,716
And while I don't trust the world...

747
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,052
I do trust you.

748
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:44,054
With everything.

749
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:52,062
Thank you.

750
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,791
You have a connection
to the mirror, even

751
00:39:00,794 --> 00:39:04,625
when it's broken.

752
00:39:04,627 --> 00:39:07,294
Now who sounds crazy?

753
00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:10,055
I've seen a lot of strange
things in the last six years.

754
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:13,133
You being able to control
that mirror is the least of it.

755
00:39:13,135 --> 00:39:15,728
Sam Scudder could even
travel through them.

756
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,230
Well, I'm not a meta-criminal
who jumps through mirrors

757
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:19,931
to rob banks.

758
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:21,303
I know.

759
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:23,065
You're much more than that.

760
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:25,092
We're the only people
in this world, Eva,

761
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:28,939
so trust me when I say that
you're stronger than you think.

762
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:32,018
You're a survivor.

763
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,562
Now prove it.

764
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:47,242
You did it. Now keep going.

765
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,090
1,323...

766
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:47,510
I'm still with you.

767
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,650
How did I do that?

768
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,750
I don't know.

769
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:12,160
But I promise you,
we will figure it out.

770
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:54,960
Game on.

771
