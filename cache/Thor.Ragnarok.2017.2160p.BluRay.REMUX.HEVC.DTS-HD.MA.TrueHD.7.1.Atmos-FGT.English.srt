- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?

659
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:00,509
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

660
00:40:00,593 --> 00:40:01,594
I'm stuck
in this stupid chair.

661
00:40:01,677 --> 00:40:02,970
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.

662
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:04,638
- Get me out of this one.
- I can't.

663
00:40:04,722 --> 00:40:06,056
- Get me out. What?
- I can't.

664
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,141
I've made friends
with this man.

665
00:40:07,224 --> 00:40:08,225
He's called the Grandmaster.

666
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:09,435
- Oh, he's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.

667
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:11,186
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

668
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:12,479
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.

669
00:40:12,688 --> 00:40:13,689
I just got here.

670
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:14,940
(WHISPERS) What are you
whispering about?

671
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:16,150
(YELPS)

672
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:17,860
Time works real different
around these parts.

673
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:21,071
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

674
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:22,865
But here on Sakaar...

675
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:24,908
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

676
00:40:28,412 --> 00:40:30,956
In any case,
you know this, uh...

677
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,374
You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

678
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,835
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

679
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:36,712
I've never met this man
in my life.

680
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:38,505
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.

681
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:39,673
Is he any kind of a fighter?

682
00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:41,091
(LAUGHS) You take this thing

683
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:42,176
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

684
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:44,011
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

685
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:46,138
Hey, Sparkles,
here's the deal.

686
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,515
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

687
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:49,850
Asgard.

688
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:52,770
Any contender who defeats
my champion...

689
00:40:52,978 --> 00:40:54,688
their freedom they shall win.

690
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,523
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

691
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:58,067
of whoever's ass
I have to kick!

692
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,819
That's what I call, contender.

693
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,364
Direction would be
this way, Lord.

694
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:05,032
Ah! Loki!

695
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:10,579
(GRUNTING)

696
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:12,915
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

697
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:15,709
- (PANTING)
- Over here.

698
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:17,378
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

699
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:20,089
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

700
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:21,924
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

701
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:23,300
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

702
00:41:23,592 --> 00:41:25,344
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

703
00:41:25,427 --> 00:41:26,887
But don't let that
intimidate you.

704
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:28,347
You don't need to be afraid

705
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,973
unless you're
made of scissors. (CHUCKLES)

706
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:31,350
Just a little
rock-paper-scissor

707
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:32,434
joke for you.

708
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:35,354
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

709
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:38,273
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

710
00:41:39,024 --> 00:41:40,317
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

711
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:43,153
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

712
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:45,114
Ah, well, I tried to start
a revolution,

713
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:46,240
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

714
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:47,908
So hardly anyone turned up,

715
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:50,577
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

716
00:41:50,911 --> 00:41:52,204
As punishment, I was forced

717
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:54,665
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

718
00:41:54,873 --> 00:41:56,166
Bit of a promotional disaster,
that one.

719
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,086
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

720
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:00,379
I don't know
if you'd be interested

721
00:42:00,462 --> 00:42:01,505
in something like that.

722
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:03,257
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

723
00:42:05,551 --> 00:42:06,552
How did you...

724
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,388
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

725
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,725
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

726
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:14,226
This doesn't make any sense.

727
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:15,602
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

728
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:17,229
The only thing
that does make sense

729
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:18,689
is that nothing makes sense.

730
00:42:19,022 --> 00:42:21,233
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

731
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:22,526
Doug has.

732
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:23,694
Doug!

733
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:24,945
Our luck, Doug's dead.

734
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:26,029
That's right.

735
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:27,281
Everyone who fights

736
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:28,449
the Grandmaster's champion
perishes.

737
00:42:28,907 --> 00:42:30,451
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

738
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:33,245
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

739
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:35,330
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

740
00:42:35,414 --> 00:42:37,249
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

741
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:39,168
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

742
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,753
Yes, I am.

743
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:42,838
Gonna fight him, win,

744
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:44,214
and get the hell out
of this place.

745
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:46,717
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

746
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,761
See you later, new Doug.

747
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,314
Does no one remember me?

748
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:03,358
Has no one been taught
our history?

749
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:10,491
Look at these lies.

750
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:12,659
Goblets and garden parties?

751
00:43:15,037 --> 00:43:16,580
Peace treaties?

752
00:43:17,498 --> 00:43:18,624
Odin...

753
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:20,375
proud to have it...

754
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:21,919
ashamed of how he got it.

755
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:23,295
(GRUNTING)

756
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:43,482
We were unstoppable.

757
00:43:43,565 --> 00:43:45,484
I was his weapon
in the conquest

758
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:48,028
that built Asgard's empire.

759
00:43:50,906 --> 00:43:54,201
One by one,
the realms became ours.

760
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:58,539
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

761
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:03,377
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

762
00:44:03,752 --> 00:44:06,421
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

763
00:44:06,713 --> 00:44:10,217
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

Most of the stuff in here

Or weak.

768

Smaller than I thought
it would be.

769
00:44:34,908 --> 00:44:36,410
That's not bad.

770

Being lied to.

788
00:46:38,073 --> 00:46:39,408
Being told you're one thing

789

and then learning
it's all a fiction.

come and see you, did you?

you could join me

No. I used to spin it
really fast,

off the...

up into the air,
and I would fly.

it would always
come back to me.

858

a pretty special

with this hammer...

860

and that losing it

861
00:49:29,077 --> 00:49:30,871
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

What happened to your hair?

1325
01:15:38,353 --> 01:15:39,563
Some creepy old man
cut it off.

- Is she okay?

- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?

1330

The city, Sokovia.
Did we save it?

- Banner, listen.
- What?

1332
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:53,910
Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

He kind of runs the place.

1357
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:49,841
You actually lived
at his house for awhile.

1358
01:16:49,925 --> 01:16:50,926
- I did?
- Yeah.

No, no, no.

Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.

These are Tony's clothes.

- Is he here?

No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

You know what I like about
being upset? The blame.

Right now, that's
the mindset that I'm in.

And you know who I'm blaming?

1383

- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!

1384
01:17:52,487 --> 01:17:53,488
Don't interrupt me!

1385

Here you go.

Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

1387
01:17:57,158 --> 01:17:58,785
He was interrupting.

1388

That's not
a capital violation.

Where was I?

My precious champion
has come up missing...

1391

and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

1392

It's all because of him.
Your brother.

Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

1394
01:18:12,966 --> 01:18:13,967
I'm sure
there's a big history.

1395
01:18:14,217 --> 01:18:15,218
And your contender...

1396

LOKI: My dear friend...

1397
01:18:17,387 --> 01:18:19,097
if you were to give me
12 hours,

1398
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,557
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

1399
01:18:20,807 --> 01:18:22,225
I could do it in two.

1400
01:18:23,226 --> 01:18:24,227
I could do it in one.

1401

Let's stop there.

1402
01:18:25,687 --> 01:18:27,397
You know what?
I woke up this morning

1403
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,190
thinking about
a public execution.

1404
01:18:30,233 --> 01:18:31,234
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

01:18:31,568 --> 01:18:34,279
(EXCLAIMS)
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1406
01:18:35,363 --> 01:18:37,866
So, you're on the clock.

1407
01:18:39,868 --> 01:18:40,952
What have you done?

1408
01:18:41,036 --> 01:18:42,287
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1409
01:18:42,412 --> 01:18:43,413
It's Loki.

1410
01:18:43,622 --> 01:18:45,123
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

1411
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,084
- (GRUNTS)
- Hmm.

1412
01:18:48,376 --> 01:18:51,087
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1413
01:18:51,504 --> 01:18:52,631
I don't help anyone.

1414
01:18:59,304 --> 01:19:00,305
You're a Valkyrie.

1415
01:19:05,393 --> 01:19:07,395
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1416
01:19:08,813 --> 01:19:10,315
Choose your next words wisely.

1417
01:19:10,649 --> 01:19:13,735
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1418
01:20:00,448 --> 01:20:01,449

THOR: The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1420
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:11,584
The sun's going down.

1421
01:20:11,668 --> 01:20:13,086

- Oh, shoot.

1422
01:20:13,461 --> 01:20:15,672
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?

1423
01:20:15,755 --> 01:20:16,798
I just need you to stay calm.

1424
01:20:17,048 --> 01:20:18,883
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1425
01:20:19,175 --> 01:20:20,802
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1426
01:20:20,885 --> 01:20:21,928
Yeah. One.

1427
01:20:22,262 --> 01:20:23,805
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1428
01:20:24,097 --> 01:20:25,223
It's a new experience.

1429
01:20:25,432 --> 01:20:27,350
My neurons,
they're firing faster

1430
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:29,436
than my brain can handle
the information.

1431
01:20:29,686 --> 01:20:31,855
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1432
01:20:32,147 --> 01:20:33,857
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

1433
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,233
each had a hand on the wheel.

1434
01:20:35,608 --> 01:20:37,277
But this time, it's like
he had the keys

1435
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,903
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

1436
01:20:39,154 --> 01:20:40,947
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

1437
01:20:41,156 --> 01:20:42,198
No, it's not what matters.

1438
01:20:42,407 --> 01:20:43,450
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

1439
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:45,076
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

1440
01:20:45,326 --> 01:20:46,703
Banner may never come back.

1441
01:20:46,995 --> 01:20:48,204
And we're stranded on a planet

1442
01:20:48,288 --> 01:20:50,040
that is designed
to stress me out.

1443
01:20:50,123 --> 01:20:51,249
We're not stranded.

1444
01:20:51,332 --> 01:20:52,667
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1445
01:20:53,209 --> 01:20:54,210
Thank you.

1446
01:20:54,544 --> 01:20:56,546
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1447
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,922
What?

1448
01:20:58,173 --> 01:20:59,758
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

1449
01:21:00,341 --> 01:21:02,510
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1450
01:21:02,761 --> 01:21:04,512
who also happens
to be my sister.

1451
01:21:04,763 --> 01:21:06,431
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

1452
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:07,724
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

1453
01:21:07,807 --> 01:21:09,059
That's a family issue.

1454
01:21:09,184 --> 01:21:10,435
No, she's an evil being.

1455
01:21:10,518 --> 01:21:12,312
I don't care what she is.

1456
01:21:12,395 --> 01:21:14,564
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1457
01:21:14,814 --> 01:21:15,815
- What?
- I just told you.

1458
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:17,650
If I turn into the Hulk,

1459
01:21:17,734 --> 01:21:18,902
I am never gonna

And you don't care.

1461
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,030
No, no. I'm putting together
the team.

1462
01:21:22,322 --> 01:21:23,531
The Hulk is the fire.

1463
01:21:23,823 --> 01:21:25,492
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1464
01:21:25,742 --> 01:21:27,160
- What? No!
- It's gross.

1465
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:29,079
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1466
01:21:29,454 --> 01:21:31,081
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

1467
01:21:31,164 --> 01:21:32,415
He's all like...

1468
01:21:32,582 --> 01:21:34,000
"Smash, smash, smash."

1469
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:35,251
I prefer you.

Thanks.

1471
01:21:38,046 --> 01:21:39,547
But if I'm being honest,

1472
01:21:39,631 --> 01:21:41,007
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

1473
01:21:41,257 --> 01:21:42,550
he is very powerful
and useful.

1474
01:21:42,884 --> 01:21:44,677
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1475
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:46,054
Is he though?

1476
01:21:46,346 --> 01:21:48,348
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1477
01:21:48,556 --> 01:21:50,308
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

1478
01:21:51,267 --> 01:21:53,144
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

1479
01:21:53,394 --> 01:21:55,188
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

What are you doing with that?

1481
01:22:00,527 --> 01:22:01,528
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1482
01:22:01,611 --> 01:22:03,279
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

1483
01:22:04,155 --> 01:22:05,615
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

1484
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,575
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1485
01:22:07,909 --> 01:22:10,286
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1486
01:22:10,537 --> 01:22:11,746
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1487
01:22:11,996 --> 01:22:12,997
Because you were naked.

1488
01:22:13,164 --> 01:22:14,290
Okay, I'll give you that.

1489

What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1490
01:22:16,501 --> 01:22:17,877
Tony wears his pants
super tight.

1491
01:22:17,961 --> 01:22:18,962
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

1492
01:22:19,295 --> 01:22:21,297
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

1493
01:22:21,589 --> 01:22:23,842
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1494
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:26,469
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

Hey. Shh. It's okay.

he transformed himself
into a snake,

and he knows
that I love snakes.

1620
01:27:01,369 --> 01:27:03,121
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1621
01:27:03,371 --> 01:27:04,789
and he transformed back
into himself

1622
01:27:04,872 --> 01:27:05,998
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

1623
01:27:06,249 --> 01:27:09,127
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.
