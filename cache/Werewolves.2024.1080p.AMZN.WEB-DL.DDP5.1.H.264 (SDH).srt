165
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,856
SOLDIER: All right.
Go ahead, Dr. Marshall.

166
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,943
Thank you.

167
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,071
MAN (on P.A.): Curfew is
in place for your protection.

168
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,466
Yeah, okay.

169
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,847
(grunts)

170
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,477
(muttering)

171
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,379
MAN (on radio): They don't
care about our rights.

172
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,672
WOMAN (on radio):
That's right. Our right

173
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,215
is to kill these motherfuckers.

174
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,508
MAN (on radio): Yeah, yeah.
It's up to us tonight

175
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,843
to fight these things.

176
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,970
It's up to us
to keep America safe.

177
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,388
WOMAN (on radio):
We are supposed to keep

178
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,015
our people safe.

179
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,767
MAN (on radio): That's right.
They're not gonna do it for us.

180
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,602
We have to do it for ourselves.

181
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,981
ARANDA: I trust that everyone
made plans for your loved ones.

182
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,734
I know it's not easy.

183
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,153
We have a nine-hour window

184
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,240
to assess, test,
and report our findings.

185
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,827
I would like to introduce
Wesley Marshall,

186
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,038
Global Rapid Response
team leader

187
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,956
and lead molecular biologist.

188
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,918
Evan Radcliffe
is second in command.

189
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,503
And Amy Chen,

190
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:19,298
chief Canis lupus biologist
and behavioralist.

191
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,302
They have been spearheading
our work here tonight.

192
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,764
(TV clicks on)

193
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,058
Now we know that the supermoon

194
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,851
triggers rapid DNA mutation,

195
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,603
and is photosensitive
to moonlight.

196
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,607
We hope to see
if this mutation can be blocked.

197
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,443
This team standing behind me
has developed a liquid

198
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,822
we call "Moonscreen."

199
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,406
It is our hope

200
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,117
that this Moonscreen
acts as a barrier

201
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,079
between the moonlight
and human DNA.

202
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:58,254
What we discover tonight could
go a long way to finding a cure.

203
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,673
It is not hyperbole to say

204
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:05,845
that our discoveries
could save millions of lives.

205
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,267
Emergency services
will be suspended

206
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,894
from sunset to sunrise.

207
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,398
Please stay out
of the moonlight.

208
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,861
Good luck tonight.

209
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:28,075
(yelling)

210
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,036
WOMAN (on P.A.): Please
be advised, for your safety,

211
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,038
we are now in full lockdown.

212
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,665
No one will be permitted
to enter

213
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,959
or leave the facility
until daybreak.

214
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,045
All exit points
have been sealed.

215
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,312
(indistinct chatter)

216
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,242
AUTOMATED VOICE: Subject
number three entering facility.

217
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,539
Subject number three
entering facility.

218
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,006
MYLES: Amy...

219
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:30,930
Whatever happens tonight,
remember, it is my choice.

220
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,266
I know.

221
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,521
I love you, Dr. Chen.

222
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,257
Don't worry, Dr. Chen.

223
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,718
We've taken
every safety precaution.

224
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,012
He's gonna be okay.

225
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,442
Myles can feel the supermoon
is about to rise.

226
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,487
All the Year Oners
know it's close.

227
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,323
They can feel it.

228
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:37,246
Whatever turned him last year
left a compulsive craving.

229
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,748
He's an addict without a fix.

230
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,919
Until tonight.

231
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,005
(door buzzes)

232
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,929
MAN (on radio):
We are now entering

233
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,472
the final hour of daylight.

234
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,767
Our prayers are with everyone,

235
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,477
and the team at Aranda Corp.

236
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,646
Let us hope they find us a cure.

237
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:07,067
Stay safe out there, everyone,
and Godspeed.

238
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,319
(video game beeping)

239
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,449
Scoot over, kiddo.
Mama needs in on this game.

240
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,659
You know
I always beat you, right?

241
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,328
Oh, it's like, it's like that?
Is it like that?

242
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,247
-(both laugh)
-Is it really like that?

243
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,666
But who wins the tickling?

244
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,670
Who-who-who? Who wins at
tickling, Emma? Tell me.

245
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,760
AUTOMATED VOICE:
30 minutes to canopy retraction.

246
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,095
30 minutes to canopy retraction.

247
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,265
30 minutes to canopy retraction.

248
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,523
Hey. You okay?

249
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,028
We're in it together. Yeah?

250
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,449
Breathe. Just breathe.

251
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,749
Three, two, one...

252
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,421
(buzzing)

253
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,589
Go time.

254
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,468
(door hisses)

255
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,724
ARANDA:
All staff to stations.

256
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,393
MALE SCIENTIST: Hey, Phil,
we're over here on Subject One.

257
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,271
PHIL:
Copy. Moving in.

258
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,818
Sir. Step forward.

259
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,696
FEMALE SCIENTIST:
Good luck tonight, sir.

260
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,783
MALE SCIENTIST:
Whoa, whoa, ma'am, ma'am.

261
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,911
-(woman whimpering)
-Ma'am, I need you to stay calm.

262
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,955
Your heart rate
is incredibly elevated.

263
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,540
Good.

264
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,917
MALE SCIENTIST:
Hey, hey, you sure this guy

265
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,627
passed the psych eval?

266
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,421
FEMALE SCIENTIST: It's not like
we had a lot of volunteers.

267
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,298
EVAN: (sighs) How come
I always get the crazy ones?

268
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,592
FEMALE SCIENTIST:
Right?

269
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,595
MALE SCIENTIST: Moonscreen
temperature... stable.

270
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,514
I really don't like
the name "Moonscreen."

271
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,517
We commence in ten minutes.
Ten-minute warning.

272
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,729
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Ten-minute warning.

273
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,398
Ten-minute warning.

274
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,275
I can't believe
they volunteered for this.

275
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,277
-Let me get in there.
-Go ahead.

276
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,820
SCIENTIST:
Excuse me, sir.

277
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,280
EVAN: You don't even know
if the Moonscreen will work.

278
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,991
It'll work. It has to work.

279
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,910
PHIL: Subject Three,
step forward, please.

280
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,037
Don't worry,
it's just a liquid nanotech

281
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,205
to protect your eyes.

282
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,540
It won't hurt.

283
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,338
WESLEY: All right.
Liquid lens team out.

284
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,383
-Formula team in.
-MALE SCIENTIST: Vitals out.

285
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,219
God, I hope this works.
Good luck tonight, guys.

286
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,679
WESLEY:
Keep moving.

287
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,848
SCIENTIST:
Good luck.

288
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,017
AUTOMATED VOICE: Five minutes
to canopy retraction.

289
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,935
-(chuckling)
-Five minutes

290
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,812
to canopy retraction.

291
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,319
WESLEY: Spray him down.
Make sure you get all of it.

292
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,281
Start the clock.

293
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,909
Notate how long
the screen lasts.

294
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,494
WESLEY:
Starting the clock.

295
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,829
SCIENTIST 1:
All right, spray down.

296
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,331
SCIENTIST 2:
Security, be ready.

297
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,540
Screen them up, guys.
Screen them up.

298
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,833
SCIENTIST 3:
Good over here.

299
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,757
PHIL:
Chin up, chin up.

300
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,802
(cackles)

301
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,805
AUTOMATED VOICE: Three minutes
to canopy retraction.

302
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,183
Three minutes
to canopy retraction.

303
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,518
Three minutes to
canopy retraction.

304
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,146
What happens if one of them
decides to moon the sky

305
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,357
once we open up this roof?

306
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,068
The formula penetrates
the thin fibers, Evan.

307
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,737
No one's showing their ass
and turning tonight.

308
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,866
(woman whimpering)

309
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,535
I changed my mind.

310
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,123
Hey. Hey.

311
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,541
Hey. Are you listening to me?

312
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,085
SCIENTIST:
We're losing Subject One.

313
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,796
AUTOMATED VOICE: Two minutes
to canopy retraction.

314
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,880
WOMAN:
Help me!

315
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,049
Two minutes
to canopy retraction.

316
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,342
(grunts)

317
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,594
Wait, wait, where are you going?

318
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,180
(cries)
Please, let me out of here!

319
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,015
-AMY: Should we sedate her?
-No.

320
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,978
Sedatives could interfere
with the test results.

321
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,357
She knew what
she was getting into.

322
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,734
(crying):
I don't want to turn. No.

323
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,777
(screams)

-WESLEY: We good?
-It's close.

821
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,923
(Wesley groans softly)

822
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,053
You remember
when a full moon meant...

823
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,015
...something cool and magical?

824
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,272
God, we gotta find a way
back to that again.

825
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,235
It's the only way
to go on with life.

826
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,907
I don't even know
what that looks like anymore.

827
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,576
"Go on with life." (scoffs)

828
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,664
You know, I've been around
this planet five times over

829
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,541
chasing pandemics?

830
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,797
I never had time for a family.
I didn't want one.

831
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,175
Give me a crisis...

832
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,928
I can handle that.

833
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,518
Now I have my brother's family,

834
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,228
and I don't know
how to take care of 'em.

835
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,107
You're giving them your best.

836
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,361
That's the problem.

837
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,155
I don't think
my best is good enough.

838
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,909

839

It's ready.

840
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,872
All right.

841
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,084
We just need to find
something to keep it cold.

842
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,921
-I'll go check the back.
-Mm.

843
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,886
(squelching)

844
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,788
-(low snarl)
-Hey.

845
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:30,627
Hey. How did you get in here?

846
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,796
(low growl)

847
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,801
Oh, fuck.

848
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,641
Stop.

849
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,270
Stop.

850
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,733
I'm not gonna tell you again.

851
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,194
Don't make me shoot you.

852
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,738
-Stop!
-(growls)

853

(both breathing heavily)

857
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,834
Just a kid.

858
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,212
I know.

859
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,258
Let's get out of here.

Stay here, baby.

863
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,307
My home is a sacred ground.

864
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:12,603
I will protect myself and
the ones I love at all costs.

865
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,689
I am a survivor.

866
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,734
I am strong. I am capable.

867
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,237
I bend, but I do not break.

871

That's a 12-gauge shotgun,

872
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,797
and I swear to God,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,924

01:25:12,982 --> 01:25:15,235
Wes, Wes, we're your...

1151
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:18,071
we're your family,
and we love you. We...

1152
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,532
Please don't do this
to us. Please.

1153
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,450
Oh, God!

Oh. Oh, God!

1156
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:49,060
Think of your...
think of your brother.

1157
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,979
Think of Sean.

(snarling)

1159
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:57,652
Remember...
remember your brother, Sean.

1160
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:02,657
Think of... think of Emma.
Think of Emma, your niece.

1161
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,868
Think of how much you love her.

1162
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:06,703
And we love you so much.

1163
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:09,956
Wes, it's me.

1164
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,125
It's Sean.
