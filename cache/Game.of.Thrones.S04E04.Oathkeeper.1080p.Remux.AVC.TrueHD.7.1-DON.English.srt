00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,830
If the killer threw himself
before the Iron Throne,

170
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:36,043
confessed to his crimes,
and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt,

171
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,502
it wouldn't matter to Cersei.

172
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:40,464
She won't rest until my head's on a spike.

She's offering a knighthood to
whomever finds Sansa Stark.

175
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,721
Sansa couldn't have done this.

176
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,307
She had more reason than
anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

177

Do you think it's a coincidence

178
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,143
she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?

179
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,644
No, but

180
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,106
Sansa's not a killer.

181
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,319
Not yet, anyway.

I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.

Did I kill Joffrey?

191
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,362
I've been in the Vale for weeks.

192
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,696
I know it was you.

193
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:50,367
And who helped me with this conspiracy?

194
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,496
There was Ser Dontos.

195
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,581
You used him to get me
out of King's Landing,

196
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,334
but you would never trust him to kill the King.

197
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,877
Why not?

198
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,587
Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.

199
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,382
Then perhaps it was your husband.

200
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,592
No.

201
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,970
How do you know?

202
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,555
I just do.

203
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,934
You're right.
He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.

204
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,145
But you were.

205
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:22,941
Do you remember
that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?

206
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:28,613
I don't suppose you noticed
that a stone was missing after the feast.

207
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:31,908
The poison.

208
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,954
I don't understand.

209
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,540
The Lannisters gave you wealth, power.

210
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,417
Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.

you are or what you want,

214
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,137
they can't know what you plan to do next.

215
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,475
I don't believe you.

216
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,687
If they catch you, they'll put your head

217
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,731
on a spike just like my father's.

218
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,901
You'd risk that just to confuse them?

219
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,989
So many men, they risk so little.

220
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,201
They spend their lives avoiding danger.

221
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,494
And then they die.

222
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:21,458
I'd risk everything to get what I want.

223

Everything.

225
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,766
My friendship
with the Lannisters was productive.

226
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,184
But Joffrey,

227
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,981
a vicious boy with a crown on his head,
is not a reliable ally.

228
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,234
And who could trust a friend like that?

229
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,527
Who could trust you?

230
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,281
I don't want friends like me.

231
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,659
My new friends are predictable.

232
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,244
Very reasonable people.

233
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,497
As for what happened to Joffrey,

234
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,334
that was something
my new friends wanted very badly.

235
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,878
Nothing like a thoughtful gift

236
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,172
to make a new friendship grow strong.

No.

00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,284
Have they even agreed to the match?
No one tells me anything.

248
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,288
I wasn't originally meant to
marry your grandfather Luthor.

249
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,500
He was engaged to my sister,
your great-aunt Viola.

250
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,379
I was to be given to some Targaryen or other.

251
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,257
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

252
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,052
But the moment I saw my intended,

253
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,972
with his twitchy little ferret's face

254
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,225
and ludicrous silver hair,
I knew he wouldn't do.

255
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:08,606
So the evening
before Luthor was to propose to my sister,

256
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,484
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

257
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,903
and happened upon his chamber.

Mmm-hmm.

261
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,661
The following morning,
Luthor never made it down the stairs

262
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:25,123
to propose to my sister
'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

263
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,751
And once he could, the only thing he wanted

264
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,086
was what I'd given him the night before.

265
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,213
I was good.

266
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,716

Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid.

270
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,355
She'll turn the boy against you
as soon as she can.

Accusing her brother of his murder,
which he didn't commit.

276
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,370

Why did she set you free?

You know why. She'd hoped
I'd send her daughters back to her.

that if her daughters were alive,
I'd return them to her.

So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.

I wanted to get back to you.

Should I have told her to fuck off?

You didn't mean it, then?

378

When you told me about
Bran going beyond the Wall,

505
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,484
all I could think about was
getting my strength back

506

512

They could try and find shelter at one of them.

There's 60 miles of wilderness

They know the Wall. They know our defences.

(GROANS)

664
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,343
Hodor.

665
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:18,229
(ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)

666
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:22,192
Hodor.

667
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:26,821
Hodor.

668
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,032
(GROANS)

669
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,452
Hodor.

670
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:37,082
If I was your size,
I'd be king of the fucking world.

671
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,583
(MEN LAUGHING)

672
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:50,470
Help him up.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

674
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,203
This is nice.

675
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,581
Fine leather.

676
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,168
You're no wildling.

677
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,963
Important. Highborn.

678
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,050
Who are you?

679
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,351
(GRUNTS)

680
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,228
You see, where I come from,

681
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,314
a commoner like me
slaps a little lord like you,

682
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:45,817
I'd lose me right hand.

683
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,487
But we're a long way from home, aren't we?

684
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,740
And then the two of you,

685
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:58,580
fancy-looking folks north of the Wall
creeping through the woods.

686
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:02,250
Isn't that a bit odd?

687
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,672
I like your curly hair.

688
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:12,302
My mom had curls like that.

689
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:16,139
Beautiful brown curls.

690
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,351
Why'd you drag a crippled boy
all the way up here?

691
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:22,270
Hmm?

692
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:28,818
See, you haven't played this game before.

693
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:31,738
A highborn hostage,

694
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,616
that's valuable.

695
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,035
But three of them,

696
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:40,788
that's a lot of mouths to feed.

697
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,498
RAST: What the fuck's wrong with him?

698
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:43,958
Come here.

699
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,501
(SCREAMS) No, please.

700
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,003
Please, let me help him.

KARL: Who are you?

702
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,505
Please.

703
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:50,673
Who are you?

704
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:55,053
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

It's Jon Snow's brother.

707
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,103
It's Meera. I'm right here.

708
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:08,775
And I thought
this was gonna be another boring day.

709
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,490
MEERA: I'm right here.
