on this planet to a normal boy.

We've never had three women
in The Seven before. This is a moment.

He swapped place cards
so he could sit next to me.

468
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,455
And he chatted me up all night.

469
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,082
Two days later,
there's a fire in his office.

470
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,710
They found his head in one room...

471
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,297
and his torso in another.

472
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,467
What are you saying?

473
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,471
I don't want him to do that to you.

Homelander?

You think Homelander did that?

The things that I've watched him do...

the things that he made me do...

479
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,834
If he ever finds out about you...

480
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,965
Why are you telling me this now?

481
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,850
I don't want you to hate me anymore.

Cool. Thank you.

You're welcome.

It's crazy
you don't have one already, actually.

Well, you can call me.

You know, Ryan, um, when I was your age,
I didn't have many friends, either.

Mom says being lonely
makes you know yourself better.

Well, that's not wrong, I suppose.

Can I tell you a secret?
Man-to-man? You know?

491

My dad and I, we never played catch
in the yard with a World Series ball.

492
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:12,950
Truth is...

493
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,911
I never had a dad.

494
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:18,330
Or a mom.

Wait, you didn't?

496
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:29,300
See, sometimes it's hard, Ryan,

being superior to every single
other person on the planet.

498

It's isolating.

499
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:41,854
And gods should not have to feel
that kind of...

you know, pain.

501
