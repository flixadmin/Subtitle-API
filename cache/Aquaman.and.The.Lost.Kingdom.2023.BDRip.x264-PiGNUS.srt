1
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,205
Stay down!

2
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,045
Don't move!

3
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,010
Yeah!

4
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,685
Mayday! Mayday!
This is the Sawyer-Two.

5
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,145
We're under attack by pirates.

6
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,605
Requesting an immediate aid.

7
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:09,904
They say everybody's
good at something.

8
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,114
Me? I talk to fish.

9
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,076
That's how I met my friend, Storm.

10
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,704
He's always there when I need a lift.

11
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,886
Some people think
that makes me a joke, but I don't care.

12
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,597
You know why?
'Cause I'm also good at something else.

13
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,603
And that's breaking heads.

14
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,405
Papa took on all the pirates.

15
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,031
I was like,
well, the pirates think that...

16
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,076
Papa kicked their butts.

17
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,958
Those chumlickers
didn't stand a chance.

18
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,296
Papa kicked their asses
and took their names.

19
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,339
Yeah! Come on!

20
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,135
Watch out.

21
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,641
Sorry, Pops. My bad.

22
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,687
Oh, yeah,
this is my son, Arthur Jr.

23
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,523
See, four years ago, everything changed.

24
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,360
I met a woman, fell in love,
and the next thing I know,

25
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,988
we're getting married and having a kid.

26
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,741
This little guy's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

27
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,456
But this kid, he doesn't sleep.

28
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,337
Okay...

29
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:51,922
And he never misses.

30
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,549
What the...?

31
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,967
And then, I'm up at the crack of dawn

32
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,261
because on top of getting married
and having a kid...

33
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,430
I finally got a job.

34
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,809
That's right.
I'm the king of freaking Atlantis.

35
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,481
How did I score that, you asked?

36
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,902
Well, I stopped my brother, Orm,
from attacking the surface world.

37
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,155
And in doing so,
I claimed the throne from him.

38
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,699
At first I was all like...

39
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:21,285
Yeah!

40
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,329
The territorial waters
are long held...

41
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,540
But then, as it turned out, being king
wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

42
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,542
I would kindly remind king nereus...

43
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,295
It's just meetings all day and politics.

44
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,422
I'm so bored, I don't even know
which end of the Brine King

45
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,341
I'm supposed to be looking at
half the time.

46
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,929
Yeah! That was awesome!

47
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,430
And as if that's not bad enough,

48
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:43,682
turns out there's this whole
Council of Houses thing

49
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,142
that nobody told me about.

50
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,645
Which basically gets to shoot down
everything I want to do.

51
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,481
The only thing
that makes all the hard work

52
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,275
and sleepless nights worthwhile
is hanging with my little man.

53
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,236
Hey! You missed me!

54
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,076
But of course,
there are fun parts of the job.

55
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,957
I get to keep the sea safe
the best way I know how.

56
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,922
Especially when I get to take down
an illegal cage fight or two.

57
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:24,432
But for everything I get right,
something else gets screwed up.

58
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,026
Ah, fu...

59
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,971
- Oh, yeah.
- Here you go.

60
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,603
SlÃ¡inte.

61
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,401
So...

62
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,280
he's gonna need a little brother
or sister to play with.

63
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,911
He's got a dog.

64
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,038
Hey, I'm serious.

65
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,459
I saw how lonely it was
for you growing up.

66
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,960
An only child.

67
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,881
I always regretted
I couldn't give you that.

68
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,092
Yeah, well,
don't be too hard on yourself.

69
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,429
Turns out I have a brother
and he's a total dickbag.

70
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:46,847
Come on.

71
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:51,352
Your relationship with Orm
isn't how it usually is.

72
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:57,149
Sure, siblings bicker and fight,
but at the end of the day, they're family.

73
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:01,195
You should be able
to count on them for help.

74
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,908
Yeah, well,
I'll still take the dog over him any day.

75
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,707
Hey, look at that.

76
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,469
Holy crap.

77
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,563
Hi, baby boy.
Are you talking to the fishies?

78
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,194
Oh, man.
Pops, this is blowing my mind.

79
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,323
My whole life I've wanted
to share this gift with someone.

80
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:50,953
Yeah, but you and me, son, we're different.
We're special.

81
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:54,540
We're connected to the land and the sea.

82
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,752
I can't wait to introduce you to all
the majestic creatures on our planet.

83
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,547
And show you how awesome
this world can be.

84
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,716
Yeah, you and me.

85
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:03,192
I cross-referenced the coordinates
from Dr. Shin. Nothing.

86
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,736
Still no sign of Atlantean remnants
under the ice.

87
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,031
Looks like he's led us
on another wild goose chase.

88
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:31,303
Every day I don't fix my power suit
is another day Aquaman gets to live.

89
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,767
Check again.

90
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,978
We're close this time.
I can feel it.

91
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:52,116
Expedition log day 463,
Dr. Stephen Shin recording.

92
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,744
My quest for Atlantis
has brought me to the ends of the Earth.

93
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,163
David Kane is losing his patience.

94
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,292
If I don't turn up the Atlantean
technology he's looking for soon,

95
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,671
they're probably going to...

96
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,467
You know what, let's not even go there.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

97
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,857
Dr. Shin, take a look at this.

98
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,401
Please tell me you found something.

99
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,737
Seismic array is going crazy.

100
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,071
Where's the epicenter?

101
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,407
We're standing on it.

102
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,556
Run!

103
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,565
What just happened?
An earthquake?

104
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,735
No. I think it was a piece
of ice sheet breaking off.

105
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,983
Come on. Get up.

106
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,237
- I think I broke my ankle!
- Come on, let's go!

107
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,573
Come on, get up. Go, we gotta go!
We gotta go!

108
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,702
Come on, we gotta move! Come on!

109
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,974
Please, please. No, no!

110
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,601
Help, please! Don't let go!

111
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,258
What the hell happened to you?

112
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,803
There's something back there.

113
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,569
Astounding.

114
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,822
My readings show something's down here.

115
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,825
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

116
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:07,079
If it is, we might be able to scavenge
the tech you need to fix your suit.

117
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,457
How is this place even possible?

118
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,503
This was all probably solid ice
until we started heating the planet.

119
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,966
Well, thank God for global warming,
am I right?

120
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,969
Yeah,
that's not exactly a good thing.

121
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,530
The tracks lead down there.

122
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,366
Suit up.

123
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:48,704
Wait. The tracks lead down there,
which means...

124
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,998
the monster's down there.

125
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,755
Okay.
I guess we're going down there.

126
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,615
I don't believe this.

127
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,077
It's a structure of some kind.

128
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,247
And there's more buried in the ice.

129
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,417
Here I thought we were just going
to find a ship.

130
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,713
- Everyone, fan out and search.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,674
We've stumbled upon
something big here, doc.

132
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,680
This has to be a few thousand years old.

133
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,265
Astounding.

134
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,001
What is this place?

135
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,508
At last, you are here.

136
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,499
Free me from my prison

137
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,502
and I will grant you the strength

138
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:46,173
to kill the man who murdered your father.

139
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,049
You can't leave him like this!

140
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,135
You ask the sea for mercy.

141
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:54,556
Get out of here. You need to live
so you can kill that son of a bitch.

142
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,852
You will take from him
what he stole from you.

143
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,982
His home will burn

144
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:09,029
and his kingdom will fall
before my legions.

145
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,163
David. No, David.

146
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,789
David!

147
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,958
David. David, it's okay.

148
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,251
You're all right.

149
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,047
What the hell is that thing?

150
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,856
Just unbelievable footage
coming in from all around the world.

151
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,857
Good evening, folks.

152
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,860
In the past five months we've seen
an extraordinary rise

153
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,238
in temperatures
reported around the world.

154
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,492
And that has resulted in some
of the wildest weather we've ever seen.

155
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,079
Yes, this is thundersnow in Dallas, Texas.

156
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:02,916
Visibility is near zero,
and there's more snow expected tonight

157
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,211
than Dallas usually sees
in an entire year.

158
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,130
It's only one part
of a worldwide weather phenomenon

159
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,675
unlike anything we've ever seen before.

160
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,515
Arthur.

161
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,271
The Council's called
for an emergency gathering.

162
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,773
There's been another plague outbreak.

163
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,569
In which scientists
are at a loss to explain.

164
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,530
But the real question is,

165
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,575
how long will it continue?
And how much hotter is it going to get?

166
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,080
Where did it hit this time?

167
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,125
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

168
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,170
and there are now reports of outbreaks
in the Fishermen Kingdom as well.

169
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,965
There haven't been outbreaks like this
in centuries.

170
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,049
Why now?

171
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:57,304
Increased ocean acidity, decreased
oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

172
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,222
Take your pick.

173
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:04,019
The surface has been poisoning
our atmosphere for over a century.

174
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,813
You can't expect them to care
about what happens to us

175
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,732
if they don't even know we exist.

176
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,151
If you want to be a part
of the conversation,

177
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,486
we have to take our seat at the table.

178
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,703
It's time for Atlantis to reveal itself
to the surface.

179
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,918
Your majesty is well aware
of the Council's position on this.

180
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,172
Listen, we can talk to their scientists
and combine our technologies

181
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,424
to reverse the damage
that they've already done.

182
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:39,512
And I know this is against our traditions,
but the world is shrinking,

183
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,848
and the old ways aren't gonna
protect us anymore.

184
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,768
Times have changed.

185
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,145
Atlantis wants this.

186
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,023
There's a whole generation out there
that don't want to hide anymore.

187
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,360
Have you already forgotten
that this plague

188
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,363
killed your own beloved mentor,

189
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,908
and you want to negotiate with them?

190
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:04,412
We gave your brother war powers
and made him Ocean Master for a reason.

191
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,125
If we ever decide to make ourselves known
to the surface dwellers,

192
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:13,171
it will be to eradicate them,
not to co-exist.

193
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,493
Hey, not bad.

194
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,248
Used to take me twice as long
to get you to go to sleep.

195
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,083
I don't know
how you did it, Pops.

196
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,252
Mera and I have
the whole kingdom helping us,

197
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,671
but that little baby boy is still
kicking our asses.

198
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,089
And you...

199
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,385
taking care of me,
raising me on your own...

200
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,808
You're the real superhero.

201
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,980
To single parents.

202
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,444
Well, my job was a little less
stressful than yours.

203
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,155
Yeah, well,
I just plain suck at my job.

204
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,491
Vulko told me to bring
the land and the sea together.

205
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:29,080
The problem is half of Atlantis
still wants to destroy the surface.

206
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,458
They won't listen.
I can't bring shit together.

207
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,586
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

208
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:35,962
I know.

209
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,507
I miss him.

210
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:43,678
Hey.

211
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,016
You can't save them all, son.

212
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,353
You really want to know how
I raised you here? By myself?

213
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,523
I just keep going.

214
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,611
You celebrate the wins,
you mourn the losses.

215
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,655
And you wake up the next day
and you do it again.

216
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:07,327
Sometimes not giving up
is the most heroic thing you can do.

217
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,763
Humans were not made
to live at these depths.

218
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,558
Yeah, don't worry about that.

219
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,519
You just remember who built this ship.

220
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,438
I'm more worried about how long ago
they built it.

221
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:22,151
We're coming up on it.
Engage stealth mode.

222
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,336
Hey, doc.

223
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,965
You stand ready
with that big gun of yours.

224
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,729
Expedition log, day 613.

225
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,315
Kane is off on our most
dangerous mission yet.

226
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:03,151
A three man octobot infiltration team.

227
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,614
It's incredible that these
ancient machines we found

228
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,116
still function after all these years.

229
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,410
All I did was retrofit them to our needs.

230
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:16,456
But they require a very specialized fuel
to keep them running.

231
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,750
Kane calls it orichalcum.

232
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,585
I don't know how he knows about this,

233
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,296
but it all started the day
he found that trident.

234
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,299
Suddenly, he knows secrets
that he couldn't possibly know,

235
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,218
including the only way
to obtain this orichalcum

236
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:32,305
is to steal it from highly-protected
storage vaults.

237
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,141
And we're about the hit
the most dangerous one of them all.

238
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,648
Okay, you have 15 minutes
to get in and out.

239
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,734
No margin for error.

240
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:43,042
Okay, this should take you through.

241
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,683
We don't want any confrontation.

242
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,269
David, we can't fight their entire army.

243
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,287
Stay vigilant.

244
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,415
We have no idea what kind
of security measures they have down there.

245
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,859
Commencing extraction.

246
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,738
Be careful. It's highly volatile.

247
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:02,914
Loading barge now.

248
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,851
Stingray. Change of plans.

249
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:25,561
I need an extraction now!

250
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,815
All hands to battle stations.

251
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,933
Astounding.

252
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,857
Attention, unidentified vessel.

253
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,568
- You are out of the transit zone.
- Doctor.

254
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,902
Power up the sonic battery.

255
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,946
Illegal border crossing will be met

256
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,948
- with deadly force.
- Now!

257
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,869
Commencing charge.

258
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,044
Border Control, intruder approaching.

259
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,297
Arm hydro cannon and lock target.

260
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,799
Hydro cannon at front border gate
locking in on target.

261
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:38,342
Chargers set to maximum power.

262
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:42,930
Intruder in sight.

263
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,307
Take them out!

264
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,148
What are you waiting for?
Fire!

265
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:25,222
Sir, Atlantean hostiles are approaching.

266
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,100
Split up. Make your way
to the extraction point.

267
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,477
Roger.

268
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,396
They've raided the storage vault.
We can't let them get away.

269
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,274
Don't worry, they won't.
I'm on this one.

270
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,667
Hold your fire!
They're cutting through the Night Market.

271
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,669
Watch out for the civilians.

272
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:53,019
Warning. Warning.
Illegal entrance into hypertube.

273
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,730
Exceeding maximum speed of 600 knots.

274
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:57,565
Reduce speed immediately.

275
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:44,820
Oh, shit.

276
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,005
David, we're here
at the extraction point.

277
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,840
The orichalcum on board and secure.

278
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,217
Come on, let's go!

279
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,510
Not yet!

280
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,137
I'm gonna kill me a dead mermaid.

281
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,567
Get away from my wife!

282
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:26,654
Your wife?

283
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,115
First you steal your brother's throne,

284
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,991
then you steal his woman?

285
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:34,328
Aquaman, shame on you.

286
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,962
David, we gotta go.

287
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,047
The entire Atlantean army
is headed this way.

288
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,049
If we don't leave now, we're dead.

289
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,557
Twenty degrees port!

290
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,491
Fire the sonic cannon!

291
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,327
Come on, Shin!

292
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,469
Lady Karshon has called
an emergency session of the High Council

293
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:17,681
to discuss a motion that would
strip the throne of its executive power.

294
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:21,477
The throne is the heart of Atlantis.

295
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:24,730
Too often now it stands empty,

296
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:28,359
while our king spends half
his time on land.

297
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:32,529
And now his surface world enemies
have followed him home.

298
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:38,160
This tragedy is merely a taste
of the havoc that will be brought,

299
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:41,914
if Atlantis ever becomes known
to the surface.

300
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:45,501
Because if he cannot protect
his own family,

301
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,712
how is he supposed to protect us?

302
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:59,181
He's different now.
He's stronger than before.

303
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,433
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

304
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,602
And where the hell did he get
all the new toys from?

305
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:07,439
The technology seems ancient,
but we've never seen anything like it.

306
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:11,610
That weapon he used
fires some kind of ultrasonic energy

307
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,237
that disrupts the nervous system.

308
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,780
Do we know what was stolen?

309
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,993
He escaped with a large stockpile
of orichalcum.

310
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,579
Am I supposed to know what that is?

311
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:25,833
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

312
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,502
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

313
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,337
that are highly destructive to our planet.

314
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:33,215
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

315
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,050
before we realized what we were doing.

316
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,555
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

317
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,225
has been buried in 12 storage vaults
deep underground.

318
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,060
Well, we should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

319
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,813
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

320
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,650
We think he's been launching secret raids
for at least five months.

321
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,235
This is just the time he got caught.

322
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,905
Well, this spike in global temperatures
that's causing disasters on the surface

323
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:01,160
and making the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

324
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:04,955
He's using the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

325
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,751
Why would he do that?

326
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,586
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

327
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,130
If he is using the orichalcum
to heat the planet,

328
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,298
we don't have much time.

329
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,425
He is pushing this past the tipping point.

330
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:21,013
He must be stopped
or a global climate meltdown is imminent.

331
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,891
We need to find him, but he has
completely vanished off the radar.

332
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,643
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

333
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,063
But you're not gonna like it.

334
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,815
Your brother?

335
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,777
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

336
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,695
but he's dealt with Manta in the past,

337
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:39,031
and he's the only one who might know
how to find him in time.

338
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,201
The Fishermen will never allow you
to speak to Orm.

339
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,244
He killed their king.

340
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:47,414
I wasn't exactly gonna ask for permission.

341
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:51,877
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract Orm
from an allied nation.

342
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,171
It would be an act of war.

343
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,216
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

344
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,052
I'm gonna break him out myself.

345
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:04,014
Arthur, Karshon is looking for a reason
to seize war powers.

346
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,725
You will be nothing more
than a figurehead if she does that.

347
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,520
My place is out there where I belong,
where I'm actually good at what I do.

348
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,814
I'm tired of nothing ever getting done.

349
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,066
I've got to do this.

350
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,153
If anyone finds out,
if you're caught...

351
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:21,407
it will tear the kingdoms apart.

352
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:25,953
Then help me not get caught.

353
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,585
Xebelian intelligence has recently
learned that your brother is being held

354
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:36,797
on the surface in a secret
one-of-a-kind underground facility.

355
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,093
They're assuming no sea dweller
would ever dare cross the desert.

356
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,262
And here's a special outfit for you.

357
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,682
What is that?
A boy's extra medium?

358
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,058
It's supposed to be tight.

359
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:50,936
The chromatophores change color
and camouflage you for up to a minute,

360
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,522
making you undetectable to most sensors.

361
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,816
They'll never see you coming.

362
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,445
What are we doing for comms?

363
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,196
Open comms are too risky.

364
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,741
I'll be sending a cephalopod with you
to act as a messenger.

365
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:07,744
That's an octopus.

366
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:11,165
Tactical Operations and Pursuit Operative.

367
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:13,083
Topo, for short.

368
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:17,254
Genetically engineered intelligence
for infiltration and espionage.

369
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,632
He also plays a variety
of musical instruments.

370
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:28,724
Just try and lay low
when we get in there, okay?

371
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,559
You might be invisible,
but your hectocotylus

372
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,227
is starting to smell like
warm chum butter.

373
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,607
Topo, you dumb squid!

374
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,150
God, come on!

375
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,445
Is ink piss?

376
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,656
The prison is guarded
by fearsome Deserter remnants.

377
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,535
Death-worshipping ascetics who survived
when the Sahara went dry

378
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,330
by turning to blood for sustenance.

379
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,499
If they catch you,
they'll bleed you dry.

380
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,502
When you find Orm, he'll be weak.

381
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,254
They're limiting his water supply...

382
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:02,424
just enough to keep him alive.

383
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:09,681
And if you do see Orm,
you tell him that I love him.

384
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,311
You tell him
that I think of him every day.

385
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,771
I will.

386
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,648
Look, I know he's family,

387
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,192
but you can't forget
who you're dealing with here.

388
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,944
Once you've broken Orm out,

389
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,529
you're not gonna be able
to turn your back on him.

390
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:26,532
You need him,
but you can never trust him.

391
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,220
You look rough.

392
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,140
What the hell are you doing here?

393
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,183
I'm here to break you out.

394
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,477
Have you lost your mind?

395
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,896
You're the one who put me here.

396
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,565
Why you bringing up old shit?

397
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,233
Come on, we'll talk about it later.

398
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:45,360
You cannot break me out.

399
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,988
There's a treaty
with the Fishermen Kingdom.

400
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,407
Look, I gotta stop David Kane
from destroying the world.

401
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,076
And you're the only one that can help me.
So you do the math.

402
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,829
Oh, shit.

403
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,832
Come on, Cast Away.
Grab Wilson, let's roll.

404
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,543
Come on. Let's go.

405
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,058
This changes nothing.

406
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,686
Wouldn't have it any other way,
little brother.

407
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,147
Do not call me brother.

408
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,691
Hermanito?

409
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:26,234
Come on.

410
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:33,241
Come on, Topo, you stupid squid!

411
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,493
Wake up and open the door.

412
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,371
Topo?

413
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,499
The cephalopod?

414
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,459
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

415
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:45,337
Topo!

416
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:58,767
All right, come on.

417
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,859
Wait.

418
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,781
Did you... bring water?

419
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:13,824
Yeah.

420
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,742
No, sorry.

421
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,411
I drank it all on the way here.

422
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,622
- What?
- Bro, it's hot up there.

423
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:44,271
Easy.

424
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,531
- You know how to ride one of these?
- Are you kidding?

425
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,074
I don't even know what the hell it is.

426
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:57,284
What?

427
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,291
Yeah!

428
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,427
Yeah!

429
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,741
Whoa, no!

430
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,322
All right, the water's right there.

431
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,949
Let's go, skinny jeans.

432
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,102
Yeah. All right.

433
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,188
Good job, little brother. High-five.

434
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,814
No.

435
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,900
All right. Good job.

436
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:29,955
You know, I got a bunch of king shit to do
back in Atlantis so we should go.

437
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:32,874
Come on, Topo!

438
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:58,233
This is worse
than I could have possibly imagined.

439
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,861
The safety and security
of Atlantis is a sacred trust.

440
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,572
No king has allowed
the great city wall to be breached

441
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:06,366
in a hundred generations.

442
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,910
A hundred generations? Really?

443
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,203
How many years is that?

444
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,831
I'm bad with geology.
What is that, like, a million years?

445
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,292
You're calling me one in a million?

446
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:18,670
How can you make jokes
at a time like this?

447
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:21,464
It's undignified for a king to jest.

448
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:23,800
Oh, excuse me, Your Highness,
if I use comedy

449
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,302
to mask my feelings and deal with stress.

450
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:29,764
Otherwise, I'd end up looking like you.
A very tight butthole.

451
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,975
Super tight.

452
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,771
You know, if the pressures
of leadership are too stressful,

453
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:41,484
perhaps you should leave and let someone
who knows what they're doing be king.

454
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:44,446
You know what?

455
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:47,449
I cannot wait to throw your ass
back in prison when this is all over.

456
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:50,869
You won't have to.
Once I stop David Kane,

457
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,328
I'll surrender myself to the Fishermen.

458
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,539
That is my honor to Atlantis.

459
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:57,167
You're so dramatic.

460
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,502
Whatever.
Just help me find this asshole.

461
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:02,005
Well, my contact
will at least know where to look.

462
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:06,092
What happened to him?

463
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,639
David Kane that I knew was ruthless,
but he wasn't insane.

464
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:15,351
This guy just put a gun to the world's
head and pulled the trigger.

465
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:17,395
Without even making any demands.

466
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:22,794
Congratulations, Dr. Shin.

467
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:25,296
That cannon of yours worked
exactly how you said it would.

468
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,843
Well, you found it.
All I did was figure out how it worked.

469
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:34,347
I didn't think we'd ever actually
have to use it on anyone.

470
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,808
Yeah, well, what can I say?

471
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:39,227
Things don't always go as planned.

472
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,937
But that's what I'm afraid of.

473
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:47,110
David, this stuff could reshape
the entire planet.

474
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:51,823
Hey, doc.

475
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:59,831
We are this close to unlocking
the greatest power in human history.

476
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:04,294
Are you really telling me
you want to walk away now?

477
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,216
If I said yes, would you let me?

478
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,595
Sure.

479
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:18,433
You want to see how long you last
in that jungle?

480
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,102
Be my guest.

481
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,034
Yeah, I'll stick around.

482
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,079
Yeah.

483
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,763
Welcome to the last frontier.

484
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:01,726
They scavenged ships from around the world
to build this place.

485
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,062
The Sunken Citadel.

486
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:08,066
It is the one place in the world
where the scum of the land and sea mingle.

487
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,611
It is where people come to disappear.

488
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,657
It's an impressive shithole.

489
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:18,952
How have I never
heard of this place before?

490
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:22,705
It is not meant to be common knowledge.
It's a pirate haven.

491
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,707
Pirates?

492
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:28,044
Listen, I don't know
if you know this about me,

493
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,338
but I'm not too popular with pirates.

494
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,391
Oh, I'm well aware.

495
00:51:47,689 --> 00:51:50,900
Relax.
It was the only way to get us both in.

496
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,947
You could've at least given me a heads up.

497
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,198
Would you have gone along with it?

498
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,450
- Hell, no.
- Then put a hook in it.

499
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,901
There. That's Kingfish.

500
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:36,070
He is the one who put me in contact
with David Kane.

501
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:39,866
He brokers deals with pirates,
mercenaries, slavers, you name it.

502
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:40,742
Cool.

503
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:42,744
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

504
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,371
Just let me handle this.

505
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:47,165
He's our best shot at finding Manta,

506
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,542
and he's not going to tell us anything
if you go in there

507
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,336
flexing your muscles at him.

508
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:56,382
You're so lucky we didn't
grow up together, little brother.

509
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,927
Do not call me brother.

510
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:01,888
Well...

511
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:06,225
This is a bit of a surprise, isn't it?

512
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,645
I didn't realize
you'd been released from prison.

513
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:12,565
It is a recent development.

514
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,694
Outlaws, aren't we all?

515
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,572
We need to find David Kane.

516
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,867
Bad news, I'm afraid.

517
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,496
David Kane is no longer on the market.

518
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:29,040
Not for sale at any price.

519
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:34,128
He's solely running
as an independent operator.

520
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,214
Where is he holed up now?

521
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:42,178
In exchange, I offer a favor...

522
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,808
from the King of Atlantis.

523
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,812
You seriously expect me
to play footsie with someone

524
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,730
with that kind of blood on their hands?

525
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:55,233
I don't have hands!

526
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:56,734
Or feet!

527
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:06,536
Listen, if the information
checks out good,

528
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:11,207
I promise you that I won't immediately
come back here and tear this place apart.

529
00:54:13,126 --> 00:54:15,128
That's too bad.

530
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:22,093
Traditionally, the kings of Atlantis have
turned a blind eye to the Sunken Citadel.

531
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:26,889
Now, we have to blind it for you.

532
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:37,191
Fine. Flex your muscles.

533
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,164
Smash his stupid head in!

534
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,624
Boom!

535
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:10,475
Gotcha, fatback!

536
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:16,939
Okay! Okay!
We can work this out. We can.

537
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,149
Talk.

538
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,194
I don't know where he is,
but there have been rumors.

539
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:25,406
A dormant volcano in the South Pacific,
called Devil's Deep.

540
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:27,366
Talk faster.

541
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,951
It's been barren for years.

542
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:31,162
But travelers say
there's a jungle there now.

543
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,915
Navigation gets scrambled
as soon as you start to get close.

544
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:36,918
And if you get too close,
you don't come back!

545
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:39,962
If I was a betting man,
and believe me, I am,

546
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:42,215
I'd say that's where Kane is hiding out.

547
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,428
We got all we needed.
Let's go!

548
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:02,818
<i>Rise up, come,
rise up through the fire</i>

549
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,910
Soon you'll be more powerful than he is.

550
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:16,457
But you're not ready yet,
and you involved him far too soon.

551
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:19,252
I sense them closing in on us.

552
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:20,670
Do I seem concerned?

553
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,258
If anything, it's even easier now.

554
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:28,094
We couldn't have planned it
any better than...

555
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:37,728
Hey.

556
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:41,315
I just wanted to tell you
that the orichalcum furnace

557
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,234
is now running at peak output.

558
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:36,912
I win.

559
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:44,712
Topo, go back to Atlantis
and give them our coordinates.

560
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:54,388
You know
what'd be amazing right now?

561
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:55,389
Reinforcements?

562
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:58,351
Great, big, greasy cheeseburger
and a pint of Guinness.

563
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,188
You gotta admit,
the food is so much better up here.

564
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,648
I find that hard to believe.

565
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,107
Hold up.

566
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:07,193
Are you telling me you never went topside
to have a cheeseburger?

567
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,779
- What?
- Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

568
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:14,617
Or a thick, juicy, medium raw steak
with fries and a shake, and you dip it...

569
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,954
Even the words that surface dwellers
give their food sound disgusting.

570
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,584
You've let your prejudices
stop you from enjoying half the world.

571
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:27,380
You should think about that.
It's your loss, dude.

572
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,431
Aw, yeah!

573
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:38,849
Bet you never had one of these.

574
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,560
- What is it?
- It's a cockroach.

575
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:43,521
You eat it?

576
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:45,439
Oh, yeah. Shrimp of the land.

577
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:04,959
That's good. Here, drink this.

578
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:10,381
Okay, you first.

579
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,249
Are you seeing this?

580
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,420
That's not normal?

581
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:56,510
Definitely not normal.

582
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:00,306
Let's get out of here.

583
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:02,767
You see how dangerous
the orichalcum can be?

584
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:06,061
I bet it mutated the flora and fauna
in a short amount of time,

585
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:08,522
turning them mons... trous.

586
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,075
Oh, shi...

587
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,422
Run!

588
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,009
Come on.

589
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:40,679
Faster!

590
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,771
What the hell are you doing?

591
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:50,856
I don't know.
I'm not used to running.

592
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:51,982
Just do what I do.

593
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:53,776
Use your arms, use your legs.
Lift them up.

594
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:55,444
Like this?

595
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,864
- Holy shit.
- Yeah!

596
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:00,282
- Wait up.
- Yeah!

597
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,441
We have to jump.
We'll survive the fall.

598
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,151
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

599
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,904
So, what do you wanna do?
Stay here and fight the hopping demons?

600
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,116
What is that? What does that say?

601
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,701
The writing is ancient Atlantean.

602
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,787
A true king builds bridges.

603
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,002
What are you doing?

604
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:59,508
Got any more krill-brained ideas?

605
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,914
See?
A true king builds bridges.

606
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,209
That's a metaphor!

607
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:37,087
Hey! I forgot to tell you.

608
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,505
Mom says she loves you.

609
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,591
She thinks about you all the time.

610
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,676
Why the hell are you
telling me this now?

611
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,346
I don't know. I'm just tired of waiting
for the right moment.

612
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,228
Come on.

613
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:23,842
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

614
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:36,772
David? I just ran more tests,
and this data is really disturbing.

615
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:39,858
We have to stop
burning the orichal... cum.

616
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,237
David?

617
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:57,603
Okay, doc, you want to know
my plan so bad.

618
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:00,022
Here it is.

619
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:04,693
I'm gonna kill Aquaman
and destroy everything he holds dear.

620
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:11,158
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

621
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,954
I will avenge my father.

622
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:19,917
Even if I have to make a deal
with the devil to do it.

623
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:23,670
David, you can't trust the trident.

624
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:34,556
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

625
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,603
Pray I never show it to you again.

626
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:06,213
We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

627
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:08,966
We should wait for Atlantis
to receive your message.

628
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,759
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

629
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:13,762
Yeah. Look, Loki,
I'm not asking for your advice on this.

630
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:15,681
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

631
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:18,100
So you can go on back
to Azkaban for all I care.

632
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:19,643
So, what's your plan?

633
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:20,978
I don't have one, yet.

634
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:24,064
But he came after my wife, which means
I'm gonna pull his tongue out of his butt.

635
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,276
Arthur, you are the king.
You cannot let this get personal.

636
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:29,945
This coming from the guy
who turned the entire nation of Atlantis

637
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,613
into his own private ego trip?

638
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:32,739
My ego?

639
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,993
You're the one who swam to the front gate
and challenged my claim for the throne.

640
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,287
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

641
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,664
If you weren't such an asshole,
you'd still be king.

642
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,332
Unbelievable.

643
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:43,750
Wait, wait! Wait!

644
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,336
You took my throne
and you don't even want it?

645
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:49,047
Are you kidding me? I hate this job.

646
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:52,009
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep
Atlantis from destroying the surface.

647
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:53,719
And I might even be screwing that up.

648
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,012
You really had no ambition for it?

649
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,180
Absolutely not.

650
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:58,849
From the day
my father found out you existed,

651
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,601
he prepared me for the moment
that you would come

652
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:01,852
and challenge me for the throne.

653
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,478
Wow, that's really sad.

654
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:04,980
Especially when you think how easily
I kicked your ass

655
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,815
with basically no prep time whatsoever.

656
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,151
Roasted.

657
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,320
That is not how it happened.

658
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:12,946
- That's exactly how it happened.
- Mera saved you.

659
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,406
No, she didn't.
I kicked your ass.

660
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,034
Nope. She made the little water tornado,
I fell in it.

661
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:18,493
Okay, shut up.
I think we're here.

662
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:28,795
Sleep, aloha.

663
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,172
Come on, let's do this.

664
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,758
Once this is over with,
we should go get some burgers and beers.

665
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,843
- Don't push it.
- Tacos and tequila.

666
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:36,720
I don't even know those words.

667
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:04,706
Hey!

668
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,117
Whoa, brother.

669
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,379
It's an orichalcum furnace.

670
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:55,173
All that stolen orichalcum.

671
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:56,925
They're just burning it up.

672
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:58,927
He's heating
the atmosphere on purpose.

673
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:01,013
This is catastrophic.

674
01:09:01,096 --> 01:09:03,432
This whole place must be
heat-shielded to protect it

675
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,309
from the surface's thermal satellites.

676
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,352
Question is, how do we stop 'em?

677
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:10,522
To take out this reactor,
we would have to crater the entire island.

678
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,607
Get away from there! Now!

679
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,780
This blaster may be ancient,
but it was built for killing Atlanteans.

680
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,247
Okay, I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

681
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:29,833
I just didn't want you to break me in half
before I could surrender.

682
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:32,711
Please take me with you.

683
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,340
Knock him out
and then help me hide these bodies.

684
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:38,342
No, no. Wait, please.

685
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,677
I didn't want any of this.

686
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:43,889
All I wanted was to see Atlantis
with my own eyes.

687
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:46,099
I thought I could share its wonders
with the world.

688
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:49,561
I'm a scientist
and I just wanted to be taken seriously.

689
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:53,315
David Kane said he could help me,
but now he won't let me leave.

690
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,526
You expect us to believe
you have nothing to do with this?

691
01:09:57,569 --> 01:09:58,695
I know.

692
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:00,781
I've done things I'm not proud of.

693
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:03,116
But he would've killed me if I hadn't.

694
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:06,119
Knock him out.

695
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:08,580
No.

696
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,415
- Then I'll knock him out.
- No!

697
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:12,793
- What?
- No.

698
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:15,796
Fine!

699
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:18,006
You can come with us.

700
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,883
Oh, thank you.

701
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,886
But you better start talking.
Or I'm gonna give you one sassa!

702
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,262
Okay, okay.

703
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:27,974
It's the black trident.
It's a direct link to some ancient evil.

704
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:30,143
It gives Kane great powers and in return...

705
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:49,496
I hate when that happens.

706
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:03,802
Stop them!

707
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:19,729
No, no, no, no, no!
Not the orichalcum!

708
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:20,981
You wanna blow us up?

709
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:22,774
- This stuff blows up?
- Yes!

710
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,318
My bad!

711
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:29,239
Then stop using it!

712
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,491
Just shut up and let me save your ass.

713
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,201
Again.

714
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:58,912
He's going to fight us
without the power suit?

715
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,580
I told you he's stronger now.

716
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:03,917
He's still just a surface dweller.

717
01:15:12,676 --> 01:15:14,302
Bro!

718
01:15:18,973 --> 01:15:23,019
I never expected to see you two
fighting side by side.

719
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,397
We're making a special exception
just for you.

720
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:33,279
No one hits my brother but me.

721
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:37,784
I was gonna kill you last,
but thanks for dropping by.

722
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,494
You're making this easy.

723
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:53,883
Yeah!

724
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,343
Come at me.

725
01:15:55,427 --> 01:15:56,678
The killer of kings.

726
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,865
Take that island down!

727
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:23,389
Fire at will!

728
01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:36,986
We've got to get out of here.

729
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:48,915
Malfunction. Malfunction.

730
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,333
Warning. Warning.

731
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:17,944
Shin, let's go!

732
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,576
What are you waiting for?

733
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:26,536
Fire the goddamn cannon!

734
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,851
I'm sorry
to drag you all into this.

735
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:34,437
But the Fishermen can't think
that Atlantis was involved.

736
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,774
Atlantis does not command
the armies of Xebel. I do.

737
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:41,277
And the Brine Kingdom
has not forgotten its debt to you.

738
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:42,946
You may count on us always.

739
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:45,114
Something happened to me.

740
01:19:45,907 --> 01:19:48,034
When I touched that black trident.

741
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,161
Why is he even here?

742
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,538
He should be on his way back to prison.

743
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:54,248
We should hear what he has to say.

744
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:56,125
I made that mistake once.

745
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:58,294
That's why I know he can't be trusted.

746
01:19:58,378 --> 01:20:01,089
And he cut off my claw.

747
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:04,342
This thing took a whole year to grow back.

748
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:06,803
Look, he wants to stop Manta
same as we do.

749
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:08,638
And just for the record,

750
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,848
the only reason we made it this far
is because of him.

751
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:14,519
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

752
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:21,025
Mom, I don't know enough about this.

753
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:22,610
Is that even possible?

754
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:26,072
All anyone knows for sure
is there once was a seventh kingdom

755
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:29,158
and then one day, just before the fall,

756
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:31,744
every record of it was stricken
from the chronicles.

757
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,956
How do you know what you saw
was the Lost Kingdom?

758
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,959
No one even knows
what it was called anymore.

759
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,585
It's called Necrus.

760
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:42,213
And I didn't just see it.

761
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:44,590
I knew it.

762
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:49,512
It's almost like I was... remembering it.

763
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:54,392
Flashes of someone else's memories.

764
01:20:55,268 --> 01:21:00,023
During King Atlan's time, there were
seven united kingdoms of Atlantis.

765
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:05,319
And the Black City
was a curse upon them all.

766
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,995
By exploiting orichalcum,

767
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:17,248
Necrus rapidly became a superpower
unlike any other.

768
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,167
But it came at a terrible price.

769
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:21,586
Poisoning the land, the sea.

770
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,339
Even the mind of the tyrant
who ruled Necrus.

771
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,137
Atlan's own brother, Kordax.

772
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,014
Atlan pleaded with him

773
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,224
to stop using it before the world

774
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:37,018
was irrevocably damaged.

775
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:39,604
However, Kordax resented Atlan,

776
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:42,607
thinking his own brother
was trying to steal his power.

777
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:47,236
So he resorted to dark magic
and crafted an instrument of evil.

778
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:49,447
That black trident.

779
01:21:58,706 --> 01:22:02,418
He transformed his people
and himself into monsters...

780
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:07,924
to fight Atlantis.

781
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,301
So the two brothers went to war.

782
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:24,524
But Atlan defeated Kordax
and imprisoned him and all of Necrus

783
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:27,485
with a spell cast with his own blood...

784
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:34,325
to ensure that Kordax's dark power
would never be found.

785
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:38,704
And that is why Necrus
is stricken from the chronicles.

786
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:53,302
This evil was supposed to remain frozen
for eternity.

787
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,682
But David Kane has found it.

788
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,935
And it's slowly possessing him.

789
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:05,648
But even with the ice cap melting,
Kordax still can't be freed.

790
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,359
Atlan used blood magic
to seal Kordax in his prison.

791
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:10,319
Only Atlan himself could release him.

792
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:14,824
Manta doesn't need Atlan himself.
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

793
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:17,285
Blood magic isn't really magic, it's DNA.

794
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:22,206
The key to Kordax's prison
is the royal bloodline itself.

795
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:26,169
That means he needs blood
from either you, me or Arthur.

796
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:29,755
We're the end of the bloodline.

797
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:35,219
No, we're not.

798
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:39,098
Wildfires would
have made headlines across the world.

799
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:41,392
But now, they're almost
a weekly occurrence.

800
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:44,687
We're witnessing unprecedented
weather events across the globe,

801
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,191
and meteorologists are at a loss
to explain this rapid change in climate.

802
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:50,026
From sweltering heatwaves and droughts,

803
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:53,529
which are shattering temperature records,
to torrential rains and floodings.

804
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:55,281
- What is going on?
- Hurricanes have been bearing down

805
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:58,367
on the East Coast, leaving
one million homes without power...

806
01:24:00,745 --> 01:24:03,039
Make that a million and one.

807
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:05,666
I gotta get the flashlight, bubba.

808
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,729
I'm gonna leave you alive,
so he can watch you die.

809
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:36,656
Dad!

810
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:38,366
- Tom!
- Dad!

811
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,660
Tom!

812
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,412
No! Dad!

813
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:44,664
Where's Junior?

814
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:49,085
No!

815
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:50,878
I'm sorry, son.

816
01:24:51,504 --> 01:24:52,630
Where's Junior?

817
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:56,217
Manta... took Junior.

818
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:58,761
- No!
- No!

819
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,222
No!

820
01:25:56,986 --> 01:25:59,071
The medics have
stabilized his condition.

821
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:00,740
He will be okay.

822
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:02,283
We just picked up a signal.

823
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:06,829
It's faint, but it's broadcasting
on an old Atlantean sonar frequency.

824
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,664
Headed to Antarctica.

825
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:12,501
- Bring our little one back.
- I will.

826
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,339
I've dreamed of this.

827
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:18,966
The two of you standing together
as brothers.

828
01:26:22,887 --> 01:26:24,972
Promise me you will protect each other.

829
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:30,144
Promise me, Orm.

830
01:26:44,325 --> 01:26:45,701
Go.

831
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:14,146
Great waves, Nereus.

832
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:18,067
Your warship is powerful,
but it's slower than a sea cow.

833
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:23,489
I say we ditch all this dead weight
and travel light.

834
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:25,991
And what are you gonna do
when he turns on that sonic cannon?

835
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:30,579
Our only chance is to hit him with total
overwhelming force from every direction.

836
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:33,666
- Not with Junior in the crossfire.
- What choice do we have?

837
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:35,751
We have no defense against that cannon.

838
01:27:35,835 --> 01:27:37,211
Well, wait a minute.

839
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:41,090
So this cannon sends out soundwaves that
messes with our nervous system, right?

840
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:44,051
That's right. Ultrasonic echoes.

841
01:27:44,135 --> 01:27:45,678
Well, what if we disrupt those echoes

842
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,555
with another soundwave
on the same frequency,

843
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:49,723
but just much, much louder?

844
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:51,767
You wanna disrupt their disruption?

845
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:53,853
Well, that's gonna be the easy part.

846
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:56,981
Take your weapons.

847
01:27:58,441 --> 01:28:00,192
And ready your steeds.

848
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:22,465
Really doesn't like you, does he?

849
01:28:53,954 --> 01:28:55,831
Made a lot of progress, doc.

850
01:28:55,915 --> 01:28:58,125
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job,

851
01:28:58,209 --> 01:29:00,002
but we were damn close.

852
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,630
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

853
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,051
My God, what did we do?

854
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:10,429
Nothing the world wasn't already doing.

855
01:29:10,513 --> 01:29:13,182
All we did was fast forward things
a few years.

856
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,727
The ice hasn't fully melted yet,
but our scanning reveals a weak spot.

857
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:18,604
Here.

858
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,232
This will lead you straight to Kordax.

859
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,735
Power up the sonic cannon.

860
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:27,738
Bag the child and suit up.

861
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:59,937
Captain, we have multiple
incoming hostiles.

862
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:03,023
You're too late.

863
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:13,826
No.

864
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:40,978
Commence charge.

865
01:31:31,862 --> 01:31:34,239
You've gotta be kidding me.

866
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:13,028
Astounding.

867
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:57,948
This place is immense.
It could be anywhere.

868
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:00,409
The throne of Necrus is
in the heart of the city.

869
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:03,036
- I sense something in the water.
- Everyone light it up.

870
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:12,796
Didn't you say that Kordax turned
his people into an army of monsters?

871
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,631
Yes. I did.

872
01:33:14,715 --> 01:33:16,216
Keep your eyes open.

873
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:19,553
Well, that'll be easy.
Mine don't close.

874
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:22,306
Everyone stand ready.
Something's coming.

875
01:33:27,186 --> 01:33:28,771
Fire at will!

876
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:45,704
We need to find a way out of here.

877
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:47,539
I think this goes
all the way through.

878
01:33:47,623 --> 01:33:50,042
My men and I can deal with these worms.

879
01:33:50,751 --> 01:33:52,920
Go now and save the prince.

880
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,047
Thank you, Your Highness.

881
01:33:57,424 --> 01:33:59,510
Come on, you spineless worms!

882
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,428
Bring it on!

883
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:11,456
Help me!

884
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:16,396
Give me the child.

885
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:14,037
You picked the wrong day
to grow a spine, doc.

886
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,209
Get behind the portcullis!

887
01:37:20,085 --> 01:37:22,212
We need to close the gate!

888
01:38:00,167 --> 01:38:02,627
Get away from my son!

889
01:38:03,336 --> 01:38:06,673
Your blood will do just fine.

890
01:38:08,133 --> 01:38:10,886
You want blood? Come get it!

891
01:38:25,192 --> 01:38:26,693
Aquaman!

892
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:18,787
You wear my brother's armor,
and wield his trident,

893
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:21,706
but you're only half the man he was.

894
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:24,501
How pathetic.

895
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:40,142
Mera!

896
01:39:55,657 --> 01:39:56,741
Go!

897
01:40:11,256 --> 01:40:12,340
Mera...

898
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:15,343
Run!

899
01:40:19,264 --> 01:40:21,558
Free me from my prison,

900
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:26,897
and all my power will be yours
to wield as you desire.

901
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:07,479
Kill him,
and you will be Ocean Master again!

902
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,864
Well, now this is certainly
an improvement.

903
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:20,659
Powerful, Atlantean body.

904
01:41:20,742 --> 01:41:24,246
And this one hates you more
than the other one did.

905
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:26,831
It's not true. Come on, little brother.
I know you're in there.

906
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:29,417
Don't you see? You can't win.

907
01:41:29,918 --> 01:41:32,796
Either you kill your brother or you die.

908
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:52,691
By Atlan's blood, this magic is broken.

909
01:42:05,996 --> 01:42:09,207
My eternal night is ending.

910
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:19,175
I'm done fighting your puppets, Kordax.

911
01:42:20,385 --> 01:42:22,262
I'm coming for you.

912
01:42:25,432 --> 01:42:26,516
- Give it to me!
- No!

913
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:29,185
- I can end this.
- Don't let him take it!

914
01:42:29,269 --> 01:42:31,521
Hasn't he taken enough already?

915
01:42:33,148 --> 01:42:34,441
Yield the throne.

916
01:42:34,524 --> 01:42:37,986
It's time for me to reclaim my destiny.

917
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:40,905
It would be foolish
to think he could ever change.

918
01:42:40,989 --> 01:42:42,490
I knew you would do this.

919
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:44,701
You are the one true king.

920
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:48,204
Atlantis deserves its one true king.

921
01:42:50,582 --> 01:42:54,502
I am the one true king!

922
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:05,305
You know, there was a time when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

923
01:43:06,181 --> 01:43:09,768
Let you know that you weren't alone,
that we were in it together.

924
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:11,978
Promise me
you'll protect each other.

925
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:20,862
Come on, little brother,
let's end this bastard.

926
01:43:21,321 --> 01:43:23,740
I meant what I said when I first met you.

927
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:26,326
No matter what, you are not alone.

928
01:43:26,993 --> 01:43:28,286
We're in this together.

929
01:43:31,873 --> 01:43:33,208
You are my brother.

930
01:43:38,797 --> 01:43:39,714
Orm.

931
01:43:42,801 --> 01:43:44,302
Let go.

932
01:43:58,608 --> 01:44:00,527
Orm, let it go.

933
01:44:19,546 --> 01:44:22,298
I live again!

934
01:44:22,924 --> 01:44:28,513
I have waited countless centuries
in the dark for this moment.

935
01:44:34,727 --> 01:44:35,937
Shit.

936
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:44,863
Arthur!

937
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:12,700
Never.

938
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:23,586
Arthur, we've gotta go.
The magic is broken.

939
01:46:38,768 --> 01:46:39,894
Let's get outta here!

940
01:46:52,323 --> 01:46:53,491
Hurry!

941
01:46:59,080 --> 01:46:59,998
That's right!

942
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:01,624
Come on, baby! Yeah!

943
01:47:17,599 --> 01:47:18,433
Yeah!

944
01:47:38,995 --> 01:47:39,996
My love.

945
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:44,083
Hi, baby boy.

946
01:47:53,718 --> 01:47:54,594
Shin.

947
01:47:55,553 --> 01:47:56,554
Thank you.

948
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:04,604
Astounding.

949
01:48:09,942 --> 01:48:12,654
All here looking intact.
That's good. That's good.

950
01:48:13,071 --> 01:48:14,155
Well, I'm not.

951
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:16,282
My claw got cut off.

952
01:48:16,366 --> 01:48:17,659
Again!

953
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,495
You're one tough crustacean,
Your Highness.

954
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:24,332
As far as I'm concerned,
your debt is paid.

955
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,585
Not everybody's gonna see it
that way though.

956
01:48:32,465 --> 01:48:34,926
It's too bad you went
and had yourself killed back there.

957
01:48:36,969 --> 01:48:37,970
Yes.

958
01:48:38,054 --> 01:48:39,847
All this ice.

959
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:43,017
It'd be impossible to find the body.

960
01:48:44,769 --> 01:48:46,062
Just lay low for a while.

961
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:47,980
But don't go too far.

962
01:48:48,398 --> 01:48:50,400
I may need to call you up for some advice.

963
01:48:50,483 --> 01:48:53,361
You know, with the whole
running the kingdom thing.

964
01:48:59,409 --> 01:49:00,535
Thank you...

965
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:03,955
Brother.

966
01:49:19,095 --> 01:49:21,180
You're not as bad at this as you think.

967
01:49:23,015 --> 01:49:25,768
The people of Atlantis
are lucky to have you.

968
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:28,855
You were everything I was not.

969
01:49:28,938 --> 01:49:31,941
You do the right thing when doing
the wrong thing is much easier.

970
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:37,864
And you're willing to ask for help,
even from your worst enemy.

971
01:49:39,699 --> 01:49:42,577
I know it may not feel like you know
what you're doing sometimes, but...

972
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,454
keep trusting your instincts.

973
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:48,666
If you lead, Atlantis will follow.

974
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:54,797
After all, a true king
builds bridges, right?

975
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:58,050
I thought that was just a metaphor.

976
01:50:00,428 --> 01:50:05,266
Well, your metaphor
might have just saved the world's ass.

977
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:30,750
We've got breaking news.

978
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:32,084
We are witnessing history.

979
01:50:32,168 --> 01:50:34,545
A moment the ramifications
of which simply...

980
01:50:34,629 --> 01:50:35,546
cannot be overstated.

981
01:50:38,591 --> 01:50:39,675
A first contact...

982
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:41,260
with the undersea nation of Atlantis.

983
01:50:41,344 --> 01:50:45,515
An entire civilization hidden for
thousands of years about to be revealed.

984
01:50:51,979 --> 01:50:54,732
I think it's safe to say
the world will never be the same.

985
01:50:54,816 --> 01:50:57,109
The King of Atlantis
has reached out to the United Nations

986
01:50:57,193 --> 01:50:59,195
and will be officially seeking membership.

987
01:50:59,278 --> 01:51:00,863
And is expected
to propose a joint effort

988
01:51:00,947 --> 01:51:02,406
to reverse the climate issues.

989
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:03,908
We are told that this was the result

990
01:51:03,991 --> 01:51:06,744
of weeks of secret negotiations
with the United Nations.

991
01:51:06,828 --> 01:51:08,663
We now go live to Ellis Island,

992
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:10,623
where the first official ambassador
from Atlantis

993
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:12,875
is about to address the United Nations.

994
01:51:21,843 --> 01:51:24,762
I come here today
as a representative of two worlds.

995
01:51:25,388 --> 01:51:27,765
The land and the sea.

996
01:51:31,394 --> 01:51:35,690
And I stand here as proof
that change is coming to both.

997
01:51:36,148 --> 01:51:40,278
And I'm calling for global unity
for a global crisis.

998
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:45,491
To finally bring harmony between us
and the natural balance of our world.

999
01:51:46,659 --> 01:51:50,913
Atlantis stands ready to help
contribute its science and technology.

1000
01:51:50,997 --> 01:51:54,417
And with your knowledge of the air,
and our knowledge of the seas,

1001
01:51:55,084 --> 01:51:57,044
together we can write
the next chapter in our story,

1002
01:51:57,795 --> 01:51:59,213
rather than its ending.

1003
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:03,259
Sometimes it's gonna seem like
our differences are too extreme,

1004
01:52:03,759 --> 01:52:05,928
but all we have to do
is look beneath the surface,

1005
01:52:07,263 --> 01:52:11,392
to see that we're all here on this planet
with the same goals and aspirations.

1006
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:12,560
- Even when our customs
- Here you go.

1007
01:52:12,643 --> 01:52:15,563
- Might seem strange and unfamiliar.
- Beer and a cheeseburger.

1008
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:17,648
Extra greasy like you asked for.

1009
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:21,903
And by overcoming our prejudices,

1010
01:52:21,986 --> 01:52:24,488
we'll become stronger
and learn more about ourselves.

1011
01:52:25,615 --> 01:52:28,993
We can seize this moment
to create a better more hopeful future,

1012
01:52:29,368 --> 01:52:32,455
for our children, and our families.

1013
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:35,958
My name is Arthur Curry.

1014
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:39,754
I'm the rightful sovereign
of the undersea nation of Atlantis.

1015
01:52:39,837 --> 01:52:41,797
I'm a father, a brother,

1016
01:52:41,881 --> 01:52:44,467
a warrior and a friend.

1017
01:52:45,635 --> 01:52:47,637
I'm the King of Atlantis.

1018
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:50,640
I am Aquaman.
