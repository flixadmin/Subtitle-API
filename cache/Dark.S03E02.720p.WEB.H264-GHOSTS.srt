1
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:18,860
Get dressed.

2
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:06,920
- Martha?
- It can't be.

3
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:09,860
You... You're alive.

4
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:20,610
This is not Martha.

5
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,902
What's going on here?

6
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,610
He's right.

7
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:45,902
I'm not Martha.

8
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:49,819
Not your Martha.

9
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,235
I promised I would fix everything.

10
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:58,235
So none of this would happen.

11
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:01,735
So that you don't die in my world,
and I don't die in yours.

12
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,337
So that Ulrich, Dad, Mikkel...

13
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:08,985
so... so that you all come back.

14
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:11,860
So all this can really end.

MISSING FOR THREE MONTHS

<i>I think you did the right thing.</i>

<i>Even if the coffin is empty.</i>

48
00:06:58,153 --> 00:07:00,444
To... To get closure.

49
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:05,610
At least you have each other.

50
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:08,527
They're here for support.

51
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:19,444
At least we have each other.

52
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:23,944
Now we can get our closure together
looking at a coffin that's empty.

53
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:39,652
Tell everyone where you were
when Mads vanished.

54
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:48,569
Fucking your girlfriend!

55
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:53,027
He was screwing Claudia Tiedemann
when my son went missing.

56
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:05,194
If only you'd devoted as much energy
to finding your own son

57
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,152
as you devoted to your mistress,

58
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,069
then maybe Mads wouldn't have gone.

59
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,277
I'm not sure what you're saying.

60
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:36,694
WHERE IS CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN?

61
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:39,110
You're not sure what I'm saying?

NUCLEAR POWER PLANT HEAD
MISSING SINCE JUNE 26,

63
00:08:54,236 --> 00:08:56,152
THE DAY HER FATHER
WAS FOUND DEAD AT HOME.

64
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,652
POLICE

65
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:39,837
<i>Scientists are
still looking for an explanation</i>

66
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:42,004
<i>for the events of June 27, 2020.</i>

67
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,754
<i>The presumed origin for the catastrophe</i>

68
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:47,212
<i>is assumed to be
the small town of Winden.</i>

69
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:51,337
<i>A French team of scientists believes
it possible that our world stood still</i>

70
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:54,295
<i>for a fraction of a nanosecond
on June 27th,</i>

71
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:57,379
<i>possibly causing
the divergence of tidal forces.</i>

72
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:59,879
<i>This would explain the global tidal waves,</i>

73
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:04,129
<i>weather phenomena
and disturbances of electrical systems,</i>

74
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:07,629
<i>which in turn could explain
the countless number of airplane crashes</i>

75
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:11,712
<i>and the simultaneous electrical outages
at nuclear power plants worldwide.</i>

<i>There is currently

77
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:46,069
How are you?

78
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:51,694
Mom.

79
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:06,735
You're leaving already?

80
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,069
I'll return before the sun goes down.

81
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,152
In five days this'll all be closed off.

82
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:47,527
Men, over here!

83
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,569
This whole area's been evacuated.

84
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:54,360
We have orders
to seal off the restricted area.

85
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,152
What?

86
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:00,860
To wall it in.

87
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:12,110
Why do this to her?

88
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:53,819
- You're from a parallel world?
- Where Mikkel didn't disappear?

89
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:55,694
And I'm mute.

90
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,444
And Jonas doesn't exist?

91
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:06,277
Where we're all dead because your world
ends just like ours does?

92
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,527
That's all bullshit.

93
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:13,069
I'm not dead...

94
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:14,860
I'm here.

95
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:26,069
How were we found?

96
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:31,319
How did you know where we are?

97
00:14:32,944 --> 00:14:34,360
Jonas told me that.

98
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:39,402
I thought
there was no Jonas in your world.

99
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,069
He traveled.

100
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:51,610
From your world to mine.

101
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:00,444
You're lying.

102
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:03,985
I never went to your world.

103
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:07,277
Did you write the letter?

104
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:10,819
What do you really want here?

105
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:14,337
Did Adam send you here?
What did you use to travel?

106
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:16,004
Tell me what you used to travel!

107
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,402
You're late today.

108
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,110
The machines aren't running yet.

109
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:41,819
You have a visitor.

110
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,319
So you're the reason

111
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:11,027
why his mood
is even worse than usual today.

112
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:17,694
You have no reason to fear me.

113
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:22,194
People may say
that I'm not quite right in the head,

114
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:24,652
but I assure you

115
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:30,610
that I see more than those of you who see.

116
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:43,277
- Do you know this child?
- No.

117
00:16:43,361 --> 00:16:45,420
- Do you know this child?
- No, sorry.

118
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:47,360
- Do you know this child?
- No, sorry.

119
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:50,319
- Do you know this child?
- No.

120
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:53,902
Ulrich.

121
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:01,944
I know you?

122
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:08,944
Do you know where this child could be?

123
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:13,152
WHO HAS SEEN MICHAEL KAHNWALD?
12 YEARS OLD

124
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:15,527
Maybe that lunatic got him.

125
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:18,819
What lunatic?

126
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:21,734
Get your hands off me, lady.

127
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:23,527
Hey, Ulrich.

128
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:25,819
Ulrich?

129
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:29,110
I thought you weren't coming today.

130
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:36,110
Katharina?

131
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:39,027
We're going to be late for history.

132
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:41,587
Katharina Albers.

133
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:42,819
Hello?

134
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:47,944
Now I remember.

135
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,235
What's her deal?

136
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:57,777
The old lady ain't all there.

137
00:17:58,486 --> 00:17:59,652
Come on.

138
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:01,421
Hey.

139
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:03,902
Hey! What lunatic?

140
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:06,444
What lunatic?

141
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:18,152
Someone escaped
from the asylum this summer.

142
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:21,027
He grabbed Michael
and took him to the cave.

143
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:24,277
It was in the paper.

144
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:27,444
You stay the hell away from Mikkel.

145
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:28,944
And from Ulrich.

146
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:55,879
VISITOR'S PASS - NIELSEN, TRONTE

147
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:10,444
I told all of this to the police already.

148
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:13,027
It won't take long.

149
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,069
I promise.

150
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:21,277
And... this is for the newspaper?

151
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:27,402
The week before Claudia vanished...

152
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:33,027
did you notice anything?

153
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,235
Her appearance always mattered to her.

154
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:41,235
She was always put together.

155
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:42,860
But that week...

156
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:45,985
twice she wore the same thing.

157
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:49,194
She forgot appointments. Her hair...

158
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:52,069
I thought...

159
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,610
it all had to do
with that dog and the old woman.

160
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:00,712
She showed up a few days
before Mrs. Tiedemann disappeared.

161
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:03,402
And she said that the dog was hers,

162
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,069
but then she didn't take it with her.

163
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,985
After that,
Mrs. Tiedemann was somehow just...

164
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:14,402
changed.

165
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:43,152
Excuse me.

166
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:49,444
We're looking for
a woman in her late forties,

167
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:51,069
blonde hair.

168
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:53,902
And a teenage girl, red hair.

169
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:58,735
If they're not on the wall,
then they're not here.

170
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:17,485
This is good.

171
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:22,194
If they're not here...

172
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:24,485
then...

173
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:28,277
Maybe they've traveled.

174
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:40,920
CALL FOR WITNESSES
WE ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE

175
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:44,652
MISSING TIEDEMANN, CLAUDIA

176
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:47,944
Hey!

177
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:51,277
The man from the psych ward.

178
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:56,735
- Why didn't you tell me about that?
- I thought I'd already explained this.

179
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:00,004
You can run in here as often as you like

180
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:03,337
demanding information on the whereabouts
of Michael Kahnwald,

181
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:04,837
but you won't get any.

182
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:07,569
Someone tried to kidnap my son
this summer.

183
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:08,819
Your son?

184
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:12,170
You can't identify yourself,

185
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:15,462
nor do you have any proof
you're actually the boy's mother.

186
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:17,712
You're not registered anywhere.

187
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:20,462
You don't have a birth certificate.

188
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:23,837
And, astonishingly,
you don't even want to reveal your name.

189
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,444
In three months nobody's seen him.

190
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:28,527
He doesn't go to school.

191
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:30,444
He's not at the house.

192
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:34,194
This man from the psych ward...

193
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:36,819
I actually remember that.

194
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:39,235
My mother told me about that.

195
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:43,152
He could... He could have tried
to do it again, couldn't he?

196
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:48,194
Listen to me carefully.

197
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:51,087
The boy hasn't disappeared.

198
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:54,629
Child Protective Services know
where Ines and Michael Kahnwald are.

199
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:58,360
After what happened this summer,
they decided the boy needed some time off.

200
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:01,754
And the lunatic was returned to the ward.

201
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:04,152
Where he's been the past 34 years.

202
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,944
What was that you just said?

203
00:24:09,444 --> 00:24:11,254
Let me be totally clear.

204
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,462
If you turn up here again,
I'm putting you in protective custody.

205
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,587
- What is his name?
- Afternoon.

206
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:17,819
What is his name?

207
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:06,694
Hello, Regina.

208
00:25:14,194 --> 00:25:15,485
Is that your dog?

209
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:20,152
She was my mother's dog.

210
00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:27,444
Would you like a ride?

211
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,610
Strange, you know.

212
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:54,152
Looks just like Gretchen.

213
00:25:56,694 --> 00:25:58,860
I assume that's why she kept her.

214
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:04,735
Do you think...

215
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:10,860
that all these things with Mads
and my mother... could be connected?

216
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:15,735
I just don't know.

217
00:26:21,694 --> 00:26:27,319
The week before she vanished, did she say
anything to you about an old lady?

218
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:34,777
And...

219
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:38,277
did she say anything about me?

220
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:48,277
I...

221
00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:53,110
just thought
she might have said something.

222
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:58,527
I'll...

223
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,235
get out right here...

224
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:04,527
and walk the rest of the way.

225
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:19,152
Regina...

226
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:23,819
if there's anything you might need...

227
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,504
My name is Claudia Tiedemann.

228
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:23,069
I am one of the only survivors
of the apocalypse on June 27, 2020.

229
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:26,652
Almost three months have passed
since the catastrophe.

230
00:28:26,736 --> 00:28:27,879
It is still unclear

231
00:28:27,903 --> 00:28:30,819
exactly what triggered
the events in Winden that day.

232
00:28:31,194 --> 00:28:34,587
But the God particle,
if we can stabilize it,

233
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:36,610
maybe it'll give us a way back,

234
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:39,235
to return to the past.

235
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:42,569
We could save them...

236
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:45,069
all.

237
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:33,777
I'll take a look around upstairs.

238
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:28,944
Looking for food.

239
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:32,027
Are you?

240
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:54,735
MOM AND SISTER

241
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:00,319
Where do you sleep?

242
00:31:13,903 --> 00:31:16,277
CAVE

243
00:31:18,653 --> 00:31:20,069
What's going on?

244
00:31:27,569 --> 00:31:29,069
Why are you here?

245
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:32,027
Are you following us?

246
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:37,819
I told you before,
we want nothing to do with you.

247
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:43,319
You want to protect her, I get it.

248
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:47,652
So do I.

249
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,777
And I will.

250
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:55,319
After you get killed.

251
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:15,819
MACHINE FACTORY TANNHAUS

252
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:41,235
I'm sorry.

253
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:44,402
About Jonas.

254
00:32:46,153 --> 00:32:47,610
Since we got here...

255
00:32:49,444 --> 00:32:50,610
he's...

256
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:55,360
He's changed.

257
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:01,860
How did you get here?

258
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:05,235
We traveled.

259
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,485
At the exact moment
when everything was destroyed.

260
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,444
He didn't want to come here.

261
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:18,027
This is just what happened.

262
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,485
The device is empty.

263
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:28,569
Here, in 1888, nuclear material
is somewhat hard to come by.

264
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:37,402
And this here?

265
00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:40,902
What is this? The workshop.

266
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,027
The blind guy.

267
00:33:43,778 --> 00:33:45,235
Does he know who you are?

268
00:33:46,153 --> 00:33:47,444
Where you come from?

269
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:01,194
Come with me.

270
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:04,444
I need to show you this.

271
00:34:12,611 --> 00:34:14,319
The young woman.

272
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:17,860
Is she one of you?

273
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:21,194
A traveler?

274
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:29,027
When I found you, now, that was a sign.

275
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,444
A god-sent miracle.

276
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:35,837
Whatever this woman means to you,

277
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:38,319
don't forget what we are going to create.

278
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:40,402
Paradise!

279
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:45,652
Every calamity can be reversed.

280
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:50,152
Every pain,
destroyed before it even exists.

281
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:53,902
A perfect world.

282
00:35:01,444 --> 00:35:03,444
<i>Sic mundus</i>

283
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:05,860
<i>creatus est.</i>

284
00:35:52,278 --> 00:35:53,694
Excuse me.

285
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,819
Can I help you?

286
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:07,194
Can I help you?

287
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:15,777
I... uh...

288
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:19,152
I'd like to visit someone.

289
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,694
He's lived here for 34 years.

290
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:24,985
The inspector?

291
00:36:27,403 --> 00:36:28,985
Do I know you?

292
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:32,110
You look familiar somehow.

293
00:36:38,194 --> 00:36:39,610
Are you related to him?

294
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:47,110
He's my husband.

295
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:50,444
I see.

296
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,194
So you're one of them.

297
00:36:55,028 --> 00:36:57,504
Those women
who go for lunatics or prisoners

298
00:36:57,528 --> 00:36:59,735
because they can't find anyone else.

299
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,777
I'm off duty. Come back tomorrow.

300
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:05,527
That's Saint Christopher.

301
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:09,610
Patron saint of travelers.

302
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:17,694
He renounced the devil
and carried the creator of the world.

303
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,235
My mother also had one.

304
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:26,235
I've traveled a very long way.

305
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:29,360
Let me see him.

306
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:31,360
Please.

307
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:44,485
He was just released
from solitary.

308
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:47,569
My colleague will let you out.

309
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:35,652
Ulrich.

310
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:46,194
Katharina.

311
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,485
I'll get you out of here.

312
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:20,194
I swear.

313
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:01,444
Excuse me.

314
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,985
Excuse me, what are you doing here?

315
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,277
What do you want?

316
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:18,402
I...

317
00:40:18,694 --> 00:40:20,194
I'll call security.

318
00:40:21,778 --> 00:40:22,944
No.

319
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:24,735
You won't.

320
00:40:34,153 --> 00:40:35,485
Jasmin.

321
00:40:36,278 --> 00:40:37,444
Right?

322
00:40:41,236 --> 00:40:42,527
Hell is empty.

323
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,360
And all devils are here.

324
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:54,735
Shh.

325
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:38,610
At some point you have to decide.

326
00:41:39,444 --> 00:41:40,652
For us.

327
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,152
Or against us.

328
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:50,235
I...

329
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:54,235
saw Regina today.

330
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,485
She's all grown up.

331
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:09,944
I've wondered all these years...

332
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,694
if she could...

333
00:42:16,736 --> 00:42:18,860
Claudia never said who the father is.

334
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:28,944
You're right.

335
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:31,944
I have to decide.

336
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:14,985
Mom?

337
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:36,194
Tronte?

338
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:40,819
Regina.

339
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:46,194
What brings you here?

340
00:43:47,653 --> 00:43:49,004
I'm so sorry.

341
00:43:49,028 --> 00:43:51,379
But it has to happen.

342
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:53,194
I don't understand.

343
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:07,819
She said...

344
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,485
it's the only way to save you.

345
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:41,235
MOM AND SISTER CAVE

346
00:44:42,153 --> 00:44:43,485
LENTIL SOUP

347
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:50,485
What did he say to you?

348
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:53,212
What do you mean?

349
00:44:53,236 --> 00:44:54,985
The boy.

350
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,860
Forget it.

351
00:45:02,278 --> 00:45:05,027
I'm not a little kid anymore.

352
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:21,754
Why do you carry that around
everywhere you go?

353
00:45:21,778 --> 00:45:23,504
What's in there?

354
00:45:23,528 --> 00:45:26,402
Where are Mom and Franziska?

355
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,485
We'll find them.

356
00:47:32,694 --> 00:47:36,360
Everything will be okay.

00:48:06,986 --> 00:48:10,962

I said, clear the table.

361
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,402

What is this?

391
00:51:57,736 --> 00:51:59,444
It's like a secret society.

392
00:52:01,278 --> 00:52:04,069
Old Tannhaus is the only one of them left.

393
00:52:06,903 --> 00:52:08,837
His father was convinced

394
00:52:08,861 --> 00:52:11,235
he could supersede
the rules of time and space.

395
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:15,027
He dedicated his life to doing just that.

396
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:18,444
And so did his son.

397
00:52:21,653 --> 00:52:24,027
They tried to build
a time machine back then?

398
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:31,694
Jonas is trying to rebuild things
the way he saw them.

399
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,819
He's been here already.

400
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:36,819
Not now.

401
00:52:38,153 --> 00:52:39,319
In the future.

402
00:52:47,403 --> 00:52:49,194
He asked you something earlier.

403
00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:52,527
If Adam had sent you.

404
00:52:54,653 --> 00:52:55,985
He said...

405
00:52:56,986 --> 00:52:59,110
that Adam killed Martha.

406
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:02,569
Who is this Adam?

407
00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:06,694
He didn't tell you that?

408
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:13,277
He is Adam.

409
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:16,610
Jonas.

410
00:53:28,403 --> 00:53:29,944
We don't know our end.

411
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:35,319
But our end

412
00:53:36,653 --> 00:53:37,985
knows us.

413
00:53:39,278 --> 00:53:40,444
Salvation...

414
00:53:42,028 --> 00:53:43,819
or there is damnation.

415
00:53:46,278 --> 00:53:50,777
We can indulge
in the illusion of free will if we want.

416
00:53:52,153 --> 00:53:56,902
But we cannot escape our ultimate destiny.

417
00:54:10,611 --> 00:54:13,694
The choices we make
in each world may be different,

418
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:17,735
but still

419
00:54:18,486 --> 00:54:21,069
they converge on the same moment.

420
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:27,735
Things may not happen in the same way,

421
00:54:28,278 --> 00:54:29,985
or at the same time.

422
00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:32,402
But they always happen.

423
00:54:34,778 --> 00:54:38,110
You believed a world without you
would be a better one.

424
00:54:42,736 --> 00:54:44,694
But they're all going to die.

425
00:54:46,736 --> 00:54:47,902
Mikkel.

426
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:51,110
Mikkel will die.

427
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:54,027
Everyone will die.

428
00:54:56,278 --> 00:55:01,652
The apocalypse occurs
in my world just as it does in yours.

429
00:55:02,903 --> 00:55:05,485
In mine,
it will happen in three days' time.
