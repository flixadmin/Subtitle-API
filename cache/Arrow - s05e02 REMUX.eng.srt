1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,546
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,964
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:08,926
I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.

4
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:11,262
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,389
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.

6
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,683
But by night, I'm someone else.

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,935
I am something else.

8
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,271
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,981
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:23,292
What are you doing in Russia?

11
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:24,942
I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,362
Only people who have power
to get past his army are Bratva.

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,822
We lost one. It's in the air.

14
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,269
You need to divert that missile.

15
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:33,826
That's it.

16
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,624
Tobias Church, he and his crew
tore up Hub City and Bludhaven.

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,209
Anybody else want to be in charge?

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,919
Church just became our top priority.

19
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,880
Felicity thinks that it's time
we put together a new team.

20
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,716
Evelyn Sharp. Basically,
a 16-year-old badass in the making.

21
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,052
Until her parents
met Damien Darhk I'm guessing.

22
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:54,680
You recruit me too.

23
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:55,847
You wanna help?

24
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,183
It's my city too.

25
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,352
I don't want to
see you out here again.

26
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:42,812
You again?

27
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,480
How's the leg?

28
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,984
You call yourself a vigilante?

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,486
You just let the Halcones' top seller
get away.

30
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,285
Now I thought I said that I didn't
want to see you out here again.

31
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,662
You don't listen very well.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,871
You sound like my ex.

33
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,625
Rene Ramirez, you need to decide

34
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,712
if you want to be a man in a hockey mask

35
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,673
or if you want to be someone else.

36
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,301
Something else.

37
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,738
Conahan was struck
with an arrow and a sword.

38
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,364
Literally overkill.

39
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,908
Definitely not Church's M.O.

40
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,119
Totally different than
the Bertinelli murder too.

41
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,204
Ballistics show
that he was shot by his own men.

42
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,539
Well, that had to be Church.

43
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,546
In Hub City,
he killed every crime boss in town

44
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,711
so he could unite everyone
under one super-gang under his control.

45
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,212
How does he do this?

46
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,840
It's all in the core.

47
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,095
So, Curtis,

48
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,598
I'm guessing this wasn't
part of your Olympic training?

49
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,772
Impossible.

50
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,941
It's really hot. I mean, not. It's not.

51
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,321
Curtis, if you think this is hard

52
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:16,923
wait until I actually start training you.

53
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:17,948
What happens then?

54
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,218
The last guy got an arrow
in the leg before it even started.

55
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,243
That was Roy, right?

56
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,050
Also Roy, but I'm talking about Wild Dog.

57
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,289
And you did put two arrows
in Barry Allen's back.

58
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,736
I'm starting to sense a pattern.

59
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,185
Don't worry.
His bark's way worse than his bite.

60
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,436
And you're gonna get it worse than anyone.

61
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,503
Uh... Thanks?

62
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,523
The people that we're looking at have
at least some experience on the street.

63
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,467
You have the farthest way to go before
I'm convinced that you can do this.

64
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:37,593
I can do it, sir.

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,470
- Don't call me sir.
- Okay, Oliver.

66
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,448
Don't call me Oliver especially
in front of the recruits.

67
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,033
We don't know these people
and they can't know us.

68
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,618
Whoa, whoa! Hold up.
You're going to be wearing a mask

69
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,786
when you training our recruits?

70
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,144
Yeah. And so are you.

71
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,511
I only wear a mask once a year

72
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,915
and that's if my Halloween costume
calls for it.

73
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,150
This is not negotiable, Felicity.
I'm late for a budget meeting.

74
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,488
Yeah.

75
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,949
And I'm sure that kicking things off

76
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:04,620
by lying to everyone is an awesome idea.

77
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,999
Well, the original team started off
with Oliver lying about his identity.

78
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,671
And everyone who's not dead or
presumed dead, quit.

79
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:15,631
Yeah.

80
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,637
Now this trigger was taken from one of the
nukes that fell on Genesis Day.

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,976
Our intel tells us that a group of
Chechen rebels is close to obtaining it.

82
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,438
I don't have to tell you what
kind of a nightmare scenario will ensue

83
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,481
if that happens.

84
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,484
Now the mission
is standard retrieval and extraction.

85
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:39,697
Sergeant Diggle here, will be running
the op, wheels up at 0400.

86
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:44,160
All right, gentlemen, get some rest.
You're gonna need it. Dismissed!

87
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,838
You good, soldier?

88
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,800
I got through basic training, no sweat.

89
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,220
But this is my first day in the soup

90
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,765
and I don't want to be scared,
but I am a little.

91
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,312
Fear is part of war.
The part that keeps us alive.

92
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,440
See these stripes?

93
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,901
They give me strength, clarity.

94
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,987
Right or wrong, up and down,

95
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,114
they tell me what to do.

96
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,719
Which means that fear can kiss my six.
You understand, soldier?

97
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,078
- Yes, Sir.
- Good. Dismissed.

98
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,546
It used to be that the Glades
were the worst part of the city,

99
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,090
but now it seems like
every other part is just as bad.

100
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,844
We've had three hospital closures
in the past eighteen months.

101
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,697
But with a Free Medical Clinic
event like this

102
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,640
we can start to walk back
some of that damage.

103
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:52,102
In a day, we can provide
medical care for up to a thousand people.

104
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,773
Plus, we already have about 30 doctors
and nurses just waiting to volunteer.

105
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,418
We're looking for a company
to cover logistical expenses and...

106
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,194
I don't need to hear any more.

107
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,403
AmerTek is in.

108
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,615
And not just for logistical expenses,
for the whole thing.

109
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,908
Well, that's amazing.

110
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,719
That's, that's incredibly generous,
thank you.

111
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,343
Please, you would be doing us the favor.

112
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,205
And by "us" she means our stock price.

113
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,141
Good PR is worth, literally,
its weight in gold.

114
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,205
Uh, well, we will make sure
this clinic is a success

115
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,962
and that everyone knows
they have AmerTek to thank for it.

116
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,129
Wow.

117
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,049
Thought I'd almost feel bad
about boosting their stock prices

118
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,594
if it wasn't so good
for your approval ratings.

119
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,556
But actually you should really handle
the press on this one.

120
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,558
Maybe you can?

121
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,295
Oh, God, Ollie, I really thought
that we talked about this.

122
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,813
I can't keep doing everything on my own!

123
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,984
I have faith that you can, but
either way now is not a very good time.

124
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,277
And why is that?

125
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,487
- I'm recruiting a new team.
- Oh.

126
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:45,990
You okay with that?

127
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,993
Yeah, why wouldn't I be? I quit.

128
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,538
I know, but there's a difference
between leaving and being replaced.

129
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,831
Oh.

130
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,250
It's really cute you think
I can be replaced.

131
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,418
That's not what I meant.

132
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,296
I know. But I actually think
it'll be really good for you

133
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,381
to not be out there solo anymore.

134
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,135
Plus, it would mean you would have
more time to actually be here.

135
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:10,139
That's the idea. But it's going to take
a minute to get these kids up to speed.

136
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,100
Wait, maybe I should hire my own team
for the office then.

137
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,061
That's also a good idea.
Start looking at résumés.

138
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,234
Hey, Quentin.

139
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,153
Have you actually heard about

140
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,739
this free medical event
Ollie and I are putting together?

141
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,243
- Rene Ramirez?
- Yeah.

142
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,288
Figures there'd be more of you.

143
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,707
Robin Hood needs his band of Merry Men,
right?

144
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,709
Well, I am just here for moral support.

145
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,794
She means she's here to make sure

146
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,189
that the Green Arrow's training technique
doesn't kill us.

147
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,506
He's not going to kill you.

148
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,385
I'm just here to make sure that the
horrible maiming stays a minimum.

149
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,970
I'm Curtis.

150
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:51,764
Evelyn Sharp.

151
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,726
So wait, there's training? I'm out.

152
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,395
Pretty early to quit, Mr. Ramirez.

153
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,956
I can't quit something I haven't started.

154
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,500
You think you can do this on your own?

155
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,692
I've been doing this on my own
for five months now.

156
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,739
And if you were getting it done
on your own, you wouldn't have come here.

157
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm out of here.

158
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,078
- No mask?
- No chance.

159
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:19,917
On the line.

160
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,836
Wait. I thought there was gonna be,

161
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,214
I dunno, like an orientation?

162
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,466
Is that what the brochure promised?

163
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,427
- That's hilarious. He's good...
- On the line!

164
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,599
This is simple.

165
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:36,975
Get past me

166
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,270
and ring that bell.

167
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,980
So, we're playing games now?

168
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,442
Fine. I'll play.

169
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,913
On the line.

170
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,005
At least he's not shooting them.

171
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,465
On the line.

172
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,009
This is stupid.

173
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,137
Still think it's a game?

174
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,754
I came here to work with the guy
who killed Damien Darhk

175
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:16,807
not ring a friggin' bell.

176
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:20,227
This isn't a game.
And if you need further evidence of that

177
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:22,479
then you walk down to the pier

178
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,940
and you look at the statue
of Laurel Lance.

179
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,276
Now, get on the line!

180
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:20,412
I'd love to, but I can't tonight.
Too much to do for this medical event.

181
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,248
Yeah, it's great, Janet agreed to it.

182
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,375
All right, see you Saturday?

183
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,595
Here you go, bud.

184
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:49,608
How's the victim?

185
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,902
Victim is Evan Wender. He's in the ICU.

186
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,738
Doctors think that
he was suffocated by something.

187
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,782
Is that lining up
with anything you've found?

188
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,909
You're assuming
I've actually found anything.

189
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,345
What's your interest in this, anyway?

190
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,971
AmerTek is helping us with a charity event

191
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,395
and all of a sudden one of their
Vice Presidents is attacked.

192
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,916
It cannot be a coincidence.

193
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,501
Not in this city.

194
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,171
- I have to go.
- Bye.

195
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,397
Thanks.

196
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,899
We're very sorry
about what happened to Mr. Wender.

197
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,186
But I would like you to know that I've
assigned the Anti-Crime Unit to his case

198
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,281
and I've asked them to make catching
whoever did this their top priority.

199
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,283
Well, I appreciate that.

200
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,493
But in the wake of this recent development

201
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,080
my board of directors, to say nothing
of AmerTek's army of attorneys

202
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,249
have advised us to
pull out of tomorrow's event.

203
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,256
They're concerned that
the attack on Mr. Wender

204
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,312
could be the start of a larger
pattern of violence.

205
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,696
And if something were to happen during the
Clinic, then AmerTek would be held liable.

206
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,387
What if Star City
agrees to indemnify AmerTek?

207
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:01,834
Ollie, that could cost millions.

208
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,433
And I will triple
the police presence at the event.

209
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,378
There will be plenty of security?

210
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,895
I will see to it personally.

211
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,272
Well.

212
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,942
I'm going to hold you to that, Mr. Mayor.

213
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,069
Thank you.

214
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,660
So is the plan,
to see to it personally with a new team?

215
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,162
No. They're nowhere near ready.

216
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,538
Then what's the back-up plan?

217
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,708
Me. It's one of the advantages

218
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,044
of having the mayor
moonlighting as a vigilante.

219
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,838
Or the vigilante moonlighting as mayor.

220
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,843
No hostiles, sir. We're a go.

221
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,155
Excellent. Intel was good.
Hostiles are on a shift change.

222
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,532
Bravo Team, you're upstairs,
northwest corridor, second floor.

223
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,058
Alpha Team with me, look sharp.

224
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,359
Alpha Team is here.
Bravo Team, where are you, what's your...

225
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,330
Come on! Move! Move! Move!

226
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,291
How the hell did they know we were here?

227
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,926
On the line.

228
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,846
Here to learn something, man.
Not just get beat up.

229
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,849
I told you, I'm teaching you.

230
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,560
Teaching us what exactly?

231
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,897
Because I actually find myself
agreeing with the scary, weird guy.

232
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,609
The goal of this exercise

233
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,737
is to figure out
the goal of this exercise.

234
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,823
Now, get on the line.

235
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,535
Actually, Green Arrow?
Can I talk to you for a second?

236
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,079
Now?

237
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,119
You know, I thought maybe we could hold
off on the criticism for a little bit.

238
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,587
Oh, yeah, no problem 'cause there's a lot.
Look.

239
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,234
I thought there wasn't any usable footage
from traffic cameras.

240
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:04,094
Yeah, but who needs traffic cams when you
got KH-ten spy satellites?

241
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,097
Could be a meta.
Or magic of some sort.

242
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,892
Exactly. So Thea may or may not have told
me about your brilliant plan

243
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,270
to protect the Free Clinic
all by yourself.

244
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,648
I won't be all by myself.
I'll have the SCPD and the ACU.

245
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,775
No way!
This is out of both of their leagues.

246
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,111
What?

247
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,782
It's out of their league too.
They're too green.

248
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,659
Some could say the same about you.

249
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,455
I've been waiting five years
to make that joke.

250
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,959
The convention center
has twenty entrances.

251
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,252
You can't be on them all.

252
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,659
Throw them around the perimeter for three
extra pairs of eyes. What could it hurt?

253
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,472
Okay, heads on swivels.
But do not engage under any circumstances.

254
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,601
- Copy that.
- Yes, sir. I mean, I mean, Green Arrow.

255
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,977
Wild Dog, do you copy that?

256
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,064
- We gotta talk about this code name.
- Not now. Stay focused.

257
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,910
You know, it'd help to know where you are.

258
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,106
No, it wouldn't because
you are not going to engage.

259
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,944
Come on, where's the fun in that?

260
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,672
Man,
it would take one major asshat

261
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,490
to make a move against all these people.

262
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,284
Something I learned recently
is this city is filled with them.

263
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,829
It starts at the top, you know?

264
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,374
Pretty Boy Queen here thinks
he's actually saving the city.

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,044
Thank you, Officer. Hey.

266
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,089
How are you? Hello.

267
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,801
- Hi.
- Hi.

268
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,302
What have we here?

269
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh. Her broken bone never set.

270
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,181
Oh. You'll be fine.
I have some experience with that.

271
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,519
Evelyn, check the northwest corridor.

272
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,686
I don't get a code name?

273
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,189
We really thank you for sticking with us.

274
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,526
Oh. Well, I'm glad
that Oliver changed my mind.

275
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,279
It's nice to feel that this company
can still do some good.

276
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,740
Um, sorry I'm late.

277
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,035
If you'll excuse me.
The event is almost over.

278
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,871
Yeah, I know.
It's been that kind of traffic, you know?

279
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,225
Yeah, but you were supposed to watch
the Tenth Street entrance.

280
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,876
But I just said, this traffic,
it's terrible!

281
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,586
Are you okay?

282
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,131
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, you know?

283
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,216
Sorry, it won't happen again.

284
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,552
Yeah, but...

285
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,389
You haven't been drinking again, have you?

286
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,859
Janet Carroll.
You have been judged and found wanting.

287
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,321
He's here.

288
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,576
Son of a bitch!

289
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,375
Overwatch?

290
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:44,045
I don't see him on any of the security
cameras. It's like he just disappeared.

291
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,398
I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see him

292
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,215
do all that other stuff
that I don't believe.

293
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,763
I'm almost afraid to ask... Actually,

294
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,808
I am afraid to ask.
You know, maybe I'm just afraid.

295
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,059
Is he coming?

296
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,686
He's on his way.

297
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,314
Did he sound unhappy?

298
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,692
Why did you do that anyway?

299
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,653
He specifically told us not to engage.

300
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,031
First, he's not the boss of me
and never will be.

301
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:14,385
Second, if he thinks I'm just gonna stand
back and watch some little girl get hurt

302
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,387
then he never should've
recruited me in the first place.

303
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,347
I think that's quickly becoming
the majority opinion.

304
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,541
Third, if I hadn't done what I did,
I wouldn't have gotten this.

305
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,043
Wait. Is that a piece of...

306
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,502
Yeah. Ragman.

307
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,004
Now, I may be new at this and all

308
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,931
but isn't that
what you guys call "evidence"?

309
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,132
On the line!

310
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,651
Listen, before you say anything,
I think you...

311
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,469
My instructions were specific.

312
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,472
By not listening,
you put every one of our lives at risk.

313
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,806
You need to calm down.

314
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,284
Now, I know
that none of you are ready for this.

315
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,161
But now I'm not sure
if you're ever going to be.

316
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:43,855
Because you are reckless. You're useless
if you're not behind a computer

317
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,649
and you are just a little girl

318
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,068
who should be doing something better
with her life.

319
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:51,571
Okay, that's enough pep talk for one day.
Can I talk to you for a second?

320
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,639
Did you learn nothing from what happened
with Curtis last year?

321
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,580
You know I don't have a bedside manner...

322
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,974
There's having no bedside manner

323
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,143
and then there is being
physically and emotionally abusive.

324
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,379
It took me five years in hell to turn into
someone capable of going out there.

325
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,715
You know who didn't have five years?
Laurel Lance.

326
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,052
And now she's dead.

327
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,156
Well, were those five years just full of
pain and suffering

328
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,932
or did you have someone who taught you?

329
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:23,353
I had a few people who taught me
and I'm trying to teach them.

330
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,855
What? To take a punch? An insult?

331
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,942
You keep expecting them to do
what you're telling them to do.

332
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,503
And then you're not giving them
any reason.

333
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,367
You just keep jabbing them with
a cattle-prod expecting them to perform.

334
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,783
And the guy that you called reckless
got us our only clue we have so far.

335
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,162
We need to do a full work-up on that.

336
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,331
Yeah, well, I can't, I mean, not here.

337
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,209
The Ghosts
destroyed our Gas chromatograph.

338
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,546
But, uh, I have other methods.

339
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,466
Good. I have to get to City Hall.

340
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,135
What about them?

341
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,264
The city just experienced the equivalent
of a terrorist attack.

342
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,392
Those three can wait.

343
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,538
You should get to the medic tent
when we get back,

344
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,202
but this should hold you for a few hours.

345
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,190
A few hours, why? We're not bugging out?

346
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,003
Our orders are to get that trigger,
that's exactly what we're going to do.

347
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,170
All the men are on the second floor,

348
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,547
we have no idea how
many guys are up there.

349
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,251
Do you remember
what I told you about fear?

350
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,866
- Gets you through.
- That's right.

351
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,452
And so does the chain of command.

352
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,414
We don't have to think about do or don't,
right or wrong.

353
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,624
There's a clarity in that, right?

354
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,626
A peace.

355
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,087
Do you understand?

356
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,257
Fall out.

357
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,470
Secure the south hallways.
I'll take the north.

358
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,167
Contacts will be here any minute.

359
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,267
So let's keep our heads
on swivels, ladies.

360
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,407
Thought you guys were either dead or gone.

361
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,899
Collins took a through-and-through.
He'll fine but...

362
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,293
What the hell is going on here?

363
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,985
Really sorry about this, Sergeant.

364
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,227
You're not here to secure the trigger.
You're stealing it.

365
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,242
Can't steal anything if nobody owns it.

366
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,872
Now, you be careful now, Sergeant.
You just might live through this.

367
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,461
Not that I would normally condone
drinking this much caffeine

368
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,422
but since you are so busy
trying to save the entire city and all...

369
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,909
Add it to the list of vices
I've been meaning to swear off.

370
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,802
Oh! Do I even want to know?

371
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,221
Just as much as I want to know
why you're really here.

372
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,108
You already bought me an Americano
this morning before I got to work.

373
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,143
Ah! And that's why you are the detective.

374
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,064
It's been a while since I dated anyone.
Is this a thing now?

375
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,359
No, this is not a thing. This is

376
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,947
a very long, funny story.

377
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:42,075
Do you want to tell me this story?

378
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,494
Yeah, it's why I'm here. Um...

379
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:49,332
This belonged to my friend's maid.
Cleaning lady.

380
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,292
Your friend's cleaning lady?

381
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,629
She's gone missing.
And he's very worried about her.

382
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,218
You want me to make a report to
Missing Persons?

383
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,692
No, no, no! I was thinking that...

384
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,956
Well, she left this rag behind.

385
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:03,763
So I was thinking there might be some
evidence left behind on it that, um,

386
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,492
could help my friend locate
her cleaning lady.

387
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,518
I thought your friend was a guy.

388
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:10,687
Are you jealous?

389
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,315
Only insofar as I haven't actually met
any of your friends yet.

390
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,525
Mmm.

391
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,111
And yes, that's a hint
officially being dropped.

392
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,447
Hint noted.

393
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,823
Okay.

394
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,452
So just a quick forensic work-up?

395
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,978
Like, maybe just a quick pass
through the gas chromatograph?

396
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,250
Fine. It's your tax dollars.

397
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,711
You are the best.

398
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,091
Thea, may I speak with...

399
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,468
- Hi.
- Hi.

400
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,138
- Oh, I was just leaving.
- Is everything okay?

401
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,988
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

402
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,076
I was just talking to Thea
about maybe coming aboard,

403
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,728
- helping out with some stuff and...
- Yeah.

404
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,231
Yeah, anyway.
So anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

405
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,774
- Okay.
- Okay.

406
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,651
Uh, thanks.

407
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,530
- What was that about?
- It's nothing.

408
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:05,241
Look, we have way bigger problems
on our plate right now.

409
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,911
Because of you we are on the hook
with AmerTek

410
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,537
and the CEO is in the hospital.

411
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:12,248
Actually, she was just released,
she's fine.

412
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,215
Okay, but she's gonna hit the city
with a multi-million dollar lawsuit.

413
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,879
Well, can you speak to her?
My hands are kind of full right now.

414
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,756
Okay. What else is new?

415
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,341
What is going on with Quentin?

416
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,219
I am 90% sure
he's drinking again.

417
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,428
And I'm 100% sure.

418
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,598
He told me when I saw him last week.

419
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,434
Ollie, I put him to work security
at the event...

420
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,521
The dude in rags came in through the door

421
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,439
he was supposed to be working.

422
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,233
Thea, I'm sorry.

423
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,443
I had no idea
that you were gonna reach out to him.

424
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,922
But why is he talking
like he's going to be working with us?

425
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,697
"I'll see you tomorrow"? What, is that?

426
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:47,450
He's hurting, Ollie.

427
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,844
But I don't think that putting him

428
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,120
in a position of responsibility
is the best idea for him,

429
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,374
or for us right now. Okay?

430
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,417
I'll talk to him.

431
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,381
I have to go. Thank you.

432
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,136
What's going on? Where are the others?

433
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,680
Somewhere not here.

434
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,139
They quit.

435
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,725
This really shouldn't come
as any sort of surprise to you.

436
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,353
It's not surprising.
We chose the wrong people.

437
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,313
- Including me, right?
- Curtis,

438
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,109
do you know what the purpose
of this exercise is?

439
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,486
To figure out the purpose
of this exercise?

440
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:24,988
No. It's to work together

441
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,794
because that's the only way that you win.

442
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,783
That is what I've been trying
to teach all of you.

443
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,827
Well, maybe there's a reason
why you couldn't.

444
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,455
- We don't trust you.
- That's on you.

445
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,332
No, man, that's on you.

446
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,336
Because you don't trust us.
Because you don't want us.

447
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,298
Okay, this is a setback.
But we can salvage this. Like...

448
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,549
They'll listen to you.

449
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:47,111
Can you just tell them how Oliver usually
approaches things and...

450
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,428
I tried that.

451
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:53,224
I told them all about how you
and Speedy and Spartan were a family.

452
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:57,979
And even though you were tough
and scary and even a little abusive,

453
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,024
they clearly trusted you
because they stood by you.

454
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,360
But then it hit me.

455
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,613
No, they didn't.

456
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,114
They left.

457
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,407
And now I know why.

458
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,035
You don't respect people.

459
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,641
You don't know how to have partners.

460
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,581
You don't build people up.
You tear them down.

461
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,834
I thought I could trust you,

462
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:21,919
we could trust you,

463
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,547
but I was wrong.

464
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,760
And that's why I'm out too.

465
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,480
Figured I'd find you here.

466
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:41,773
You were right.

467
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:45,777
Oh. As much as I usually love
hearing those three little words,

468
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,863
gloating right now
would be like kicking a puppy.

469
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,284
I failed these recruits as a leader.

470
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,078
Well, that's 'cause you're not a leader.

471
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,336
Well, in your defense,
you never set out to be.

472
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,917
You never planned
on doing this with partners.

473
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,587
Though, I don't think
you really ever had a way

474
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,798
- around that one.
- How so?

475
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:12,011
When I got to know you, the real you...

476
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,017
I was in awe.

477
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,480
I had never met somebody so passionate,

478
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,111
so focused and determined
to make a real difference.

479
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,863
But the recruits

480
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,658
didn't get to see the real you

481
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:37,495
because all you showed them
was this angry guy in a mask.

482
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:38,955
Like scary angry.

483
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:42,667
I just thought that if they didn't know
who I was it would make things easier.

484
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,544
How would that make things
easier for them?

485
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,629
For me. Easier for me.

486
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,175
- When I was in the Bratva...
- Mmm.

487
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,761
You never talk about your time in Russia.

488
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,351
Nobody in the Bratva
uses their real names.

489
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,398
Nobody knows anything about anyone's life

490
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,275
before they were Bratva.

491
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,903
- Sounds lonely.
- It's effective.

492
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,701
They teach you that the only person
you can trust is yourself.

493
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,536
That without personal attachment,

494
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,331
there can be no loss.

495
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,254
Laurel,

496
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,424
Thea, Digg, even Roy.

497
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,636
I let them into my crusade,
I let them in...

498
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:36,846
And they left.

499
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,308
I was protecting myself.

500
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,578
I just think you're missing something.

501
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,188
Only one thing?

502
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,027
The reason the original team
worked so well,

503
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,699
was because of the trust and respect

504
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,951
that everyone had for Oliver Queen,

505
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,370
not the Green Arrow.

506
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,375
Oliver is the one who makes a good leader.

507
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,461
He's the one that runs a good team.

508
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,463
He's the one that I chose to stand by

509
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,757
and that I continue to choose to stand by.

510
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,724
I got to take this.

511
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:43,871
Hey, hey. If we can move them
to the left, we may have a chance.

512
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:47,291
We need to divert their attention

513
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,794
and then one of us sneaks past
and we ring the bell.

514
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,128
Congratulations, Oliver.

515
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,342
Well, it looks
like we have our work cut for us

516
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,553
getting AmerTek back in our good graces.

517
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,400
Couldn't even get past the reception desk.

518
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,142
So we need
to get this handled with... But...

519
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,980
Just call me back whenever you get this.

520
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,156
I'm sorry I'm late.
It couldn't be helped.

521
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,491
Help it next time.
I don't like waiting.

522
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,285
Are we all set for tonight?

523
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:05,995
We are if you have the money.

524
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,539
$100 million.

525
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,834
For everything I need
to take over this city.

526
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,295
Mr. Church, I'm selling you

527
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,547
enough ordinance to take over a country.

528
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,512
Argh. Sons of bitches are late.

529
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,349
Go topside. See if you can get a visual.

530
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,993
Don't you just hate it when your plan

531
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,895
to steal illegal nuclear technology
hits a snag?

532
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,397
So that ambush, that was you.

533
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:38,194
You had your own men,
soldiers, brothers walk into a trap.

534
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:40,738
And I'll carry
that with me till the day I die.

535
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:45,076
But till that day comes,
I'm going to be a very, very wealthy man.

536
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,995
- You swore an oath, man!
- Then Genesis Day happened!

537
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:52,208
ISIS. Taliban. Al-Qaeda.
I could take 'em all on!

538
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,169
But what hope does the world have
against men with magic?

539
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,922
All those meta-humans in Central City?

540
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,884
How long before one of them,
manages to tear the world apart?

541
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,431
Sarge, what's going on?

542
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:10,559
It's all right. No! No!

543
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,437
You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

544
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,941
You know, I've been puzzling out

545
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,777
why none of my contacts have showed up,

546
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:22,705
fretting that maybe this whole thing
had gotten a little bit sideways,

547
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,073
wondering what to do about it.

548
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:28,744
And you showed up to solve my problem.

549
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,580
Thanks.

550
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,500
So, are you sure that it was them?

551
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,961
Yeah, that son of a bitch
leaves a pretty good impression.

552
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,213
Well, if AmerTek is in bed
with Church, then...

553
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,841
Then maybe that guy in rags isn't so bad.

554
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,759
He's probably trying to take down AmerTek.

555
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:47,179
So, why is the CEO of a
Fortune 500 company like AmerTek

556
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,890
willing to deal weapons to a crime lord?

557
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,769
Because they are trying
to avoid bankruptcy.

558
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,939
Got the forensics work-up back
on that piece of cloth from Ragman.

559
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,418
Please tell me that's
not what we're actually gonna call him.

560
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:00,443
What'd you find?

561
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,778
That it is over 2000 years old.

562
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:05,865
- And radioactive.
- Which means trackable.

563
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:08,760
If this weapons buy is going down,
this guy's going to try to stop it.

564
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,995
Leading us right
to Janet Carroll and Mr. Church.

565
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,642
Wait. What did you mean when you said

566
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:14,040
that AmerTek is going bankrupt?

567
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,460
The isotope that made the cloth
radioactive is very specific.

568
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,813
It came from one of the nukes
that Darhk launched on Genesis Day.

569
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,380
Specifically, a nuke manufactured

570
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,387
by a company
called "Atomic Defensive Systems."

571
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,426
They're likely a subsidiary of AmerTek.

572
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,595
Aw! People say he's just a pretty face.

573
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:28,763
Hmm!

574
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,016
Bottom line is the
subsidiary's connection with Genesis Day

575
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,894
has made AmerTek's stock prices go...

576
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,230
Which explains why they were so eager
to have a big public relations bonanza.

577
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:42,276
And why they'd be willing to unload
their excess ordinance on Tobias Church.

578
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,445
We need to find our friend in the rags

579
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,292
and hope he leads us to that weapons sale.

580
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,742
Wait! They did just say
that there was enough weaponry

581
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,410
to take down an entire country.

582
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,257
So I would think this would be a good time

583
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,705
for you to test out your new team.

584
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:57,208
There's no team anymore, Thea.

585
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,211
If I'm going in, I'm going alone.

586
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,517
This is the spot.

587
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,286
There's a crazy amount of hostiles inside.

588
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,353
I say crazy because

589
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,231
that is what you would have to be
to take them on all alone.

590
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,026
All right. You have your merchandise.

591
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,861
And now you want your money.

592
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,280
What kind of dent
can $100 million

593
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,532
make in your balance sheet?

594
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,911
- That's my worry.
- No, I think that's your golden parachute

595
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,704
and I admire that.

596
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,428
Hello, Janet.

597
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:57,768
Easy. This man's about to
save us $100 million.

598
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:03,983
They all died in fire. Your fire.
Your weapon. All for your money.

599
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,614
Where you at?

600
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,091
What are you talking about?

601
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:33,971
I'm talking about a KN-zero-eight.
Your pride and joy.

602
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:37,057
Over 15,000 missiles
launched on Genesis Day.

603
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,768
Only one found its mark. Yours.

604
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:43,272
No. No. We built those missiles
to keep people safe.

605
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,065
It was Damien, it was Damien Darhk.

606
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,110
Couldn't have done anything
if you hadn't given him the tools.

607
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,917
Your missile killed everyone in my home.

608
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,503
I am the very last living soul
of Havenrock.

609
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,632
And I carry with me a message

610
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,551
from all those souls you killed.

611
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,355
Ragman!

612
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,820
Thank you.

613
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,657
Thank me
by not standing in my way.

614
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,824
Let her go.

615
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,203
It's over.

616
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:47,169
Thank you for coming.

617
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:53,175
Your offer sounded intriguing.
Why'd you make it?

618
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,844
Why did you give up your vengeance
to save my life?

619
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,013
I don't know.

620
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,855
I think it's what my father
would have wanted me to do.

621
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,649
He saved my life.

622
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,234
On Genesis Day

623
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,447
he wrapped me in these rags.

624
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,076
He said they were ancient.

625
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,037
From the time of Devarim.

626
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:25,749
That they would protect me from the fire.

627
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,251
And they did.

628
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,838
So you see why I have to avenge him?

629
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:35,551
Your father didn't give up his life
so you could become a killer.

630
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:36,719
You don't know that.

631
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,722
My father gave up his life to save mine.

632
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:44,059
He made me promise to be better than him.

633
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,273
To save this city in a way
that he never could.

634
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,485
It's been nearly ten years since that day.

635
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,323
So far, I've failed.

636
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,283
Why are you telling me this?

637
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,952
Because I don't want to fail anymore.

638
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,621
I can't do it alone.

639
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,082
I need a team.

640
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:12,755
Let's honor the legacies of our fathers.

641
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,091
Together.

642
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:28,771
Why, Anatoly? Why kill them?

643
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,774
You rang bell. They did not.

644
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,611
I only rang the bell because of them.
I couldn't have done it alone.

645
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:38,489
But using team was your idea.

646
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,992
You used them to win, huh? Intelligent.

647
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:45,245
Bratva wants that, Bratva need that.

648
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,332
I never would have done it if I had known

649
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,250
it was gonna cost them their lives.

650
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,045
First part of initiation.

651
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:56,090
Only person you can trust, yourself.

652
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:04,139
You seemed
to have re-opened a wound, friend.

653
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,314
What the hell?

654
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,201
Still think you can write
with your cuffs on?

655
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,987
I mean, it wouldn't be much.
Just a signature.

656
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,112
You want to read your confession
before you sign it?

657
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:24,952
Screw you!

658
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,831
Now, Sergeant,
I am offering you an opportunity here.

659
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,167
I'm not owning up to this. You did this.

660
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:35,254
Yeah, but I used your gun
to shoot Private Collins.

661
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:39,091
Apparently, he walked in
on your attempted illegal appropriation

662
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,093
of a WMD for your own personal gain.

663
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,179
I got six men
out there who'll testify to that.

664
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,391
No one will ever believe your story.

665
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:48,684
I will.

666
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:50,227
Good luck with your court martial.

667
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,026
Oh, please, come in, sorry.

668
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:01,321
Sit down and I will be right with you.

669
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,871
Okay, thank you for coming.

670
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,957
Um, yeah, well, I almost didn't.

671
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,710
'Cause, you know, I...

672
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,421
I screwed up, didn't I? People got hurt.

673
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,257
Now it seems like you figured it out that

674
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,758
I'm drinking again and

675
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:24,386
I understand,
I don't wanna be any trouble.

676
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:27,681
I'm just sorry it didn't work out.

677
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,934
Okay, Quentin, that's...
It's not gonna work for me.

678
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,645
What?

679
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,689
You leaving
and hitting the bottle again, okay?

680
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,524
No! I think we can do better than that.

681
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,583
- I've been to meetings.
- Not a meeting.

682
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,070
A job.

683
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,866
How does Deputy Mayor sound?

684
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:51,205
You want to, hire a drunk
to be your deputy mayor, huh?

685
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,583
What, Oliver's approval ratings
are not low enough?

686
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,586
If we were hiring a drunk,
that would be a very good point.

687
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,214
But that is not what we are doing.

688
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,092
We are hiring the former captain
of the SCPD who...

689
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,763
Who just lost his daughter
and is honoring her memory

690
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,307
by dedicating himself
to the city that she loved.

691
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,603
All right, what do you think
about that one?

692
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,777
Why, I think
maybe the wrong Queen ran for mayor.

693
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:25,531
Look, Ollie, he told me you said,

694
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:30,452
that you needed a reason
to stay sober, so I...

695
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,455
I thought maybe this could be it.

696
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,713
Yeah, maybe it could.

697
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,633
You let Church almost kill you
so that you could recruit Ragman?

698
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,302
I was betting that his heroism
would trump his vengeance.

699
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,447
That's a big risk
to take on a stranger, don't you think?

700
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:52,266
Yeah. Well, I'm not done yet.

701
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,977
Hey.

702
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,062
- Yeah?
- Are you all right?

703
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,064
Yeah. Fine.

704
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,193
Thank you all for coming.

705
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,613
I only came 'cause blondie said
there'd be an apology.

706
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,284
Well, "blondie" made a good point.

707
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,541
You're not just joining up
with the Green Arrow.

708
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,012
You'd be joining up with me.

709
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:33,682
The Green Arrow is the Mayor?

710
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,601
I had the same cognitive dissonance.

711
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,245
I hope you don't think I'm gonna apologize

712
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,589
for the trash I talked about you.

713
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:41,007
No more than I'm going
to apologize for the tough training.

714
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,776
But I understand
that you all need to trust me.

715
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:48,530
This is as far as I know how to go.

716
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,866
You're sort of asking without asking

717
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,951
if we want to come back, right?

718
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,870
That's exactly what he's doing.

719
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:58,790
Okay, good. Then I'm in.

720
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,000
Me, too.

721
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,712
Wild Dog?

722
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,342
I'll fight any war long as I trust
who's leading me into battle.

723
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,970
But we have got to rethink this code name.

724
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,017
No chance.

725
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:28,612
Ah.

726
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,739
Can't stay away from me, can you?

727
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,914
You almost killed
the Green Arrow the other night.

728
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:42,042
If you had, you'd be dead right now.

729
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:44,044
Who the hell are...

730
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,089
The Green Arrow is mine.

731
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:50,175
You kill him, you die.

732
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,927
Who are you?

733
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,931
Prometheus.

734
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:28,588
English - SDH
