1
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:13,212
Gotta be ready before nightfall.

2
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:16,090
Now keep it moving.

3
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:24,642
Put a watch on the ridge
and the tree lines.

4
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:28,060
Boy.

5
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,651
Lovely boy.

6
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,950
What do you want?

7
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:34,613
A man has a thirst.

8
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:37,704
A man does not drink for a day and a night.

9
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:39,705
A boy could make a friend.

10
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,334
I have friends.

11
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,329
Give us beer before I skin you.

12
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:47,539
A man does not choose his companions.

13
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,590
These two, they have no courtesy.

14
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,716
A man must ask forgiveness.

15
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,640
You're called Arry?

16
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:01,844
This man has the honour to be Jaqen H'ghar,

17
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,647
once of the Free City of Lorath...

18
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,936
Beer, you little shit. Get us beer!

19
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:09,815
You should have asked nicely.

20
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:10,937
Aah!

21
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:16,240
Come closer...

22
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:18,946
and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole

23
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,866
and fuck you bloody.

24
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,414
That boy has more courage than sense.

25
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:24,533
Come here!

26
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,248
Yoren said none of us were
to go near those three.

27
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,501
Come here!

28
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,788
They don't scare me.

29
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,923
Hmm? Then you're stupid.

30
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,837
They scare me.

31
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:40,053
What are gold cloaks
doing so far from King's Landing?

32
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:46,305
What are you doing?

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,729
They're looking for me.

34
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:49,980
You in command here?

35
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:53,481
You're a long way from home.

36
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:55,567
I asked you a question.

37
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,284
Aye, you did.

38
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,571
You asked without manners

39
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,040
and I chose not to answer.

40
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:04,829
I have a royal warrant

41
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:09,338
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

42
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:14,504
Well, the thing is...

43
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:18,632
these gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch now.

44
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:21,850
That puts them beyond the reach
of kings and queens.

45
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,478
Does it?

46
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:25,849
It's a funny thing,

47
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,979
people worry so much about their throats

48
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,474
that they forget about what's down low.

49
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,188
Now, I sharpened this blade before breakfast.

50
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,276
I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.

51
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:43,869
Or... I could nick this artery in your leg.

52
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,997
And once it's nicked,

53
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,121
there's no one around here
who knows how to un-nick it.

54
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:52,337
We'll just keep that.

55
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,636
Good steel is always needed on the Wall.

56
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:59,423
Seems you have a choice,

57
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:03,726
you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

58
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:06,563
or you can go back to your city
and tell your masters

59
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:09,055
you didn't find what you were looking for.

60
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:17,316
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.

61
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:19,696
He carries a bull's head helmet.

62
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:25,039
Anyone turning him over
will earn the King's reward.

63
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,697
We'll be back with more men

64
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:31,163
and I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.

65
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:08,406
My lord.

66
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,125
You make me wait a long time,

67
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,120
but your friend keeps me company.

68
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,129
We were just speaking of your bravery

69
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,879
in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.

70
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:20,542
It was quite a battle.

71
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,967
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.

72
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:28,602
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

73
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,387
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

74
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:36,147
To find so lovely a creature
working in your father's kitchens...

75
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:38,564
It almost beggars belief.

76
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,074
Strange things do happen.

77
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,158
You should taste her fish pie.

78
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,737
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

79
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,915
- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.

80
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:54,082
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.

81
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:56,045
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

82
00:06:57,091 --> 00:07:01,302
I am glad your new friend
was able to accompany you to the capital.

83
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,175
Friends are such an important part of life.

84
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,894
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

85
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,388
But rest easy, my lord.

86
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,814
I am very good at keeping secrets
for my good friends.

87
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,402
Your discretion is legendary...

88
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:20,487
Where your friends are concerned.

89
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:25,116
How unspeakable of me to go on and on
when all you want to do is rest.

90
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:26,365
I will leave you.

91
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:31,072
Welcome to King's Landing, my dear.

92
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,037
This city is made brighter by your presence.

93
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,246
We have a council meeting, my lord.

94
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:42,090
I don't like threats.

95
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:43,584
Who threatened you?

96
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,633
I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.

97
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:48,384
Ned Stark was a man of honour.

98
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:49,673
And I am not.

99
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,769
Threaten me again
and I'll have you thrown into the sea.

100
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,892
You might be disappointed in the results.

101
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:01,652
Storms come and go,

102
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:03,981
the big fish eat the little fish,

103
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:06,744
and I keep on paddling.

104
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:09,575
Come, my lord.

105
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,578
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

106
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,873
"From this time until the end of time,

107
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,708
"we are not part of your realm,

108
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,003
"but a free and independent
Kingdom of the North."

109
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:31,763
He has more spirit than his father,
I'll give him that.

110
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:34,604
You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.

111
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:37,645
We can give him his father's bones back,
at least,

112
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,476
as a gesture of good faith.

113
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:41,644
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

114
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,155
I will, Your Grace.

115
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,273
Did you see my brother
when you were the Starks' guest?

116
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:49,649
I did.

117
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,034
They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.

118
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,289
If you speak with him,

119
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,244
tell him he's not been forgotten.

120
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:01,252
I will, Your Grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.

121
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,093
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

122
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:09,883
If that's everything...

123
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:14,345
A raven flew in this morning
from Castle Black.

124
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:16,646
Trouble with the wildlings.

125
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:19,223
That's why they're called "wildlings."

126
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:21,564
Somewhat less wild these days.

127
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:24,233
Seems they've stopped killing each other

128
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:27,026
and started following
this king-beyond-the-Wall.

129
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:29,530
Another king? How many is that now?

130
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:31,658
Five? I've lost count.

131
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:35,363
The Lord Commander asks
that we send more men to man the Wall.

132
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:38,909
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.

133
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:43,208
"The cold winds are rising
and the dead rise with them."

134
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:46,925
The northerners are a superstitious people.

135
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,129
According to the Commander,

136
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,379
one of these dead men
attacked him in his chambers.

137
00:09:51,473 --> 00:09:52,932
Mormont doesn't lie.

138
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:56,058
How do you kill a dead man?

139
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,765
Apparently you burn him.

140
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:05,226
One trip to the Wall and you come back
believing in grumpkins and snarks.

141
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,947
I don't know what I believe,

142
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,865
but here's a fact for you:

143
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:12,784
the Night's Watch is the only thing

144
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,443
that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.

145
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:20,000
I have every confidence that the brave men
of the Night's Watch will protect us all.

146
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:25,381
And I said,
"If the gods wanted us to have dignity,

147
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:27,791
"they wouldn't make us fart when we died."

148
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:31,548
We fart when we die?

149
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,050
My blessed mother,

150
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,679
I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

151
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,470
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

152
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:52,906
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

153
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:55,401
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?

154
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:57,654
We were having a serious discussion.

155
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,287
Would you look at that?

156
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:05,495
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

157
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:08,165
I prefer watching them come towards me.

158
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:10,587
I'm sure that's nice, too.

159
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:16,264
Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet
on the next farm over from where I grew up.

160
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,351
We were wrestling together
from the time we were six years old.

161
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:24,346
And then we got older and the wrestling...

162
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,360
changed.

163
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,024
You were with her?

164
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,437
How many times?

165
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:33,859
Well, as many times as I could.

166
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,406
I wish I grew up on a farm.

167
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:43,622
We need more potatoes.
Get another sack from the sledge.

168
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,337
Get the turnips, too.

169
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:03,688
No. Ghost, no.

170
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:05,471
No!

171
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,901
Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo!

172
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,116
You all right?

173
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:18,316
- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.

174
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,068
Oh.

175
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:21,907
Oh, right.

176
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,493
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,501
I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.

178
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,836
You're very brave.

179
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:46,770
What are you doing?

180
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:48,767
This is Gilly.

181
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,898
She's one of Craster's daughters.

182
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,689
Hello, Gilly. What are you doing?

183
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,191
Sam said you could help.

184
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:56,859
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed...

185
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,361
She's pregnant.

186
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,873
We have to take her with us when we leave.

187
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,705
What?

188
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,705
- What would that...
I know it sounds a bit mad.

189
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:13,376
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

190
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:16,421
- The Lord Commander ordered us to...
- We are sworn to protect.

191
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:18,303
- Sam, we can't take...
- Please, sir, please.

192
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:20,262
I can still run if I have to.

193
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,674
- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.

194
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,847
If it's a boy...

195
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,103
If it's a boy, what?

196
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:36,654
You want us to risk our lives for you
and you won't even tell us why?

197
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:45,413
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?

198
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:47,325
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?

199
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:49,326
Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

200
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,626
- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.

201
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:53,338
What do you think Craster cuts off for that?

202
00:13:53,423 --> 00:13:57,587
I can't steal her. She's a person, not a goat.

203
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:06,098
We're heading
deeper and deeper into wildling territory.

204
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:08,938
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.

205
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:11,893
And even if he would,
what would we do with her?

206
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,775
Who's going to deliver a baby, you?

207
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,059
I could try.

208
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,023
What? I've read about it.

209
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:21,655
A bit.

210
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:25,026
I'm sorry, Sam.

211
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:27,619
We can't help her.

212
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:25,759
Khaleesi.

213
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:14,099
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

214
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,646
- Who did this?
- Khal Pono, perhaps.

215
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:22,979
Khal Jhaqo.

216
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:26,192
They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a khalasar.

217
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:29,285
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

218
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,123
They killed his soul!

219
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:47,425
Shh. They cannot kill his soul.

220
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,420
They did!

221
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:51,889
They butchered him like an animal.

222
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,729
They did not burn his body.

223
00:16:55,981 --> 00:17:00,726
He can never join his ancestors
in the night lands.

224
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,856
Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.

225
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,289
And I promise you,

226
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,287
Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.

227
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,540
Is it as you remember, my lord?

228
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,716
It looks smaller.

229
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,627
Everything looks bigger when you're a child.

230
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,551
I remember my father's cabin
felt like a palace when I was little.

231
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:14,849
Now look at it.

232
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:17,176
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

233
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,978
Who will?

234
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,855
Anyone who matters.

235
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,980
This is a big day for them.

236
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,519
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

237
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:28,689
It's a hard place, the Iron Islands.

238
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:30,276
Always has been.

239
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,573
It's cold and it's wet.

240
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,322
Oh, I love the cold and wet.

241
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,820
They say hard places breed hard men.

242
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,576
And hard men rule the world.

243
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,586
Then you'll be king before long.

244
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,761
Try smiling with your lips closed.

245
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:53,003
Better.

246
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,929
My father doesn't trust you Iron Islanders.

247
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,929
I don't blame him.

248
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:04,023
He says that you're all reavers and rapers

249
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,935
and that no matter
how many women you have,

250
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:08,067
you'll never be sat...

251
00:19:08,154 --> 00:19:10,111
Quit talking about your father.

252
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:13,441
But he's right about us.

253
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:17,868
Our wives from the Iron Islands,
they're for breeding.

254
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,162
That's not enough for us.

255
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,294
That's why we take salt wives,
the women we capture.

256
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:25,790
Capture me.

257
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,920
Take me with you when you go ashore.

258
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:32,088
- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.

259
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:34,218
Not after you leave.

260
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:38,137
Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.

261
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,724
I haven't paid you.

262
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:55,321
Oh, yeah.

263
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,506
I paid good money...

264
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:20,389
I'm not going to stand for this.

265
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:22,185
I barely touched her.

266
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,761
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel

267
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,231
and this is what I get, crying.

268
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:28,604
One moment, my friend. A moment.

269
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:40,284
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

270
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:42,779
Aremca will take good care of you.

271
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:14,403
I'm sorry, my lord.

272
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:19,732
Did he hurt you?

273
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:22,819
No, my lord.

274
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,865
It's Mhaegen.

275
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:28,498
Who?

276
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:31,957
She works for you.

277
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,629
She's the one...

278
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:37,045
The gold cloaks,

279
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:39,841
- They killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.

280
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,259
That was...

281
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:43,600
poorly handled.

282
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,472
Sometimes those with the most power
have the least grace.

283
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:53,478
I can't stop thinking about it.

284
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:55,988
I can't sleep.

285
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,860
Her poor little baby.

286
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,158
You know, you remind me of another girl,

287
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:07,990
a lovely thing I once acquired
from a Lysene pleasure house.

288
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:12,165
Beautiful, like yourself,

289
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:15,624
and intelligent, like yourself.

290
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:18,135
But she wasn't happy.

291
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:22,428
She cried often.

292
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:24,760
I asked her why,

293
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:29,807
but we didn't have the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

294
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:35,394
Yes, it was quite sad.

295
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:40,900
Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses
are expensive,

296
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,534
extremely expensive.

297
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:45,991
And this one wasn't making me any money.

298
00:22:50,627 --> 00:22:52,785
I hate bad investments.

299
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:55,165
Really, I do.

300
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,373
They haunt me.

301
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:04,506
I had no idea how to make her happy,

302
00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:08,513
no idea how to mitigate my losses.

303
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:14,305
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me a tremendous amount of money

304
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,274
to let him transform

305
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,445
this lovely, sad girl.

306
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:21,906
To use her in ways

307
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,158
that would never occur to most men.

308
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,364
But you know what occurs to most men.

309
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:36,463
I would not say he succeeded
in making her happy,

310
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:42,126
but my losses were definitely mitigated.

311
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:52,970
Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.

312
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,061
I'll see you tomorrow.

313
00:23:57,151 --> 00:23:58,432
And you'll be happy?

314
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,151
That makes me happy.

315
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:17,870
More wine?

316
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:21,421
Damn it, boy!
Apologies, my lord.

317
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:24,712
Leave us, Podrick.
I believe we know how to pour our own wine.

318
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,888
That's your new squire?

319
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:29,966
I could've found you a proper lad.

320
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:33,060
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

321
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:35,680
That's a good red. Dornish?

322
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:37,184
You know your wines, my lord.

323
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,817
That I do.

324
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,485
A fine dinner, my lord.

325
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:43,148
Call me Tyrion, please.

326
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:47,030
I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners,
now that you're a lord.

327
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,945
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

328
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,576
Wars have been started for less.

329
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:55,704
I heard there was some trouble
in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

330
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:56,872
Mmm.

331
00:24:57,336 --> 00:24:58,368
Nasty business.

332
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,206
- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

333
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,125
The City Watch must keep the peace.

334
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,133
Only, I hadn't realised
peace depended on killing babies.

335
00:25:07,513 --> 00:25:09,885
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

336
00:25:10,016 --> 00:25:12,055
Especially the Queen's orders.

337
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:13,846
I never said they were the Queen's orders.

338
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:17,637
No, but who else would want
to murder King Robert's bastards?

339
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,060
She's always been a jealous woman.

340
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,811
You know your sister better than I do.

341
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:24,191
You've heard the awful rumours
about my brother and sister?

342
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,905
I don't listen to filth.

343
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,777
That's good of you, but you have heard them.

344
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,162
I suppose people who do believe that filth
consider Robert's bastards

345
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,737
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

346
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:36,789
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

347
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:38,916
I appreciate your loyalty.

348
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:44,586
Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men

349
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:47,629
in the throne room, did you give the order?

350
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:50,092
I did.

351
00:25:50,598 --> 00:25:52,306
And I would again.

352
00:25:52,391 --> 00:25:54,218
The man was a traitor.

353
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,137
He tried to buy my loyalty.

354
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:57,639
The fool.

355
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,514
He had no idea you were already bought.

356
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:02,354
Are you drunk?

357
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,019
I'll not have my honour questioned by an imp!

358
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:08,448
I'm not questioning your honour, Lord Janos.

359
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:10,818
I'm denying its existence.

360
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,994
If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf...

361
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,915
Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.

362
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:19,455
And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

363
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,999
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

364
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,754
I intend to serve as Hand of the King

365
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:26,335
until my father returns from the war.

366
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:28,632
And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

367
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:31,555
well, I just wouldn't feel safe
with you lurking about.

368
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:33,133
What are you...

369
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,181
My friends at court will not allow this!

370
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:37,307
- The Queen herself has granted...
- The Queen Regent.

371
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,886
And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.

372
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,273
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

373
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:43,473
No, we shan't.

374
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:54,367
There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.

375
00:26:54,453 --> 00:26:57,953
From there, I'm afraid,
it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.

376
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,499
I hope you enjoy the Wall.

377
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,576
I found it surprisingly beautiful...

378
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:06,580
in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable
sort of way.

379
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,502
The lads will escort you.

380
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,751
The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

381
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:12,505
These men are under my command!

382
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:15,173
I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

383
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,926
His name is Bronn,

384
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:19,390
and he is the new commander
of the City Watch.

385
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,802
Boys.

386
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:25,516
I have friends at court,

387
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,353
powerful friends!

388
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,651
The king himself made me a lord!

389
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:37,743
To the new commander.

390
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:47,828
If I told you to murder an infant girl, say,

391
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:49,916
still at her mother's breast,

392
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,087
would you do it without question?

393
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,679
Without question? No.

394
00:27:58,517 --> 00:27:59,716
I'd ask, "How much?"

395
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:20,237
If they come back, I say we yield.

396
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,742
Gendry's the one they want.

397
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:23,576
Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

398
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,328
I ain't afraid of no battles.

399
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:28,041
If you got within a mile of a battle,
you'd fill your pants.

400
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,589
I've seen lots of battles.

401
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,298
- I saw...
- Liar.

402
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:33,542
I saw a man kill another man

403
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:36,043
just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.

404
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:38,380
Stabbed him right in the neck.

405
00:28:38,474 --> 00:28:40,716
Two men fighting isn't a battle.

406
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,884
- They had armour on.
- So?

407
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,603
So, if they've got armour on, it's a battle.

408
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,101
No, it isn't.

409
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:51,314
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

410
00:28:51,404 --> 00:28:53,443
Gendry's an armourer's apprentice.

411
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,448
Hot Pie, tell Gendry
what makes a fight into a battle.

412
00:28:58,286 --> 00:29:00,777
It's when they've got armour on.

413
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,531
Who told you that?

414
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,071
A knight.

415
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:07,578
How'd you know he was a knight?

416
00:29:09,088 --> 00:29:12,172
Well, it was 'cause he'd got armour on.

417
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:14,250
You don't have to be a knight to have armour.

418
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,760
Any idiot can buy armour.

419
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:17,922
How do you know?

420
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:19,681
'Cause I sold armour.

421
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:34,902
What do the gold cloaks want with you?

422
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:36,898
- No idea.
- You're a liar.

423
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:39,660
You know, you shouldn't
insult people that are bigger than you.

424
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,317
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

425
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,406
I don't care what any of them want.

426
00:29:44,498 --> 00:29:46,456
No good's ever come of their questions.

427
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,535
No good's ever come?

428
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:50,753
Who asked questions before?

429
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:53,958
How can someone so small
be such a huge pain in my arse?

430
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,295
Who asked questions?

431
00:29:58,262 --> 00:29:59,673
The Hand of the King.

432
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:01,972
Hands of the King.

433
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:05,215
Lord Arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,

434
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:08,810
and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.

435
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,647
Lord Stark?

436
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:15,150
See? Asking me questions is bad luck.

437
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:19,029
You'll probably be dead soon.

438
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:23,242
- What did they ask about?
- My mum.

439
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:25,902
- Who's your mum?
- Just my mum,

440
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,907
worked in a tavern, died when I was little.

441
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,625
And who was your father?

442
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,830
Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

443
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:34,998
What about you anyway?

444
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:37,167
You thought they were after you.

445
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:40,128
Why?

446
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:43,008
Did you kill someone
or is it just because you're a girl?

447
00:30:43,516 --> 00:30:45,888
- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.

448
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:47,596
Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

449
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:48,766
Stupider.

450
00:30:48,854 --> 00:30:50,763
The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.

451
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:53,312
- Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl.
- I am not!

452
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,974
Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.

453
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:58,654
I don't need to take a piss.

454
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:07,077
Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.

455
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:08,575
No one can know.

456
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:12,201
Well, they won't. Not from me.

457
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:16,756
My name's not Arry.

458
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:20,332
It's Arya, of House Stark.

459
00:31:22,471 --> 00:31:24,594
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

460
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:29,058
He was your father, the Hand, the traitor.

461
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:30,639
He was never a traitor.

462
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:32,647
Joffrey is a liar.

463
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:35,524
So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.

464
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:37,483
No. I mean, yes.

465
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,112
My mother was a lady and my sister...

466
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:42,731
Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter,
and you lived in a castle and you...

467
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,488
Look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said...

468
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:48,151
And I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

469
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,659
I should be calling you "my lady."

470
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:53,501
- Do not call me "my lady."
- As my lady commands.

471
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:55,495
Well, that was unladylike.

472
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:57,082
Oh!

473
00:32:24,783 --> 00:32:26,575
What's she carrying?

474
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:29,531
Myrish oranges,

475
00:32:29,955 --> 00:32:31,284
wine from the Arbor...

476
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:35,163
and the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.

477
00:32:38,672 --> 00:32:41,590
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.

478
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:46,335
Me.

479
00:32:48,224 --> 00:32:49,766
I don't like wine.

480
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:51,804
Woman's drink.

481
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:56,725
I need to get to Pyke.

482
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,485
I'll find you a horse.

483
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:22,588
I'm heading that way. I can take you there.

484
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,046
I bet you can.

485
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:27,212
Have you been at sea long?

486
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,843
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

487
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:32,090
- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.

488
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:34,809
Maybe you don't know what you're like.

489
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:37,018
Maybe you need someone to teach you.

490
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:39,976
Do you know who I am?

491
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:43,353
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewellery,

492
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:45,899
Lord Greyjoy?

493
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:51,274
Have my things sent up to the castle.

494
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,881
You should give me the reins.

495
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:11,596
I'm a better rider than you.

496
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:13,593
I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.

497
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,178
Nine years?

498
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:18,062
Do you still know your way around a ship?

499
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:20,104
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

500
00:34:20,316 --> 00:34:22,604
Don't you worry about my hands.

501
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,650
The sea is in my blood.

502
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,740
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

503
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:32,281
I have a proposal for my father,

504
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,693
one that will make him king again,

505
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:37,414
and me after him.

506
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,628
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

507
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,838
Is that an offer from my future king?

508
00:34:44,923 --> 00:34:47,046
An order from your future king.

509
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:52,258
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

510
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:55,717
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

511
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:09,728
Father.

512
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,824
Nine years, is it?

513
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:16,076
They took a frightened boy.

514
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:18,497
What have they given back?

515
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,448
A man.

516
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:24,667
- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.

517
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:29,087
Stark had you longer than I did.

518
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:31,878
Lord Stark is gone.

519
00:35:33,722 --> 00:35:36,178
And how do you feel about that?

520
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,349
What's done is done.

521
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,433
I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.

522
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:46,019
Who gave you those clothes?

523
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:51,027
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

524
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:53,941
If my clothes offend you, I will change them.

525
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:55,149
You will.

526
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,992
That bauble round your neck,

527
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:02,248
did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold?

528
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,121
I asked a question.

529
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:07,750
Did you pull it from the neck
of a corpse you made

530
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,087
or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?

531
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:16,718
Iron or gold?

532
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:20,931
Gold.

533
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,568
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

534
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:34,023
My fears have come true,

535
00:36:34,116 --> 00:36:36,405
the Starks have made you theirs.

536
00:36:36,493 --> 00:36:39,530
- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the Stark boy sends you to me

537
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:42,907
like a trained raven clutching his message.

538
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:44,833
The offer he makes is one I proposed.

539
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:47,540
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

540
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:49,165
hunted with him, fought at his side.

541
00:36:49,256 --> 00:36:50,750
He thinks of me as a brother.

542
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,593
No, not here, not in my hearing.

543
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,966
You will not name him brother,

544
00:36:56,054 --> 00:37:00,004
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

545
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,887
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

546
00:37:02,978 --> 00:37:04,887
I forget nothing.

547
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,807
I remember my brothers.

548
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,307
And I remember when my father was a king.

549
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:28,206
I see.

550
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:31,542
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him

551
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:34,917
and he will make me
king of the Iron Islands once again.

552
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,679
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

553
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,462
I'm your son, your only living heir.

554
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:43,467
Who else?

555
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:47,847
I told you to wait outside.

556
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:51,149
How did you get past the guards?

557
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,607
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

558
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,858
My dear.

559
00:37:59,952 --> 00:38:01,031
Yara?

560
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:03,529
So good to see you, brother.

561
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:07,914
This is a homecoming
I'll tell my grandchildren about.

562
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:13,043
- She can't lead an attack!
And why not?

563
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:15,080
You're a woman!

564
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:18,591
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.

565
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,300
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

566
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,095
after your new father killed him.

567
00:38:24,184 --> 00:38:27,138
- What's dead may never die.
- ...dead may never die.

568
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:31,853
The only nights she's spent off these islands
have been spent on the sea.

569
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:34,894
She's commanded men.

570
00:38:34,987 --> 00:38:36,481
She's killed men.

571
00:38:37,197 --> 00:38:39,190
She knows who she is.

572
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,277
No man gives me a crown.

573
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,113
I pay the iron price.

574
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:49,533
I will take my crown,

575
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:52,243
for that is who I am.

576
00:38:53,046 --> 00:38:55,086
That is who we have always been.

577
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:02,253
You won't stand a chance
against the Lannisters on your own.

578
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:05,058
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

579
00:39:12,858 --> 00:39:15,693
You'll have your gold
when we take the treasury at King's Landing.

580
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:17,569
All these kings fighting for the throne,

581
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:20,489
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

582
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:22,981
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

583
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:25,028
Because you're a smart gambler.

584
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:28,788
Stannis has proved himself in war twice.

585
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:32,041
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

586
00:39:32,127 --> 00:39:33,870
Neither has the false King Joffrey.

587
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:35,919
And yet they both have larger armies.

588
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,880
Stannis has just begun the fight.

589
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:40,884
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

590
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,884
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honourable than Stannis Baratheon

591
00:39:45,974 --> 00:39:47,385
or more worthy of loyalty.

592
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:48,886
What is the world coming to

593
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:51,551
when smugglers must vouch
for the honour of kings?

594
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:53,935
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

595
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,732
You think I'm insulted?

596
00:39:55,817 --> 00:39:58,688
I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.

597
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:00,731
I don't sail for promises.

598
00:40:00,822 --> 00:40:02,281
Of course you do.

599
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,356
Every time you leave harbour,
you're leaving on a promise,

600
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:06,911
a promise that somewhere on the sea,

601
00:40:06,995 --> 00:40:09,320
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

602
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:11,988
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

603
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:14,411
You're not a young man, Salladhor.

604
00:40:14,503 --> 00:40:17,954
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

605
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:20,163
Only the clever ones.

606
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:23,085
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

607
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:26,927
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Myrenese silk merchants, then go.

608
00:40:27,015 --> 00:40:30,182
They're out there waiting for you. That's easy.

609
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,429
What I'm offering you is hard.

610
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,441
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

611
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:41,190
You'll be the richest man in Lys,
and the most famous.

612
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:45,111
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

613
00:40:46,868 --> 00:40:49,157
"Salladhor Saan" is a good name for songs.

614
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,662
- It is.
- One thing, I want the queen.

615
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:55,626
- The queen?
- Cersei, I want her.

616
00:40:55,711 --> 00:40:58,202
I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships.

617
00:40:58,296 --> 00:41:00,455
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

618
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:03,799
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

619
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:05,677
This war isn't about you.

620
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:09,473
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

621
00:41:09,558 --> 00:41:12,013
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

622
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,799
As if she would just let you.

623
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:15,722
You don't know how persuasive I am.

624
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:18,225
I've never tried to fuck you.

625
00:41:20,402 --> 00:41:23,154
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

626
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:24,697
the one true God...

627
00:41:24,823 --> 00:41:26,282
I've been all over the world, my boy,

628
00:41:26,366 --> 00:41:29,320
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true gods.

629
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:31,154
They all think they found the right one.

630
00:41:31,747 --> 00:41:34,416
The one true God
is what's between a woman's legs,

631
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:37,032
and better yet, a queen's legs.

632
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,827
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

633
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:42,167
He's young yet.

634
00:41:43,592 --> 00:41:46,427
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

635
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:48,006
I cannot promise you the queen.

636
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:53,386
You believe your king can win?

637
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:55,720
He is the one true king.

638
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,605
You Westerosi are funny people.

639
00:41:58,023 --> 00:42:00,893
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

640
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:05,353
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

641
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:08,199
You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.

642
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:11,323
Make me rich.

643
00:42:11,411 --> 00:42:14,531
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

644
00:42:26,551 --> 00:42:28,259
When will the king have us sail?

645
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,384
As soon as his God wills it.

646
00:42:30,472 --> 00:42:33,093
He's my God, too, and yours,

647
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,555
but you are too blind to see.

648
00:42:37,854 --> 00:42:39,930
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

649
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:41,601
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

650
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:43,850
The holy books are
much more persuasive than I can be.

651
00:42:43,944 --> 00:42:45,687
I wish I had a God, truly.

652
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:48,531
I'm not mocking you,
but I've seen men pray to every God there is,

653
00:42:48,615 --> 00:42:50,904
pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.

654
00:42:50,992 --> 00:42:53,662
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

655
00:42:53,745 --> 00:42:55,287
I wasn't praying.

656
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:58,039
But I was.

657
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:00,750
Every night that you were at sea,

658
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:03,671
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

659
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:06,626
You want me to have a God?

660
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:09,801
Fine. King Stannis is my God.

661
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:12,294
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

662
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,010
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

663
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,974
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

664
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,310
You think a fire God commanded all that?

665
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,647
It was Stannis, only Stannis.

666
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:26,683
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

667
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:29,565
Don't tell him that.

668
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,531
Lord Janos Slynt
was commander of the City Watch.

669
00:43:33,618 --> 00:43:35,029
You had no right to exile him.

670
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,662
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

671
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:39,498
You're serving as the King's Hand
till Father gets here.

672
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,863
I am Queen Regent.

673
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:42,584
Listen to me, Queen Regent.

674
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:44,128
You're losing the people.

675
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:47,128
- Do you hear me?
- The people.

676
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:48,966
You think I care?

677
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:52,882
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

678
00:43:53,638 --> 00:43:57,802
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

679
00:43:57,893 --> 00:44:01,427
And your gold-plated thugs
just gave them their rallying cry,

680
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:04,270
"The Queen slaughters babies."

681
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:09,481
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

682
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,246
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

683
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:24,876
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

684
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:29,340
Did he tell you?

685
00:44:29,424 --> 00:44:31,251
I imagine that would be even worse.

686
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:33,716
He did what needed to be done.

687
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:36,840
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

688
00:44:36,932 --> 00:44:40,265
This is what ruling is,
lying on a bed of weeds,

689
00:44:40,352 --> 00:44:42,178
ripping them out by the root, one by one,

690
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,930
before they strangle you in your sleep.

691
00:44:44,022 --> 00:44:46,430
I'm no king,
but I think there's more to ruling than that.

692
00:44:46,524 --> 00:44:48,102
I don't care what you think!

693
00:44:48,568 --> 00:44:49,897
You've never taken it seriously.

694
00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:51,694
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

695
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,361
It's all fallen on me.

696
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,491
As has Jaime, repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

697
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:12,466
You're funny.

698
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:18,339
You've always been funny...

699
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,682
but none of your jokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

700
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:26,104
You remember?

701
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,515
Back when you ripped my mother open
on your way out of her

702
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:31,518
and she bled to death?

703
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,569
She was my mother, too.

704
00:45:35,824 --> 00:45:37,234
Mother gone...

705
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,327
for the sake of you.

706
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:47,036
There's no bigger joke in the world than that.

707
00:46:09,316 --> 00:46:12,269
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

708
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,353
How did you fare with your pirate?

709
00:46:14,446 --> 00:46:17,862
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships.

710
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:19,858
His men know how to fight.

711
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:23,402
In my experience,
pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

712
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:24,955
It does seem the wiser choice.

713
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,328
There won't be a choice this time.

714
00:46:28,626 --> 00:46:29,741
Do you trust him?

715
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,003
Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
I've known him 30 years.

716
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,964
I've never trusted him.

717
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:39,843
Now, once he gets the smell of gold
he never stops.

718
00:46:40,638 --> 00:46:43,556
Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share.

719
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,301
Leave us.

720
00:46:55,028 --> 00:46:56,059
At once, Your Grace.

721
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:06,412
The Lord of Light shines through you,
young warrior.

722
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,285
Come.

723
00:47:20,845 --> 00:47:22,090
What did you say to him?

724
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,134
I told him death by fire is the purest death.

725
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:28,135
- Why?
- Because it is true.

726
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:31,563
You're troubled, my king.

727
00:47:32,524 --> 00:47:33,722
Yeah.

728
00:47:33,942 --> 00:47:36,397
These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.

729
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,488
Tell your lord to burn them, then.

730
00:47:39,572 --> 00:47:41,031
I tell him nothing.

731
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:44,116
I pray for his commands and I obey.

732
00:47:46,162 --> 00:47:49,946
My little brother has 100,000 men,
according to the scouts,

733
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,876
men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

734
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:54,752
You must have faith.

735
00:47:55,088 --> 00:47:56,250
Faith?

736
00:47:57,924 --> 00:48:00,593
In a real war, the side with
the greater number wins,

737
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,301
nine times out of ten.

738
00:48:02,804 --> 00:48:04,215
Then we must be the 10th.

739
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,386
I cannot defeat my brother in the field.

740
00:48:08,726 --> 00:48:12,142
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

741
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,273
I have seen the path to victory in the flames.

742
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:22,148
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

743
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,992
I've said the words, damn you.

744
00:48:28,746 --> 00:48:30,905
I burned the idols.

745
00:48:34,252 --> 00:48:37,703
You must give all of yourself.

746
00:48:43,011 --> 00:48:44,090
I have a wife.

747
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:47,587
I took a vow.

748
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:52,803
She's sickly, weak...

749
00:48:54,939 --> 00:48:56,766
Shut away in a tower.

750
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:00,102
She disgusts you.

751
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,277
And she's given you nothing,

752
00:49:06,534 --> 00:49:10,117
no sons, only stillborns,

753
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:12,908
only death.

754
00:49:19,297 --> 00:49:23,377
I will give you a son, my king.

755
00:49:26,346 --> 00:49:27,425
A son?
