1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:07,132
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,802
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,347
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,517
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,812
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:25,526
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,157
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,535
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,996
- Who do you think you are?
- This is what we talked about:

11
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,581
Using my speed to do good.

12
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,000
We talked about you helping
contain metahumans.

13
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,169
After all these classes, I started a blog.

14
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,256
I thought you were taking journalism,
not science fiction.

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,092
Since I've known you,
you've believed in the impossible.

16
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,972
What if you were right about when your
mom died? Something is saving people.

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,560
See you soon, Barry.

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,899
How often do you think
about why your friends came into your life?

19
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:10,862
Was it random, by design,
or maybe a little of both?

20
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,240
Regardless of the reason...

21
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,869
some friends, you just know,
are gonna be by your side for a while.

22
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:21,206
Others, you're not so sure.

23
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,041
And then there's that one friend...

24
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,879
who, well, you hope someday
becomes something more.

25
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,467
But friend will have to do for now...

26
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,928
and that's okay, I guess.

27
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,557
I'm glad you invited Caitlin and Cisco.

28
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,726
- They're cool, right?
- They saved your life.

29
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,228
That makes them the coolest people
I've ever met.

30
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,897
It's nice that you guys became friends.

31
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,775
To friends, old and new.

32
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,784
Ooh. I'm up. Wish me luck.

33
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,914
- I am going to destroy you.
- Don't get cocky, West.

34
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,249
Mm.

35
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,547
Guys, I have a problem.

36
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,717
We all do when guys like him exist.

37
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,553
Yeah. He's so hot.

38
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,682
Uh, I mean, genetically speaking.
Because I'm a geneticist, of course.

39
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,852
- God, do I sound like Felicity?
- I'm not talking about Eddie.

40
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,355
I'm talking about this.

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,733
I can't feel anything.

42
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,153
Yeah, that's usually what happens
when you drink too much.

43
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,489
No, the alcohol is not affecting me.

44
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,741
I mean, I literally feel nothing.

45
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,786
It's your hypermetabolism. I need a sample.

46
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,288
- I'll get more shots.
- I swear I had a Vacutainer.

47
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,457
Wait, you carry a blood-collection kit?

48
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,876
You have your hobbies...

49
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,806
- Fourteenth floor, secure.
- Roger that.

50
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,898
Hold off on that check.

51
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,992
Lock down the building. Hold it!

52
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,831
- Don't come near me.
- You need to come with me. Come on.

53
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,251
Get down.

54
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,521
- Ah. Still nothing?
- I can't get drunk.

55
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,691
I mean, I'm only 25,
and my drinking days are already over.

56
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,192
Come on, Allen, you're up.

57
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,156
There was a bombing on Eighth and Pass.

58
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,199
- I gotta go, babe.
- Okay.

59
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,993
Sorry, guys.

60
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,828
I've got an early shift at Jitters.

61
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,080
- We'll catch up tomorrow. Great.
- I'm beat.

62
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,167
It's getting late anyway,
so I'm just gonna...

63
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,343
Help! Somebody!

64
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,555
Guys, there's a window washer,
and he's gonna fall.

65
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,308
Don't try and catch him.
You don't have super-strength.

66
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,978
Is there a bed store near here?
What if I get mattresses and stack them?

67
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,732
- Barry, this isn't a Road Runner cartoon.
- Help! Help!

68
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,401
How fast would I need to go
to run up a building?

69
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,404
How far up do you need to go?

70
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,573
Hurry! Somebody!

71
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,743
Uh, I don't know, 50 meters give or take.

72
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,828
Thirty-two point fifty-seven...

73
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,083
Guys, hurry.

74
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,419
Just run really fast and you'll be fine.

75
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:58,173
- Maintain velocity on the way down, or...
- Or what?

76
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,635
- Splat.
- Great.

77
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,596
- Help!
- All right, all right, all right.

78
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,391
Here it goes.

79
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,932
Barry, what have you got?

80
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,894
Bombers typically have
their own unique signatures.

81
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,146
Crimped wires, fragmentation.

82
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,441
The level of sophistication is telling
once I've analyzed it.

83
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,487
- You show me a bomb, I can find a clue in it.
- Sounds like there's a "but" coming.

84
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,156
Yeah. I haven't found any sign
of an oxidizing agent.

85
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,952
- It's as if the floor just blew itself up.
- Things don't just blow up.

86
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,289
Security guard said our bomber
was a woman, red hair.

87
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,791
Also cut the security cameras.
There's no footage.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,960
But there might be something else.

89
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,755
Some kind of small charge
blasted the doorknob off.

90
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,719
- Any idea what's missing?
- My guess is one of these files.

91
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:30,181
- It will take days to figure out which one.
- Let's let Barry do his thing.

92
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,753
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

93
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:05,008
Came in here like they owned the place. Been
talking to Singh for the last half hour.

94
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,052
This can't be good.

95
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,102
- General Eiling, this is Detective West.
- Detective.

96
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,897
What's this all about?

97
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,399
The Army's taking over
the bombing investigation.

98
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:25,236
I'll need everything you have.
Physical evidence, photos...

99
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,281
- witness interviews, notes.
- I've been on the job 20 years.

100
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,034
Never heard of the Army
investigating anything civilian.

101
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,536
Well, it's not civilian. She's one of ours.

102
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,290
We'll send over everything we got.

103
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,669
Very kind of you.
I think we'll take it now, though.

104
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,506
Give them what they want, Joe.

105
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,552
You heard him, Joe. Give me what I want.

106
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,524
Hey, what's going on?

107
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,443
General Eiling is relieving us
from the bombing case.

108
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,780
Give these men everything that's relevant.

109
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,075
Sure thing, yeah.

110
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,710
You and a few civilians from S.T.A.R. Labs
might wanna check into that.

111
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,045
I think we might.

112
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,008
Can I talk to you for a minute, Joe?
It's about Iris.

113
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,136
Hey, Dad. You're home early.

114
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,097
What were you doing
at the bomb site last night?

115
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,976
Don't deny you were there.
Officer Vukovich saw you.

116
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,230
- It's complicated.
- You can't be coming to every crime scene...

117
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,899
because you're worried about Eddie.
He's a big boy.

118
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,694
I didn't go there to see Eddie. I...

119
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,030
I went there to see the Streak.

120
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,659
The Streak.

121
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,745
Hmm.

122
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,747
- What is that?
- My blog.

123
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,959
I've been collecting posts about the
Streak sightings and writing about them.

124
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,880
Baby, there's no Streak.

125
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,925
Yes, there is. I saw him last night, Dad.
I looked right at him.

126
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,847
Something incredible is happening in
Central City, and I am gonna write about it.

127
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,058
If you'll excuse me, I have to get to work.

128
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,186
Blogging about supernatural events
doesn't really pay well.

129
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,863
A VA file number is all the info
you have on the bomber?

130
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,865
C.C.P.D.'s been ordered off the case.

131
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,576
- Well, who has the power to do that?
- The Army.

132
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,954
Yeah, some general.
His name was Eiling, I think.

133
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,498
General Wade Eiling.

134
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,958
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

135
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,212
About 10 years ago General
Wade Eiling contracted S.T.A.R. Labs...

136
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,798
to develop enhanced gene therapies
for soldiers.

137
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,509
I was interested in the medical benefits
for civilians.

138
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,262
General Eiling really wanted
to develop mind-reading capabilities...

139
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,348
for interrogation purposes.

140
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,811
I ended the study when I saw his techniques,
but our split was less than amicable.

141
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,271
He took the evidence
I collected on the bombing.

142
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,689
Everything but the folder.

143
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,194
Well, lucky for us,
the VA finally joined the new millennium...

144
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,696
and digitized their records.

145
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,448
A lot of redacted info...

146
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,994
but our girl's name is Bette Sans Souci,
an EOD specialist for the Army.

147
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,663
- EOD?
- Bombs.

148
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,499
- Is there an address?
- Hold on. Here we go.

149
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,461
One person in case of emergency:
Cameron Scott, Anglewood.

150
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,066
Bette Sans Souci?

151
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,488
- I need you to come with me.
- Don't touch me, please.

152
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,367
Get whatever you're wearing off of you.

153
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,245
Hurry.

154
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,550
Barry, can you hear me? Barry?

155
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,679
There must be a perfectly reasonable
explanation for why he's not answering.

156
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,431
Barry!

157
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,144
- Uh...
- Don't ask.

158
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,105
I'm gonna ask. Where's my suit?

159
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,609
It's gone.

160
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,069
What do you mean, it's gone?

161
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,947
- What did you do with my suit?
- It blew up, dude.

162
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,159
I managed to get out of it
before it went kaboom.

163
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,329
My suit went kaboom?

164
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,248
Fun fact about Bette Sans Souci:
She's not carrying bombs.

165
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,085
She touched the emblem on the suit
and turned it into a bomb.

166
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,587
She's a metahuman.

167
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:57,300
With the ability to cause spontaneous
combustion upon tactile contact.

168
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,761
- She blew up my suit.
- You have like three more.

169
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,138
Okay, I have two. And I loved that one.

170
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:07,018
- All right, what else do we know about her?
- Oh, I don't know, she's pure evil?

171
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,730
We're gonna find this girl
and send her butt into the pipeline.

172
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,192
No one blows my tech to smithereens
and gets away with it.

173
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,321
Unless she looks like that.

174
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,616
I don't think she meant to hurt me.

175
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,828
Or her being a metahuman explains
General Eiling's interest in her.

176
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,830
And why he stole the case from us.

177
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,292
He didn't want anyone
to know what she could do.

178
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:37,173
- Detective.
- Doctor. So human bomb.

179
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,133
Must be Tuesday in Central City.

180
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,888
Yes. And General Eiling's not one to
give up a potential asset without a fight.

181
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:48,351
- We have to find her before he does.
- Barry, can I see you for a second?

182
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,735
When were you planning on telling me
that Iris saw the Streak?

183
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,321
That was not planned.
She caught me off guard.

184
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,739
We had a deal.

185
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,576
Keep her in the dark about metahumans,
and I don't go Floyd Mayweather on you.

186
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,871
- Okay. Joe, I know...
- And she's writing a blog now.

187
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,666
- I already talked to her about that.
- Talk to her again.

188
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,210
And be more convincing.

189
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,878
Okay.

190
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,882
- You mean right now?
- Yes, I do.

191
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,262
You gotta stop writing about this guy.

192
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,347
- He doesn't even exist.
- I saw him, Barry.

193
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,933
He wears a red suit,
like a uniform or something...

194
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,727
with a lightning bolt on his chest.

195
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,106
Iris, come on.
You were drinking last night at the bar.

196
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,694
I was not drunk, and I know what I saw.
He wears a mask.

197
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,447
I think he smiled at me.

198
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:48,453
Okay, first of all, if he's wearing a mask,
he doesn't want people to know who he is.

199
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,996
It doesn't matter who he is.

200
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,540
What matters is that people know
that he's out there.

201
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,085
What is wrong with you?
This is important to me.

202
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,795
Why can't you be more supportive?

203
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,632
I'm just...
You haven't even put your name on it.

204
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,136
I mean, how serious can you be
about an anonymous blog?

205
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,890
Okay, you know what?

206
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,643
Our entire lives, you couldn't scream
loud enough that the impossible existed.

207
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,063
Now it's actually
happening in Central City...

208
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,483
I have proof of it,
and you don't wanna know about it?

209
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,568
That doesn't make sense, Barry.

210
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,905
So when you're ready to tell me
what this routine is really about...

211
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,324
then we can talk.

212
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,079
Yeah.

213
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,289
We've piggybacked
onto Eiling's surveillance.

214
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,292
According to what they're saying,
the lovely Ms. Sans Souci...

215
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,002
was just spotted in Anglewood.

216
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,755
The same neighborhood
as Dr. Harold Hadley's office...

217
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,549
the military surgeon
who performed procedures on her.

218
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,676
That's why she was looking for the folder.

219
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,179
- You gotta get to her before Eiling does.
- Okay.

220
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,989
- Sergeant Sans Souci.
- You remember me. Good.

221
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,492
Because I remember you, doctor.

222
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,662
I remember waking up from a coma.
You'd started cutting me open.

223
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,125
I was trying to help ease your condition.
You couldn't control it.

224
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,336
You did this to me. You and Eiling.

225
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,399
- Go bring me my asset.
- Sir.

226
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,741
You okay? I can get you out of here. I can
help you understand what happened to you.

227
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,035
- How?
- Because it happened to me too.

228
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,245
Please.

229
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,679
Target is gone.

230
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,020
As the detonation dispersed
throughout Central City...

231
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,440
a number of people were exposed
to a wave of unquantifiable energy.

232
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,901
One of those people was you.

233
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,612
You were in Central City 10 months ago.

234
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,657
Uh, I had just returned from Afghanistan.

235
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,244
I was there diffusing roadside bombs...

236
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,539
and shrapnel ripped through me.

237
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,502
I was flown back Stateside.
Spent months at the base recuperating.

238
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,629
And next thing I know...

239
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,340
I became the thing
that almost killed me.

240
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,135
And Eiling's favorite new lab rat.

241
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:55,848
The dark matter must have combined
with the bomb particulate inside your body.

242
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,518
I thought Eiling did this to me.

243
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:03,314
Eiling is not smart enough
to create someone like you...

244
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,316
but clever enough to see your value.

245
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,110
Do you know of any others
who were changed?

246
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,406
- There have been a few.
- But no one that looks like you.

247
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,787
I'm sorry. That was inappropriate.

248
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:22,542
- Please don't leave.
- I know how to perform a lobotomy.

249
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,920
Cell structure's unlike anything I've seen.

250
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,548
Her nitrogen levels are off the charts.

251
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,011
You think we can help her?

252
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,556
To answer that,
we have to understand how she works.

253
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,058
To understand that,
we have to study her in action.

254
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,810
You want her to blow stuff up.

255
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,980
- Yes. Now we're talking.
- Not in here. She's too unstable.

256
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,940
- I know.
- I know you know.

257
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,236
So this is your life now, huh?
Testing people like me?

258
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,405
Stopping people like you.

259
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,575
It's not what I thought I'd be doing.

260
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,871
Actually, aside from Barry, you're
the first metahuman that we've tested.

261
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,083
- "Metahuman"?
- It's just a term.

262
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,921
Oh, my God. What happened?

263
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,134
- Why didn't you say that you were shot?
- It just grazed me.

264
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,595
There's something in there.

265
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,437
A tracker.

266
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,113
Lock down the pipeline. Get Bette
out of here. I'll take care of Eiling.

267
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,871
Harrison Wells.

268
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,041
- How the might have fallen.
- General.

269
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,209
S.T.A.R. Labs.

270
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,171
This place used to be so important.

271
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,759
Tell me, what does one do
after such a spectacular public failure?

272
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,055
One adapts. One evolves.

273
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,766
One becomes intent
on reversing one's fortune.

274
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,476
Always the idealist.

275
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,479
- What do you want, Wade?
- Where's my asset?

276
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,399
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- We tracked her here, Harrison.

277
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,944
Turn her over before you see the rest
of your precious palace crumble.

278
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,155
Wade, Wade, Wade.

279
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,997
We could've changed the world, you and I.

280
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:41,597
Four hundred twenty-seven kPa's.
Her Trauzl rating is around 45.

281
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,058
That's the same as any plastique.

282
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,186
"Plastique." Ha! First try.

283
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,647
Didn't really think
this one through, did you?

284
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,487
Downrange insurgents
started booby-trapping cars.

285
00:19:56,654 --> 00:20:00,991
For the rest of my tour,
I was terrified to touch another vehicle.

286
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,872
Now I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
terrified to touch another human being.

287
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,043
Have they tried to help you?

288
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,796
Uh...

289
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,341
They've helped me
learn how to use my powers...

290
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,551
not reverse them.

291
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:23,681
If they could reverse it
SO you weren't a metahuman...

292
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,349
would you?

293
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,813
A friend told me
I was given my speed for a reason...

294
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,315
that I was chosen.

295
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,026
I don't know if I believe that.

296
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,905
But I always wanted to help people.

297
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,991
Now I can.

298
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,037
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,666
- Hey, Joe.
- I see your little conversation with Iris...

300
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,001
Wwas a rousing success.

301
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,795
She just posted another story
about the Streak.

302
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:59,091
- Joe, I tried. I really tried.
- She's got her name on it now, Barry.

303
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,968
- What? Joe...
- It's my fault.

304
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,972
I shouldn't have asked you to say anything.
I just wanted you to know. Okay? Bye.

305
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,644
What was that about?

306
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,649
Iris posted about the Streak again.
She signed her name to it.

307
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,195
- Oh, that's not good.
- No.

308
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,156
If one of these bad metahumans
figures she knows something...

309
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,492
They may target her. I know.

310
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,336
Sorry, we're closed.

311
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,090
Oh, my God. It's you.

312
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,761
Iris West,
I hear you've been writing about me.

313
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,351
You are real.

314
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,771
I should, um...

315
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,648
Let me just clean up...

316
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,529
Meet me on the roof.

317
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,657
- I'll give you a head start.
- Okay.

318
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,459
I need you to stop writing about me.

319
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,797
There are a lot of people
who need someone like you right now...

320
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,174
to know that you're out there.

321
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,302
I have so many questions.

322
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,471
Where are you from?

323
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,307
I can't say.

324
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,434
Who are you?

325
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,812
I can't tell you that either.

326
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,314
How can you do what you do?

327
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,280
You're a terrible interview.

328
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,908
There's more to this
than you can understand.

329
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:52,288
Just trust me, please. I need you to stop.

330
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,498
Can you stop?

331
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:58,502
Running into buildings and rescuing people
without them even knowing you're there?

332
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,755
- I don't do this for the glory.
- So why do you?

333
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,182
Look, I have this friend...

334
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,853
and he had something terrible happen
to him when he was a kid.

335
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,650
And his whole life, he's been telling
stories about this impossible thing.

336
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:26,488
And people laughed at him,
and shrinks analyzed him.

337
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,868
And he's been searching
for an explanation ever since.

338
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:36,624
But now suddenly it's
like he's lost his faith.

339
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,753
But you, you are proof
that he wasn't crazy.

340
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,176
Help me save my friend.

341
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,057
He's a lucky guy.

342
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:55,081
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

343
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,411
Hey, what's wrong?

344
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,748
- Did Eiling find out you're here?
- No.

345
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,834
Caitlin was about to give me
the not-so-good news.

346
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,675
The shrapnel in your body
has merged with you on a cellular level.

347
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,430
The technology required
to unsplice your DNA...

348
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,558
It hasn't been invented yet.

349
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,857
Bette...

350
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,610
It's okay.

351
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,238
Roger that. I...

352
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,740
I just need a minute.

353
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,035
Don't worry. I'm pretty sure I can cry
without blowing stuff up.

354
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,753
What now?

355
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,966
She joins us. Becomes a part of the team.

356
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:13,137
Barry, you have an amazing ability
to help people.

357
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,140
She makes things explode.

358
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,935
She's the first metahuman not hell-bent
on destroying the city.

359
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,145
It's too dangerous.

360
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,065
- She's not going in the pipeline.
- I'm not suggesting she go in.

361
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,652
But were she to remain at S.T.A.R. Labs,
it would put all of us at risk.

362
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,654
From who, Eiling?

363
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,991
Eiling is a dangerous man, Barry.
We do not want him as an enemy.

364
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,205
After the lightning bolt,
what if you hadn't found me?

365
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,415
It could've been me.

366
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,670
Hunted, on the run, cut off
from everyone I know and care about.

367
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,630
You guys saved me.

368
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,842
And I wanna save her
just as bad as you do, Barry.

369
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,177
We all do.

370
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,688
Joe.

371
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,023
What are you doing here?

372
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,318
Going over the materials
in your mom's case.

373
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,195
How's it going with you?

374
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,157
Stellar. I made friends
with a human bomb...

375
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:19,119
who I promised I could help
and then I couldn't.

376
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:24,041
And I finally diagnosed
why Iris is writing about the Streak.

377
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,961
She's doing it for me.

378
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,841
To prove the impossible is possible.

379
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,636
How do you know that?

380
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,056
The Streak may have talked to her.

381
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,226
Barry, don't you think
Iris would recognize your voice?

382
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,395
No, I can do
this cool thing with my vocal cords...

383
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,856
where I vibrate them
so I sound like this.

384
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,567
I know.

385
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,861
It's cool. It's cool.

386
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,322
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

387
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,534
Well, you put that out there now, so...

388
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,496
I want to keep her safe.

389
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,584
You know the only way to get her to stop
is to tell her the truth.

390
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,920
Man, you really wanna tell her.

391
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,673
I tell her everything.

392
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,758
Hmm.

393
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,552
Not everything.

394
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:29,857
Is it that obvious?

395
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,403
Not to her.

396
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,614
How long have you known for?

397
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:43,287
I have watched you be in love with Iris since
you were old enough to know what love is.

398
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,207
Heh. And I've been waiting years
for you to tell her.

399
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,295
But you haven't.

400
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,925
- Guess I was too slow.
- Hmm.

401
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,595
Now she's happy
and with someone else, so...

402
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,306
When the universe wants
to make something happen...

403
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,975
whether it be giving a young man
lightning speed...

404
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,311
or putting two people together...

405
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,646
it has a way of
figuring those things out.

406
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,401
I gotta get home.

407
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,908
Thanks.

408
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,670
- Cisco?
- He went home.

409
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,758
I think our Cisco's developing a little bit
of a crush on you.

410
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,761
Not sure I'm prizewinning
date material anymore.

411
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,179
Change is hard.

412
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:47,517
The same accident that changed you
put me in this chair.

413
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,603
Sorry. I didn't know.

414
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,272
I don't share that story with you
to garner sympathy.

415
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,275
- I tell it to illustrate a larger point.
- What point is that?

416
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,819
That I would do anything...

417
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,156
to get back what I lost.

418
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:02,658
As would you.

419
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,786
I would.

420
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,537
I just don't know how.

421
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,212
You soldiers,
you call yourselves sheepdogs.

422
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,005
Am I right?

423
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,633
Happy and normal
until someone attacks our flock.

424
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,719
Every good person who was changed
that night, people like you...

425
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,723
people like Barry Allen,
those people are your flock now, Bette.

426
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,395
And General Eiling will never stop
attacking that flock.

427
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,231
And he always gets his target.

428
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,610
Unless you stop him.

429
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,158
You know your duty, sergeant.

430
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,578
Kill Eiling.

431
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,248
One last mission...

432
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,167
and then you go home.

433
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,975
Where's Bette?

434
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,810
- She left.
- What do you mean?

435
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,812
- Where'd she go?
- She didn't say.

436
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,897
Well, where the hell could she be?

437
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,490
Let's go. Go, go, go.

438
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,162
On me.

439
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,463
- I'm ready to give myself up.
- Oh, I highly doubt that.

440
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,716
Think you can put one over on me?

441
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,179
You can't.

442
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,682
- Stand down, soldier.
- I got back on the military feed.

443
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,144
Looks like they've gone to the waterfront
to rendezvous with Bette.

444
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,604
She's turning herself in.

445
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,482
She's not turning herself in.

446
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,611
Please let him get there in time.

447
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,031
All over the world,
people are plotting to destroy our country.

448
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,075
To end our lives.

449
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,661
Brave American soldiers
are gonna die in that fight.

450
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,747
But they don't have to. Because of you...

451
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,792
we could have victory.

452
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,961
All I've ever wanted
was to make the world a safer place.

453
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,213
And it will be...

454
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,256
when you're not in it.

455
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,217
Take cover!

456
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,311
What are you doing here?

457
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,022
Being a soldier
doesn't mean you're a murderer.

458
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,273
Don't become one now.

459
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,072
- I'm sorry. I didn't see him.
- Don't be.

460
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,450
It's not your fault. I'm
glad you stopped me.

461
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,619
- I'll get you back to S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Barry.

462
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,664
Dr. Wells, he...

463
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,749
He...

464
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,347
- We have a problem.
- Is Bette okay?

465
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,184
No. Eiling killed her.

466
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,897
- She's glowing. She's gonna detonate.
- Oh, my God.

467
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,025
- A mass that size, the explosion would be...
- Devastating.

468
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,697
- You have to get her away from the city.
- But there's no time.

469
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,451
Can I run on water?

470
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:37,122
I built up enough speed to run up a building.
How fast do I need to go to run on water?

471
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,124
Assuming your weight...

472
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:43,086
450 pounds of force per step
for vertical suspension.

473
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:46,840
- Accounting for fluid drag...
- Approximately 650 miles an hour.

474
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,927
You have to outrun the blast,
or you'll die too.

475
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,846
Nothing out of the ordinary occurred.

476
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:21,142
The military was simply conducting
an underwater weapons test.

477
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,562
There is no need for panic or alarm.

478
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,231
Central City is safe, I guarantee you.

479
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,653
He murdered Bette right in front of me,
and there's nothing we can do to him?

480
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,155
Powerful men have a way
of avoiding consequences.

481
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,743
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

482
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,996
You can walk on water.

483
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,707
Puts you in pretty interesting company.

484
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,223
If you came to do laundry,
I already have a load in.

485
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:06,813
Uh, no, I came to talk.

486
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,369
I was working a case...

487
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,374
someone I really thought
I could help befriend...

488
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,628
but they died.

489
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,129
Barry, I'm really sorry.

490
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:35,091
I didn't know her that
well, but it still hurts.

491
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,304
And as bad as I feel right now...

492
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:44,434
I know how much worse it is
to lose someone who's family.

493
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:49,439
Iris, writing about this stuff...

494
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,275
putting your name out there,
it's dangerous.

495
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:58,990
So I'm asking you one last time,
please stop.

496
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:05,121
And I am asking you one last time to
tell me what is really going on with you.

497
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,291
Why am I the only one of us
who's interested in this?

498
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:27,310
I guess just all this stuff with my family,
I finally just...

499
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,021
put it behind me.

500
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,816
I'm asking you to also.

501
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:39,531
That may have been how this started,
but it's about something more for me now.

502
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,494
Whoever this Streak is,
wherever he comes from...

503
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:48,707
I am not stopping until the
rest of the world believes in him.

504
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,512
Maybe we shouldn't see each other
for a while.

505
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,934
Yeah.

506
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,832
Can I get another club soda, please?

507
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,504
Hey.

508
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:40,175
- Hey. What are you guys doing here?
- We thought we should have a toast.

509
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,886
Doesn't work on me, remember?

510
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,848
Barry Allen, you of all people should know
that nothing is impossible.

511
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:52,187
I distilled a highly fermented
potent suspension.

512
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,897
It's basically 500-proof.

513
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,984
I figured if anybody could use
a drink tonight, it was you.

514
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,237
So here's to Bette.

515
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,407
Bette.

516
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,958
Whoa. Oh!

517
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,336
- That hits you quick.
- Are you buzzed?

518
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,087
Um...

519
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,424
Yeah. Heh. Yeah, I'm buzzed for sure.

520
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:22,926
Whoa.

521
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,553
Oh, that is good stuff.

522
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,265
And it's gone.

523
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,477
- Right.
- Work in progress.

524
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,980
For a guy who has experienced
his fair share of mysteries...

525
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:41,444
one mystery I still can't figure out
is why some people come into our lives...

526
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:45,448
why some people go,
and others become a part of you.

527
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:49,244
Some friendships feel
like they'll last forever.

528
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,246
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

529
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,957
There's dinner in the fridge.

530
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,000
Okay, thanks.

531
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,295
- Iris, about your blog...
- I don't wanna talk about it, okay?

532
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,007
And others end far too soon.

533
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,803
Not every friendship is meant
to last a lifetime.

534
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,474
What does last forever is the pain
when that person is gone.

535
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,206
I was wrong about you, Harrison.

536
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,001
You're still one step ahead.

537
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,962
Impressive for a man
without the use of his legs.

538
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,882
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

539
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,636
A girl who can transform ordinary objects
into explosives with the touch of her hand.

540
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:53,516
Today I saw a man who can move faster
than the blink of an eye. Extraordinary.

541
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:58,646
The night your particle accelerator died
was the night the impossible was born.

542
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,357
I think we should start working
together again.

543
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,734
I think you should leave.

544
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,194
I can have a squadron of soldiers
here in minutes.

545
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,989
You know I can have an army
of press here... like that.

546
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,241
Believe me, general,
I'd be more than happy...

547
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:15,371
to testify to your involvement in
activities that were less than humane.

548
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,833
Threaten me again,
and I will end you, general.

549
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,669
And I am not talking about your career.

550
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,552
You know,
I figured out your little secret, Wells.

551
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,181
Won't be long before the public
catches on as well.

552
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:51,240
- This is everything we've worked to achieve.
- The same goals, but not the same means.

553
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,869
I will not have this project end
before it even begins.

554
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,246
And as long as he's on my premises...

555
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,959
I will not have him subjected to that
kind of cruelty anymore. We're done.

556
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,588
We're done.

557
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:09,926
General, get out.

558
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,781
Hey.

559
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,618
It's okay.

560
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,914
It's okay, boy. It's okay.

561
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,458
He's gone.

562
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,460
Don't you worry.

563
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:49,132
I have a whole different future
in mind for you.

564
00:41:49,156 --> 00:41:57,156
