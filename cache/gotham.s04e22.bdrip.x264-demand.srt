The maze bombs, yes.
I mean the other ones.

Jim, as an engineer,
you expect systems to fail.

68

So, you build in redundancies.

Healthy male adult. His ribs should
be able to take about 450 pounds

322
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640
- before they crack.
- (GROANS)

323
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,238
Do you think you could
hide this from me, Ed?

324
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,880
I'm Queen of the Narrows.
People tell me things.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,035
I know how this looks.

326
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,696
It looks like you're trying
to crush him to death

327
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,920
because you think we still have
feelings for each other.

328
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,712
Well, perhaps we should jump to
why this is a good thing.

329
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,035
I can't wait.

330
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,395
He's holding you back.

331
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,195
From?

332
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,513
From being the person
that you are meant to be.

333
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,273
The woman that I love.

334
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,310
(SIGHS) You really think
so little of me?

335
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,635
I don't follow that.

336
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,997
How weak would that person need to be
if Jim Gordon could hold her back?

337
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
It's actually insulting.

338
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,953
That's not what I intended, I...

339
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,075
Enough.

340
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,072
Yesterday, you said a part of you
would always care for me.

341
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,478
The woman you loved is gone.
Understand?

342
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,590
Yes.

343
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,959
The Narrows is free from landlords
and gangs.

344
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,797
Every family has money to build
their life. I'm done. I'm leaving.

345
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,516
I want you to come with me.
But if you kill Jim, don't bother.

346
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,997
And I will decide
who I'm going to be.

347
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,192
Not you. Not Jim Gordon. Me.

348
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,993
I'm leaving tonight.
It's your choice.

350

She chose me, Jim.

351
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,594
Did you hear that?

352
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,349
It's all I wanted.

353
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,670
You can have Gotham.

BARBARA: By the time I got there,
Jeremiah had already escaped.

356
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,716
ALFRED: Right.
Where the hell is Ra's al Ghul?

357
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,634
Alfred. Let me guess. Ra's helped
Jeremiah kidnap Bruce.

358
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,194
So you came to me to find Ra's.

359
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,153
Would you care to tell me
where he is?

360
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,675
I don't know where he is.
But I know where he's gonna be.

361
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,990
Ra's is leaving Gotham tonight
after turning it to a pile of rubble.

362
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,316
With. I assume. Jeremiah's help.
So, here's the deal.

363
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,392
You get to kill Jeremiah,
you get to rescue Bruce.

364
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,153
And I get to kill Ra's.

365
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,080
And how do you plan
on doing that then?

366
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,839
I got a little surprise for him.

367
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,194
PENGUIN: One question.

368
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,319
Who do I get to kill?

369
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,993
The only way to keep
Butch on the table

370
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,753
was to promise I would come help.

371
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,435
Well.

372
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,950
Don't we make quite the little gang?

373
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,194
Let's do this.

374
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,119
- (GROANING)
- (SIREN WAILING)

375
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,275
Hey.

376
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,199
My car's around the corner.

377
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,033
You're gonna wanna ice those ribs.

378
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,197
Is it true about you leaving Gotham?

379
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,473
- Yes.
- And taking Ed with you?

380
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,519
That's none of your concern.

381
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,069
Back in the GCPD,

382
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,515
when I told you there was so much
Iwish I could change,

383
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,199
- you asked me what I meant.
- Jim.

384
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,840
I would change everything that
brought us to this point.

385
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,790
I would ask you to leave Gotham
with me that first moment I saw you

386
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,640
and I would make sure we had
a life together.

387
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,749
Then you wouldn't be you.

388
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,240
Maybe thafd be a good thing.

389
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,915
No, it wouldn't.

390
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,957
I'm not going back to who I was.

391
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,390
But. what you said yesterday about
part of you always caring for me,

392
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,509
Ifeel the same way.

393
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,957
Goodbye. Now, go save Gotham.

394
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,750
Ready at your command, Major.

395
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,160
- Jim.
- Harvey.

396
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,280
Thank God, you're all right.
What the hell happened?

397
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,560
<i>It's a long story.
Did Harlan ger Bruce to the precinct?</i>

398
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,039
Yeah, it's bad.

399
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,576
<i>- What are you talking about?
- (SIGHS)</i>

400
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,355
Jeremiah escaped. He's got Bruce.
He took the bombs, all of them.

401
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,469
It's true.

402
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,392
- How did you two...
- Find each other?

403
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,557
I'd like to think it was you, Bruce.

404
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,796
You brought us together.

405
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,199
I trust things went smoothly?

406
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,835
Like clockwork.

407
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,198
Did your men retrieve my bombs?

408
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,315
They are en route to their positions
as we speak.

409
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,115
From here,

410
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,518
we can take in the full majesty
of G0tham's destruction.

411
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,720
You're both insane.

412
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,318
I know
it's difficult to fathom, Bruce.

413
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,751
But Jeremiah and I are doing this
for your benefit.

414
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,756
How is destroying Gotham
supposed to help me?

415
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,672
Because I had a vision.

416
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,832
That out of this crucible
of blood and fire

417
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,800
will rise the Dark Knight
that your city needs. That I need.

418
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,758
To be honest, Bruce.

419
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,959
Prophesies, visions.
Not really my cup of tea.

420
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,190
But our friend revealed
something to me.

421
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,520
That my twin obsessions,
rebuilding Gotham and rebuilding you,

422
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,677
are one and the same.

423
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,793
You're the brotherl never had.

424
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,113
The one Jerome never could be.

425
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,070
We will create a legacy in this city.

426
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,913
Gotham falls. We rise.

427
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,589
Together.

428
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,949
A dozen transport Vans were stolen
from the GCPD motor pool.

429
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,517
That's gotta be how
they're carrying the bombs.

430
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,989
There were sightings here,
here and here.

431
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,991
They're moving towards
the outskirts of Gotham.

432
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,753
Jeremiah must have changed targets.

433
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,075
- Gordon.
- PerfecL

434
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,834
You have some explaining to do.
What happened to my men?

435
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,433
Major, we got serious fish to fry...

436
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,936
I didn't ask
for your opinion, Detective.

437
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,480
Two more sightings.
Bolyston and Third,

438
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
and they're moving nonh
along the Van Hook Highway.

439
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,880
That doesn't make any sense.

440
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,640
What buildings
would he be targeting there?

441
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,511
Told me Jeremiah promised to turn
Gotham into a dark island.

442
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,153
We need to cancel the evacuation.
Get those people off the bridges.

443
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,594
Absolutely not.

444
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,136
They're filled with people
leaving the city.

445
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,080
We bring them back into Gotham.
Buildings fall...

446
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,839
The bridges are the targets.
Harper, spread the word.

447
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,230
Don't move. Arrest Captain Gordon.

448
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,669
I wouldn't do that.

449
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,074
Arrest them both.

450
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,754
Officer, your radio.

451
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,795
This is Captain Gordon. I want all
the bridges cleared immediately.

452
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,389
I repeat. Clear all the bridges.

453

Civilization, so fragile, Bruce.

454
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,798
Gotham is soon to be each man
for himself, a more savage place.

455
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,389
Sounds like fun.

456
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,154
Sure you wanna leave?

457
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,277

I'm not leaving.

460

Gotham's in my blood. And I don't
think I can let you leave either.

461
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,870
You re-forged it. Well now.

462
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,640
You see, you say you're leaving.

463
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,870
But I've got a feeling
you're gonna be back.

464
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,470
And I don't like looking
over my shoulder.

465
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,594
Need I remind you, Barbara.
You've already tried

466
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,795
using that knife.

467
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,678
And also. you're outnumbered.

468
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Hmm.

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,910

working out for you, huh?

with the, uh, science stuff.

642
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,039
And there are others on their way.

643
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,714
This is our city.
You're going to need our help.

644
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,869
Speaking of, there's something
I need you to do.

645
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,273
(GRUNTING)

646
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,315
Where's Jeremiah?

647
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,549
I don't know!

648
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,639
You see him, you tell him
I'm looking for him.

649
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Bruce.

650
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,038
You're not supposed to be here.

651
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,309
Neither are you.

652
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,758
There's a dozen cops downstairs.

653
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,512
You stayed to fight for the city.

654
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,395
The gangs are carving up territory.
We're gonna have to go

655
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,629
block by block.

656
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,075
I have no idea what we're gonna find.

657
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,477
A thing like this brings out
whatever's lurking in the shadows.

658
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,360
(SQUEAKING)

659
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,995
(SCREAMING)

660
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,155
The light.

661
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,554
You're basically daring whatever
is out there to come after you.

662
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,554
Let them come.

663
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,597
There are still good people
out there.

664
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,157
They need to know we're here,
willing to fight.

665
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,073
I remember the night we met.

666
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,797
You told me the world may seem dark.

667
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,080
But there is light.

668
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
