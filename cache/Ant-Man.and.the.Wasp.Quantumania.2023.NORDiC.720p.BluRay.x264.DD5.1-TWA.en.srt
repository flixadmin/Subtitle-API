1
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,755
What is this place?

2
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:54,441
My life doesn't really make sense.

3
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:55,651
Hey.

4
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:58,570
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

5
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:02,908
"Scott, you're a divorced ex-con.
How are you an Avenger?"

6
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,010
"Why are you time traveling
with Captain America?"

7
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:06,495
"That doesn't make sense."

8
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:09,957
A lot has changed about my life.

9
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:12,626
But everywhere I go,
people ask me the same thing.

10
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:14,294
Can you take a picture with my dog?

11
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,505
"Scott, what about now?"

12
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:17,715
"What's next?"

13
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,383
"Where does the ride take you?"

14
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:22,261
If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.

15
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:23,470
All right.

16
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,707
It's been a crazy few years.
For everyone.

17
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:27,933
Hey, hi. How are you?

18
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,560
Everything is ready for you.

19
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:30,769
You're too much.

20
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:32,271
No, no, no.

21
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:33,522
Your money's no good here.

22
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,108
- Are we still talking about that?
- Yes, of course.

23
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,527
Rubin, you are the best.

24
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,321
Thank you, Spider-Man.

25
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:45,951
So, let's make time for the stuff
that really matters.

26
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:47,411
Like friends.

27
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:50,122
Friends you didn't even know you had.

28
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,251
Remember the people who got you here.

29
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:56,045
You couldn't have done it without them.

30
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:59,631
Hey, I'm just a guy who got fired
from Baskin-Robbins.

31
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,301
Sometimes you just get lucky.

32
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:04,428
I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.

33
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,888
I think you know who she is.

34
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:09,183
She's taken back her dad's company.

35
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:12,061
Now she's using the Pym Particle
for global change.

36
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:15,522
A lot of people say they want
to save the world...

37
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,524
but Hope, she saves it every day.

38
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,692
Thank you.

39
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,445
Thank you so much.

40
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,491
Reforestation. Affordable housing.
Food production.

41
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:27,326
She's not wasting a second.

42
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:35,542
I still can't believe it.

43
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:38,003
None of this should have happened.

44
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,213
But it did.

45
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,841
It's a pretty good world.

46
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,718
I'm glad we saved it.

47
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,513
"Do I miss the action?"

48
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:49,848
"Sometimes."

49
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,392
"Will I be there when
the Avengers need me?"

50
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:53,560
"Absolutely."

51
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,479
"I'd never turn my back on them."

52
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:59,483
"But right now, the only job I want
is being a dad."

53
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:01,985
"I love you, Cassie."

54
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,696
"Thanks for being my hero."

55
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,325
"And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays."

56
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:12,246
"And for the rest of you kids out there..."

57
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:13,539
"word of advice."

58
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,083
"Look out for the little guy."

59
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,543
"Make mistakes."

60
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:19,711
"Take chances."

61
00:05:20,504 --> 00:05:22,756
"Because if there's one thing
life's taught me..."

62
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,426
"there's always room to grow."

63
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,268
Sorry, that's me.

64
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,437
Why is jail calling?

65
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,023
Lang!

66
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,818
- Lang!
- I'm here.

67
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:44,486
All right, come on. Let's go.

68
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:47,573
Come on.

69
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:53,954
Hey. Is she okay? Have you heard anything?

70
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,164
Not yet. No.

71
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:57,624
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

72
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:59,543
Cassie. What happened?

73
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,752
Sign here.

74
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:03,672
You know, just jail stuff.

75
00:06:04,506 --> 00:06:05,549
Give it back.

76
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,010
I know it was you.

77
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:09,136
Are you sure?

78
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:10,571
I mean, it was kind of hard to see...

79
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:13,657
through all that tear gas you fired
into the park full of peaceful protestors.

80
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:14,474
Where is it?

81
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,768
I'm sorry.
This must be really embarrassing for you.

82
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:21,857
I did find this though.

83
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,655
You shrank a cop car?

84
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:29,948
What were you thinking?

85
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,992
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

86
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:34,094
They were clearing out a homeless camp
in the middle of the night.

87
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,971
- No, I'm not saying that...
- And where do they expect them to go?

88
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,056
It's not their fault that they lost
their homes in the Blip.

89
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:38,916
I know that.

90
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:42,144
No one can even afford rent right now,
unless you're some trust-fund asshole.

91
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,462
I'm not telling you what to do.

92
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,897
- I'm just saying...
- Telling her what to do.

93
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,215
Telling me exactly what to do.

94
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:47,883
No, you do what you want.

95
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,635
I'm suggesting another way to do it.

96
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,053
Okay.

97
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,512
You know, I promised your mom...

98
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:55,140
that you would only use this stuff
when one of us was around.

99
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:56,391
It's really dangerous tech.

100
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:57,726
I know it's dangerous.

101
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:00,187
What if the cops took it from you?
What if you lost it?

102
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,396
I didn't lose the suit.

103
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:02,356
You have a suit?

104
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:03,732
Wait, you have a suit?

105
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,459
I know how to
take care of myself, okay?

106
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,277
Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

107
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,613
Ouch.

108
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:13,717
- I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
- I know.

109
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,035
That's okay. It's all right.

110
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,286
I get it.

111
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,997
I just think you should get
to have a normal life.

112
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:20,916
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee...

113
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,960
tried to kill me in my room when I was six.

114
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,671
I've never had a normal life.

115
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:28,423
How about some music?

116
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:31,051
"And in that moment,
all I could think was..."

117
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,595
"'How did the Hulk turn me into a baby?"

118
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,597
"'Will I be a baby forever?"

119
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,974
"'Am I the Hulk's baby?'"

120
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,850
Dad, are you listening to your own book?

121
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:41,353
- "But I was ready for anything.
- Hmm? No, that's...

122
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,246
- It's just the radio.
- "Steve and I grew close over that."

123
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:44,731
- Dad, turn it off.
- It's so weird.

124
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,875
Something's wrong with this switch.
It won't turn off.

125
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,943
I said turn it off.

126
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:49,544
What's that? Turn it up? All right.

127
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,072
"A little after that,
a raccoon from space showed up."

128
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:53,865
"I don't think he knew my name."

129
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:56,368
"I was just happy to meet a raccoon
who could talk."

130
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,123
Excuse me.

131
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,332
Thank you.

132
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,252
All right.

133
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:08,422
Your Nobel Prize is in the mail.

134
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,133
It better be. I just saved eight bucks.

135
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:13,260
God, I admire you.

136
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:14,678
Thank you.

137
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,431
I missed this.

138
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,308
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

139
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,394
No. No anything.

140
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:24,855
You know, Mom, you can talk about it.

141
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:26,398
If you want.

142
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:29,568
Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.

143
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:33,155
I wanna live right now.

144
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:40,412
So, Cassie, did you make any new friends
in the slammer this time?

145
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,705
Grandpa.

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,123
"This time"?

147
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:44,791
Was there a last time?

148
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,835
I mean, last time barely counts.

149
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,004
I didn't know that.

150
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:50,005
Why didn't you call me?

151
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,506
'Cause I knew you'd be like this.

152
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,383
I would've just broken you out with ants.

153
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:55,068
All right, you know what? Family meeting.

154
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:56,236
Can we have a family meeting?

155
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:57,404
Isn't that what we're doing?

156
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:58,472
Yeah, I mean about this.

157
00:08:58,555 --> 00:09:00,432
About everybody being so fine with this.

158
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:04,436
Look, you wanna help. I get it.

159
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,063
I do, Cassie. I really do.

160
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,706
But I don't want you wasting your life.

161
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:09,858
At least I'm still trying to
do something with mine.

162
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,029
I literally saved the world.

163
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,030
Oh, did you?

164
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,948
Well, yeah, you never mentioned
that before.

165
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:18,700
Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world.

166
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,035
How was that for you, Scott?

167
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:21,578
You should write a book about it.

168
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,080
Ha ha. Hilarious.

169
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:25,123
Yeah,
you're welcome for all not being dust.

170
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,750
And what do you do now?

171
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:29,878
Sign books?

172
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,006
Aren't you the guy who
broke into VistaCorp?

173
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:34,941
Aren't you the guy who flew all the way
to Germany...

174
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:36,927
just to fight Captain
America at the airport?

175
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:39,221
Fight with Captain America at the airport.

176
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:42,015
Wouldn't fight Captain America.

177
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,225
Not insane.

178
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,435
People still need help, Dad.

179
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:49,272
At least we're trying to do something
that matters.

180
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:53,819
Who's "we"?

181
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,072
What are you three up to?

182
00:09:57,989 --> 00:09:59,032
Science.

183
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,369
With ants.

184
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:04,538
Ant science.

185
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,124
I don't believe you.

186
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,335
Let's just show him.

187
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,882
What are they building?

188
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,092
Are you doing this?

189
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,512
Actually, no, they built their own tech.

190
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,097
Pretty smart ants.

191
00:10:22,264 --> 00:10:24,015
Okay, so when you were all...

192
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:27,185
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

193
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,729
And I started reading Grandpa Hank's
old journals...

194
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,857
and I got really into the Quantum Realm
and...

195
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:33,733
The Quantum Realm?

196
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,279
I know we all have a history there,
and I didn't want to freak anyone out...

197
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:38,421
but we've been talking about it.

198
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:39,865
She had some questions, okay?

199
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,160
I can't help if people are inspired by me.

200
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:48,331
So, you've been studying the Quantum Realm?

201
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,393
Why didn't you ask me about it?

202
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,503
I tried, Mom.

203
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,880
A lot.

204
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:56,673
You never wanted to talk about it.

205
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,091
Cassie's just been curious...

206
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,885
and we gave her some pointers.

207
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,722
This isn't exactly ant science,
is it, Henry?

208
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,892
You know how dangerous
the Quantum Realm is.

209
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:07,893
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

210
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:09,603
Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.

211
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:11,605
That's why we made this.

212
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:15,108
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

213
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,237
But Quantum.

214
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:22,908
We just need a map.

215
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:26,453
And then we can study and explore
the entire Quantum Realm.

216
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:29,372
Never even have to go.

217
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:34,419
Your daughter built a subatomic
Hubble Telescope in a basement.

218
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,925
You know, if I had something like this
when you were gone...

219
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,221
then I could have found you.

220
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:48,767
It's amazing.

221
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:50,936
I'm blown away.

222
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:54,689
How does it work?

223
00:11:54,856 --> 00:11:57,817
It's kinda like that two-way radio
we used to have.

224
00:11:58,193 --> 00:11:59,903
You send a signal down from here...

225
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:02,130
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

226
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,198
Wait. Wait a minute.

227
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:07,118
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

228
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,913
Yeah.

229
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,207
- Shut it down now.
- Janet...

230
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:14,084
- Why would we shut it...
- What's wrong?

231
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,335
You have to turn it off!

232
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,003
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

233
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,800
Janet?

234
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:27,681
There's something I should have told...

235
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:02,841
Dad?

236
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:06,636
No!

237
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,263
- No!
- Mom!

238
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,140
No!

239
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:12,601
Damn it!

240
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:15,729
Dad?

241
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,054
Dad!

242
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,685
Dad!

243
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:21,961
Cassie.

244
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,510
Dad!

245
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,303
Oh, Dad. Come on.

246
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:32,514
Okay.

247
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:33,515
Are you okay?

248
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:34,849
Yeah. I'm okay.

249
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:52,283
Where are we?

250
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:11,469
Mom!

251
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,055
Dad!

252
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,932
Hope. Over here.

253
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:19,644
Are you okay?

254
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:22,063
We should be dead.

255
00:15:23,064 --> 00:15:24,107
Why aren't we?

256
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,358
I don't know.

257
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:28,987
Are we where I think we are?

258
00:15:29,654 --> 00:15:31,322
I would say yes...

259
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:33,783
but it wasn't like this.

260
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,160
Janet!

261
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:36,661
Mom!

262
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:38,788
Janet!

263
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,416
Mom!

264
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,597
Do not move.

265
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,658
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

266
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:17,911
Right now.

267
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:23,833
Hope? Hope?

268
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,919
Hank? Can you hear me?

269
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:29,547
- Can anyone hear me?
- Oh, my God.

270
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,192
- It's okay.
- What are we gonna do?

271
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,093
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

272
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:35,361
We're okay. It's gonna be okay.

273
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:36,613
You're saying "okay" too much.

274
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:38,848
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

275
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:39,891
We're okay.

276
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,142
We are fine.

277
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,561
Hey, we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home.

278
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:45,855
In the meantime, look around.

279
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:47,273
It's beautiful.

280
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:48,650
All right? We're outside.

281
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,528
It's like we're camping. We love camping.

282
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:52,862
We've never been camping.

283
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,698
But we've always talked about it.

284
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,288
Is that sun moving?

285
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:14,300
Get back!

286
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:19,848
Oh, my God.

287
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:22,392
I don't think this is a sun!

288
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:24,310
It's fine.

289
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,437
- Dad!
- Honey, it's okay.

290
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:27,647
Still okay.

291
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:37,907
Dad. Oh, my God.

292
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:39,158
That was weird.

293
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:45,498
Run.

294
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:17,363
There's Quantum people
in the Quantum Realm?

295
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,573
Yeah.

296
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:20,783
I didn't know that either.

297
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,372
What was that back there, Mom?

298
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:28,124
What was that ship looking for?

299
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,959
Keep your voice down.

300
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:32,253
You said there was nothing down here.

301
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,896
Why didn't you tell us about all of this?

302
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:35,690
Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now...

303
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,692
- I just need you to trust me.
- Then make me trust you!

304
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,303
Let's just calm down, all right?
We can talk about this...

305
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,472
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

306
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:44,015
No, you need to tell us what's...

307
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,434
Why didn't you listen?
I told you to stay away from here.

308
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,395
Janet, I'm so sorry.

309
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,815
I should have told you what we were doing.
I had no idea...

310
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:53,983
I know. It's...

311
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:56,319
We'll talk later.

312
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:58,279
Right now, we stick together...

313
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,573
we find Scott and Cassie...

314
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:02,867
and we go home. Okay?

315
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:04,369
- Okay?
- Okay?

316
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:05,536
- Okay.
- Okay.

317
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:06,704
Stay close.

318
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:15,463
This is incredible.

319
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,466
I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.

320
00:19:20,718 --> 00:19:22,011
Why didn't I see any of this?

321
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:24,514
You weren't able to look deep enough.

322
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:27,225
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

323
00:19:28,476 --> 00:19:30,311
There are worlds here...

324
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:32,146
worlds within worlds.

325
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,859
It's a place outside time and space.

326
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:40,822
It's a secret universe...

327
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:42,824
beneath ours.

328
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:05,847
Hey, get your hands off me!

329
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:13,896
Cassie?

330
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:17,608
Where's my daughter?

331
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:20,778
Where is she?

332
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:22,905
Cassie?

333
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,869
Where's my daughter?

334
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,540
Cassie!

335
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:36,169
Dad!

336
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,046
Cassie!

337
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,131
Drink the ooze.

338
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,508
What?

339
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:05,865
I'll handle this.

340
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:21,214
Mom.

341
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:17,145
Was that a good stab?

342
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:19,063
I got us a ride.

343
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:39,417
He's friendly.

344
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:41,419
Quite a ride.

345
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:44,505
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

346
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,673
I like ants.

347
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:48,050
And I love that you love them. Here.

348
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:51,095
These will help us blend in.

349
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,724
Where exactly are we going on this?

350
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:56,767
We're not too far from
an old friend of mine.

351
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,728
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are...

352
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:00,813
it'll be him.

353
00:23:01,689 --> 00:23:02,732
After you.

354
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:05,818
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

355
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:13,284
Let me go! Let me go!

356
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,963
I don't know what you're saying!

357
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:27,965
I don't know what you...

358
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:47,860
No! No!

359
00:23:57,453 --> 00:23:59,080
Drink the ooze!

360
00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:00,581
Drink the ooze!

361
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:02,625
Drink the ooze!

362
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,126
Drink the ooze!

363
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:06,879
Hello.

364
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:07,964
Hi. Hi.

365
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:09,507
Did you drink the ooze?

366
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:12,426
Why can I understand you?

367
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:13,761
Great. That's the ooze.

368
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:15,721
Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!

369
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:20,851
We can finally be friends.

370
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:22,186
Hi. I am Veb.

371
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:23,354
You just drank me.

372
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,689
I did... What?

373
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:26,123
Do you need some more ooze? Here.

374
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:28,209
- I can pour some ooze into your hole...
- No, I'm okay.

375
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,735
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Oh, wow!

376
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,362
A big hole.

377
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,155
How many holes do you have?

378
00:24:33,864 --> 00:24:35,341
I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?

379
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,909
I don't have any holes.

380
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,120
His name is Scott Lang.

381
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,622
He has seven holes.

382
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:47,586
Yeah, that's right.

383
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:49,505
How did you know that?

384
00:24:49,672 --> 00:24:51,674
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

385
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,011
You can read minds?

386
00:24:55,219 --> 00:24:58,306
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

387
00:24:58,472 --> 00:25:01,475
Everyone is disgusting.

388
00:25:03,311 --> 00:25:05,271
- Could you please stop thinking that?
- Sorry.

389
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:07,732
- Please, stop.
- Thinking?

390
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,192
- Thinking that.
- I'm trying.

391
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,571
Well, not very hard.
And I think you look weird too.

392
00:25:13,738 --> 00:25:15,381
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

393
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:16,657
I wish my head glowed.

394
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:18,784
No, no, you don't.

395
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:21,329
I know I don't. I'm nervous, okay?
And it just came out.

396
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:22,538
What are you doing here?

397
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,457
- Are you a spy?
- What? No. No, no.

398
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:25,708
We should torture him.

399
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,709
Guys. No, it's okay.

400
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,587
We're not spies. He's my dad.

401
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:33,132
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

402
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:37,219
Then who is San Francisco?

403
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,013
- It's where we're from.
- It's a place.

404
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:40,139
Then what's Earth?

405
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:41,057
It's also where we're from.

406
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:42,266
We should torture them.

407
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,660
Why are you always trying to
torture people? We have other options.

408
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:47,480
Do things come out of your holes,
like milk, juice...

409
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:50,066
Veb, stop asking about his holes.

410
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:51,275
Some of us have holes.

411
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:52,902
What are you doing here?

412
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:54,779
Where are you from?

413
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,739
- Okay.
- Up there. Up there.

414
00:25:56,864 --> 00:25:59,825
- See, above this, it's a different universe.
- The Earth. Big Earth.

415
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,219
- It's the same universe, but it's bigger.
- This is Earth, but it's a very small Earth.

416
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:04,080
- Sometimes, I guess.
- I get big. I shrink.

417
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,265
- And it's like...
- But I wrote a book about it, actually.

418
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,166
- I don't know.
- This is the Quantum Realm.

419
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,684
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

420
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:10,686
- We shrunk. Right now, we're really small.
- It's bigger where we're from.

421
00:26:10,711 --> 00:26:12,463
- So, we're small right now.
- It's bigger.

422
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:18,219
Okay, they're telling the truth.

423
00:26:18,386 --> 00:26:19,428
It doesn't matter.

424
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,933
You come from above.

425
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,227
Like him.

426
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,314
So, he is hunting you.

427
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,651
He will burn the world to find you.

428
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,569
Who?

429
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:38,447
The Conqueror.

430
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,889
There are beings down here.
Intelligent beings.

431
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:48,017
I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here...

432
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:51,270
a subatomic universe.

433
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:53,939
This changes everything
we know about life...

434
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:56,484
evolution, our place in the galaxy...

435
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:58,360
Holy shit!

436
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,404
That guy looks like broccoli.

437
00:28:09,872 --> 00:28:11,123
Keep your head down.

438
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:04,301
Follow me.

439
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,732
Drink those.

440
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:20,776
I'll be right back.

441
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:36,375
I'm here for Krylar.

442
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,423
It's you.

443
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:43,882
Let's keep that between us.

444
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:46,510
And Krylar.

445
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:47,678
Hello.

446
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,639
I don't know your ways or customs...

447
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:54,310
but I assume that you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?

448
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:55,561
Absolutely, sir.

449
00:29:58,522 --> 00:30:00,983
So, what's your story then?

450
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,402
God.

451
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:06,030
Move.

452
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:07,406
It's time.

453
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:08,949
Follow me.

454
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:16,874
Right this way.

455
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,923
How exactly do you know this guy?

456
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,218
Old freedom fighter friend of mine.

457
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:30,387
Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?

458
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:31,555
Or terrorist.

459
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:33,766
Depends on who you ask.

460
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:37,353
But, trust me, he can help.

461
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:22,022
Janet Van Dyne?

462
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:25,526
I thought you were dead.

463
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,028
Been a long time, Krylar.

464
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:31,448
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

465
00:31:31,615 --> 00:31:33,992
I fought like hell against that.

466
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:36,120
It sounds so elitist.

467
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:40,082
You have got to be Hank.

468
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:44,002
I've heard so much about you and your ants.

469
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,296
What are ants anyway?

470
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:47,798
Do we have 'em down here?

471
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,633
I don't think so. No.

472
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:51,760
That's too bad.

473
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,054
Hope.

474
00:31:54,763 --> 00:31:56,432
You have to be Hope.

475
00:31:56,974 --> 00:31:59,184
She talked about you every day.

476
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,728
That's strange...

477
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,105
she never said anything about you.

478
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:07,651
I don't think I would have told
my kid either.

479
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:10,195
- Wild stuff.
- Funny.

480
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:12,156
How wild?

481
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,451
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

482
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,122
Krylar, we need your help.

483
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:24,209
Janet, after all we've been through,
together...

484
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:25,544
just ask me.

485
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:27,171
Tell me, how can I help?

486
00:32:27,296 --> 00:32:28,589
But...

487
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:31,800
is anyone starving? I'm starving.

488
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,177
Boys...

489
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:34,887
Now.

490
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:44,229
They don't know anything.

491
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,524
About... anything.

492
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:48,776
Then get them out of here.

493
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:51,695
Excuse me.

494
00:32:51,862 --> 00:32:54,031
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

495
00:32:54,198 --> 00:32:55,632
We're just trying to find our family.

496
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:56,784
Do you have a map?

497
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:58,243
All we wanna do is go...

498
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,289
Wait, wait. Don't shoot.

499
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:03,582
They're with us.

500
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:06,835
Is that building alive?

501
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,629
Yours are dead?

502
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:13,175
Look. Excuse me.

503
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,802
We just wanna go home.

504
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:21,099
At least you still have a home.

505
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,359
What happened here?

506
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:33,654
The Conqueror burned our homes.

507
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:36,073
Our stories.

508
00:33:37,032 --> 00:33:40,285
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

509
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,996
Some of us escaped...

510
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,915
found others on the run.

511
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,501
We gathered who we could to fight.

512
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,753
It was never enough.

513
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,297
I'm sorry.

514
00:33:53,215 --> 00:33:54,258
We can help.

515
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:02,182
- Cassie...
- Dad, you're an Avenger.

516
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,350
They need help.

517
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,310
No. What I need to do is get you home.

518
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:06,979
Why don't you wanna help?

519
00:34:07,187 --> 00:34:08,455
We don't know anything about this place.

520
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,374
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

521
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,667
Have we been gone for 10 seconds?

522
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:12,834
Or have we been gone for 10 years?

523
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,152
Think about your mom right now.

524
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:16,505
- Can you imagine what she must be...
- Don't use Mom as an excuse.

525
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,615
- You just don't care.
- No, I do care.

526
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,450
I know you wanna help. I do.

527
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:22,411
But this is not our fight.

528
00:34:22,786 --> 00:34:25,665
Just 'cause it's not happening to you
doesn't mean it's not happening.

529
00:34:26,957 --> 00:34:28,000
Hey.

530
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,296
Would you look at me?

531
00:34:34,548 --> 00:34:36,133
She's disappointed in you.

532
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,676
I got that. Yeah. Thank you.

533
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:38,677
You're welcome.

534
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:39,928
We'll talk about it later.

535
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,763
Right now, let's just find the others.

536
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,224
No one knows this place
better than Janet.

537
00:34:46,602 --> 00:34:47,644
What did you say?

538
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:49,104
What?

539
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:50,439
That name.

540
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:53,150
Janet Van Dyne.

541
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:54,359
Where is she?

542
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:56,486
That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?

543
00:34:56,653 --> 00:34:57,905
I know her.

544
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:00,449
She shouldn't be here.

545
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:04,286
Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please.

546
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,913
Yes, thank you.

547
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:09,207
If you haven't had this, don't try it...

548
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,793
unless you want to change your life.

549
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:26,558
Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.

550
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,810
Two of them.

551
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,354
Human, like us.

552
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,064
Human, that's the word.

553
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:35,400
Totally forgot what you call yourselves
up there.

554
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:36,568
Human.

555
00:35:37,194 --> 00:35:39,196
Are you not human?

556
00:35:39,363 --> 00:35:41,365
Not technically, but yes.

557
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,367
In the ways that matter.

558
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:49,039
No!

559
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:53,835
Let us talk.

560
00:35:56,797 --> 00:36:01,051
So, what is it that brings you to us,
Janet?

561
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:04,930
If I remember correctly, you left.

562
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:08,392
You left all of us.

563
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,310
With him.

564
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,730
Janet, what is he talking about?

565
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:18,568
You didn't tell them about him.

566
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,073
Did you say anything...

567
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:25,242
about what you did here?

568
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:29,746
How many people died because of you?

569
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:37,170
Does your family even know who you are?

570
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,967
Your mommy...

571
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,345
is full of secrets.

572
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,555
You're lying.

573
00:36:46,722 --> 00:36:47,848
I lie.

574
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:50,142
A lot.

575
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:54,563
Not about this.

576
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:57,649
Let them go.

577
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:01,445
He just wants me.

578
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:03,030
But you want them.

579
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:05,949
So they're coming too.

580
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:10,328
Along with those other friends of yours.

581
00:37:11,788 --> 00:37:13,540
I heard about them.

582
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:15,917
But he did too.

583
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:19,337
And he sent the Hunter.

584
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,465
What kind of hunter?

585
00:37:22,716 --> 00:37:24,885
Not a man. Not a machine.

586
00:37:25,052 --> 00:37:28,889
A mechanized organism designed only...

587
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:30,766
for killing.

588
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:34,186
Where are they?

589
00:37:34,436 --> 00:37:35,687
No clue.

590
00:37:36,897 --> 00:37:37,939
Dead.

591
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:41,485
Probably dead.

592
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,001
This is so sad when all of this...

593
00:37:58,168 --> 00:37:59,753
could have been avoided, Janet.

594
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:03,006
Just give him what he wants.

595
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:07,719
What happened to you?

596
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,517
We fought against him.

597
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,521
He can be very persuasive.

598
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,024
Let's pay him a visit.

599
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:26,571
I think we're done here.

600
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:45,882
Can that ship get us out of here?

601
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,219
Cover me?

602
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,512
Always.

603
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:23,503
Henry, take the helm.

604
00:39:24,504 --> 00:39:25,755
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

605
00:39:29,718 --> 00:39:31,428
Where are the controls?

606
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:33,180
Those are the controls.

607
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:37,976
What the hell?

608
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,020
You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.

609
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:44,399
Is the bike alive?

610
00:39:57,913 --> 00:39:59,664
Hands, all the way in!

611
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:01,750
Like stuffing a turkey.

612
00:40:09,716 --> 00:40:11,843
- Really, him?
- He used to be charming.

613
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:12,761
That guy?

614
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:14,721
I was down here for 30 years, Henry.

615
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,640
- I had needs.
- Oh, my God.

616
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:18,600
Look, I get it. I've got needs too.

617
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:19,768
Oh, my God!

618
00:40:19,893 --> 00:40:21,978
I had dinner with someone a few times.

619
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:24,022
Her name was Linda.

620
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:26,024
It didn't work out.

621
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:27,484
What went wrong?

622
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,527
She wasn't you, baby.

623
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,784
- Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving.
- All right.

624
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:37,702
- And, Xolum.
- Right here.

625
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:40,121
Take them as far away from here as you can.

626
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:41,331
- Why?
- What?

627
00:40:41,498 --> 00:40:44,668
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

628
00:40:53,093 --> 00:40:54,886
You led them straight to us.

629
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:56,763
Come on, come on.

630
00:40:57,514 --> 00:40:58,848
Take as many as you can.

631
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:00,183
We'll hold them off.

632
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:24,457
Go!

633
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,502
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

634
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:29,629
We gotta go! We gotta go!

635
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:30,797
Get on. Get on now!

636
00:41:31,006 --> 00:41:32,257
We have to go now. Now!

637
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:51,276
Oh, my God!

638
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:10,295
Cassie, let's go!

639
00:42:17,552 --> 00:42:18,803
Get to the sanctuary.

640
00:42:19,596 --> 00:42:20,680
Wait for my message.

641
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,099
- Veb, we're leaving.
- No. No, wait!

642
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:25,310
- Move! Move!
- All my friends.

643
00:42:47,624 --> 00:42:48,708
Give up the travelers.

644
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,251
The Conqueror will show you mercy.

645
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:51,753
I know his mercy.

646
00:43:05,308 --> 00:43:06,393
Stay here. I'm...

647
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,728
Cassie?

648
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:11,439
Oh, no.

649
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:36,005
Okay. I have a suit.

650
00:43:36,548 --> 00:43:37,924
Yeah, I noticed.

651
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:39,968
- You okay?
- Yes.

652
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,971
Look, momentum, right?

653
00:43:43,138 --> 00:43:45,056
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

654
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:46,307
I know how to do it, Dad.

655
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:47,559
- Do you? Really?
- Yes.

656
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:48,993
'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.

657
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:50,270
I messed up on the timing.

658
00:43:50,437 --> 00:43:51,479
Jump...

659
00:43:56,943 --> 00:43:57,819
Like that.

660
00:43:57,986 --> 00:43:59,612
You see what I did? You see what I did?

661
00:43:59,946 --> 00:44:01,614
No. You're like this small.

662
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:02,991
I jumped and tapped.

663
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,170
Jentorra, we have to go.

664
00:44:36,357 --> 00:44:37,525
Get to the ship!

665
00:45:25,448 --> 00:45:28,159
Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.

666
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:31,496
I've been waiting a long time for this.

667
00:45:32,247 --> 00:45:33,331
What?

668
00:45:34,874 --> 00:45:36,042
Is someone in there?

669
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:38,169
Oh, yes.

670
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:40,922
The destiny you cannot escape.

671
00:45:41,047 --> 00:45:44,175
Our fates have always
been forged together...

672
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,346
ever since that day we met.

673
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,183
Scott Lang.

674
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,434
Get away from us!

675
00:45:53,601 --> 00:45:55,186
The day you broke me.

676
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,233
- Banished me down here.
- Wait.

677
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:03,611
Darren?

678
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,864
Surprised to see me?

679
00:46:08,825 --> 00:46:09,867
Yeah.

680
00:46:09,993 --> 00:46:11,119
It's the bee guy?

681
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:13,329
- It's the bee guy?
- Cassie?

682
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:15,164
I almost didn't recognize you.

683
00:46:16,124 --> 00:46:17,750
How are you not dead?

684
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:19,877
I became the ultimate weapon.

685
00:46:21,087 --> 00:46:23,172
That's what this is?

686
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:25,300
Look, Darren.

687
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,722
Darren is dead!

688
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:34,392
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

689
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,562
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

690
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:38,896
Not from me.

691
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:41,107
And not from him.

692
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,277
He's the future.

693
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:46,195
He's the past.

694
00:46:46,988 --> 00:46:50,241
And now all he needs is you.

695
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:57,665
Mom?

696
00:46:58,082 --> 00:46:59,876
What's after Scott and Cassie?

697
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:03,129
We have to find them.

698
00:47:04,213 --> 00:47:06,007
There's something I have to do first.

699
00:47:06,132 --> 00:47:07,508
They could be dead!

700
00:47:07,675 --> 00:47:09,177
Hope, please.

701
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:11,012
And you're still hiding things from us.

702
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:13,431
I am trying to protect you.

703
00:47:14,057 --> 00:47:15,099
From what?

704
00:47:17,644 --> 00:47:19,520
Who are you so afraid of?

705
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:33,409
Third time in jail?

706
00:47:35,536 --> 00:47:36,579
Four.

707
00:47:45,421 --> 00:47:47,423
And here we are again.

708
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,051
Face to face.

709
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,097
That's a face.

710
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:56,641
It's a big face.

711
00:47:56,849 --> 00:47:58,393
Why are you just a floating head?

712
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,645
Maybe you could walk us through this,
Darren.

713
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:03,731
You left Darren to die
in the Quantum Realm.

714
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:07,402
But the Conqueror found me.

715
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:09,112
Rebuilt me.

716
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:11,280
Made me the ultimate weapon.

717
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,784
A mechanized organism designed
only for...

718
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,035
M.O.D.O.K.?

719
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,331
I get it. It's an acronym.

720
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:21,666
It's an acronym.

721
00:48:21,874 --> 00:48:24,836
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

722
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:27,922
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

723
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:31,509
- I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.
- Just now noticing the baby legs.

724
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,302
They're not baby legs.

725
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:34,804
A little bit like a Björn.

726
00:48:34,971 --> 00:48:36,264
You think you're so smart.

727
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:39,600
Scott Lang,
the man who took everything from me.

728
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,144
Who stole my whole life.

729
00:48:41,436 --> 00:48:42,478
But I did it.

730
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,565
I got you here.

731
00:48:45,773 --> 00:48:47,734
I found your signal, Cassie.

732
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:50,570
Thanks for that, by the way.
Couldn't have done it without you.

733
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,742
You're looking at a man set free.

734
00:48:56,743 --> 00:49:00,455
I've created so much more here
than you could possibly imagine.

735
00:49:01,622 --> 00:49:04,208
All for him.

736
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:10,131
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

737
00:49:13,426 --> 00:49:15,219
What is this place?

738
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:18,347
He said he was a traveler.

739
00:49:18,598 --> 00:49:21,559
A scientist who crashed off course.

740
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,735
He had a ship...

741
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,238
beyond anything I had ever seen.

742
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:38,034
A ship that could travel the Multiverse.

743
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:39,368
The Multiverse?

744
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:42,872
As in alternate dimensions?

745
00:49:43,122 --> 00:49:44,874
Parallel realities?

746
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,709
I didn't believe it at first.

747
00:49:48,878 --> 00:49:49,921
But it's real.

748
00:49:51,714 --> 00:49:53,132
Just like we theorized.

749
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:57,345
Can this take us home?

750
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,723
It can take you anywhere.

751
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:21,828
I'd never met anyone like him.

752
00:50:24,247 --> 00:50:26,332
He felt so...

753
00:50:26,707 --> 00:50:27,792
lost.

754
00:50:29,502 --> 00:50:30,711
I guess we both were.

755
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,089
But we had a way out.

756
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:37,468
We tried everything...

757
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:40,388
to recharge his ship's energy core.

758
00:50:46,018 --> 00:50:47,562
Nothing worked.

759
00:50:49,188 --> 00:50:53,776
But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.

760
00:50:55,111 --> 00:50:56,529
I lied to Hope.

761
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:02,743
I told her I was coming home.

762
00:51:06,873 --> 00:51:08,749
I can see her by the door.

763
00:51:11,252 --> 00:51:12,628
Waiting for me.

764
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,259
That's the last thing I did...

765
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,013
was lie to her.

766
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,894
I just thought I'd have more time.

767
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:34,191
I can give that to you.

768
00:51:36,235 --> 00:51:37,278
Time.

769
00:51:41,157 --> 00:51:42,450
It's not what you think it is.

770
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:48,164
It's a cage.

771
00:51:49,582 --> 00:51:51,375
And it does everything it can...

772
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:53,044
to break you.

773
00:51:56,297 --> 00:51:59,508
It's not until you free yourself from it
that you see...

774
00:52:00,676 --> 00:52:02,178
just how small...

775
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:04,388
it always was.

776
00:52:10,186 --> 00:52:11,979
We're going to get out of here.

777
00:52:15,274 --> 00:52:16,776
She's gonna open the door...

778
00:52:18,361 --> 00:52:19,820
and you'll be there.

779
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:25,576
I promise.

780
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,041
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

781
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:38,047
It took ages, but we did it.

782
00:52:39,674 --> 00:52:42,009
We brought it back to life.

783
00:52:44,178 --> 00:52:45,680
Let's go home.

784
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,103
His ship was neurokinetic.

785
00:52:53,312 --> 00:52:54,689
Connected to his thoughts.

786
00:52:58,609 --> 00:52:59,694
When I touched it...

787
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,572
I saw his mind.

788
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:05,741
I felt...

789
00:53:07,493 --> 00:53:08,869
what he had done.

790
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,458
Entire worlds...

791
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:17,378
entire timelines.

792
00:53:17,503 --> 00:53:21,549
Gone, like they never even existed.

793
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:41,027
Janet?

794
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,949
We can leave.

795
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:50,244
Right now.

796
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,834
Who is Kang?

797
00:54:02,173 --> 00:54:03,549
Who I need to be.

798
00:54:07,887 --> 00:54:09,305
He didn't crash here.

799
00:54:09,764 --> 00:54:11,515
He was exiled here.

800
00:54:12,558 --> 00:54:15,728
Outside space and time.

801
00:54:16,896 --> 00:54:18,564
The only place...

802
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:21,067
that could hold him.

803
00:54:22,193 --> 00:54:23,611
Exiled?

804
00:54:24,278 --> 00:54:25,738
By who?

805
00:54:26,113 --> 00:54:27,156
I don't know.

806
00:54:29,575 --> 00:54:31,410
But they sabotaged his ship.

807
00:54:32,661 --> 00:54:34,497
And trapped him here.

808
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:38,334
And because of me...

809
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,045
he was getting out.

810
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:42,254
Janet?

811
00:54:45,091 --> 00:54:46,425
Stay away.

812
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:53,682
You saved my life.

813
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:00,439
I made a promise.

814
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:08,948
Just let me take you home.

815
00:55:10,783 --> 00:55:11,826
And then?

816
00:55:13,994 --> 00:55:15,746
What are you going to do?

817
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,467
Win.

818
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:50,197
I told you time isn't what you think.

819
00:55:52,324 --> 00:55:53,951
I can make it...

820
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,871
so you never left her.

821
00:55:58,164 --> 00:56:01,417
Hope is going to open the door...

822
00:56:02,835 --> 00:56:04,170
and you'll be there.

823
00:56:05,171 --> 00:56:07,506
And how many worlds will die...

824
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,593
if you get out?

825
00:56:11,886 --> 00:56:13,179
Not yours.

826
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:16,599
She'll never know.

827
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,856
Don't you want to see your daughter again?

828
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,735
I can't let you leave.

829
00:56:30,196 --> 00:56:32,198
Why do you think you can stop me?

830
00:56:50,132 --> 00:56:51,550
Give it to me, Janet.

831
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,136
Give it to me!

832
00:56:54,595 --> 00:56:57,556
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

833
00:56:58,432 --> 00:56:59,475
What did you do?

834
00:57:03,896 --> 00:57:05,481
I'm sorry, Hope.

835
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:08,943
No!

836
00:57:36,178 --> 00:57:37,930
I blew up his core.

837
00:57:38,097 --> 00:57:40,266
Cut him off from time.

838
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:43,644
And trapped us both down here forever.

839
00:57:45,688 --> 00:57:47,606
But I gave him back enough.

840
00:57:47,731 --> 00:57:49,400
Now that he had his suit back...

841
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:52,903
he became what he always was.

842
00:57:53,821 --> 00:57:55,572
A conqueror.

843
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:58,242
He's got weapons and technology...

844
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:02,079
centuries beyond anything we can dream of.

845
00:58:02,955 --> 00:58:06,750
He took his prison and made it his empire.

846
00:58:07,793 --> 00:58:11,046
I spent years fighting him...

847
00:58:11,213 --> 00:58:13,757
running from him, hiding from him.

848
00:58:15,551 --> 00:58:16,885
And then you saved me.

849
00:58:20,222 --> 00:58:21,265
You brought me home.

850
00:58:23,142 --> 00:58:24,184
But I didn't deserve it.

851
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,606
I unleashed a monster on this place...

852
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:31,608
and ran away.

853
00:58:32,026 --> 00:58:35,404
Janet, you couldn't have known.

854
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,575
I'm sorry I never told you.

855
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:42,578
I just wanted to forget.

856
00:58:43,996 --> 00:58:46,373
I just wanted to be your mom again.

857
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:54,757
I'm so sorry you had to go through
all of that alone.

858
00:58:55,674 --> 00:58:58,302
But you are not alone now.

859
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,390
We'll stop him together.

860
00:59:04,433 --> 00:59:05,851
He's after the core.

861
00:59:06,935 --> 00:59:09,396
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

862
00:59:09,605 --> 00:59:12,941
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,
he's got Pym Particles.

863
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:14,943
- And a head start.
- Exactly.

864
00:59:15,069 --> 00:59:16,779
- We gotta get out of here.
- Hope.

865
00:59:17,196 --> 00:59:18,906
He cannot get out.

866
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:41,929
You're an interesting man...

867
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,017
Scott Lang.

868
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:49,853
I don't know who you are...

869
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:52,815
but you've made a big mistake.

870
00:59:53,482 --> 00:59:54,525
Okay?

871
00:59:55,484 --> 00:59:56,944
I'm an Avenger.

872
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,196
I've called the other Avengers...

873
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:00,906
You're an Avenger?

874
01:00:03,158 --> 01:00:05,077
Have I killed you before?

875
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,079
What?

876
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:09,832
They all blur together after a while.

877
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:13,710
You're not the one with the hammer?

878
01:00:13,836 --> 01:00:15,170
No, that's Thor.

879
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:18,173
We get confused a lot.

880
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:20,509
Similar body types.
Who are you?

881
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:24,012
Just a man...

882
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:26,765
who's lost a lot of time.

883
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:28,016
Like you.

884
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,396
But we can help each other with that.

885
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:36,400
M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.

886
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:38,861
Yeah, he stole something from me.

887
01:00:40,529 --> 01:00:42,865
Do not speak when I am in the room.

888
01:00:50,873 --> 01:00:53,250
Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

889
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:55,294
You know Janet too?

890
01:00:56,587 --> 01:00:58,839
Does everyone down here know Janet?

891
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,717
She didn't tell you about me?

892
01:01:06,305 --> 01:01:07,931
I guess that's not a surprise.

893
01:01:10,601 --> 01:01:12,728
Janet stole something from me.

894
01:01:13,604 --> 01:01:16,190
My ticket out of here.

895
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:21,904
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

896
01:01:22,237 --> 01:01:23,822
And why would I do that?

897
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:26,408
Because you want to get out of here.

898
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:31,205
And I need to get out of here.

899
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,375
Because I know how it ends.

900
01:01:35,834 --> 01:01:37,211
How what ends?

901
01:01:40,547 --> 01:01:41,965
All of it.

902
01:01:45,344 --> 01:01:48,472
I don't live in a straight line.

903
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:52,809
And with time...

904
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:54,895
it's hard...

905
01:01:55,354 --> 01:01:57,022
not to skip to the end.

906
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,984
So, if you want to stop what's coming...

907
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,029
and trust me...

908
01:02:04,196 --> 01:02:05,447
you do...

909
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:09,952
I am the only shot you have.

910
01:02:10,577 --> 01:02:11,787
What's coming?

911
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:15,040
Me.

912
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:19,419
A lot of me.

913
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:27,427
They exiled me, down here.

914
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:32,307
They're afraid of me.

915
01:02:38,313 --> 01:02:41,483
But I'm the man who can get you home.

916
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:53,370
So, do we have a deal?

917
01:02:56,832 --> 01:02:58,709
No, I don't think we do.

918
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:09,011
Dad!

919
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,513
Let me make this easy for you.

920
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,390
You will bring me what I need...

921
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:15,892
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you...

922
01:03:16,018 --> 01:03:18,061
then make you relive that moment...

923
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:21,523
over and over again in time, endlessly...

924
01:03:21,732 --> 01:03:24,192
until you beg me to kill you.

925
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:26,903
Do we understand?

926
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:31,617
Don't do this.

927
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:37,664
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

928
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:41,960
Dad.

929
01:03:43,045 --> 01:03:44,087
Don't listen to him.

930
01:03:46,882 --> 01:03:47,633
No! No!

931
01:03:47,883 --> 01:03:49,092
Look, we can talk about this.

932
01:03:49,301 --> 01:03:50,427
Don't do it!

933
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:52,095
You really should do it.

934
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:53,305
Please.

935
01:03:55,015 --> 01:03:57,142
That's my daughter, please.

936
01:03:57,309 --> 01:03:59,728
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

937
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:00,979
Please!

938
01:04:01,063 --> 01:04:02,356
You think I'm lying?

939
01:04:03,482 --> 01:04:05,150
Do I look like a liar to you?

940
01:04:06,985 --> 01:04:08,028
Stop!

941
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:09,613
- Dad!
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

942
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,281
I'll do it. Just let her go.

943
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:13,075
Let her go. Let her go!

944
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,170
You're out of your league.

945
01:04:27,214 --> 01:04:28,256
Ant-Man.

946
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:36,264
Just be glad I need you.

947
01:04:49,569 --> 01:04:52,989
Don't touch her again.

948
01:04:53,448 --> 01:04:55,033
Then give me what I need.

949
01:04:56,785 --> 01:04:58,078
Where is it?

950
01:05:39,578 --> 01:05:40,996
What is that?

951
01:05:41,163 --> 01:05:43,540
It was a multiversal engine core.

952
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:48,670
A power source that can take you anywhere
in space and time.

953
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,048
Then Janet blew it up.

954
01:05:56,344 --> 01:05:57,637
It's in that?

955
01:05:57,804 --> 01:05:59,681
It is that.

956
01:05:59,848 --> 01:06:01,892
And we have to get to the center.

957
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:04,186
That's good to know.

958
01:06:06,021 --> 01:06:09,191
You'll have to shrink down and
pass through the eye of the storm.

959
01:06:09,357 --> 01:06:12,068
Once you're inside, find the core...

960
01:06:12,194 --> 01:06:13,904
and size it back down.

961
01:06:14,112 --> 01:06:15,489
What does it look like?

962
01:06:15,655 --> 01:06:17,991
When I steal something,
I usually know what I'm stealing.

963
01:06:18,116 --> 01:06:19,659
You'll know it when you see it.

964
01:06:19,826 --> 01:06:22,204
Get in and out as fast as you can.

965
01:06:22,329 --> 01:06:25,624
The longer you're in there,
the more your mind will come undone.

966
01:06:28,543 --> 01:06:29,586
Better hurry.

967
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:31,797
Dad!

968
01:06:34,216 --> 01:06:35,509
I'm sorry.

969
01:06:36,051 --> 01:06:37,511
This is all my fault.

970
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:40,847
Hey, hey, hey.

971
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:42,307
No.

972
01:06:43,809 --> 01:06:45,101
I messed up.

973
01:06:45,685 --> 01:06:46,728
Cassie.

974
01:06:47,521 --> 01:06:49,689
My whole life happened because I messed up.

975
01:06:51,233 --> 01:06:53,819
The only thing I didn't mess up is you.

976
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:58,198
Dad!

977
01:06:58,907 --> 01:06:59,950
It's okay.

978
01:07:00,075 --> 01:07:01,159
It's okay.

979
01:07:03,912 --> 01:07:05,330
I love you, Peanut.

980
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,416
I love you too.

981
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,212
Okay. I'm in.

982
01:07:57,424 --> 01:07:59,467
Darren, can you hear me?

983
01:07:59,593 --> 01:08:00,635
Darren?

984
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,762
Darren?

985
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:06,975
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

986
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:08,268
What?

987
01:08:08,643 --> 01:08:10,228
- I'm in.
- Okay.

988
01:08:10,729 --> 01:08:13,440
Okay, so what do I do? What's the plan?

989
01:08:14,983 --> 01:08:16,192
Don't die?

990
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,738
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

991
01:08:19,946 --> 01:08:21,156
Do you see it?

992
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:23,700
Yeah. I see it.

993
01:08:28,914 --> 01:08:30,373
I'm heading in.

994
01:08:33,752 --> 01:08:34,794
What the hell?

995
01:08:34,836 --> 01:08:35,712
What the hell?

996
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:36,713
What the hell?

997
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,549
I told you, Scott.
Getting in was just the beginning.

998
01:08:39,758 --> 01:08:40,884
You never said that.

999
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:42,344
Why am I looking at another me?

1000
01:08:42,427 --> 01:08:44,012
I'm not another me. You're another me.

1001
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,263
You just came out...

1002
01:08:45,305 --> 01:08:46,848
Why am I looking at another me?

1003
01:08:47,057 --> 01:08:50,268
You're looking at the possibility
of another you.

1004
01:08:50,393 --> 01:08:52,187
You're in a Probability Storm.

1005
01:08:52,354 --> 01:08:54,439
What does any of that mean?

1006
01:08:54,606 --> 01:08:56,274
- You don't know?
- Why would I know?

1007
01:08:56,441 --> 01:08:57,500
Because you got me in here.

1008
01:08:57,525 --> 01:08:58,735
So, I am the real one, huh?

1009
01:08:58,902 --> 01:08:59,945
No. I didn't say that.

1010
01:09:01,363 --> 01:09:02,697
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1011
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:03,840
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1012
01:09:03,865 --> 01:09:05,050
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- What the hell?

1013
01:09:05,075 --> 01:09:06,117
What the hell?

1014
01:09:07,285 --> 01:09:08,328
What is this place?

1015
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:10,413
It's a Probability Storm.

1016
01:09:10,956 --> 01:09:13,458
Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.

1017
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:15,085
What is he saying? What's he saying?

1018
01:09:15,418 --> 01:09:17,629
- What's he saying?
- You're inside Schrödinger's box.

1019
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:18,797
And you're the cat.

1020
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:20,565
- That doesn't make sense.
- Oh, I get it.

1021
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,300
Nobody move! All right? Nobody move!

1022
01:09:22,467 --> 01:09:24,736
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

1023
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:25,929
- What the hell?
- Am I real?

1024
01:09:25,971 --> 01:09:26,846
- Am I real?
- Am I real?

1025
01:09:27,013 --> 01:09:28,406
- I am the real one!
- What the hell?

1026
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:30,392
What the hell. I'm the real one.

1027
01:09:30,517 --> 01:09:32,060
Guys. Hey, relax.

1028
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,895
Take it easy. Breathe.

1029
01:09:34,062 --> 01:09:36,147
We'll figure this out. Together.

1030
01:09:36,356 --> 01:09:37,399
Who are you?

1031
01:09:37,482 --> 01:09:38,817
Why are you dressed like that?

1032
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:41,361
Because I work at Baskin-Robbins.

1033
01:09:41,486 --> 01:09:43,279
This is my uniform.

1034
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:44,698
These are normal clothes.

1035
01:09:44,823 --> 01:09:46,116
Why are you dressed like that?

1036
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:47,784
- Do you have ice cream?
- Enough!

1037
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:48,994
Let's do this!

1038
01:09:57,168 --> 01:09:58,628
Oh, we're all gonna die.

1039
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:02,090
Wait.

1040
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:03,842
Wait. Wait!

1041
01:10:04,009 --> 01:10:05,093
No! No!

1042
01:10:05,677 --> 01:10:07,762
No! Wait! No!

1043
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:09,264
I've got a read on Scott.

1044
01:10:24,863 --> 01:10:25,905
Out of the way!

1045
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:28,116
- Mom! What is this?
- What are you doing?

1046
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,243
Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.

1047
01:10:31,369 --> 01:10:32,620
They're not you.

1048
01:10:32,912 --> 01:10:34,873
Scott, where are you?

1049
01:10:39,127 --> 01:10:40,170
Why am I here?

1050
01:10:41,129 --> 01:10:43,006
Don't worry. It'll work this time.

1051
01:10:43,173 --> 01:10:44,966
What are you... Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

1052
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:47,594
- Stop! No!
- I got this, guys.

1053
01:10:52,974 --> 01:10:54,976
I got this!
I got it!

1054
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:00,648
Scott, where are you?

1055
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:02,233
Scott!

1056
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:07,280
Where are you, Scott?

1057
01:11:08,573 --> 01:11:10,450
- I can't breathe.
- Ow, that's my neck.

1058
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:13,161
Stop kicking me!

1059
01:11:15,789 --> 01:11:17,457
- My back!
- We're all gonna die!

1060
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:19,626
Dad.

1061
01:11:22,462 --> 01:11:23,671
Come back.

1062
01:11:24,464 --> 01:11:25,590
Dad...

1063
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:27,801
if you can hear me...

1064
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,887
come back.
Just come back.

1065
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,473
- Don't give up.
- Come on.

1066
01:11:34,349 --> 01:11:36,267
- Dad, just come back one more time.
- Come on.

1067
01:11:36,434 --> 01:11:38,019
- She needs us.
- Please.

1068
01:11:38,186 --> 01:11:39,729
- Yes, come on.
- Come back.

1069
01:11:39,813 --> 01:11:41,773
She needs us.
Let's do it together.

1070
01:11:41,856 --> 01:11:43,983
- Get him up! Get him up!
- Grab him! Grab him!

1071
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:45,360
Let's go.

1072
01:11:46,194 --> 01:11:48,196
- Come on, lift him!
- Yes!

1073
01:11:48,446 --> 01:11:50,615
- I got ya, I got ya! Go.
- Come on. That's it.

1074
01:11:50,782 --> 01:11:52,742
- Come on!
- Give him a boost! Give him a boost!

1075
01:11:54,828 --> 01:11:57,330
Come on, we're doing it for Cassie!
Fellas, let's go!

1076
01:11:57,497 --> 01:11:59,207
Everyone together!

1077
01:11:59,374 --> 01:12:00,416
What are you doing?

1078
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:02,669
How are you able to do that?

1079
01:12:02,836 --> 01:12:03,878
I'll tell you how.

1080
01:12:05,505 --> 01:12:07,090
We all want the same thing.

1081
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:10,760
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1082
01:12:19,394 --> 01:12:20,770
Go get her, pal.

1083
01:12:26,151 --> 01:12:27,652
Everyone, let's go!

1084
01:12:30,029 --> 01:12:31,322
Come on!

1085
01:12:39,247 --> 01:12:40,290
Come on, closer.

1086
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,291
Get him higher!

1087
01:12:41,499 --> 01:12:43,126
Hang on, guys, hang on.

1088
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,004
Careful. Steady, steady.

1089
01:12:49,048 --> 01:12:50,800
Steady. That's it.

1090
01:12:51,009 --> 01:12:52,051
Let's go.

1091
01:12:58,433 --> 01:12:59,475
What?

1092
01:13:02,937 --> 01:13:04,606
- Oh no.
- What happened? Did it work?

1093
01:13:04,731 --> 01:13:06,441
Sorry, buddy!

1094
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:08,318
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

1095
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,496
Hope, are you real?

1096
01:13:20,955 --> 01:13:22,290
I'm real.

1097
01:13:22,874 --> 01:13:23,917
Then let's do this.

1098
01:13:28,922 --> 01:13:30,173
You ready?

1099
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:31,382
Ready.

1100
01:14:17,387 --> 01:14:18,471
Come on.

1101
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,864
We gotta get that thing out of here.

1102
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:20,723
No, no, no. Wait.

1103
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:21,975
He's got Cassie.

1104
01:14:22,517 --> 01:14:23,768
- What?
- Scott.

1105
01:14:24,269 --> 01:14:26,354
- Janet.
- Give that to me.

1106
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:27,397
- We have to go now.
- No.

1107
01:14:27,605 --> 01:14:28,773
He's got Cassie.

1108
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:31,651
We will save her. I promise you
we will save her...

1109
01:14:33,152 --> 01:14:34,988
but you cannot give that to him.

1110
01:14:35,446 --> 01:14:36,698
I wouldn't trust her.

1111
01:14:40,618 --> 01:14:42,328
Janet has a way of...

1112
01:14:45,415 --> 01:14:46,874
changing her mind.

1113
01:14:53,715 --> 01:14:56,217
Hello, Jellybean.

1114
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,474
So...

1115
01:15:07,228 --> 01:15:08,896
what's it gonna be, Scott?

1116
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:14,736
Well, well.

1117
01:15:15,903 --> 01:15:18,740
If it isn't my old mentor.

1118
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:24,329
Hi, Hank.

1119
01:15:27,749 --> 01:15:28,791
Darren?

1120
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:31,794
Didn't expect to see
your protégé again after all...

1121
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:33,713
Holy shit, Darren.

1122
01:15:34,672 --> 01:15:35,965
What happened to you?

1123
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:38,593
I'm the ultimate weapon!

1124
01:15:49,187 --> 01:15:50,813
Do I need to take it?

1125
01:15:51,272 --> 01:15:52,482
Where is my daughter?

1126
01:15:54,609 --> 01:15:55,651
Scott.

1127
01:15:56,903 --> 01:15:57,945
Don't.

1128
01:15:58,821 --> 01:16:01,032
We had a deal.

1129
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,034
She'll be fine without you.

1130
01:16:28,518 --> 01:16:30,186
So long, Hank.

1131
01:16:37,735 --> 01:16:38,778
Henry.

1132
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:48,162
You left me right here to die.

1133
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:53,835
Let's see how they do.

1134
01:17:54,645 --> 01:17:56,063
What did you see?

1135
01:18:04,906 --> 01:18:08,201
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1136
01:18:10,203 --> 01:18:11,329
But I always wondered.

1137
01:18:15,082 --> 01:18:17,001
When you touched my mind...

1138
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:30,223
what did you see?

1139
01:18:31,057 --> 01:18:32,308
A monster...

1140
01:18:33,768 --> 01:18:35,228
who thinks he's a god.

1141
01:18:35,603 --> 01:18:38,022
When you can see time the way I do...

1142
01:18:38,231 --> 01:18:40,107
you don't get to close your eyes.

1143
01:18:40,316 --> 01:18:42,985
And you're the only one who sees?

1144
01:18:43,152 --> 01:18:47,949
I am the only one that can see it's broken.

1145
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:49,325
And who broke it?

1146
01:18:51,911 --> 01:18:53,037
I did.

1147
01:18:54,247 --> 01:18:57,250
Every version of me.

1148
01:18:58,417 --> 01:18:59,877
My variants.

1149
01:19:00,586 --> 01:19:01,963
Throughout the Multiverse.

1150
01:19:04,257 --> 01:19:07,468
Playing with time, like children.

1151
01:19:09,887 --> 01:19:12,932
But I saw how it ends.

1152
01:19:14,141 --> 01:19:16,185
I saw their chaos...

1153
01:19:17,019 --> 01:19:19,981
spreading across realities.

1154
01:19:21,107 --> 01:19:23,359
Universes colliding.

1155
01:19:24,819 --> 01:19:26,028
Endless incursions.

1156
01:19:27,405 --> 01:19:29,365
I saw the Multiverse.

1157
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:31,951
And it was dying.

1158
01:19:33,661 --> 01:19:34,996
All because of them.

1159
01:19:36,455 --> 01:19:38,291
So, I took control.

1160
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,918
You mean you started a war.

1161
01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:45,006
And now you wanna wipe away
any universe that's a threat to you.

1162
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:47,675
That's what monsters do.

1163
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,678
That's what conquerors do.

1164
01:19:51,095 --> 01:19:53,973
They burn the broken world.

1165
01:19:54,974 --> 01:19:57,768
And they make a new one.

1166
01:19:57,935 --> 01:20:00,855
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

1167
01:20:02,982 --> 01:20:05,234
You only want revenge
because they beat you.

1168
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:07,236
Because you lost.

1169
01:20:07,486 --> 01:20:09,363
I have lost.

1170
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:15,161
You have no idea what I have lost.

1171
01:20:16,704 --> 01:20:20,583
And I will burn them out of time...

1172
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,126
for what they've done to me.

1173
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:27,089
You'll be wiping out entire timelines.

1174
01:20:27,798 --> 01:20:30,968
Murdering trillions of people.

1175
01:20:32,345 --> 01:20:34,847
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1176
01:20:56,786 --> 01:20:58,287
Oh, God. What am I doing?

1177
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:10,216
What?

1178
01:21:14,428 --> 01:21:15,471
Hank!

1179
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:20,351
Are these your ants?

1180
01:21:21,102 --> 01:21:22,144
From the ant farm?

1181
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:24,188
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1182
01:21:24,522 --> 01:21:25,981
How did you find them down here?

1183
01:21:27,566 --> 01:21:30,111
I've been picking up strange signals
ever since we crashed.

1184
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:34,949
First I thought maybe it was a malfunction.

1185
01:21:35,116 --> 01:21:36,701
Some kind of interference.

1186
01:21:36,867 --> 01:21:38,744
What is that?

1187
01:21:38,953 --> 01:21:40,079
But it wasn't.

1188
01:21:41,372 --> 01:21:42,581
It was the ants.

1189
01:21:44,542 --> 01:21:47,420
They were reaching out the whole time.

1190
01:21:48,921 --> 01:21:52,383
Apparently, they passed through
some sort of time dilation.

1191
01:21:52,967 --> 01:21:55,761
They've lived thousands of years
in a single day...

1192
01:21:56,345 --> 01:21:59,306
expanding their knowledge,
their science...

1193
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,476
becoming more advanced
than I could have ever thought.

1194
01:22:02,852 --> 01:22:04,228
I didn't find them.

1195
01:22:05,146 --> 01:22:06,355
They found me.

1196
01:22:08,441 --> 01:22:10,151
I told you they were smart.

1197
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:17,575
They've already built something
of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.

1198
01:22:17,825 --> 01:22:20,745
I mean,
I know socialism is a charged word...

1199
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:23,789
- but we could learn a lot from these...
- Dad.

1200
01:22:24,874 --> 01:22:26,167
Yeah, they're my ants.

1201
01:22:26,917 --> 01:22:28,919
And ants don't give up.

1202
01:22:29,128 --> 01:22:30,337
I don't care who this guy is.

1203
01:22:30,463 --> 01:22:31,672
I don't care what he can do.

1204
01:22:31,881 --> 01:22:32,923
I'm getting Cassie.

1205
01:22:33,257 --> 01:22:35,468
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

1206
01:22:38,596 --> 01:22:40,097
We've got some ideas.

1207
01:22:40,222 --> 01:22:41,265
What are you thinking?

1208
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:44,393
Well, as a great writer once said...

1209
01:22:45,352 --> 01:22:47,605
"There's always room to grow."

1210
01:22:49,982 --> 01:22:51,066
You read my book?

1211
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:55,196
Every goddamn word.

1212
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,200
Come on. Let's go to work.

1213
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:13,923
Hey! I'm sorry.

1214
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:15,925
That was probably terrifying.

1215
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,343
What are you doing here?

1216
01:23:18,135 --> 01:23:19,220
I'm rescuing you.

1217
01:23:19,595 --> 01:23:20,638
How?

1218
01:23:22,264 --> 01:23:23,808
That's a good question.

1219
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:27,186
Does this thing have like a key?

1220
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:29,313
Or a card? Like a room key?

1221
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,648
Do you know, like a...

1222
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:33,692
Shit!

1223
01:23:41,325 --> 01:23:42,368
Jump and tap.

1224
01:23:51,377 --> 01:23:52,419
Jentorra.

1225
01:23:53,796 --> 01:23:55,631
I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

1226
01:23:57,341 --> 01:23:58,384
How can I help?

1227
01:24:03,514 --> 01:24:04,557
Wow.

1228
01:24:04,723 --> 01:24:05,891
Let's hurt 'em back.

1229
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:08,269
Damn, you're cool.

1230
01:24:09,228 --> 01:24:10,271
Do you have a plan?

1231
01:24:10,312 --> 01:24:11,730
Freeing you was basically my plan.

1232
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:13,774
Do you have a plan?

1233
01:24:13,983 --> 01:24:16,402
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1234
01:24:16,652 --> 01:24:18,504
Then free our people
from the detention cells below...

1235
01:24:18,529 --> 01:24:19,880
and launch a counteroffensive from within.

1236
01:24:19,905 --> 01:24:22,157
Yeah, you have a plan.
So, how do we get a message out?

1237
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:23,367
Follow me.

1238
01:24:23,409 --> 01:24:24,869
Okay. Great.

1239
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:32,167
I built an empire down here, Janet.

1240
01:24:34,587 --> 01:24:36,213
And I'm taking it with me.

1241
01:24:52,313 --> 01:24:55,065
You really should've let me out
when you had the chance.

1242
01:25:04,366 --> 01:25:07,453
History is not written.

1243
01:25:09,455 --> 01:25:10,706
It is forged.

1244
01:25:11,498 --> 01:25:13,375
Today, we ascend.

1245
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:19,214
From this fortress, I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.

1246
01:25:20,674 --> 01:25:24,053
Today we conquer eternity.

1247
01:25:24,845 --> 01:25:27,014
And the dynasty of Kang shall...

1248
01:25:30,935 --> 01:25:32,645
Hello? Is this working?

1249
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,313
Cassie?

1250
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:36,315
I can't tell if this is working.

1251
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:39,151
Okay. I think we're on.

1252
01:25:39,318 --> 01:25:40,878
I'll hold them off. Get the message out.

1253
01:25:40,903 --> 01:25:42,696
I thought you were getting the message out.

1254
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,282
Now!

1255
01:25:46,533 --> 01:25:48,702
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

1256
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:49,954
And I'm with Jentorra.

1257
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:51,455
He's not invincible.

1258
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:59,672
I know it might feel like...

1259
01:25:59,797 --> 01:26:01,215
it's too late...

1260
01:26:02,841 --> 01:26:04,927
like all we do is just lose.

1261
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:07,054
But the family I've lost...

1262
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,306
taught me to keep fighting.

1263
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:11,350
And if they were here, they would too.

1264
01:26:12,226 --> 01:26:14,228
We need to look out for the little guy.

1265
01:26:14,687 --> 01:26:16,146
My dad taught me that.

1266
01:26:16,563 --> 01:26:18,399
'Cause when people needed help...

1267
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:20,734
he didn't look the other way.

1268
01:26:21,318 --> 01:26:22,486
And neither do we.

1269
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:25,823
We need to move!

1270
01:26:25,906 --> 01:26:28,283
Come to the tower! Fight back!

1271
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:30,828
I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.

1272
01:26:30,995 --> 01:26:33,122
He knows he can't take all of us.

1273
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:34,415
Come to the...

1274
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:35,624
Cassie.

1275
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,893
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1276
01:26:37,918 --> 01:26:39,503
- Let's go.
- I'll drive.

1277
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:46,969
Find Lang's daughter.

1278
01:26:50,389 --> 01:26:51,432
Kill her.

1279
01:27:10,492 --> 01:27:11,535
Let's go. Let's go!

1280
01:27:12,077 --> 01:27:13,412
If you want to fight, follow me!

1281
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:19,418
It's over, Cassie.

1282
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:21,503
Free the others. Go!

1283
01:27:29,636 --> 01:27:30,721
He's gonna see us coming.

1284
01:27:30,888 --> 01:27:32,931
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

1285
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:35,017
Begin the launch.

1286
01:28:27,444 --> 01:28:29,196
Your dad's not here, Cassie...

1287
01:28:29,446 --> 01:28:31,406
but I guess that's not a big surprise.

1288
01:28:54,847 --> 01:28:56,014
Kang!

1289
01:28:57,182 --> 01:28:59,059
We had a deal.

1290
01:29:01,186 --> 01:29:03,480
You took my daughter!

1291
01:29:05,899 --> 01:29:07,276
Holy shit.

1292
01:29:07,901 --> 01:29:09,111
That's big.

1293
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:19,538
You lied to me!

1294
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:22,916
Our word is our bond.

1295
01:29:23,709 --> 01:29:26,879
Without that, we're nothing!

1296
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:28,672
Bring him down.

1297
01:29:28,839 --> 01:29:29,882
Yes, sir.

1298
01:29:36,513 --> 01:29:37,806
Keep going. I've got them.

1299
01:29:39,766 --> 01:29:41,059
Yeah, come on!

1300
01:29:55,616 --> 01:29:56,783
There's so many!

1301
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,244
Scott! I can't hold them!

1302
01:30:10,297 --> 01:30:11,340
They came.

1303
01:30:13,133 --> 01:30:15,135
Way to go, Cassie!

1304
01:30:17,554 --> 01:30:18,639
Yes!

1305
01:30:18,972 --> 01:30:21,391
Come on! Let's go!

1306
01:30:26,396 --> 01:30:28,273
Revolution!

1307
01:30:41,453 --> 01:30:43,497
Burn it all down.

1308
01:30:43,664 --> 01:30:44,831
Fight!

1309
01:31:02,099 --> 01:31:03,976
Cover! Get down!

1310
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:14,152
What is the bridge code?

1311
01:31:14,695 --> 01:31:15,779
I'll die first.

1312
01:31:16,446 --> 01:31:17,698
One-eight-one-four-seven.

1313
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:19,116
Damn!

1314
01:31:34,423 --> 01:31:35,590
You'll need this.

1315
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:39,052
Hi.

1316
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:40,762
This is our home!

1317
01:31:41,722 --> 01:31:43,015
Let's take it back!

1318
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:48,645
No!

1319
01:31:55,861 --> 01:31:57,779
I have holes.

1320
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:02,242
I have holes!

1321
01:32:08,874 --> 01:32:10,208
I didn't know he could do that.

1322
01:32:19,968 --> 01:32:21,011
Kang!

1323
01:32:21,553 --> 01:32:22,804
Where is she?

1324
01:32:23,472 --> 01:32:24,765
Launch now!

1325
01:32:35,984 --> 01:32:37,486
What is that?

1326
01:32:37,903 --> 01:32:39,321
He's getting out.

1327
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:40,947
Oh, no, he's not.

1328
01:32:48,622 --> 01:32:50,165
Keep him away from the rings.

1329
01:33:29,371 --> 01:33:30,455
Dad!

1330
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:34,626
Dad, I'm coming!

1331
01:33:46,138 --> 01:33:47,180
Dad!

1332
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,023
Nowhere left to run.

1333
01:34:05,949 --> 01:34:07,075
Please let this work.

1334
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:27,053
Hey, where do you think you're going?

1335
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:28,263
Let's go.

1336
01:34:28,555 --> 01:34:30,307
You think this is over? Come on! Let's go.

1337
01:34:30,474 --> 01:34:32,017
Darren, just stop...

1338
01:34:32,476 --> 01:34:34,853
trying to be whatever this is.

1339
01:34:35,645 --> 01:34:37,105
I don't know what to be.

1340
01:34:39,191 --> 01:34:40,775
Tell me what to be.

1341
01:34:41,026 --> 01:34:43,195
I don't know.
Just don't be a dick.

1342
01:34:43,945 --> 01:34:45,322
It's too late.

1343
01:34:45,947 --> 01:34:47,115
Look at me.

1344
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,243
I'm such a dick.

1345
01:34:50,619 --> 01:34:53,038
It's never too late to stop being a dick.

1346
01:34:58,835 --> 01:34:59,920
We've gotta stop him.

1347
01:35:01,838 --> 01:35:03,131
I have an idea.

1348
01:35:05,926 --> 01:35:06,760
Ready?

1349
01:35:06,927 --> 01:35:08,053
Probably not.

1350
01:35:10,889 --> 01:35:13,308
One, two, three. Now!

1351
01:35:36,331 --> 01:35:37,624
Dad!

1352
01:35:37,999 --> 01:35:39,042
Dad!

1353
01:35:39,751 --> 01:35:40,794
Cassie?

1354
01:35:42,754 --> 01:35:43,630
You're huge.

1355
01:35:43,797 --> 01:35:45,423
I'm huge.

1356
01:35:49,886 --> 01:35:51,388
I love you, Peanut.

1357
01:35:51,596 --> 01:35:52,973
I love you too.

1358
01:35:53,265 --> 01:35:54,933
I'm so proud of you.

1359
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,644
I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla.

1360
01:35:57,894 --> 01:36:00,397
I know. It feels so cool.

1361
01:36:00,689 --> 01:36:02,399
I know, right?

1362
01:36:03,149 --> 01:36:04,276
I'm so hungry.

1363
01:36:04,442 --> 01:36:05,485
Yeah, that happens.

1364
01:36:05,569 --> 01:36:07,779
- I could eat everything.
- Everything. I know.

1365
01:36:08,321 --> 01:36:10,657
- But I really want like a lime.
- Right?

1366
01:36:10,824 --> 01:36:12,867
- Citrus. It's weird. I know.
- Citrus.

1367
01:36:12,993 --> 01:36:14,035
It's...

1368
01:36:24,921 --> 01:36:26,339
Take the tower!

1369
01:36:57,954 --> 01:36:59,164
It's over.

1370
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:03,084
You still can't see it.

1371
01:37:05,086 --> 01:37:08,048
It's never over.

1372
01:38:24,708 --> 01:38:26,459
- We have to go, right now.
- No.

1373
01:38:26,626 --> 01:38:27,669
- Come on.
- No!

1374
01:38:27,794 --> 01:38:29,104
I know, I know, but we have to go.

1375
01:38:29,129 --> 01:38:30,463
- No!
- Come on.

1376
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:21,890
You son of a...

1377
01:39:25,018 --> 01:39:26,519
- Oh, God.
- Scott.

1378
01:39:26,811 --> 01:39:27,854
Come on.

1379
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:35,195
You think this is new to me?

1380
01:39:36,488 --> 01:39:41,242
Do you know how many rebellions
I have put down?

1381
01:39:42,911 --> 01:39:44,412
No, no, no.

1382
01:39:44,537 --> 01:39:48,082
How many worlds I've conquered?

1383
01:39:48,917 --> 01:39:51,169
How many Avengers I've killed?

1384
01:39:51,336 --> 01:39:53,880
And you think you can beat me?

1385
01:39:54,047 --> 01:39:55,673
I am Kang!

1386
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:56,883
You...

1387
01:39:57,801 --> 01:40:00,094
You talk to ants.

1388
01:41:19,883 --> 01:41:22,468
My name is Darren...

1389
01:41:22,594 --> 01:41:27,140
and I am not a dick!

1390
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:49,871
Sorry I'm late.

1391
01:41:52,206 --> 01:41:53,458
Lotta ants.

1392
01:41:54,876 --> 01:41:55,919
Oh, is this you?

1393
01:41:58,004 --> 01:41:59,422
You were right about me, Cassie.

1394
01:42:00,757 --> 01:42:01,799
Darren.

1395
01:42:03,509 --> 01:42:04,552
Are you okay?

1396
01:42:07,347 --> 01:42:08,514
Probably not.

1397
01:42:09,849 --> 01:42:11,559
- Darren?
- Hi, Hope.

1398
01:42:12,518 --> 01:42:13,978
You changed your hair.

1399
01:42:16,731 --> 01:42:18,608
What the hell happened?

1400
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:20,443
Yeah. No...

1401
01:42:20,735 --> 01:42:22,403
It's a whole thing. I'll tell you later.

1402
01:42:22,987 --> 01:42:24,030
That was...

1403
01:42:24,489 --> 01:42:25,949
I don't know what to say.

1404
01:42:26,491 --> 01:42:27,825
Thanks, Scott.

1405
01:42:28,409 --> 01:42:31,621
You always were a brother to me.

1406
01:42:33,748 --> 01:42:34,791
I was?

1407
01:42:42,674 --> 01:42:43,758
I was.

1408
01:42:57,855 --> 01:42:59,524
And at least I died...

1409
01:43:01,109 --> 01:43:02,652
an Avenger.

1410
01:43:05,863 --> 01:43:06,906
Yeah.

1411
01:43:07,949 --> 01:43:08,992
- You did.
- Yeah.

1412
01:43:09,742 --> 01:43:10,785
You're in.

1413
01:43:27,385 --> 01:43:28,928
A lot has happened today.

1414
01:43:29,762 --> 01:43:30,847
- Henry?
- Janet?

1415
01:43:31,014 --> 01:43:32,890
- Mom, where are you?
- I'm in the tower.

1416
01:43:33,016 --> 01:43:35,018
I think I can give us one shot back.

1417
01:43:35,226 --> 01:43:37,020
But we don't have much time.

1418
01:43:37,228 --> 01:43:38,855
If we wanna go home...

1419
01:43:41,315 --> 01:43:42,692
we have to go now.

1420
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:44,402
We'll finish this.

1421
01:43:46,612 --> 01:43:47,655
Thank you.

1422
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:49,782
Thank you.

1423
01:43:51,701 --> 01:43:53,327
Come on! Let's go!

1424
01:43:53,494 --> 01:43:54,662
All right. Good luck.

1425
01:43:54,996 --> 01:43:56,039
Good luck.
Come on.

1426
01:44:26,778 --> 01:44:27,820
Thanks, buddy.

1427
01:44:30,114 --> 01:44:31,157
You did it.

1428
01:44:34,869 --> 01:44:36,037
Let's go home.

1429
01:44:57,892 --> 01:44:58,935
Where's Scott?

1430
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:00,561
He was right behind me.

1431
01:45:43,646 --> 01:45:45,273
You should've looked the other way.

1432
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:48,109
Yeah, well, never been great at that.

1433
01:45:56,033 --> 01:45:57,577
And you're not getting out.

1434
01:46:08,129 --> 01:46:09,547
I want you to remember.

1435
01:46:11,048 --> 01:46:12,592
You could've gone home.

1436
01:46:27,732 --> 01:46:29,775
You could've seen your daughter again.

1437
01:46:43,581 --> 01:46:44,916
But you thought you could win.

1438
01:46:58,304 --> 01:46:59,805
I don't have to win.

1439
01:47:01,349 --> 01:47:03,267
We both just have to lose.

1440
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:55,695
Dad!

1441
01:48:02,868 --> 01:48:03,911
Where... Where...

1442
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:05,204
Where is she? Is she...

1443
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:06,914
- No, she's okay.
- Where is she?

1444
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:08,416
She's okay. She's okay.

1445
01:48:08,874 --> 01:48:10,476
- Scott, they're all okay. They're all okay.
- She's safe?

1446
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:11,544
You did it.

1447
01:48:11,669 --> 01:48:12,712
You did it.

1448
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:17,967
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- No, no, no.

1449
01:48:18,175 --> 01:48:19,635
No, don't let go. Don't let go.

1450
01:48:20,219 --> 01:48:21,387
Don't let go.

1451
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:22,763
Don't ever let go.

1452
01:48:24,432 --> 01:48:25,766
I got you.

1453
01:48:28,602 --> 01:48:29,770
You came back.

1454
01:48:40,114 --> 01:48:41,407
I love you, Hope.

1455
01:48:44,035 --> 01:48:45,411
I love you, Scott.

1456
01:49:59,276 --> 01:50:00,653
Let's go home.

1457
01:50:03,239 --> 01:50:04,490
Home's good.

1458
01:50:12,915 --> 01:50:14,542
My life doesn't make sense.

1459
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:17,086
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

1460
01:50:17,253 --> 01:50:19,922
"Scott you just saved the Quantum Realm
with your family..."

1461
01:50:20,131 --> 01:50:21,966
"and drank a guy without holes."

1462
01:50:22,174 --> 01:50:24,427
"Why does this kind of stuff keep
happening to you?"

1463
01:50:24,593 --> 01:50:26,053
"That doesn't make any sense."

1464
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:27,596
But you know what?

1465
01:50:27,805 --> 01:50:29,807
Who said life has to make sense?

1466
01:50:34,103 --> 01:50:35,146
Rubin!

1467
01:50:35,229 --> 01:50:36,439
You are the bug!

1468
01:50:37,731 --> 01:50:40,234
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

1469
01:50:40,401 --> 01:50:41,694
You're the bug man.

1470
01:50:41,861 --> 01:50:44,447
You get big and get small
like a big bug!

1471
01:50:45,114 --> 01:50:47,741
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

1472
01:50:47,867 --> 01:50:48,909
Twelve dollar.

1473
01:50:50,786 --> 01:50:51,829
Twelve!

1474
01:50:51,912 --> 01:50:54,498
I used to wonder if this
chapter in my life was over...

1475
01:50:54,707 --> 01:50:57,877
but as Cassie reminded me,
"There's always someone you can help."

1476
01:50:58,586 --> 01:51:01,005
Came out of cake making
retirement for you.

1477
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,467
Wow.

1478
01:51:05,176 --> 01:51:06,469
You made this yourself?

1479
01:51:06,594 --> 01:51:09,013
- Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes.
- I know.

1480
01:51:09,221 --> 01:51:11,015
This is the first one I've made since 1997.

1481
01:51:11,182 --> 01:51:12,391
You're a real artist.

1482
01:51:12,558 --> 01:51:14,518
It's been a pretty wild ride.

1483
01:51:14,727 --> 01:51:17,062
One day you're fired from Baskin-Robbins...

1484
01:51:17,229 --> 01:51:20,024
the next you're beating a time-traveling
space king.

1485
01:51:21,108 --> 01:51:23,110
We did beat him, right?

1486
01:51:24,528 --> 01:51:25,921
I mean, yeah, that's what happened.

1487
01:51:25,946 --> 01:51:28,115
He was getting out and he didn't get out.

1488
01:51:29,533 --> 01:51:30,618
I think.

1489
01:51:32,161 --> 01:51:34,747
But he also said
something bad was coming...

1490
01:51:35,164 --> 01:51:38,209
and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.

1491
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:41,003
Wait. So, did I just kill everyone?

1492
01:51:41,795 --> 01:51:43,839
Is everyone gonna die because of me?

1493
01:51:43,964 --> 01:51:45,049
Oh, my God.

1494
01:51:46,175 --> 01:51:47,676
Oh my... What did I do?

1495
01:51:49,929 --> 01:51:51,263
What did I do?

1496
01:51:54,767 --> 01:51:56,852
You know what? It's probably fine.

1497
01:51:57,394 --> 01:51:59,480
Like I said, life doesn't make any sense...

1498
01:51:59,647 --> 01:52:02,775
so maybe stop asking so
many questions, Scott.

1499
01:52:02,942 --> 01:52:04,401
Stop overthinking it.

1500
01:52:06,946 --> 01:52:08,697
Surprise!

1501
01:52:08,906 --> 01:52:12,993
Happy Birthday to you

1502
01:52:14,203 --> 01:52:15,496
It's not my birthday.

1503
01:52:15,663 --> 01:52:18,207
I know. But I missed a few.

1504
01:52:20,584 --> 01:52:22,503
This is good. We're all together.

1505
01:52:22,878 --> 01:52:24,296
You're fine.

1506
01:52:24,463 --> 01:52:27,383
Everything's probably fine.

1507
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:29,885
Kang's gone. You did it.

1508
01:52:30,970 --> 01:52:32,805
Don't have to worry about that guy anymore.

1509
01:52:32,972 --> 01:52:34,014
Thanks.

1510
01:52:37,393 --> 01:52:39,395
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1511
01:55:17,302 --> 01:55:20,889
So, the exiled one is dead.

1512
01:55:23,142 --> 01:55:25,102
You sure he's dead?

1513
01:55:25,728 --> 01:55:28,564
If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you.

1514
01:55:29,231 --> 01:55:32,359
Must really eat you up,
that you're not the one who killed him.

1515
01:55:32,651 --> 01:55:35,362
None of us...

1516
01:55:36,196 --> 01:55:37,865
killed him.

1517
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:41,577
They did.

1518
01:55:42,453 --> 01:55:46,999
They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.

1519
01:55:47,666 --> 01:55:49,126
And if we let them...

1520
01:55:49,585 --> 01:55:51,378
they will take...

1521
01:55:52,838 --> 01:55:54,423
everything...

1522
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:57,384
we've built.

1523
01:55:58,427 --> 01:56:00,971
So let's stop wasting time.

1524
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:05,768
We're late.

1525
01:56:07,811 --> 01:56:10,147
How many did you call?

1526
01:56:10,481 --> 01:56:12,900
All of us.

1527
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:40,764
Time is everything.

1528
02:03:46,019 --> 02:03:49,022
It shapes our lives.

1529
02:03:50,357 --> 02:03:54,277
But, perhaps, we can shape...

1530
02:03:56,071 --> 02:03:57,155
it.

1531
02:03:58,448 --> 02:03:59,574
It's him.

1532
02:03:59,991 --> 02:04:03,286
What? You made him sound
like this terrifying figure.

1533
02:04:04,955 --> 02:04:06,039
He is.
