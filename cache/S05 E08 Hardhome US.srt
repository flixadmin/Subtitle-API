1
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,464
-Your Grace, I want to say--
-You will not speak.

2
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,803
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

3
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,388
If only I were otherwise.

4
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,391
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

5
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,644
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

6
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,521
You want revenge against the Lannisters?

7
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:30,317
I killed my mother, Joanna Lannister,
on the day I was born.

8
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,695
I killed my father, Tywin Lannister,
with a bolt to the heart.

9
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,782
I am the greatest Lannister killer
of our time.

10
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,034
So, I should welcome you into my service

11
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,411
because you murdered members
of your own family?

12
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,248
Into your service?

13
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,543
Your Grace, we have only just met.

14
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,337
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

15
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,508
If you'd rather return
to the fighting pits, just say the word.

16
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,222
When I was a young man,
I heard a story

17
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,933
about a baby born
during the worst storm in living memory.

18
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,103
She had no wealth, no lands, no army,

19
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,106
only a name and a handful of supporters,

20
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,149
most of whom probably thought
they could use that name

21
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,484
to benefit themselves.

22
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,571
They kept her alive,
moving her from place to place,

23
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,865
often hours ahead of the men
who'd been sent to kill her.

24
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,827
She was eventually sold off
to some warlord on the edge of the world,

25
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,495
and that appeared to be that.

26
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,083
And then a few years later,
the most well-informed person I knew

27
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,378
told me that this girl without wealth,
lands, or armies

28
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,840
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

29
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,758
along with three dragons.

30
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,804
He thought she was our best,
last chance to build a better world.

31
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,559
I thought you were worth meeting
at the very least.

32
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,935
And why are you worth meeting?

33
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,396
Why should I spend my time
listening to you?

34
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,565
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

35
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,485
You have no one at your side
who understands the land you want to rule.

36
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,821
The strengths and weaknesses
of the houses

37
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,866
-that will either join or oppose you.
-I will have a very large army,

38
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,660
and very large dragons.

39
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,330
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

40
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,333
When I served as Hand of the King,

41
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,002
I did quite well with the latter
considering the king in question

42
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,129
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

43
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,468
I could do an even better job
advising a ruler worth the name.

44
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,887
If that is indeed what you are.

45
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,931
So, you want to advise me?

46
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,935
Very well.

47
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,521
What would you have me do with him?

48
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,318
I swore I would kill him
if he ever returned.

49
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,445
I know.

50
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,994
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

51
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,167
Whomever Ser Jorah was
when he started informing on you,

52
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,919
he is no longer that man.

53
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,339
I can't remember
ever seeing a sane man

54
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,508
as devoted to anything
as he is to serving you.

55
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,552
He claims he would kill for you
and die for you,

56
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,555
and nothing I ever witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.

57
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,561
And yet he did betray you.

58
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,868
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

59
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,203
Yes.

60
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,580
Many opportunities.

61
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,833
And did he?

62
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,546
No, not until forced to do so.

63
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,177
He worships you.

64
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,763
He is in love with you, I think.

65
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,017
But he did not trust you with the truth.

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,478
An unpleasant truth to be sure,
but one of great significance to you.

67
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,024
He did not trust that you
would be wise enough to forgive him.

68
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,027
So, I should kill him?

69
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,490
A ruler who kills those devoted to her
is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

70
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,494
And you're going to need
to inspire devotion, a lot of it,

71
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,247
if you're ever going to rule
across the Narrow Sea.

72
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,169
But you cannot have him
by your side when you do.

73
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,760
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

74
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,582
Confess.

75
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:39,918
My son.

76
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,004
Let me speak to--

77
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,508
-Confess.
-I meant it.

78
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,845
My face will be the last thing you see--

79
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,866
My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.

80
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:16,580
When I was eight, I begged enough money
to buy my first bucket of oysters.

81
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,083
I sold that bucket and made enough money
to buy two more.

82
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,715
It took a while,
but I finally saved enough

83
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,216
to buy myself an oyster cart.

84
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,846
Now every morning, I make my way
down to the canals.

85
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,893
I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.

86
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,691
I usually see Lhara,

87
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,776
my first customer of the day
on her way home.

88
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,574
Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--

89
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,495
Turn left onto Ragman Lane

90
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,625
-where I do most of my trade.
-Lanna is very impressive.

91
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,627
Very industrious.

92
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,297
She will make a fine servant
for the Many-Faced God.

93
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,382
How will she serve him?

94
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,219
She will no longer turn left
onto Ragman Lane.

95
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,388
She will turn right
and go to Ragman Harbor.

96
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,475
-What will she do there?
-She will see.

97
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:20,977
See what?

98
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,939
How can a man tell a girl this?

99
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,400
If he knew what she would see,
there would be no reason to send her.

100
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,820
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

101
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,174
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

102
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,893
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

103
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,229
Your oysters fresh?

104
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,524
Best in the city.

105
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,442
You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you?

106
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,211
Very nice. Give me four with vinegar.

107
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,133
It's my 18th voyage.

108
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,136
Returned from all of them
without a scratch on me.

109
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,185
Can't do it.

110
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,189
Please, I've three children. Without me…

111
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,068
Here, take it. You have to.
I've three children.

112
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,820
-What will they do?
-Come on.

113
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,363
They've nothing without me.

114
00:10:55,864 --> 00:11:00,368
Please, you have to!
Please, you don't understand! Please!

115
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,127
The man is a gambler.

116
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,215
He wages that a sailor's ship
will make it to its destination.

117
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,347
It is a strange wager for the captain.
He only wins if he loses his life.

118
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,810
So, why would a captain make the wager
in the first place?

119
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,981
A girl tells a man that she has seen.

120
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,614
If the captain dies, the thin man pays
his family a lot of money.

121
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,952
But perhaps the gambler loses his bet

122
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,954
and decides he does not have
to pay after all.

123
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,749
A destitute woman and her small child,

124
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,919
what can they do to such a man
if he keeps their money for himself?

125
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,465
To whom can they turn for recourse?

126
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,556
The Many-Faced God.

127
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,936
You said you didn't know
what I would see at the docks.

128
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,855
A man had no idea what a girl
would see and what she would not.

129
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,860
A girl named Lanna
will return to the docks.

130
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,071
She will watch the gambler.

131
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,573
She will come to know as much about him
as she knows about herself.

132
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,242
And then what?

133
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,996
A gift for the thin man.

134
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,351
She's not ready.

135
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,896
Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.

136
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,648
And if she's not?

137
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,110
It is all the same to the Many-Faced God.

138
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,178
The trial will take place soon.

139
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:27,098
The High Sparrow will be presenting
a substantial case against you.

140
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,477
-The charges?
-Fornication, treason, incest,

141
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,061
the murder of King Robert.

142
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,481
-All lies.
-Of course, Your Grace.

143
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,448
My concern is that the Faith
does not adhere

144
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,826
to the same standards of proof
as the crown.

145
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,912
And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it,

146
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,539
but belief is so often the death
of reason.

147
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,249
I wish you had said it sooner.

148
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,589
-Is there any word from Jaime?
-No, I'm afraid not.

149
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,599
Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle

150
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,354
has summoned your Uncle Kevan
back from Casterly Rock

151
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:18,399
to serve as Hand of the King.
He now presides over the small council.

152
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,445
Tell him I need to speak to him.

153
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,572
I implored him to visit you,
but he would not.

154
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,162
What about my son, the king?

155
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,499
If you can visit me,
then surely the king--

156
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,834
Your arrest
and Queen Margaery's arrest,

157
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,963
the king has not taken them well.
He remains in his chambers.

158
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,424
His servants often find his food
in the hall left untouched.

159
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,593
You need to talk to him.

160
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,054
You need to talk to my son
and tell him to come and see me,

161
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,474
-come and see his mother.
-He-- I tried, Your Grace.

162
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,977
He wouldn't see me. He won't see anyone.

163
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,063
I can't stay here.

164
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,609
There is a way, Your Grace.

165
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,115
A way out.

166
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,910
Confess?

167
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,706
To the High Sparrow? I won't.

168
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,834
I made him.

169
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,504
I rose him up from nothing.

170
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,090
I will not kneel
before some barefooted commoner

171
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,717
and beg his forgiveness.

172
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,892
Good bye, my queen.

173
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,022
The work continues.

174
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,142
Why?

175
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,980
-Why, Theon?
-I'm not Theon.

176
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,400
-There is no Theon. Reek.
-Reek.

177
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,569
Why did you tell him, Reek?

178
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,572
I was helping you.

179
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,368
You wanted to escape. There is no escape.

180
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,371
Not ever.

181
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,540
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

182
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,460
The master knew.

183
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,088
He knows everything.

184
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,343
He hunted him and caught him
and strapped him to a cross,

185
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,264
and cut away piece after piece
until there was no Theon left.

186
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:01,354
Good.

187
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,985
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

188
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:13,991
If I could do what Ramsay did to you
right here, right now, I would.

189
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,039
I deserved everything.

190
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,210
I deserve to be Reek.

191
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,422
I did terrible things.

192
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,259
Turned on Robb.

193
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,053
Captured Winterfell.

194
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,932
-Killed those boys.
-They weren't "those boys."

195
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,351
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

196
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,978
You've known them since they were born.

197
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,105
-They weren't. They were only--
-Only what?

198
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,108
-I can't.
-Tell me.

199
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,736
-I can't, not unless the master says.
-Tell me. They weren't what?

200
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,196
-They weren't--
-Tell me why Bran and Rickon

201
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,449
should be gone
while you still breathe the air.

202
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,452
Tell me to my face, Theon.
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

203
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,703
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

204
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,582
I couldn't find them.

205
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,424
It was two farm boys.

206
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,556
I killed them and burned them
so no one would know.

207
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,771
You didn't?

208
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,816
Do you know where they went,
Bran and Rickon?

209
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,110
-I can't talk to you anymore.
-Theon, you have to tell me.

210
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,738
-Do you have any idea where--
-Not Theon! Reek!

211
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,997
Our scouts tell us he's got no more
than 6,000 men.

212
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,458
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

213
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,460
And how high do Stannis's horses jump?

214
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,338
Our walls have been fully repaired.

215
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,381
The gates have been reinforced.

216
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,759
We have enough food for six months.

217
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,679
We are more prepared for a siege
than they could ever be.

218
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:05,019
All we have to do is wait for them
to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

219
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,317
-You disagree?
-Stannis isn't from the North.

220
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,152
You are, Father.

221
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,323
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

222
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,867
how House Bolton treats
southern invaders.

223
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,703
-And what do you recommend?
-That we not sit and wait for Stannis

224
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,956
to decide what sort of fight
this is going to be.

225
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,001
That we hit first and hit hard
and leave a feast for the crows.

226
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,797
A smart commander does not abandon
a defensive advantage.

227
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,342
As long as we stay behind these walls,
they can't touch us.

228
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,177
Not to mention that the snow is so deep,

229
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,389
we couldn't get an army through
to engage them even if we wanted to.

230
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,598
I don't need an army.

231
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,810
I need 20 good men.

232
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,905
So, have you decided yet?
Whether I'm worthy of your service?

233
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,703
Have you decided yet,
whether you're going to have me killed?

234
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,454
It's probably my safest option.

235
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,170
I can see why you would think so.
It's what your father would have done.

236
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,840
And what would your father have done?

237
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:22,221
My father, who publicly sentenced me
to death?

238
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,683
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

239
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,809
Is that why you killed him?

240
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,024
Someday, if you decide not to execute me,

241
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,943
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

242
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,112
And on that day, should it ever come,

243
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,948
we'll need more wine than this.

244
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,244
I know what my father was.

245
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,538
What he did.

246
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,875
I know the Mad King earned his name.

247
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,297
So, here we sit.

248
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,092
Two terrible children
of two terrible fathers.

249
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,887
-I'm terrible?
-I've heard stories.

250
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,058
Why did you travel to the far side
of the world to meet someone terrible?

251
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,310
To see if you were
the right kind of terrible.

252
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,395
-Which kind is that?
-The kind that prevents your people

253
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,730
from being even more so.

254
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,234
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

255
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,029
Under my rule, murder will once again
become entertainment.

256
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,322
Yes, that was wise.

257
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,201
And you agreed to marry someone
you loathe for the greater good.

258
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,702
Very impressive.

259
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,665
My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,

260
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,249
though not by choice,

261
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,710
and certainly not for the greater good,
Gods forbid.

262
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,921
She ended up having him killed.

263
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,675
Perhaps it won't come to that.

264
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,978
It's not impossible that Varys was right
about you after all.

265
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:55,022
"Varys"? King Robert's spymaster?

266
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,817
Yes, he's the one who convinced me
to come find you.

267
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,319
He was my travelling companion

268
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,446
before Ser Jorah seized
that role for himself.

269
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,490
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

270
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,078
For 20 years the Spider oversaw
the campaign to find and kill me.

271
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,455
He did what he had to do to survive.

272
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,542
He did a lot of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

273
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,504
I suspect he's the main reason
you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

274
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,174
-But you trust him?
-Yes, oddly.

275
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,802
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

276
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,304
Except my brother.

277
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,807
The brother who killed my father?

278
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,477
-That's the one.
-Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

279
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,021
Your queenly prerogative.

280
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,525
I had given up on life

281
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,195
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

282
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:48,075
If you chop off my head, well,
my final days were interesting.

283
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,083
I'm not going to kill you.

284
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,048
-No? Banish me?
-No.

285
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:06,385
So if I'm not going to be murdered
and I'm not going to be banished--

286
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,553
You're going to advise me.

287
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,348
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

288
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,397
-Advise you on what?
-How to get what I want.

289
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,274
The Iron Throne.

290
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,487
Perhaps you should try wanting
something else.

291
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,906
If I want jokes,
I'll get myself a proper fool.

292
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,574
I'm not entirely joking.

293
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,410
There's more to the world
than Westeros after all.

294
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,955
How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

295
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,502
Perhaps this is where you belong,
where you can do the most good.

296
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,216
I fought so that no child born
into Slaver's Bay

297
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,676
would ever know what it meant
to be bought or sold.

298
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,638
I will continue that fight here
and beyond.

299
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,140
But this is not my home.

300
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,268
When you get back to your home,
who supports you?

301
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,394
The common people.

302
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,022
Let's be generous
and assume that's going to happen.

303
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,900
Here in Slaver's Bay,
you had the support of the common people

304
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,276
and only the common people.

305
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,572
What was that like?
Ruling without the rich?

306
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,367
House Targaryen is gone.

307
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,870
Not a single person who shares
your blood is alive to support you.

308
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,499
The Starks are gone as well.
Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

309
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,877
The remaining members of House Lannister
will never back you, not ever.

310
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,255
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

311
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,675
His entire claim to the throne rests
on the illegitimacy of yours.

312
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,721
That leaves the Tyrells.
Not impossible, not enough.

313
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,267
Lannister, Targaryen,
Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

314
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:41,564
They're all just spokes on a wheel.
This one's on top, then that one's on top.

315
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:45,151
And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

316
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,571
It's a beautiful dream,
stopping the wheel.

317
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,824
You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

318
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,869
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

319
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,539
I'm going to break the wheel.

320
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:25,065
You said whoever wins will fight
at the Great Pit in front of the queen.

321
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:26,817
I won.

322
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,988
-You struck me.
-Have me flogged if it makes you happy.

323
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,364
But I'm the best you've got.

324
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:38,787
If I win at the Great Pit,
how much can you sell me for?

325
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,002
You're a free man.
You could have gone anywhere.

326
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,171
Why did you come back?

327
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:55,554
Let me fight for her and I belong to you.

328
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,686
Thirsty?

329
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,773
Confess.

330
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,571
I'll get out of here, you realize,
before long.

331
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,116
-Confess.
-I can make you a wealthy woman.

332
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,329
-A lady of the court.
-Confess.

333
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:29,129
Or I can make sure you die
in the most hideous way imaginable.

334
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,968
And all I do is sit here imagining
hideous ways for you to die.

335
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,889
Does it hurt?

336
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,351
No.

337
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,562
Good.

338
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,859
How are you?

339
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,988
I'm not the one who got punched
and kicked in the face.

340
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,491
You know what I mean.

341
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,370
I'm good.

342
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,915
-Are you scared?
-A little.

343
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,500
Me, too.

344
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,256
-Who's there?
-Olly.

345
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,052
Come in.

346
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,473
I heard what happened.

347
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,225
Not to worry.

348
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,604
Men brawl from time to time.
It's only natural.

349
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,941
Figured you were hungry.

350
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,070
You're a good lad.

351
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:22,076
Wanted to ask you something
if you've got the time.

352
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,453
I need to check on baby Sam.

353
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,047
Now then, how can I help?

354
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,592
-It's about the Lord Commander.
-Yes?

355
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,720
He's going up to Hardhome
to save all them wildlings.

356
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:48,811
Wildlings killed my mom and dad.
They killed everyone in my village.

357
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:52,022
-We've been fighting them for years.
-This wasn't a fight.

358
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:55,484
We were farmers, and they slaughtered us.

359
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,362
So, why is he saving them?

360
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,614
Wildlings are people.

361
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,743
Just like us, there are good ones
and bad ones.

362
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,788
The one he's travelling with,
the one with the red beard,

363
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,207
he led the raid on my village.

364
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,543
-Oh, Olly.
-How can he trust him?

365
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,296
I've seen the army of the dead.

366
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,633
I've seen the white walkers.

367
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,219
And they're coming for us,
for all the living.

368
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,140
And when it's time…

369
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,310
we'll need every last man we can find.

370
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,522
But what if we let the wildlings
through the gates

371
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,774
and they cut our throats
while we sleep?

372
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:40,320
Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.
We don't stand a chance otherwise.

373
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,908
Sometimes a man
has to make hard choices,

374
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,996
choices that might look wrong to others,
but you know are right in the long run.

375
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,958
-You believe that?
-With all my heart.

376
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,094
Try not to worry, Olly.
I've been worrying about Jon for years.

377
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,181
He always comes back.

378
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,141
Turn us about!

379
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,717
You trust me, Jon Snow?

380
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,595
Does that make me a fool?

381
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,889
We're fools together now.

382
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:48,907
Lord of Bones.

383
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,369
Been a long time.

384
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,206
Last time I saw you,
the little crow was your prisoner.

385
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,584
The other way around now.
What happened?

386
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,588
-War.
-War? You call that a war?

387
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:08,135
The greatest army the North has ever seen
cut to pieces by some southern king.

388
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:12,598
We should gather the elders,
find somewhere quiet to talk.

389
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:16,143
-You don't give the orders here.
-I'm not giving an order.

390
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,896
Why aren't you in chains?

391
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,316
He's not my prisoner.

392
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,777
No? What is he?

393
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,487
We're allies.

394
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,075
You fucking traitor.

395
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,289
You fight for the crows now?

396
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,543
I don't fight for the crows.

397
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,590
We're not here to fight.
We're here to talk.

398
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,216
Is that right?

399
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,346
You and the pretty crow
do a lot of talking, Tormund?

400
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,806
And when you're done talking,

401
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,601
do you get down on your knees
and suck his cock?

402
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,244
Gather the elders and let's talk.

403
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,814
My name's Jon Snow.

404
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,193
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

405
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,781
We're not friends.

406
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,534
We've never been friends.

407
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,121
We won't become friends today.

408
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:02,499
This isn't about friendship.

409
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,712
This is about survival.

410
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:11,341
This is about putting a 700-foot wall
between you and what's out there.

411
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,427
You built that wall to keep us out.

412
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,555
Since when do the crows
give two shits if we live?

413
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,474
In normal times we wouldn't,
but these aren't normal times.

414
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,978
The white walkers don't care
if a man's free folk or crow.

415
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,021
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

416
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,193
-But together we can beat them.
-Beat the white walkers?

417
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,196
Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.

418
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,458
It's not a trick.

419
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,839
It's a gift for those who join us.

420
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,137
Dragonglass.

421
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,058
A man of the Night's Watch
used one of these daggers

422
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,101
to kill a walker.

423
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,647
-You saw this?
-No, but I trust the man.

424
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,358
There are old stories about dragonglass.

425
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:14,362
There are old stories about ice spiders
as big as hounds.

426
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,615
And with the things we've seen,
you don't believe them?

427
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,367
Come with me and I'll share these weapons.

428
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,702
Come with you where?

429
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,788
There are good lands south of the Wall.

430
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,581
The Night's Watch will let you
through the tunnel

431
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,000
and allow your people to farm those lands.

432
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,421
I knew Mance Rayder.

433
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,257
He never wanted a war
with the Night's Watch.

434
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,426
He wanted a new life
for his people, for you.

435
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,221
We're prepared to give you that new life.

436
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:40,806
If?

437
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,934
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

438
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,438
Where is Mance?

439
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,527
-He died.
-How?

440
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,243
I put an arrow through his heart.

441
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,497
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

442
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,626
Hey, hey, hey.

443
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:14,297
I say we send the Lord Commander
back to Castle Black with no eyes.

444
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:20,262
Hey, none of you saw Mance die. I did.

445
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,890
The southern king
who broke our army, Stannis,

446
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,893
wanted to burn him alive
to send us a message.

447
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,813
Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.

448
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,358
His arrow was mercy.

449
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,487
What he did took courage.
And that's what we need today,

450
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:41,700
the courage to make peace with men
we've been killing for generations.

451
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:47,247
I lost my father, my uncle,
and two brothers fighting the damn crows.

452
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,957
I'm not asking you to forget your dead.

453
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,710
I'll never forget mine.

454
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:57,132
I lost 50 brothers the night
that Mance attacked the Wall.

455
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,427
But I'm asking you…

456
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,889
to think about your children now.

457
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,643
They'll never have children of their own
if we don't band together.

458
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,855
The Long Night is coming,

459
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,524
and the dead come with it.

460
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:16,985
No clan can stop them.

461
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,572
The free folk can't stop them.
The Night's Watch can't stop them,

462
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,949
and all the southern kings
can't stop them.

463
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,537
Only together, all of us.

464
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,706
And even then it may not be enough,

465
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,541
but at least we'll give
the fuckers a fight.

466
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,517
You vouch for this man, Tormund?

467
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,023
He's prettier than both my daughters,

468
00:37:56,191 --> 00:38:00,320
but he knows how to fight.
He's young, but he knows how to lead.

469
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:05,909
He didn't have to come to Hardhome.
He came because he needs us…

470
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,245
and we need him.

471
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:17,420
My ancestors would spit on me
if I broke bread with a crow.

472
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,423
So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead.

473
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,185
I'll never trust a man in black.

474
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,233
But I trust you, Tormund.

475
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,902
If you say this is the way…

476
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,114
we're with you.

477
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,244
This is the way.

478
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,375
I'm with Tormund.
We stay here, we're dead men.

479
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,213
At least with King Crow, there's a chance.

480
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,176
Tormund.

481
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,974
Keep that new life you want to give us.

482
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,230
And keep your glass, King Crow.

483
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:23,153
As soon as you get on his ships,
they're gonna slit your throats,

484
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:26,072
and dump your bodies
to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.

485
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,659
That's our enemy.

486
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,580
That has always been our enemy.

487
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,514
I fucking hate Thenns.

488
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,870
-Move it.
-Be careful.

489
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,331
-Move 'em along, now.
-Cast-off time.

490
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,707
That's it, come on.

491
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,837
How many are with us? Five thousand?

492
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,423
I'm not good at counting.

493
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,803
-We're leaving too many behind.
-The free folk are stubborn.

494
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:32,347
You know how long it took Mance
to band them together?

495
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,557
Twenty fucking years.

496
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,060
And he knew them better than I ever will.

497
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,773
They're running out of food
and there's nothing to hunt.

498
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,566
They'll come around.

499
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,155
-Get yourselves ready.
-Aye!

500
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:53,868
Johnna is gonna look after you.
She's in charge. You listen to her.

501
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:57,914
Take her. There you are.

502
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,624
-I want to go with you.
-I need to get

503
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:03,753
the old folks on the boats.
I'm right behind you. I promise.

504
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,217
Go on.

505
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,388
Another one.

506
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,559
-Keep moving.
-We'll meet you out there.

507
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,187
Won't be able to take that on the boat.
It's too big.

508
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,108
-That's the last one!
-Three more! Move on!

509
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,152
There's more dragonglass everywhere.

510
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,870
I've got some more daggers over here.

511
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,080
Put that dagger in his bag.

512
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,972
Steady!

513
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,702
Shut the gates.

514
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,454
Close the gates!

515
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,543
Shut the gates!

516
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,715
Wait!

517
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,010
-Open the gate!
-Let us in!

518
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,263
-Open the gates!
-Help us!

519
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,900
Please open it!

520
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,278
Open the gate!

521
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,200
Ready your arrows!

522
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,223
-Wait! Wait!
-Keep in line! Keep in line!

523
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,017
Get in line!

524
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,121
Get to the front!

525
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,957
Go on, shoot it!

526
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:01,384
-Wait, wait!
-Duncan, hold the line! Hold the line!

527
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,726
Lord Commander! Get them to the ship
and come back for me!

528
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,061
-But you'll never make--
-Now!

529
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:17,942
-Let me on!
-Let me on!

530
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,194
-Bloody fucking move!
-Let go!

531
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:25,700
-You should be on one of those boats.
-So should you. My little girls got on.

532
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,661
They're gonna let them pass the Wall
even if you're not there?

533
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,830
You have my word. I've given orders.

534
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,749
Don't think you're gonna be there
to enforce those orders.

535
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:38,463
If they get through, everyone dies.

536
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,635
Night's Watch, with me!

537
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,846
Move! Move!

538
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:49,891
Move!

539
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,550
No, no!

540
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,053
-Tormund, the sleigh!
-Okay, okay!

541
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,309
-Go! Go!
-Help me!

542
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:00,563
-The dragonglass.
-You and me, then!

543
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,065
Go!

544
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:14,637
Get the glass.

545
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:21,991
Come on!

546
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:27,121
-The dragonglass.
-Fuck the glass! We are gonna die here!

547
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:00,237
Oh, fuck!

548
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,370
Tormund, run!

549
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,049
Wun Wun, to the sea.

550
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,385
Quickly!

551
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,137
-Faster, faster!
-Run, run!

552
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,472
Quickly!

553
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:13,602
-Quickly, row! Row!
-Go, go, come on!

554
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:23,737
Stop!

555
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,968
Let's go! Now, now!

556
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,974
Come on, row!
