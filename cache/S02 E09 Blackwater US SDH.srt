00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,175
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,800
Man:
<i>THAT'S IT.</i>

3
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,984
<i>( men coughing )</i>

4
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,416
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

5
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,501
THE TIDE'S AGAINST US.

6
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,211
AYE, BUT WE HAVE
THE WIND.

7
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,964
SHE'LL BLOW US
STRAIGHT TO THE GATE.

8
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,424
YOU'RE COMING HOME.

9
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,969
KING'S LANDING HASN'T
BEEN HOME FOR 20 YEARS.

10
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:45,099
I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE
DODGING THE ROYAL FLEET.

11
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,811
AND NOW I'M SAILING
RIGHT AT THEM.

12
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,855
THIS IS THE ROYAL FLEET.

13
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,857
AND YOU'RE NOT
A SMUGGLER ANYMORE,
YOU'RE THE HIGH CAPTAIN.

14
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,277
OF COURSE THERE ARE
SEVERAL ROYAL FLEETS
AT THE MOMENT.

15
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,821
NOT AFTER TONIGHT.
WHEN THE SUN RISES,

16
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,949
STANNIS WILL SIT
ON THE IRON THRONE

17
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,325
AND YOU WILL BE HIS HAND.

18
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,619
- GODS BE GOOD.
- GOD.

19
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,788
FATHER, THERE IS ONLY ONE
AND HE WATCHES OVER US.

20
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,499
- BUT NOT OVER THEM?
- OVER ALL OF US.

21
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,169
THE PEOPLE OF KING'S LANDING
DID NOT CHOOSE THE FALSE KING
JOFFREY BARATHEON.

22
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,755
THEY WILL BE GLAD TO SEE
HIS HEAD ON A SPIKE.

23
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,257
WELL, FIRST WE HAVE
TO PUT IT THERE.

24
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,969
OUR SHIPS OUTNUMBER
THEIRS 10 TO ONE.

25
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,179
OUR ARMY OUTNUMBER
THEIRS FIVE TO ONE.

26
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,264
THOSE WALLS HAVE
NEVER BEEN BREACHED.

27
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,475
AND THE MEN
GUARDING THE WALLS,

28
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,478
WHEN THEY SEE YOU,
THEY DON'T SEE A LIBERATOR.

29
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,940
THEY SEE A STRANGER COME
TO SET THEIR CITY ON FIRE.

30
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,693
I HAVE FAITH
IN THE LORD OF LIGHT.

31
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,528
I HAVE FAITH
IN OUR CAUSE.

32
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,823
AND I HAVE FAITH
IN MY CAPTAIN.

33
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,868
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

34
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,860
ARE YOU AFRAID, MY LION?

35
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:28,077
IF THE CITY FALLS,
STANNIS WILL BURN EVERY
LANNISTER HE CAN FIND.

36
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,248
OF COURSE I'M AFRAID.

37
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,753
I WON'T LET
THEM HURT YOU.

38
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,176
I'M A LANNISTER.

39
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,888
I DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE IN ALL THIS.

40
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,973
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR WAR.

41
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,273
IT IS NOW.

42
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,655
YOU CAN'T FUCK YOUR WAY
OUT OF EVERYTHING.

43
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,617
I HAVE SO FAR.

44
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,456
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN YOU MET ME IN YOUR TENT?

45
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,087
THAT I SHOULD MAKE LOVE
TO YOU LIKE IT WAS YOUR
LAST DAY ON THIS EARTH.

46
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,435
Pycelle:
<i>AS YOU KNOW, YOUR GRACE,</i>

47
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,979
IT IS NOT ONLY
THE SWORN DUTY OF A MAESTER

48
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,316
TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES
OF THE HOUSE HE SERVES,

49
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,319
BUT ALSO TO OFFER GUIDANCE

50
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,364
AND COUNSEL
IN TIMES OF WAR.

51
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,991
YOUR WORDS ARE ALWAYS
WISE AND MEASURED.

52
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,327
- IF YOU COULD--
- IF ANYTHING,

53
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,498
A MAESTER'S DUTIES
BECOME MORE URGENT

54
00:06:55,581 --> 00:07:00,086
IN TIMES OF WAR
AND TURMOIL.

55
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,464
I REMEMBER BACK
IN THE DAYS OF KING--

56
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,216
YOU BROUGHT ME SOMETHING?

57
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,510
YES.

58
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,141
ESSENCE OF NIGHTSHADE

59
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:18,104
IS AS DANGEROUS
AS IT IS EFFICACIOUS.

60
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,439
A SINGLE DROP
IN A CUP OF WINE

61
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,652
SUFFICES TO SOOTHE
RAGGED NERVES.

62
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>THREE DROPS</i>
<i>WILL BRING ON A DEEP</i>

63
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,449
<i>AND DREAMLESS SLEEP.</i>

64
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,368
<i>10 DROPS, HOWEVER--</i>

65
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,620
I KNOW WHAT 10 DROPS
WILL BRING.

66
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,749
- YOUR GRACE, IF I MAY ASK--
- YOU MAY NOT.

67
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,295
YOU MUST HAVE
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

68
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,381
I'M SURE MANY BRAVE MEN
WILL NEED YOUR WISDOM SOON.

69
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,427
YES.
A SIEGE IS VERY--

70
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,263
BE CAREFUL ON
THE STAIRS, GRAND MAESTER.
THERE ARE SO MANY.

71
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,767

83

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

85
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,647
AND I LIKE
YOUR NOSE.

86
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,566
HOW MANY TIMES
YOU BREAK IT?

87
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,820
WELL, NOW LET'S SEE.

88
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,574
<i>FIRST TIME I WAS FIVE.</i>

89
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,827
- ME MOM SMACKED ME
WITH AN IRON POKER.
- OOH.

90
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,247
OH, IT WASN'T ME
SHE WAS AIMING AT.

91
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,415
SHE WAS TRYING
FOR ME LITTLE BROTHER.

92
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,084
NOW HE WAS A REAL PEST.

93
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,921
SECOND TIME I WAS NINE.

94
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,216
GOT IN A SCRAP
WITH A FEW OLDER BOYS.

95
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,468
THEY WON.

96
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,136
THIRD TIME...

97
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,729
EH, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT THE THIRD TIME.

98
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,402
POOR NOSE.

99
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,320
DON'T FEEL SORRY
FOR HIM.

100
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,531
HE'LL BE HALFWAY UP YOUR ASS
BEFORE THE NIGHT'S THROUGH.

101
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,617

102

103
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,795
WELCOME, FRIENDS.

104
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,134
THIS ROUND'S ON ME.

105
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,729
I DON'T THINK
HE LIKES ME.

106
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,535
YOU THINK
YOU'RE A HARD MAN?

107
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,537
( chuckles, slaps )

108
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,957
- I KNOW IT.
- ( men laugh )

109
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,129
IT'S WARM IN HERE.

110
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,214
WE'VE GOT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN

111
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,050
AND GOOD BROWN ALE.

112
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,053
PLENTY FOR EVERYONE.

113
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,554
AND ALL YOU WANT

114
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,640
IS TO PUT ONE OF US
IN THE COLD GROUND

115
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,601
WITH NO WOMEN
TO KEEP US COMPANY.

116
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,604
OH, THERE'S WOMEN
IN THE GROUND.

117
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,231
I PUT SOME THERE MYSELF.

118
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,401
SO HAVE YOU.

119
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,071
YOU LIKE FUCKING
AND DRINKING

120
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,822
AND SINGING.

121
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,410
BUT KILLING--

122
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,330
KILLING'S THE THING
YOU LOVE.

123
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,583
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME.

124
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,380
ONLY SMALLER.

125
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,342
AND QUICKER.

126
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,137
EH?
( chuckles )

127
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,848
YOUR LORD IMP
IS GONNA MISS YOU.

128
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,440
AYE.
( slaps )

129
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,779

132
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,966
ONE MORE DRINK
BEFORE THE WAR?

133
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,218
SHALL WE?

134
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,981
I'VE ALWAYS
HATED THE BELLS.

135
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,566
THEY RING FOR HORROR--

136
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,860
A DEAD KING,
A CITY UNDER SIEGE.

137
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,362
- A WEDDING.
- EXACTLY.

138
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,533
PODRICK, IS THAT IT?

139
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,869
"IS THAT IT?"
NICE TOUCH.

140
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,539
AS IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE NAME
OF EVERY BOY IN TOWN.

141
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,167
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING.

142
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,712
I'M ENTIRELY SURE
YOU'RE ENTIRELY SURE
WHAT I'M SUGGESTING.

143
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,298
DO YOU TRUST HIM?

144
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,553
ODDLY ENOUGH, I DO.

145
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,973
GOOD.

146
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,855
THE MAP YOU ASKED FOR.

147
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,820
THERE MUST BE 20 MILES
OF TUNNELS BENEATH THE CITY.

148
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,489
CLOSER TO 50.

149
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,284
<i>THE TARGARYENS BUILT THIS</i>
<i>CITY TO WITHSTAND A SIEGE</i>

150
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,079
AND TO PROVIDE ESCAPE
IF NECESSARY.

151
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,915
I'M NOT ESCAPING.

152
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,958
STRANGE AS IT SOUNDS,
I'M THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP.

153
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,668
AND IF THE SHIP GOES DOWN,
I GO WITH HER.

154
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,670
THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR.

155
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,672
THOUGH I'M SURE MANY
CAPTAINS SAY THE SAME

156
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,218
WHILE THEIR SHIP
IS AFLOAT.

157
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,095
YOU LOOK WELL SUITED
FOR BATTLE, MY LORD.

158
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,430
WELL, I'M NOT.

159
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,391
FOR ALL OUR SAKES,
I HOPE YOU ARE WRONG.

160
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,562
MY LITTLE BIRDS TELL ME
THAT STANNIS BARATHEON

161
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,191
HAS TAKEN UP WITH A RED
PRIESTESS FROM ASSHAI.

162
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,609
WHAT OF IT?

163
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,904
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN
THE OLD POWERS, MY LORD?

164
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,199
BLOOD SPELLS,
CURSES, SHAPE-SHIFTING--
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

165
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,662
I THINK YOU BELIEVE
IN WHAT YOU SEE

166
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,624
AND IN WHAT THOSE
YOU TRUST HAVE SEEN.

167
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,627
YOU PROBABLY DON'T
ENTIRELY TRUST ME.

168
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,546
MM, DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

169
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,548
I DON'T ENTIRELY
TRUST MYSELF.

170
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,509
AND YET I HAVE SEEN THINGS

171
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,220
<i>AND HEARD THINGS--</i>

172
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:10,849
THINGS YOU HAVE NOT,
THINGS I WISH I HAD NOT.

173
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,689
I DON'T BELIEVE I'VE EVER
TOLD YOU HOW I WAS CUT.

174
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,609
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE
YOU HAVE.

175
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,988
ONE DAY I WILL.

176
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,118
THE DARK ARTS HAVE PROVIDED
LORD STANNIS WITH HIS ARMIES

177
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,580
AND PAVED HIS PATH
TO OUR DOOR.

178
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,792
FOR A MAN IN SERVICE
TO SUCH POWERS TO SIT
ON THE IRON THRONE,

179
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,129
I CAN THINK
OF NOTHING WORSE.

180
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,755
AND TONIGHT,

181
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,010
I BELIEVE YOU
ARE THE ONLY MAN
WHO CAN STOP HIM.

182
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,777
( tolling continues )

183
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,872
THEY'RE WELCOMING
THE NEW KING.

184
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,709
I'VE NEVER KNOWN BELLS
TO MEAN SURRENDER.

185
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,836
THEY WANT TO PLAY
MUSIC WITH US?
LET'S PLAY.

186
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,797
- DRUMS.
- DRUMS!

187
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,383
( men shouting )

188
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,198
( men shouting )

189
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,574
Tyrion:
<i>REMEMBER, WAIT TILL--</i>

190
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,534
Bronn:
<i>THE SHIPS ARE IN THE BAY.</i>

191
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,204
- THEY MUST BE FAR ENOUGH
IN SO THEY WON'T BE--
- I KNOW WHAT "IN" MEANS.

192
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,539
- DO YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THAT?
- I CHOPPED WOOD ONCE.

193
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,125
NO, I WATCHED MY BROTHER
CHOPPING WOOD.

194
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,086
I SAW YOU KILL A MAN
WITH A SHIELD.

195
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,004
YOU'LL BE UNSTOPPABLE
WITH AN AXE.

196
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,133
- DON'T GET KILLED.
- NOR YOU, MY FRIEND.

197
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,512
- OH, ARE WE FRIENDS NOW?
- OF COURSE WE ARE.

198
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,556
JUST BECAUSE I PAY YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICES DOESN'T
DIMINISH OUR FRIENDSHIP.

199
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,058
ENHANCES IT, REALLY.

200
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,811
OH, ENHANCES.
FANCY WORD FOR A SELLSWORD.

201
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,897
BEEN SPENDING TIME
WITH FANCY FOLKS.

202
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,828
LADY SANSA
AND, UH, SHEILA.

203
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,413
SHAE.

204
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,039
SHAE, YES.

205
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,166
SURELY MY SISTER
HAS ASKED YOU TO JOIN

206
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,127
THE OTHER HIGHBORN LADIES
IN MAEGOR'S HOLDFAST.

207
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,588
SHE HAS, MY LORD,
BUT KING JOFFREY SENT
FOR ME TO SEE HIM OFF.

208
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,549
SANSA.

209
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,801
HE'S BEEN A GREAT
ROMANTIC, MY NEPHEW.

210
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,678
Joffrey:
<i>SANSA, COME HERE.</i>

211
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,516
I WILL PRAY FOR YOUR
SAFE RETURN, MY LORD.

212
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,101
WILL YOU?

213
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,562
JUST AS I PRAY
FOR THE KING'S.

214
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,568
STAY SAFE, MY LADY.

215
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,903
AND YOU, MY LION.

216
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,745
YOUR KING RIDES FORTH
TO BATTLE.

217
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,831
YOU SHOULD SEE HIM
OFF WITH A KISS.

218
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,125
MY NEW BLADE.

219
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,793
HEARTEATER I'VE NAMED IT.

220
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,881
KISS IT.

221
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,392
YOU'LL KISS IT AGAIN
WHEN I RETURN

222
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,144
AND TASTE
MY UNCLE'S BLOOD.

223
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,062
WILL YOU SLAY HIM
YOURSELF?

224
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,566
IF STANNIS IS FOOL ENOUGH
TO COME NEAR ME.

225
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,527
SO YOU'LL BE OUTSIDE THE GATES
FIGHTING IN THE VANGUARD?

226
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,197
A KING DOESN'T DISCUSS

227
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,657
BATTLE PLANS
WITH STUPID GIRLS.

228
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,660
I'M SORRY, YOUR GRACE.
YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M STUPID.

229
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,954
OF COURSE YOU'LL BE
IN THE VANGUARD.

230
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,081
THEY SAY MY BROTHER
ROBB ALWAYS GOES

231
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,708
WHERE THE FIGHTING
IS THICKEST.

232
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,502
AND HE IS ONLY
A PRETENDER.

233
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,213
YOUR BROTHER'S TURN
WILL COME.

234
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,257
THEN YOU CAN LICK HIS BLOOD
OFF HEARTEATER, TOO.

235
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,064
SOME OF THOSE BOYS
WILL NEVER COME BACK.

236
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,191
JOFFREY WILL.

237
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,193
THE WORST ONES
ALWAYS LIVE.

238
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,154
SHH.
COME, MY LADY.

239
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,622
( men shouting )

240
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,091
( neighing )

241
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,802
( men shouting )

242
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,484
<i>( distant drums beating )</i>

243
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,576
<i>( distant drums beating )</i>

244
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,496
- WHERE'S OUR FLEET?
- ON THE WAY.

245
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,042
WHY ISN'T IT HERE NOW?
THEY'RE COMING.

246
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,754
HOUND, TELL THE HAND
THAT HIS KING HAS ASKED
HIM A QUESTION.

247
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,756
THE KING HAS ASKED
YOU A QUESTION.

248
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,134
SER LANCEL, TELL THE HOUND
TO TELL THE KING

249
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,136
THAT THE HAND
IS EXTREMELY BUSY.

250
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,139
THE HAND OF THE KING
WOULD LIKE ME TO TELL
YOU TO TELL THE KING--

251
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,099
IF I TELL THE HOUND
TO CUT YOU IN HALF,

252
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,559
HE'LL DO IT WITHOUT
A SECOND THOUGHT.

253
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,352
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
THE QUARTERMAN.

254
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,606
IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE
THE SAME RING TO IT.

255
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,317
CUT ME IN HALF
AND I WON'T BE ABLE
TO GIVE THE SIGNAL.

256
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,319
<i>NO SIGNAL, NO PLAN.</i>

257
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,447
NO PLAN AND STANNIS
BARATHEON SACKS THIS CITY,
TAKES THE IRON THRONE,

258
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,783
PUTS YOUR PINCHED
LITTLE HEAD ATOP
A GATE SOMEWHERE.

259
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,161
IT MIGHT BE QUITE AMUSING,

260
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,079
EXCEPT THAT MY HEAD
WOULD BE UP THERE, TOO.

261
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,915
I'VE NEVER MUCH
LIKED MY HEAD,

262
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,460
BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE
IT REMOVED JUST YET.

263
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,921
<i>( drums beating )</i>

264
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,672
WHERE ARE THEIR SHIPS?

265
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,425
IT IS WISE
TO ATTACK AT NIGHT.
WE TOOK THEM BY SURPRISE.

266
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,470
LORD VARYS KNOWS WHAT
YOU HAD FOR BREAKFAST
THREE DAYS AGO.

267
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,180
THERE ARE
NO SURPRISES HERE.

268
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,182
IF IT'S TRUE
THERE IS DISSENTION
IN THEIR RANKS,

269
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,351
MAYBE THEIR SAILORS
HAVE MUTINIED.

270
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,603
MAYBE.

271
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,569
<i>( babies crying )</i>

272
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,245
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE WANTS ME HERE.

273
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,165
SHE'S ALWAYS SAYING
HOW STUPID I AM.
SHE HATES ME.

274
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,503
MAYBE SHE HATES YOU
LESS THAN SHE HATES
EVERYONE ELSE.

275
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,338
I DOUBT IT.

276
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,341
MAYBE SHE'S
JEALOUS OF YOU.

277
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,510
WHY WOULD SHE
BE JEALOUS?

278
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,637
SANSA.

279
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,685
I WAS WONDERING WHERE
OUR LITTLE DOVE HAD FLOWN.

280
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,188
YOU LOOK PALE, CHILD.

281
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,232
IS YOUR RED FLOWER
STILL BLOOMING?

282
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,401
YES.

283
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,111
FITTING, ISN'T IT?

284
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:23,198
THE MEN WILL BLEED OUT THERE
AND YOU WILL BLEED IN HERE.

285
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,200
POUR LADY SANSA
SOME WINE.

286
00:21:25,283 --> 00:21:27,077
I'M NOT THIRSTY,
YOUR GRACE.

287
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,747
SO? I DIDN'T
OFFER YOU WATER.

288
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,461
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

289
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,880
SER ILYN?

290
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,550
<i>HE'S HERE TO DEFEND US.</i>

291
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,343
WHEN THE AXES SMASH
DOWN THOSE DOORS,

292
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,594
YOU MAY BE GLAD
TO HAVE HIM.

293
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,055
BUT WE HAVE GUARDS
TO DEFEND US.

294
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,974
GUARDS WE HAVE PAID.

295
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,477
SHOULD THE CITY FALL,
THEY'LL BE THE FIRST ONES
OUT OF THE DOORS.

296
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,692
THE LADS CAUGHT
A GROOM AND TWO MAIDS
TRYING TO SNEAK AWAY

297
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,194
<i>WITH A STOLEN HORSE</i>
<i>AND SOME GOLD CUPS.</i>

298
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,363
THE BATTLE'S FIRST
TRAITORS.

299
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,282
HAVE SER ILYN
SEE TO THEM.

300
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,910
PUT THEIR HEADS
ON SPIKES OUTSIDE
THE STABLES AS A WARNING.

301
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,247
THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP
THE SMALL FOLK LOYAL

302
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,459
IS TO MAKE CERTAIN
THEY FEAR YOU MORE
THAN THEY DO THE ENEMY.

303
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:20,422
REMEMBER THAT IF YOU EVER
HOPE TO BECOME A QUEEN.

304
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,673
<i>( door closes )</i>

305
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,967
YOU SAID HE WAS HERE
TO PROTECT US.

306
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,513
HE IS.

307
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,391
TRAITORS ARE A DANGER
TO US ALL.

308
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,185

- ARCHERS TO THEIR MARKS.
- ARCHERS, TO YOUR MARKS!

312

Man:
<i>ARCHERS!</i>

313

WHERE ARE THE REST OF THEM?

320
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,784
WHERE ARE
THE REST OF THEM?!

321
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,873
THERE'S ONLY ONE SHIP.

322
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,462

00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,567
THE DWARF HAS PLAYED
HIS LITTLE TRICK.

- HE CAN ONLY PLAY IT ONCE.

341
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,363
WE'RE TOO FAR
FROM THE GATES.

00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,202
HUNDREDS WILL DIE.

344
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,496
THOUSANDS.

345
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,845
COME WITH ME
AND TAKE THIS CITY!

346
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,848
( cheering )

347
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,407
SANSA, COME HERE,
LITTLE DOVE.

348
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,749
MY QUEEN.

349
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,959
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

350
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,252
PRAYING.

351
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,713
YOU'RE PERFECT,
AREN'T YOU?

352
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,091
PRAYING.

353
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,842
<i>WHAT ARE YOU PRAYING FOR?</i>

354
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,220
FOR THE GODS TO HAVE
MERCY ON US ALL.

355
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,556
OH.
ON ALL OF US?

356
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,393
- YES, YOUR GRACE.
- EVEN ME?

357
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,103
OF COURSE,
YOUR GRACE.

358
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,854
EVEN JOFFREY?

359
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,402
- JOFFREY IS MY--
- OH, SHUT UP,
YOU LITTLE FOOL.

360
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,446
PRAYING TO THE GODS
TO HAVE MERCY ON US ALL.

361
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,908
THE GODS HAVE NO MERCY.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE GODS.

362
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,994
<i>MY FATHER TOLD ME THAT</i>
<i>WHEN HE CAUGHT ME PRAYING.</i>

363
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,790
MY MOTHER JUST DIED,
YOU SEE.

364
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,292
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
THE CONCEPT OF DEATH,

365
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,628
THE FINALITY OF IT.

366
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,089
I THOUGHT THAT IF I PRAYED
VERY, VERY HARD,

367
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,467
THE GODS WOULD RETURN
MY MOTHER TO ME.
I WAS FOUR.

368
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,137
YOUR FATHER DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN THE GODS?

369
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,931
HE BELIEVES IN THEM,
HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE
THEM VERY MUCH.

370
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,769
ONE FOR HER.

371
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,358
HERE.

372
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,944
SIT.

373
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,071
DRINK.

374
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,618
NOT LIKE THAT.
DRINK, GIRL.

375
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,748
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
BORN A MAN.

376
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,085
I'D RATHER FACE 1,000 SWORDS
THAN BE SHUT UP INSIDE

377
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,504
WITH THIS FLOCK
OF FRIGHTENED HENS.

378
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,048
THEY ARE YOUR GUESTS
UNDER YOUR PROTECTION.

379
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,383
YOU ASKED THEM HERE.

380
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,677
IT WAS EXPECTED OF ME,

381
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,931
AS IT WILL BE OF YOU
IF YOU EVER BECOME
JOFFREY'S QUEEN.

382
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,435
IF MY WRETCHED BROTHER
SHOULD SOMEHOW PREVAIL,

383
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:34,272
THESE HENS WILL RETURN
TO THEIR COCKS

384
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,692
AND CROW OF HOW MY COURAGE
INSPIRED THEM,

385
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,360
LIFTED THEIR SPIRITS.

386
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,738
AND IF THE CITY
SHOULD FALL?

387
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,701
YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

388
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,870
THE RED KEEP
SHOULD HOLD FOR A TIME,

389
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,663
LONG ENOUGH FOR ME
TO GO TO THE WALLS

390
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,625
AND YIELD TO LORD STANNIS
IN PERSON.

391
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,336
IF IT WERE ANYONE ELSE
OUTSIDE THOSE GATES,

392
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,379
I MIGHT HAVE HOPED
FOR A PRIVATE AUDIENCE.

393
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,174
BUT THIS IS STANNIS BARATHEON.

394
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,928
I'D HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
OF SEDUCING HIS HORSE.

395
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,974
HAVE I SHOCKED YOU,
LITTLE DOVE?

396
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,102
TEARS AREN'T A WOMAN'S
ONLY WEAPON.

397
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,148
THE BEST ONE'S
BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.

398
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,693
LEARN HOW TO USE IT.
DRINK.

399
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,157
DO YOU HAVE ANY NOTION
OF WHAT HAPPENS

400
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,952
WHEN A CITY IS SACKED?

401
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,704
NO, YOU WOULDN'T,
WOULD YOU?

402
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,876
IF THE CITY FALLS,
THESE FINE WOMEN

403
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,921
SHOULD BE IN
FOR A BIT OF A RAPE.

404
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,798
<i>HALF OF THEM</i>
<i>WILL HAVE BASTARDS</i>

405
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,467
IN THEIR BELLIES
COME THE MORNING.

406
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,303
YOU'LL BE GLAD OF
YOUR RED FLOWER THEN.

407
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,681
WHEN A MAN'S BLOOD
IS UP,

408
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,725
ANYTHING WITH TITS
LOOKS GOOD.

409
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,310
A PRECIOUS THING LIKE YOU

410
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,356
WILL LOOK VERY, VERY GOOD.

411
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,650
A SLICE OF CAKE

412
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,986
JUST WAITING TO BE EATEN.

413
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,700
- MORE PRESSURE!
- ( men shouting, grunting )

414
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,129
- PULL! PULL!
- THAT'S IT, MEN!

415
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,382
<i>PULL! PULL!</i>

416
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:28,052
<i>THAT'S IT!</i>
<i>STEADY!</i>

417
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,306
HE'S A SERIOUS MAN--
STANNIS BARATHEON.

418
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,933
THEY'RE COMING.
THEY'RE COMING ASHORE.

419
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,811
RAIN FIRE ON THEM.

420
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,730
ARCHERS!

421
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,315
THERE ARE TOO MANY.

422
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,900
HOUND, FORM A WELCOME PARTY
FOR ANY BARATHEON TROOP

423
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,320
THAT MANAGES TO TOUCH
SOLID GROUND.

424
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,657
POD, RUN TO
THE KING'S GATE.

425
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,492
BRING ANY MEN
GUARDING IT HERE NOW.

426
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,995
YES, MY LORD.

427
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,748
LET'S GO.
STANNIS IS SENDING
US FRESH MEAT.

428
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,833
YOU, TOO.

429
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,463
ANY OF THESE FLAMING
FUCKING ARROWS COME NEAR ME,

430
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,965
I'LL STRANGLE YOU
WITH YOUR OWN GUTS.

431
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,636
( men shouting )

432
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,056
PULL, PULL! GO!

433
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,308
NOCK!

434
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,855
<i>DRAW!</i>

435
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:24,233
-<i> DRAW!</i>
<i>- DRAW!</i>

436
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,325
( men shouting )

437
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,160
Man:
<i>KILL THE LANNISTERS!</i>

438
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,912
LOOSE!

439
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,246
LOOSE!

440
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,460
Man:
FORM THE LINE!

441
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,464
STANNIS!

442
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,383
- DRAW!
-<i> DRAW!</i>

443
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,802
- LOOSE!
-<i> LOOSE!</i>

444
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,451
Man:
<i>THEY CANNOT</i>
<i>BREACH THE WALL!</i>

445
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,753
YAH!

446
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,265
THE MUD GATE, GO NOW!

447
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,518
FIRST AND SECOND
SQUADS, TO THE GATE!
TO THE MUD GATE!

448
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,395
Hound:
ANY MAN DIES
WITH A CLEAN SWORD,

449
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,606
I'LL RAPE
HIS FUCKING CORPSE.

450
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,176
( screams )

451
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,101
Cersei:
<i>WHEN WE WERE YOUNG,</i>
<i>JAIME AND I,</i>

452
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,561
<i>WE LOOKED SO MUCH ALIKE.</i>

453
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,730
<i>EVEN OUR FATHER</i>
<i>COULDN'T TELL US APART.</i>

454
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:30,568
<i>I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY</i>
<i>THEY TREATED US DIFFERENTLY.</i>

455
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,322
JAIME WAS TAUGHT TO FIGHT
WITH SWORD AND LANCE AND MACE,

456
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,158
AND I WAS TAUGHT TO SMILE

457
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,243
<i>AND SING AND PLEASE.</i>

458
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,205
HE WAS HEIR
TO CASTERLY ROCK

459
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,749
AND I WAS SOLD TO SOME
STRANGER LIKE A HORSE

460
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,168
TO BE RIDDEN
WHENEVER HE DESIRED.

461
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,796
YOU WERE ROBERT'S QUEEN.

462
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,756
AND YOU WILL BE
JOFFREY'S. ENJOY.

463
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,804
I DON'T THINK
I KNOW THIS ONE.

464
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,728
PRETTY.

465
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,778
THAT'S THE WORST
CURTSY I'VE EVER SEEN.

466
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,531
HERE, IT'S NOT DIFFICULT.
I MASTERED IT WHEN I WAS FOUR.

467
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,784
STRAIGHTEN YOUR BACK
AND BEND.

468
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,539
BETTER.
YOU LEARN FAST.

469
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,376
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
IN LADY SANSA'S SERVICE?

470
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,546
A FEW WEEKS,
YOUR GRACE.

471
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,676
WHEN DID YOU
LEAVE LORATH?

472
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,721
I HAD A LORATHI
HANDMAIDEN ONCE.

473
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,643
BUT SHE WAS
A NOBLEMAN'S DAUGHTER.

474
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,603
YOU'RE NOT.

475
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,192
WHEN DID YOU COME
TO WESTEROS?

476
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,571
10 YEARS AGO,
YOUR GRACE.

477
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,574
FROM LORATHI COMMONER
TO THE RED KEEP

478
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,578
IN 10 YEARS, ALL WITHOUT
LEARNING HOW TO CURTSY.

479
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,082
I IMAGINE THAT'S
A VERY INTERESTING STORY.

480
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,709
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

481
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,086
SHAE, YOUR GRACE.

482
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,547
TELL US A STORY, SHAE.

483
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,763
- WHEN I WAS 13, I--
-<i> ( door opens )</i>

484
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,892
YOUR GRACE!

485
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,895
WHAT NEWS?

486
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,980
THE IMP HAS SET
THE RIVER AFIRE.

487
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,482
HUNDREDS OF SHIPS
ARE BURNING, MAYBE MORE.

488
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,111
STANNIS'S FLEET
DESTROYED, BUT...

489
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:40,406
( quietly )
BUT-- BUT HIS TROOPS

490
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,909
HAVE LANDED OUTSIDE
THE CITY WALLS.

491
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,952
WHERE IS JOFFREY?

492
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,330
ON THE BATTLEMENTS
WITH LORD TYRION.

493
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,457
BRING HIM BACK
INSIDE AT ONCE.

494
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,376
- BUT, YOUR GRACE--
- WHAT?

495
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,712
THE KING'S PRESENCE
IS GOOD FOR MORALE.

496
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,465
BRING HIM BACK
TO HIS CHAMBERS NOW.

497
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,550
- NOT HERE?
- WITH THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN?

498
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,303
DO YOU WANT HIM TO BE
MOCKED AS A COWARD FOR
THE REST OF HIS LIFE?

499
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,680
- NO, BUT I--
- NOW!

500
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,521
WHEN I TOLD YOU ABOUT
SER ILYN EARLIER, I LIED.

501
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,817
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
THE TRUTH?

502
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,153
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
HE'S REALLY HERE?

503
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,823
HE'S HERE FOR US.

504
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,993
STANNIS MAY TAKE THE CITY,
HE MAY TAKE THE THRONE,

505
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,080
BUT HE WILL NOT
TAKE US ALIVE.

506
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,559
( screaming )

507
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,648
( arrow thunks )

508
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,615
- Man:<i> AH! HELP ME!</i>
<i>- ( man #2 shouting )</i>

509
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,386
Man:
WE'D BETTER RUN!

510
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,222
Men:
FALL BACK!

511
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,355
GET THE LADDERS UP!

512
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,988
( grunts )

513
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,433
FASTER, YOU BASTARDS!
