1
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,650
It's not a disease.

2
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,195
It's a curse.

3
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,783
They complained of frequent nosebleeds
and auditory hallucinations.

4
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,328
It suddenly begins one day

5
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,080
and it never stops.

6
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,252
They turned into miserable,
desperate beings.

7
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,215
Throw it!

8
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,051
Humans will not be able to overcome this.

9
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,986
Help us!

10
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,657
-I was consumed by it too.
-Protect them?

11
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,034
Is that what you want?

12
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,623
You're fine.

13
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,416
Probably thanks to the golden hour.

14
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,629
There was someone who knew about this
before the government announcement.

15
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,132
If subjects hold out for 15 days
without being consumed

16
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,842
they enter a stable period.

17
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,763
They become half-monsters,

18
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,558
dangerous and volatile beings.

19
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,771
We called them special infectees.

20
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,190
Hyun-su is dangerous.

21
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,525
He's dangerous, but we need him.

22
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,068
You're just being used.

23
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,947
You think I'll hurt you guys
if I become a monster?

24
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,824
A monster is a monster.

25
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,035
Humans have failed.

26
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,745
Accept it.

27
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,926
Surrender the infected immediately.

28
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,763
Survivors will be transferred
to a shelter.

29
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,223
This "shelter" sounds ridiculous.

30
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,059
You don't know
who'll turn into a monster when.

31
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,270
There's a good chance it's a lie.

32
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,187
I'll come back.

33
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,233
No. Eun-hyeok!

34
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,153
You promised to come back!

35
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,114
Eun-hyeok!

36
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,166
Your fiancé.

37
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,003
I know where he is
and what happened to him.

38
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,257
Humans and we can't coexist anyway.

39
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,302
I'm going to find more that are like us.

Cha Hyun-su.

43
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,940
Long time no see.

BAMSEOM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUREAU
CENTRAL COMMAND

45
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,541
Any improvements in his condition?

46
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,502
Doesn't seem that way.

47
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,881
Then he has no value to us.

48
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,343
So why is he still alive?

49
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,012
Because he's still breathing.

50
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,555
Not because he's your friend?

51
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm the one who put him in this state.
Don't you remember?

52
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,603
Fair enough. Any new findings?

BAMSEOM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUREAU
C5 RESEARCH FACILITY

54
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,065
I do have a theory.

55
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,152
Earth came into existence
4.6 billion years ago,

56
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,281
and we, the Homo Sapiens,
emerged 200,000 years ago.

57
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,826
Count that as a single day,

58
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,954
and we'll only have existed
for three seconds.

59
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,250
What are you trying to say?

60
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,919
Mankind is nothing
from Earth's perspective.

61
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,966
But these worthless beings
are getting on its nerves.

62
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,720
They're destroying everything
to fulfill their greed

63
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,764
and killing off other species.

64
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,309
At this point, Earth must be thinking,

65
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,689
"It's time to let another species
take the reins, humans.

66
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,025
You've been around long enough,
don't you think?"

67
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,612
So here's my theory.

68
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,242
Mankind is a virus.

69
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,453
And the monsters are the vaccine.

This is Central Command.

73
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,805
A vehicle transporting
a special infectee has been hijacked.

74
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,099

The rest, support them.

RESTRICTED MILITARY AREA

76
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,730
Black Kite Three,
this is a crucial mission.

77
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,898
Return immediately.

78
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,941
The subject being escorted
is extremely dangerous.

79
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,110
Your safety will be ensured
if you surrender.

80
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,741
Pretty arrogant of you to say
you'll ensure my safety.

81
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,703
Who are you? What do you want?

82
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,086
I'm nobody.

83
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,755
And I don't want anything.

84
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,175
There's gotta be a reason
you're doing this, you bastard!

85
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,558
To give you a chance, I guess?

86
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,268
Who are you?

87
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,062
What the hell are you--

88
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,362
Cha Hyun-su.

89
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,616
Cha Hyun-su.

90
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,093
Long time no see.

91
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,013
Jung Ui-myeong.

92
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,268
You recognized me right away?

93
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,227
That's no fun.

94
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,129
This is Black Kite Nine.

95
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,174
The vehicle carrying the special infectee
is headed toward Hannam.

96
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,346
Vehicle is approaching the Banpo Bridge.
Calling for backup.

97
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,921
Why did you kill Sang-wook?

98
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,134
Because of you.

99
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,057
I didn't like the look in your eyes.

100
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,070
Die!

101
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,112
Die--

102
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,211
This guy's still alive.

103
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,004
All thanks to me.

104
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,008
You should be thanking me.

105
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,969
So ungrateful, Hyun-su.

106
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,421
-The vehicle is ahead of us.
-Use all the firepower we've got.

107
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,131
Stop them at the bridge at all costs.

108
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,324
There seems to be action
inside the vehicle.

109
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,743
Pursuit team,
check on the special infectee first!

110
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,300
The special infectee is still alive!

111
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,395
Stop resisting it and unleash it.

112
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,979
You…

113
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,856
can't kill me.

114
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,199
This is Night Owl. Cutting them off.

115
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,578
Launching.

116
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,432
The vehicle is pressing forward!

117
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,290
Failed to stop the vehicle.

118
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,875
It's headed toward Banpo.

119
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,251
Requesting permission for direct fire.

120
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,212
Negative.
We have to capture the target alive.

121
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,839
He's the last living special infectee.

122
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,966
Shoot down the bridge
to block the escape route.

123
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,619
This is Night Owl One.
The vehicle is getting away.

124
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,078
Lost visual on the target.

125
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,664
Check the possible escape routes
and get on its tail!

126
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,085
Pursuit team, find another route
and search every place they could hide.

127
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,053
Aren't there enough monsters
captured at Central Command?

128
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,347
-Why are you being so reckless--
-Because they're special!

129
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,973
They're neither human nor monster!

130
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,100
We need them to make a cure. Got that?

131
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,769
Did they succeed?

132
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,231
The special infectees
at Central Command are useless now.

133
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,359
They'll probably be discarded.

134
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,694
That's why we have to
capture them at all costs.

135
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,168
The soldiers did it.

136
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,003
Does that mean we're safe now?

137
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,673
There wasn't a single monster
on our way here.

138
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,093
There weren't any people either.

139
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,930
Well, that's probably because…

140
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,475
the soldiers already rescued them all.

141
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,449
This is the Dumugae checkpoint.

142
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,827
A military vehicle carrying survivors
is approaching.

143
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,287
Inspecting the vehicle.

144
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,789
See? I told you.

145
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,390
We don't see anything unusual.

146
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,850
We're letting them through.

147
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,767
Roger.

148
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,342
How long until the debris is cleared?

149
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,469
About a couple of hours.

150
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,347
We'll start moving
the survivors in the back too.

151
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,625
No! He's just sick!

152
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,335
He has leukemia.

153
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,046
There must be a doctor at the shelter.
You can check with them!

154
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,757
Okay. We'll check.

155
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,098
Tae-yun will be okay.

156
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,272
No signs of recovery.

157
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,565
He's not a monster.

158
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,025
Good.

159
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,151
Get rid of him.

160
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,740
-What the hell did you just do?
-Back off.

161
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,619
-A nosebleed is a serious symptom.
-You sons of bitches!

162
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,971
No…

163
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,142
Die, motherfucker.

164
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,143
Die!

165
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:00,894
You piece of shit.

166
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,773
Baby.

167
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,858
My baby!

168
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,192
Don't do that!

169
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,946
No, Yeong-chan!

170
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,700
You can't do that.

171
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,619
Yeong-chan, my baby…

172
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,599
You're in high spirits.

173
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,350
Humming and whatnot.

174
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,519
What the hell are you saying?

175
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,229
That wasn't you?

176
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,568
What's this sound then?

177
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,286
Ready or not, here I come

178
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,206
I'm going to find you

179
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,750
Ready or not, here I come

180
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,669
I'm going to find you

181
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,757
Move!

182
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,844
You! Where do you think you're going?

183
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,596
I…

184
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,181
I heard something back there.

185
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,350
-Scan it.
-Nothing there, sir.

186
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,894
What the hell are you trying to pull?

187
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,021
Hey, shut up and get back to work.

188
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,523
Turn around!

189
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,149
Go on.

190
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,276
Go!

191
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,861
Go!

192
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,950
Move it!

193
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,054
Ready or not, here I come
I'm going to find you

194
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,168
Run.

195
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,382
Run!

196
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,706
Over here!

197
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,832
Over here!

198
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,711
Get over here! Come on!

199
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,754
Hurry!

200
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,340
Come on!

201
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:22,758
Hurry up!

202
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,551
Let's go!

203
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,886
-Hurry!
-Hey!

204
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,686
Start driving!

205
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,438
You son of a bitch!

206
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,874
Start driving!

207
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,126
Let's go, asshole!

208
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,129
Hey! Start driving!

209
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,438
You asshole!

210
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,417
Mommy.

211
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,524
Mommy!

212
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,483
Mommy!

213
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,069
-Mommy!
-Don't shoot!

214
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,282
Let me go!

215
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,329
Mommy…

216
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,955
Mommy…

217
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,374
Mommy…

218
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,876
Yun-seo!

219
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,711
Yun-seo!

220
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,301
Yun-seo!

221
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,345
Oh, no!

222
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,263
Yun-seo!

223
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,600
Mommy!

224
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,894
Yun-seo!

225
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,483
Mommy!

226
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,693
Yun-seo!

227
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,729
Are you trying to get us
all fucking killed?

228
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,736
I thought the soldiers would be okay.

229
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,530
-You bastard.
-Bom…

230
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,240
You piece of shit.

231
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,241
Bom isn't here.

232
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,451
Who cares about your damn dog?
We barely survived.

233
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,454
You would've died if it weren't for Bom!

234
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,082
You ran away on your own back there.
You selfish bastard.

235
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,501
What's so wrong about that?

236
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,920
Stop it. This isn't the time to argue.

237
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,465
What's going to happen to us now?

238
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,303
Wait, what's in your hand?

239
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,345
You motherfucker.

240
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,561
You gotta be kidding me.

241
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,938
Do you even know how to use that?

242
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,201
What do you want?

243
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,872
There's somewhere I need to be.

244
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,525
They didn't retreat after seeing that?

245
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,361
Those reckless idiots.

246
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,614
SPECIAL INFECTEE REPORT GUIDE

247
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,038
Sergeants Kim Yeong-hu and Min Seo-jin.

248
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,624
Take your teams and search the area.

249
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,876
We'll back you up from here.

250
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,223
Search every corner.

251
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,100
Report to me if you find something.

252
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,268
Yes, sir.

253
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,824
Hey, Kim.

254
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,993
Something's wrong here.

255
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,663
Doesn't this seem familiar?

256
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,666
Most of them were shot to death.

257
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,460
Any traces of monsters?

258
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,296
I doubt a monster shot them.

259
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,924
The corpses would be in pieces
if they were attacked by monsters.

260
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,718
Judging by the mess,

261
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,512
they were here for sure.

262
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,850
Most of the bodies here
have gunshot wounds as well.

263
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,060
They might have already gotten away.

264
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,066
Stand back.

265
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,278
I'm detecting a monster
in the debris up ahead, sir.

266
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,007
Target location confirmed.

267
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,177
I think it's hiding in the debris.
Permission to blow it up, sir.

268
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,179
Granted.

269
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,398
There are more than one.
We got one here as well.

270
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,328
Cease fire!

271
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,851
It's headed your way, Kim.

272
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,102
Prepare to fire.

273
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,814
Prepare to fire.

274
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,107
Seok-chan, you're with me!

275
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,754
The monster is moving
rapidly toward the front.

276
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,237
Where the fuck did that come from?

277
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,797
Hey!

278
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,093
Back off if you want to
save your offspring.

279
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,268
Back off!

280
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,654
Hold this, Seok-chan.

281
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:33,177
Mommy…

282
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,433
Mommy…

283
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,776
Mommy…

284
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,830
That's enough.

285
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,302
Out of the way.

286
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,641
What are you doing, sir?

287
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,362
You just let a monster live.

288
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,407
"Kill any monster on sight
to stop this crisis."

289
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,912
That's our mission
as the Crow Platoon, isn't it?

290
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,960
Sergeant First Class Kim.

291
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,672
We only take out monsters
that harm humans.

292
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,090
That's…

293
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,093
the Crow Platoon's mission.

294
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,288
We need to make a good first impression.

295
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,041
We're about to meet others like us.

296
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,003
"Special infectee"?

297
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,338
I fucking hate that name.

298
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,008
Any ideas?

299
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,222
How about "neohuman"?

300
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,562
Does it still hurt?

301
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,983
I didn't mean to do that.

302
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,611
Sorry.

303
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,405
So your plan is to go on a shopping spree?

304
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,326
Why did you bring me here?

305
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,538
So you could live.

306
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,666
I didn't want you to be captured
and regret it all.

307
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,254
I saved you so you can live in freedom.

308
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,177
Humans won't give up.

309
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,057
They captured and then lost you,

310
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,851
so they'll feel anxious
and chase you down until the end.

311
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,729
I don't care.

312
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,648
It was my decision.

313
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,610
That's right.

314
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,572
You handed yourself over to the soldiers.

315
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,784
Why?

316
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,328
I told you.

317
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,080
That they'll puncture you

318
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,998
and rip you apart over and over again.

319
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,959
I told you countless times!

320
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,628
Is that why you ran?

321
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,258
Because you were scared?

322
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,015
I just wanted to live.

323
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,604
Find a new purpose.

324
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,861
Don't think about saving mankind
and all that crap.

325
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,656
Think about how you want to live.

326
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,076
There's gotta be a reason
you became a neohuman.

327
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,706
I don't want to live like you

328
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,375
at the cost of others' lives.

329
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,139
Help me!

330
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,433
Mine!

331
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,475
Bring it here!

332
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,979
Help me!

333
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,106
Mine!

334
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,275
-Mine!
-Help me!

335
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,569
-Give me!
-Help me!

336
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,528
Help--

337
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,455
I don't want to fight you.

338
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,708
So from now on,
I won't kill anyone without a reason.

339
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,550
You mean that?

340
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,177
Absolutely!

341
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,137
I promise I won't harm anyone first.

342
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,981
Unless they get in the way.

343
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,291
Dior.

344
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,209
Hermès.

345
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,657
How will you find

346
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,076
more beings like us?

347
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,954
We don't have to.

348
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,456
We're going to them right now.

349
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,296
They're all locked up in Bamseom,

350
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,590
where they were taking you.

351
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,719
I was going there anyway.

352
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,516
So why did you…

353
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,184
No, that's not…

354
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,228
That's not it.

355
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,856
You would have looked pathetic.

356
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,358
We can't be dragged there.

357
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,902
We'll walk in there ourselves.

358
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,451
Aren't you excited?

359
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,537
You'll be saving neohumans this time.

360
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,956
You'll know when you meet them.

361
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,418
The reason you were chosen.

362
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,457
This is Gate 2.

363
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,917
Unreported Black Kite vehicle approaching.

364
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,715
Major.

365
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,259
Weren't you out on an operation?

366
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,761
We have an urgent report to make.

367
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,764
You have to sign the log
and have your identity confirmed.

368
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,475
Don't you know me?
I told you it was urgent. Open up!

369
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,951
The vehicle is clear. It's coming through.

370
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,469
BAMSEOM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUREAU

371
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,809
How far do you think you can make it?

372
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,952
Do you think my soldiers will stand around

373
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,412
when their commander is gone?

374
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,122
We passed the gate with no problem.

375
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,791
That means no one's reported you missing.

376
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,462
The military is too busy
to be worried about you.

377
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,625
All troops. It's an emergency.

378
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,419
Two men presumed to be
special infectees are approaching.

379
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,922
All troops, return to the base immediately
and reinforce security at Gate 2.

380
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,140
I thought I forgot about it all.

381
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,312
But I still remember the pain

382
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,023
as clear as day.

383
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,393
We survived…

384
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,398
in this world.

385
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,900
We should live more decently
as human beings.

386
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,443
Get out.

387
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,196
Get out.

388
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,952
Get out of my head!

389
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,011
Stay away.

390
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,181
Get away from me!

391
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,475
You monster.

392
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,148
Why are you doing this to us?

393
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,916
Just kill me.

394
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,796
I don't want to hurt anymore.

395
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:30,764
Mom…

396
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,891
Mom…

397
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,883
Beginning the test on sample D-126.

398
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:49,861
Hui-ji.

399
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,573
Hui-ji.

400
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,201
The subject is
the biological mother of D-126.

401
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,036
She volunteered for the test.

402
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,247
-Her type?
-Yellow.

403
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,708
According to the mother,
she suffered from hate comments.

404
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,085
Where are you, Hui-ji? It's Mom.

405
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,671
Hui-ji.

406
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,340
Hui-ji, Mom's here.

407
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:14,970
Is that you?

408
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,059
Hui-ji, it's me.

409
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,521
Hui-ji.

410
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,086
Bonds formed pre-monsterization

411
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,088
had no effect on a Type Yellow.

412
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,548
Test over.

413
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,729
No!

414
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,647
No, Hui-ji!

415
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,524
No! Let go of me!

416
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,110
No!

417
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,491
Hui-ji!

418
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,827
No!

419
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:22,704
No!

420
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,165
Hui-ji!

421
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,170
Hui-ji!

422
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,716
Hui-ji…

423
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,052
No!

424
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,559
Hui-ji…

425
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,027
No, Hui-ji!

426
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,638
I shouldn't have taken this fucking body.

427
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:22,973
I definitely shouldn't have.

428
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:29,312
I never liked this son of a bitch.

429
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,079
Why the fuck isn't it working?

430
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,727
Running away again?

431
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,068
God damn it.

432
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,454
Did you say we were chosen?

433
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:28,914
You're wrong.

434
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,250
We were abandoned.

435
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,587
Look at you.

436
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,132
You can't live without humans.

437
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,344
You are…

438
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,679
nothing but a parasite.

439
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,431
Fuck you!

440
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:52,145
Shut up, you piece of shit.

441
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,624
Come with me.

442
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,542
Let go.

443
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,586
Let go, you motherfucker.

444
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,588
Let go!

445
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,799
Let go, you son of a bitch!

446
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,843
I'll fucking kill you!

447
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,681
Fucking son of a bitch.

448
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,307
Let go.

449
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,977
Let go, you motherfucker!

450
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,981
Son of a bitch. I'm going to kill you.

451
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,233
I'll fucking kill you, motherfucker!

452
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,609
I'll kill you.

453
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,319
Try to hang in there.

454
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,531
Two is better than one, don't you think?

455
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,865
Crazy bastard.

456
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,411
You think they'll accept you
as a human being?

457
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,832
Fuck.

458
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,584
You'll be ripped apart
for pointless experiments

459
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,462
and end up regretting everything!

460
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,093
Please.

461
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,761
I can't go back there.

462
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,556
We'll both die in there!

463
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,515
Please.

464
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,809
Please don't do this.

465
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,355
Look at me.

466
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,191
I can't go back there.

467
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,194
Please!

468
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,779
Please.

469
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,283
Why the hell

470
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:31,369
won't you believe me?

471
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,664
Why?

472
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,754
Because I don't want to forget.

473
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,216
I don't ever want to forget…

474
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,178
the fact…

475
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,890
that I'm human.

476
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,770
Fine.

477
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,524
Welcome to hell.
