<i>MY NAME IS OLIVER QUEEN.</i>

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,045
<i>AFTER 5 YEARS IN HELL,
I RETURNED HOME</i>

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,841
<i>WITH ONLY ONE GOAL...
TO SAVE MY CITY.</i>

4
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>TODAY, I FIGHT THAT WAR
ON TWO FRONTS.</i>

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,929
<i>BY DAY, I LEAD STAR CITY
AS ITS MAYOR,</i>

6
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,639
<i>BUT BY NIGHT,
I AM SOMEONE ELSE.</i>

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,016
<i>I AM...
SOMETHING ELSE.</i>

8
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,059
<i>I AM THE GREEN ARROW.</i>

<i>PREVIOUSLY ON</i> "ARROW"...</i>

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,399
THAT'S WHY YOU WON'T TELL
ME WHO PROMETHEUS IS.

11
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:27,027
TALIA:<i>HE CALLS
HIMSELF ADRIAN CHASE.</i>

FELICITY:<i>ADRIAN CHASE.</i>

14
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,949
SIMON MORRISON IS
HIS BIRTH NAME.
THAT'S HIS REAL IDENTITY.

15
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,450
DADDY'S DECIDED YOU'RE
GONNA COME HOME WITH ME.

16
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,743
I PROMISE.

17
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,286
I SPOKE
TO CURTIS' LAWYER FRIEND.

18
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,788
I PUT THINGS IN MOTION.

19
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,789
GOOD FOR YOU.

20
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:39,999
I AM GETTING DEEPER

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,291
AND DEEPER INTO THE MUCK.

22
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,960
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOU HAVE TO QUIT.

23
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:46,045
I AM BROKEN, OK? I NEED
YOU TO LET ME GO.

24
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,923
YOUR RESIGNATION'S
ACCEPTED.

25
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,593
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

26
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,345
I'M SHUTTING EVERYTHING DOWN.

00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,976
-HEY.
-GOOD MORNING.

28
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,478
ACTUALLY, IT'S A LOUSY ONE.

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,271
TELL ME.

30
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,691
LAST NIGHT, JUDGE BALDERRAMA
GRANTED RETRIALS

31
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,860
ON ALL THE CASES THAT
CHASE PROSECUTED.

32
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,153
WELL, THAT'S BAD, BUT,
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T...

33
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,489
WHAT, RELEASE THEM ON BAIL?
YUP. THAT HAPPENED, TOO.

34
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:13,657
SON OF A BITCH.

35
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,950
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

36
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,618
AND NOW WE GOT
36 VIOLENT FELONS

37
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,286
WALKING AROUND
ON THE STREETS.

38
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,997
WELL, PUT THE MOST
DANGEROUS ONES
UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

39
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,498
YEAH. IT'S ALREADY DONE.

40
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,418
LISTEN, OLIVER, WHERE ARE
WE ON FINDING CHASE?

41
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,880
RIGHT WHERE HE IS.
WE'RE NOWHERE.

42
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,215
I'M SORRY, MR. MAYOR,
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK
YOU TO LEAVE THE BUILDING.

43
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,675
WHAT? WHY?

44
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,385
A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE WAS
RECEIVED BY YOUR OFFICE.

45
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,094
-WHEN?
-JUST NOW.

46
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,221
A LARGE CRATE THAT SET
OFF THE DOGS.

47
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,015
BOMB SQUAD'S ON THE WAY.

48
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,600
WELL, ANY INDICATION WHERE
IT WAS DELIVERED FROM?

49
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,185
NO RETURN ADDRESS, BUT THE
SENDER'S A SIMON MORRISON.

50
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,938
SIR, I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO...

51
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,689
THEN RESIGN.

52
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,316
LOOK, I ENJOY GETTING
BLOWN UP JUST AS MUCH
AS THE NEXT GUY,

53
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,693
BUT AM I MISSING
SOMETHING HERE?

54
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,528
IT'S CHASE. SIMON MORRISON'S
HIS REAL NAME.

55
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,238
[SIGHS]
FINE.

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,531
BUT THAT'S NO REASON TO
GET YOURSELF...ALL OF US
BLOWN UP.

57
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,075
STEP AWAY.

58
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,952
-SIR, WE CAN'T LET YOU...
-I'VE GOT THIS. STEP AWAY.

59
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,703
QUENTIN: DON'T WORRY. HE WAS
A BOMB DEFUSER IN A PAST LIFE.

60
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,496
OFFICER: WE DON'T BELIEVE
IT'S AN INCENDIARY DEVICE.

61
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,915
SNAKE-CAM SHOWED
THE PRESENCE

62
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,124
OF CONCRETE
AND BUILDING MATERIALS.

63
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,250
THAT COULD'VE
SET OFF THE DOGS.

64
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,086
CONCRETE?

65
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,296
SIR, PROTOCOL STILL
REQUIRES WE WAIT
FOR THE BOMB SQUAD.

66
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,297
MR. MAYOR.

67
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,101
WHAT THE HELL?

68
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,237
WHO IS HE?

69
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,324
ACCORDING TO DENTAL
RECORDS, HENRY GOODWIN.

70
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,576
-RING ANY BELLS?
-NO. NOT A NOTE.

71
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,578
HE WAS A COUNCILMAN IN
THE GLADES BACK IN '02.

72
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,538
CHASE WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN OLD ENOUGH
TO DRINK BACK THEN.

73
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,499
RIGHT. AND SO FAR,
THERE ARE NO CONNECTIONS

74
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,375
BETWEEN GOODWIN AND CHASE
THAT WE CAN FIND.

75
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,919
AND GOODWIN WAS REPORTED
MISSING IN 2002.

76
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,504
HE WAS DECLARED DEAD IN '03.

77
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,923
THE QUESTION IS, WHY
WOULD CHASE SEND OLIVER

78
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,508
A 15-YEAR-OLD BODY

79
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,010
THAT NEITHER OF THEM
ARE CONNECTED TO?

80
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,511
NO IDEA.

81
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,471
THEN AGAIN, CHASE IS CRAZY.

82
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,016
OK. PULL ALL THE FORENSICS
THAT YOU CAN FIND.

83
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,182
TRY AND FIND A CONNECTION

84
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,435
BETWEEN EITHER CHASE
OR HIS FATHER.

85
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,771
-NAME'S JUSTIN CLAYBOURNE.
-CLAYBOURNE.

86
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,316
AND IF THERE IS
NO CONNECTION?

87
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,901
THERE HAS TO BE
A CONNECTION.

88
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,695
CHASE DOES EVERYTHING
FOR A REASON.

89
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,237
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IT IS.

90
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,739
THAT'S GONNA BE
A TALL ORDER, OLIVER.

91
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,491
WE'RE ALREADY SPREAD THIN
KEEPING AN EYE ON THE GUYS

92
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,242
THAT CHASE WAS
PROSECUTING WHO GOT KICKED.

93
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,870
I HAVE ASKED QUENTIN
TO TASK THE SCPD

94
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,371
WITH MONITORING THE MOST
DANGEROUS ONES.

FELICITY: WHICH LEAVES
US WITH THE EXTREMELY

96
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,542
DANGEROUS ONES,
I'M GUESSING.

97
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,752
OOH, ZOMBIE "I CAN'T
FEEL PAIN" DEREK SAMPSON

98
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,337
HAS MY VOTE.

99
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,381
WHAT'S HE BEEN UP TO
SINCE GETTING OUT OF PRISON?

100
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,133
PARTYING LIKE A GUY WHO
JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON.

101
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,801
LET'S STAY ON HIM
AND WHOEVER ELSE WE THINK

102
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,594
ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS.

103
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,262

THE CONCRETE

WE MAKE A MOVE.

108
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,067

HOW IS IT GOING
WITH, UH...

TROUBLE FINDING HIM.

113
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,867
SAMANTHA DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB

114
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,618
AT HIDING HERSELF
AND WILLIAM.

115
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,579
WELL, IF FELICITY SMOAK
CAN'T FIND HIM,

116
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,455
I FEEL BETTER ABOUT
CHASE NOT BEING ABLE TO,

117
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,541
SO THANK YOU.

118
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,678
MAYBE DRINKING BEFORE
FLYING NOT SUCH GOOD IDEA.

119
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,805
OR NOT DRINK ENOUGH.

120
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,390
I DON'T KNOW.

121
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,102
WEATHER'S GETTING WORSE.
MEANS WE'RE CLOSE.

122
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,353
I PRETEND THAT IS
GOOD THING.

MENTIONING YOU KNOW HOW TO FLY.

WHERE YOU LEARN?

00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,275
YEAH, MY DAD LOVED
VINTAGE PLANES.

126
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,902
HE WOULD TAKE ME UP
ALL THE TIME.

127
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,946
ONE OF MY LAST
HAPPY MEMORIES.

128
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,739
AND I'M GUESSING,
THIS NOT ONE OF THEM.

ROBERT: I'M NOT THE MAN
YOU THINK I AM, OLIVER.

130

I DIDN'T SAVE OUR CITY.
I FAILED IT.

131
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,828
I DID A TERRIBLE THING.

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,289
YOU CAN RIGHT MY WRONGS.

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,375
YOU CAN SAVE
THIS CITY.

134
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,877
WHY YOU WANT ME
WATCHING THIS?

135
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,255
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY I HAVE TO GO BACK.

136
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,467
WHAT, TO STARLING CITY
OR TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE?

MEAN YOU STRUCK OUT?

A PROPRIETARY FORMULA.

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,023
IT'S OWNED BY A SPECIFIC
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY.

WITH THE LOSER LOOK?

OFF ALL THAT?

BECAUSE I DID ID A SUSPECT

156
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,444
FOR YOUR PROTECTION.

157
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,362
AND SAY THAT, OLLIE.

158
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,074
I THINK YOU KNOW I CAN
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

159
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,202
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF, THEA.

160
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,703
IT HAS TO DO

161
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,288
WITH WHAT ADRIAN CHASE
IS CAPABLE OF.

162
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,956
YOU MEAN AN OSCAR-WORTHY
PERFORMANCE

163
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,624
OF A DECENT
HUMAN BEING?

164
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,626
AS BETRAYALS GO, IT
MAKES ISABEL ROCHEV

165
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,419
LOOK LIKE A BAD
PRACTICAL JOKE.

166
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,924
I'M SURE. BUT I...I
KNOW CHASE IS DANGEROUS.

167
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,718
AND I KNOW YOU'RE
WORRIED,

168
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,387
BUT I JUST...I WASN'T
READY TO COME BACK YET.

169
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,016
WERE YOU WITH ROY OR...?

170
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,391
I COULDN'T
LET HIM SEE ME

171
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,852
IN THE STATE I'M IN.

172
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,229
WHAT STATE ARE YOU IN?

173
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,231
THE PHRASE "HOT MESS"
COMES TO MIND.

174
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,732
[CHUCKLES]

175
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,275
I DON'T KNOW.

176
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,069
I'M FIGURING IT OUT.

177
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,364
WELL, I'M GLAD.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

178
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,741
OLIVER, I...

179
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,285
THEA, WH...WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

180
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,453
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.

181
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,206
NO, SORRY. IT'S...
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

182
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,665
IT'S JUST, UM,

183
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,292
WELL, IT'S JUST
BAD TIMING IS ALL.

184
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,336
UM, MAYBE WE SHOULD
DO THIS IN PRIVATE.

185
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,670
IS IT REGARDING
COUNCILMAN GOODWIN?

186
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,963
UH, YOU KNOW, YEAH.

187
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,006
I THINK MAYBE WE
SHOULD COME BACK LATER.

188
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,299
WHAT IS GOING ON?

189
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,800
CHASE SENT
A 15-YEAR-OLD CORPSE

190
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,387
TO MY OFFICE THIS MORNING
AS SOME KIND OF MESSAGE.

191
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,347
DO WE HAVE A SUSPECT?

192
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,307
YEAH.
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

193
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,767
OK.

194
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,187
WHO IS IT?

195
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,356
IT'S YOUR FATHER.

196
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,531
THIS IS CHASE. OBVIOUSLY
HE'S FRAMING OUR FATHER.

197
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,075
YEAH, BUT TO WHAT END?

198
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,826
QUENTIN: THE CONCRETE CAME
FROM WELLWARD CONSTRUCTION,

199
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,246
WHICH WAS A SUBSIDIARY
OF QUEEN CONSOLIDATED.

200
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,415
DINAH: AND THE SKIN UNDER
THE VICTIM'S FINGERNAILS

201
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,125
MATCHES MR. QUEEN'S DNA.

202
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,501
AND THE PROBLEM IS ALL THOSE
FORENSICS PASSED THROUGH

203
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,129
A WHOLE LOT OF LABS.

204
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,672
YOU CAN'T KEEP THIS FROM
GOING PUBLIC, CAN YOU?

205
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,759
NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING,
BELIEVE ME.
I'M SORRY, OLIVER.

206
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,305
DINAH, I NEED YOU TO GET
DNA AND CONCRETE SAMPLES
TO FELICITY AND CURTIS.

207
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,224
OUR FATHER IS BEING
FRAMED, AND WE NEED
TO START TO PROVE IT.

208
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,268
I'M SURE A COUPLE OF PIECES
OF EVIDENCE CAN GO MISSING.

209
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,518
AND WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA BE DOING?

210
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,062
HOLDING A
PRESS CONFERENCE.

211
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,563
I JUST WEATHERED
A SCANDAL.

212
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,065
I NEED TO GET OUT
IN FRONT OF THIS ONE.

213
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,737
OK, WELL, I THINK YOU
SHOULD RECONSIDER

214
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,656
DOING THIS
WHOLE PRESS CONFERENCE.

215
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,949
WHY?

216
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,533
BECAUSE THIS COULD BE

217
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,161
WHAT CHASE IS
MANIPULATING YOU INTO

218
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,537
JUST LIKE HE MANIPULATED YOU
INTO THE IMPEACHMENT

219
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,581
BY THROWING GREEN ARROW
UNDER THE BUS.

220
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,292
BUT LIKE WITH THE
IMPEACHMENT, I NEEDED TO...

221
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,127
LIE TO THE PRESS?

222
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,129
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING

223
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,880
IF WE FIND OUT
THAT DAD IS GUILTY.

224
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,174
THEA, COME ON.

225
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,759
LOOK, I AM JUST SAYING...

226
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,470
WHAT IF?

227
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,680
IT'S NOT LIKE OUR PARENTS
WERE SAINTS.

228
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,556
CHASE THINKS
I'M A KILLER.

229
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,392
WHAT HE'S DOING,
THIS WHOLE SETUP,

230
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,186
IS HIM TRYING
TO CONVINCE ME

231
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,980
THAT OUR FATHER WAS
THE SAME WAY.

232
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,317
OUR FATHER WAS
A LOT OF THINGS.

233
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,111
HE'S NOT A COLD-BLOODED
MURDERER.

234
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,115
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CONVINCED ME

235
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,450
TO COME BACK
TO THIS ISLAND.

236
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,035
WELL, FLY HOME ANYTIME
YOU WANT, ANATOLY.

237
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,204
SO YOU HAVE IRONY
BACK IN AMERICA, YES?

238
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,663
TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO,

239
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,748
NO ONE CAN KNOW WHAT
I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

240
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,378
YOU MEAN IN RUSSIA?

241
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:10,008
RUSSIA,
IN HONG KONG.

242
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,926
HOW DO I EXPLAIN
TO MY FAMILY

243
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,262
WHY I DIDN'T COME
HOME SOONER?

244
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:18,975
NO. IT'S EASIER IF I'M
JUST A SIMPLE CASTAWAY.

245
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,810
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS SIMPLE CASTAWAY.

246
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,062
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

247
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,231
JUST...IT WILL BE EASIER
TO KEEP MY COVER

248
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,400
IF NO ONE IS ASKING
QUESTIONS.

249
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,076
THAT'S A BAD OMEN.

250
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,952
HE WAS MY FRIEND.

251
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,372
IF THAT WAS TRUE, HE WOULD
NOT HAVE TRIED TO KILL US.

252
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,421
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

253
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,297
WELL, THIS JUST WASHED
UP ON THE SHORE

254
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,883
LIKE SOME KIND OF SIGN.

255
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,468
YEAH, THAT YOU'RE CRAZY.

256
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,221
COME ON.

257
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,139
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

258
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,559
I'M TAKING YOU SOMEWHERE
TO EXPLAIN

259
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,643
WHY I'M DOING
WHAT I'M DOING.

260
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,771
I SPENT A YEAR
ON THIS ISLAND.

261
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,440
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
THERE WAS A BAR.

262
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,195
HEY, YOU BUSY?

263
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,696
UH, YEAH. I'M JUST
GOING OVER

264
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,323
COUNCILMAN GOODWIN'S
APPOINTMENTS.

265
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,658
I'M LOOKING FOR AN ALIBI
FOR OLIVER'S FATHER.

266
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,994
UH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON FREED FELON PATROL.

267
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,621
I JUST GOT SOME GOOD
NEWS. FIGURED I'D SHARE IT.

268
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,499
PLEASE. GOOD NEWS IS IN
SHORT SUPPLY AROUND HERE.

269
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,501
I GOT A COURT DATE.

270
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,503
HA! FINALLY YOU'RE
GETTING PROSECUTED.
THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

271
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,297
FUNNY. IT'S FOR ZOE.

272
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,715
LAWYER THINKS I CAN GET
EXPEDITED CUSTODY.

273
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,511
OH, WOW. THAT'S TERRIFIC.
HUH. GOOD FOR YOU, HOSS!

274
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,096
[CHUCKLES]

275
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,432
I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

276
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,184
SINCE YOU, UH,
GAVE ME THE PUSH, YOU...

277
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,606
"YOU'D, UH...SHOW UP
FOR MORAL SUPPORT"?

278
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,234
IT'D BE AN HONOR.

279
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,529
NOW, GET OUT OF HERE.

280
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,411
I GOT YOUR 911 CALL.

281
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,912
GAS CHROMATOGRAPH
KICKED BACK

282
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,705
SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING
ON THAT CONCRETE.

283
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,124
TRACES OF SOIL

284
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,543
WITH HIGH LEVELS
OF COPPER CONCENTRATION.

285
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,545
YEAH, I THINK YOU AND I
HAVE VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS

286
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,631
OF WHAT
"INTERESTING" MEANS.

287
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,882
UH...WELL, I CROSS-REFERENCED

288
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,926
QUEEN CONSOLIDATED
CONSTRUCTION LOCATIONS

289
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,512
WITH AREAS IN THE CITY
RICH IN COPPER, AND...

290
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,138
AND YOU THINK YOU KNOW
WHERE GOODWIN WAS KILLED.

291
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,932
WELL, NOTHING
CONCRETE. BUT, YEAH.

292
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,809
IF CHASE IS TRYING
TO SEND A MESSAGE...

293
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,436
HE MIGHT BE SAYING,
"COME FIND ME."

294
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,146
OK. SEND THIS ADDRESS TO
OLIVER. I'LL MEET HIM THERE.

295
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,772
WHAT ABOUT CURTIS
AND DINAH?

296
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,899
THEY ARE STAKING OUT
DEREK SAMPSON.

297
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,656
CURTIS: LOOKS LIKE SAMPSON'S
NOT FINISHED PARTYING.

298
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,616
DINAH: HUH. EXCEPT HE'S
MOVED ON FROM STRIPPERS

299
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,451
TO M4 ASSAULT RIFLES.

300
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,370
SHOULD WE MOVE ON HIM?

301
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,497
FOR ALL WE KNOW, THOSE
GUNS COULD BE LEGAL.

302
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,165
SO IF WE GO IN NOW, THE SCPD
MIGHT NOT HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE

303
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,083
TO PUT HIM BACK BEHIND BARS.

304
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,585
EXACTLY.

305
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,671
-SO WHAT DO WE DO?
-WE WAIT.

306
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,255
SEE WHAT HIS PLAN HIS.

307
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,840
TRUST ME, WHEN IT COMES
TO THIS GUY,

308
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,551
IT'S ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING GOOD.

309
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,762

I KNOW. MY FATHER
BROUGHT ME HERE
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

313
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,270
SAID THE BUILDING
WAS NAMED AFTER ME.

CHASE WANTED EVERYONE
CLEARED OUT.

317
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,901
IT SEEMS THAT WAY.

318
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,695
IT'S A HELL OF
A BIG BUILDING.

319
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,363
IF HE'S IN THERE,
WE SHOULD GET STARTED.

JOHN: IF CHASE WANTED
YOU HERE FOR SOME REASON,

321
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,784
HE COULD HAVE BEEN
MORE SPECIFIC
ABOUT WHICH FLOOR.

THE SEARCH FOR US?

00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,845
WHAT'S CHASE PLAYING AT?

329
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,934
I HAD TO ASK.

330
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,686
OLIVER: IT'S CONCRETE.

JUST LIKE COUNCILMAN GOODWIN.

OF THOSE SMART IDEAS,

I'M IN THE MARKET!

334

THESE MONTHS,

IS CHASE'S ENDGAME.

OK, I'M DIALING UP
A RESCUE, BUT IT'S GONNA
TAKE A FEW MINUTES.

338
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,292
I'M NOT SURE HOW
MANY MORE OF THOSE
MINUTES WE'VE GOT!

00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,713
OK. HERE WE GO.

-SAMPSON'S ON THE MOVE.

342
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,426

TO PROVE A POINT.

345
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,059
WHAT THE HELL IS
HIS POINT?

346
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,019
HE FRAMED MY FATHER FOR
THE SAME KIND OF MURDER.

IT PROVES THE APPLE DOESN'T
FALL FAR FROM THE TREE, HUH?

BUT HE'S A PSYCHOPATH.

OF THAT.

THAT SAMPSON'S
WORKING WITH CHASE.

IT MAKES SENSE.

SAMPSON GOT OUT OF PRISON.

THOSE TWO BEFORE?

00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,351
FOR A REASON. WHAT WAS
THE THIRD CHEMICAL?

384
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,228
CYCLOTRIZANE. BUT THAT'S
HIGHLY UNSTABLE,

385

BACK IN '02,

BUT WE THINK THEY DIDN'T
GET THE WHOLE STORY.

COFFMAN WAS GOODWIN'S
LAWYER,

402

BUT NOT JUST HIS LAWYER.

403
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,179
COFFMAN ALSO REPRESENTED
CHASE'S OLD MAN.

YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

409
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,490
IT'S REGARDING THE RECENT
REPORTS ABOUT OUR FATHER.

410
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,492
I NEVER HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY

TO MEET HIM.

412
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,913
BUT YOUR FATHER DID
SOME REMARKABLE THINGS

413
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,330
FOR THIS CITY.

414
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,583
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH
HIS REPUTATION RIGHT NOW

415
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,585
IS SIMPLY TERRIBLE,

416
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,253
BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

417
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,838
WHAT IT COULD HAVE
TO DO WITH ME.

418
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,465
REPORTEDLY, YOU WERE
THE LAST PERSON SEEN

419
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,592
WITH COUNCILMAN GOODWIN.

420
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,137
I'M SYMPATHETIC TO
YOUR DESIRE TO IDENTIFY

421
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:15,850
A SUSPECT WHO ISN'T
YOUR FATHER, BUT...

422
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,855
WHAT'S THIS?

423
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,356
I HAVE NO IDEA.

424
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,442
BUT I WAS ASKED
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

425
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,402
-BY WHO?
-ADRIAN CHASE.

426
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,697
OR AS I KNEW HIM,
SIMON MORRISON.

427
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,450
YOU'VE BEEN IN CONTACT
WITH HIM?

428
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,577
WHY DIDN'T YOU ALERT
THE SCPD?

429
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,996
YOU'VE MET HIM.
YOU KNOW WHY.

430
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,166
THE MAN IS TERRIFYING
AND SMART.

431
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,585
HE SAID
YOU'D SEEK ME OUT

432
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,087
AND THAT WHEN YOU DID
I SHOULD GIVE YOU THAT.

433
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,465
HE SAID IT PROVES
THE KIND OF MAN

434
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,258
YOUR FATHER TRULY WAS.

435
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,845
I KNOW WHAT KIND OF MAN
OUR FATHER WAS.

436
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:55,473
AND HE WAS NOWHERE CLOSE
TO CHASE'S FATHER.

437
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,600
YOU WERE
JUSTIN CLAYBOURNE'S LAWYER.

438
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,769
YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM,

439
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,354
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS SON.

440
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,731
ATTORNEY-CLIENT
CONFIDENTIALITY.

441
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,692
I COULDN'T TELL
YOU ANYTHING

442
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,067
EVEN IF
I WANTED TO.

443
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,529
ACTUALLY, I THINK
YOU WANT TO.

444
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,822
THEA, EASY.

445
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,449
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

446
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,579
ANATOLY: GOSPODI POMILUI.

447
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,750
TAIANA. WAS THAT THE ONE
YOU KILLED KOVAR FOR?

448
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,337
THAT'S MY FATHER.

449
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,172
HE'S THE REASON
I HAVE TO GO BACK

450
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,174
THE WAY I HAVE
TO GO BACK.

451
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,385
THAT VIDEO.

452
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,387
HE WANTS YOU TO SAVE
YOUR HOME.

453
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,764
I DO NOT THINK KAPIUSHON
IS WHAT HE HAD IN MIND.

454
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,391
PUTTING ON THE HOOD

455
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,894
IS THE ONLY WAY I KNOW
HOW TO SAVE MY CITY.

456
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,187
NOW, I'VE TOLD YOU, OLIVER,
HOOD IS JUST PIECE OF CLOTH.

457
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,773
IT...NOT THAT YOU LISTEN
TO ME ANYWAY.

458
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,150
THE HOOD, ANATOLY,
IS AN IDENTITY.

459
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,820
ONE YOU THINK CHANNELS
MONSTER INSIDE YOU.

460
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,780
AND PROTECTS THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE CLOSEST TO ME.

461
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,407
I DO IT THIS WAY,

462
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,325
