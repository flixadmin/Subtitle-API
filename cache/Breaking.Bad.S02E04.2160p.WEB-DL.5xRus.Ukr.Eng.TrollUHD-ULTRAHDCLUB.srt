1
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:50,737
Hey, Captain America.

2
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,075
- What's up, brother?
- Hey, bro.

3
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:14,344
This is stupid.

4
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:19,432
- You got a better idea?
- Okay, fun. Whatever.

5
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,769
- So when do we, you know?
- We don't, for now.

6
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,188
No cooking until things settle down.

7
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,275
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

8
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,735
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal

9
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,282
that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't...

10
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:39,126
That's too expensive.

11
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:51,130
Look, I can't leave my house,

12
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,841
for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

13
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,760
I need time to mend fences.

14
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:59,806
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

15
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,643
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

16
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,573
That's $600.

17
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,157
Okay, what about the rest?

18
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,829
- Rest of what?
- Half your money's mine.

19
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,372
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

20
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,626
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

21
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,920
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

22
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:34,004
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

23
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:43,516
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

24
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:47,437
As for now, no contact. Understood?

25
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:51,024
Where are you going?

26
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,027
I leave first.

27
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:15,298
- Walt!
- In the kitchen.

28
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,981
Hey.

29
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:36,319
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

30
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:39,822
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

31
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,574
Juice is on the table.

32
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,121
What?

33
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,126
- Good morning, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,879
Dad's cooking breakfast.

35
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,924
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

36
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,387
Nice? Follow me.

37
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,598
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice

38
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,768
which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

39
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:13,106
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

40
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:17,110
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

41
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,655
I wanted to.

42
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,827
- Grapefruit juice?
- Yes, please. Thanks.

43
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,581
There you go. Honey?

44
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,125
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

45
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:37,839
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

46
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:39,591
- Yeah.
- There you go.

47
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,302
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

48
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,471
- No.
- Yes, absolutely.

49
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,266
No, in terms of pure musicianship

50
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:51,435
I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

51
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,063
You wouldn't know any current bands.

52
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:57,498
- That's besides the point.
- Have a good day, honey.

53
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,152
You too.

54
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,656
- Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
- Boz Scaggs.

55
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:07,368
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

56
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:08,702
- Bye.
- You're welcome.

57
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,371
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

58
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,998
All right.

59
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,296
Our son doesn't know who Boz Scaggs is.

60
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,757
We have failed as parents.

61
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,566
Come to think of it

62
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:25,303
- I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
- Stop it.

63
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:28,681
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

64
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,308
Thank you.

65
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,937
Hey, listen

66
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,356
in the calendar section

67
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,025
all week long

68
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:43,571
there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

69
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,158
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published,

70
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,869
- and that sort of thing.
- Yeah?

71
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:55,917
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might...

72
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,962
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

73
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,517
Oh, and

74
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:16,646
you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

75
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:19,205
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

76
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,901
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot,

77
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,240
and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

78
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:33,913
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder

79
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:37,250
to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

80
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,421
And, well, the weird thing is that

81
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:45,425
the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same

82
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,761
as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design

83
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,599
if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

84
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,935
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound

85
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,438
other than the phone ring, but...

86
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:01,816
They so overcomplicate these things.

87
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:07,447
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

88
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:10,825
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

89
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:14,871
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home

90
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,124
we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

91
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:23,171
Skyler?

92
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,476
Skyler?

93
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:29,487
- Ready?
- Yo, for what, might help.

94
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:41,207
Not another intervention.

95
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:52,510
Jesse Bruce Pinkman

96
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:55,555
pursuant to Section 47-8-13

97
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,813
of the New Mexico Real Property Code

98
00:09:57,932 --> 00:09:59,975
you are hereby given notice to vacate

99
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,606
the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

100
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:08,067
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

101
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:10,820
- It's your aunt Ginny's house.
- And she gave it to me.

102
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,504
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

103
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:15,366
You were allowed residentiary privileges.

104
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:18,828
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

105
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:22,873
Look, we talked about this, okay? I'd
sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

106
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,376
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

107
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:28,254
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

108
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:30,757
No, I'm not. What?

109
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:34,552
A DEA agent came looking for you, Jesse.

110
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:37,055
He came to our front door.

111
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:44,103
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them

112
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:48,107
which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you,

113
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:50,276
so you're welcome.

114
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:52,654
I saw your basement.

115
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:54,781
Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:58,868
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in,

117
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:03,456
and I found your laboratory.

118
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,461
You guys have your own key?

119
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:18,429
Manufacture of a Schedule ll
controlled substance

120
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:21,391
is a second degree felony.

121
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:24,853
Under federal asset seizure

122
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:28,231
the government can take the entire house.

123
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:32,110
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

124
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:34,821
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life,

125
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:38,449
but you will not drag us down with you.

126
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:41,619
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

127
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,954
Otherwise,
your parents have authorised me

128
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:47,458
to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

129
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,254
Do you have any questions for us?

130
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,342
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

131
00:11:58,386 --> 00:11:59,721
Come on.

132
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:41,971
- Hi.
- Hey.

133
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:53,566
- I fixed the garage door.
- Great.

134
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,193
Yeah.

135
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,071
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

136
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,822
Okay.

137
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:04,744
- Where were you today?
- Out.

138
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:19,467
Is everything okay?

139
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:23,471
Yeah, everything's fine.

140
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:42,615
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings

141
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:44,701
the cancer support group.

142
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,744
I think that that's good.

143
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:49,622
Yeah.

144
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:52,750
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,920
You were right on the money about that.

146
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:58,423
It's good to, you know

147
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,384
talk about things.

148
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:04,012
I think that's great.

149
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,726
Yeah.

150
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:36,945
Jesse.

151
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:42,034
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

152
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:44,745
You don't answer your phone?

153
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,332
Yeah, no, I've just been

154
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,168
pretty busy. How'd you...?

155
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:55,130
Oh, right, you have that key.

156
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:57,674
Hey, listen.

157
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:01,095
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation

158
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:05,724
we had the other day,
and I completely get why

159
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:09,269
Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and...

160
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:13,190
- It's not just your father, Jesse.
- No, I know. I know. I know.

161
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:18,612
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me

162
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:21,906
which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been

163
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,411
thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

164
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:28,169
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now...

165
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:31,792
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

166
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,754
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

167
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:39,299
The time for talking has passed, Jesse.

168
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,720
Hey. Hey.

169
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:44,304
What the hell, yo?

170
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:47,807
- I thought it was just a wake-up call.
- We are putting it in storage.

171
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:50,226
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

172
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,604
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

173
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:55,941
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

174
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,445
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

175
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:00,904
I earned this.

176
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:03,449
You did not make her lunch every day.

177
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:05,409
What did you do, huh?

178
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:08,287
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

179
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:10,789
- Don't start with me.
- Now what?

180
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:14,293
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

181
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:17,755
Great family, Mom.

182
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:21,884
Why are you like this? Why?

183
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:36,398
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

184
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:39,443
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

185
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:41,028
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

186
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:44,323
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

187
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:47,826
I don't know, sweetheart.

188
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:54,333
But please turn your life around.

189
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:59,671
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

190
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:03,801
Jeez.

191
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,356
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

192
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:20,442
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

193
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:21,860
Come in and say hello.

194
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,947
Hey, we've got omelettes.
You want an omelette?

195
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:26,198
No, I'm good.

196
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:29,368
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chillies.

197
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,453
No. Thank you, though.

198
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:33,445
Flynn and me gotta get going.

199
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,376
- Who's Flynn?
- Flynn.

200
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,545
He's your...

201
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:45,592
- Flynn?
- Yeah.

202
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,386
So?

203
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:50,472
So? Nothing.

204
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:53,308
- You ready?
- Like it.

205
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:55,227
- Bye, Mr. White.
- Okay.

206
00:17:57,229 --> 00:17:58,605
Bye.

207
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:08,949
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

208
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:16,999
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

209
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:20,461
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

210
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:22,546
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

211
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:24,757
Don't take it personally.

212
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:27,926
He wants his own identity.

213
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:36,018
You think he told Louis about me?

214
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:39,688
- About the blackout?
- Louis is his friend, Walt,

215
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,483
and your disappearance upset him.

216
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:49,990
Hey, I made omelettes.

217
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,743
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

218
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,495
Where you going?

219
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:58,082
Can you get the phone, please?

220
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,961
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

221
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:11,136
<i>- White residence.
- Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?</i>

222
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,516
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

223
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:18,852
<i>- I know, but there's a problem.
- I don't care. We agreed.</i>

224
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:22,211
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

225
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:24,806
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

226
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,737
Yeah, we're happy.

227
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:32,825
Skyler? Sky?

228
00:19:35,494 --> 00:19:39,164
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

229
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:40,791
Out.

230
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:45,879
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

231
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:48,090
Skyler.

232
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:56,723
- What?
- Yo, I get I shouldn't call,

233
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:59,357
but I'm in a situation here,
and I need my money.

234
00:19:59,476 --> 00:20:01,186
I just gave you $600.

235
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:02,812
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks,

236
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:05,106
but that was before my housing situation

237
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,317
went completely testicular on me, okay?

238
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:09,528
<i>You smoked the entire 600, didn't you?</i>

239
00:20:09,737 --> 00:20:11,030
<i>- What? No.
- Yes.</i>

240
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:12,322
<i>- No.
- Look, Jesse</i>

241
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:14,131
<i>your problems are just that.:</i>

242
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:15,951
Your problems.

243
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,871
No contact. Do not call here ever.

244
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,958
<i>- When the moment is right, I will call.
- Mr. White, you're not listening.</i>

245
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,377
They're kicking me out of my house.

246
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:38,557
You son of a bitch.

247
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:45,272
Son of a bitch.

248
00:20:46,982 --> 00:20:49,234
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

249
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:52,404
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

250
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:56,241
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

251
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,828
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

252
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,704
Hold on, buddy.

253
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:45,248
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

254
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:47,459
I know. That sounded tight.

255
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:49,503
Hey, thanks again, P.

256
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:53,716
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

257
00:21:53,924 --> 00:21:55,050
Two nights tops.

258
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,678
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

259
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:00,389
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

260
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:03,934
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

261
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:06,228
Yeah.

262
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:09,731
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

263
00:22:09,815 --> 00:22:10,816
Too hot.

264
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:14,069
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

265
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:15,728
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

266
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:18,407
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

267
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:20,743
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

268
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:25,748
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

269
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:29,168
Damn. I'm hating, man.

270
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,420
That's why we need to get the Hammer
up and running, you know?

271
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:36,091
- Get you out of the house.
- How awesome would that be?

272
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,968
Come on. Look. What?

273
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:41,680
I cut all the green parts off like you...
Just eat them. Please?

274
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:45,476
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

275
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:46,810
Get back in the scene.

276
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:49,980
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

277
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:53,150
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich,

278
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,027
and then you take...

279
00:22:55,778 --> 00:22:57,821
Mommy's home.

280
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:00,908
- Hi.
- Hello.

281
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:03,535
Hey, honey, you remember Jesse Pinkman?

282
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:07,664
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

283
00:23:07,748 --> 00:23:09,666
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey.

284
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,378
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

285
00:23:14,296 --> 00:23:16,965
Sure. Yeah.

286
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:40,596
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.

287
00:23:43,826 --> 00:23:48,622
Hey, Hen, I think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

288
00:23:58,048 --> 00:24:01,385
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

289
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:06,223
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

290
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:07,882
You got other people to call?

291
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:10,436
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

292
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:12,771
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:16,442
Yo, in-laws?

294
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,446
- Sucks to be you, P.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

295
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,157
Here.

296
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:24,783
See you, man.

297
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:26,994
It's good to see you.

298
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:32,291
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and...

299
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:35,461
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

300
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:38,130
I need a solid here, bro.

301
00:24:39,214 --> 00:24:40,799
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

302
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:45,971
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

303
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:48,891
What if it's just for tonight?

304
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:09,661
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

305
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,956
- You cannot be serious.
- Hey.

306
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:16,335
Someone took your bike, man.

307
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:18,545
Not cool.

308
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,838
- Morning.
- Oh, hey.

309
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,423
Morning.

310
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:38,760
Where did...? Where did Mom go?

311
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,263
Out.

312
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:50,730
Where's breakfast?

313
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,027
Hey.

314
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,072
Let's go do something.

315
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,949
Like what?

316
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,994
Something fun.

317
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,791
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

318
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:14,045
- Is your foot on the... Okay. Good.
- Yeah. I got it.

319
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,424
Good.

320
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:22,261
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

321
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,057
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

322
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,559
Okay, let's slow down here

323
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,896
to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

324
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:35,024
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

325
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:38,068
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right. You're doing fine.

326
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:42,073
- Much better than last time, huh?
- Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

327
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,575
Has he?

328
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,120
Good. Good. Okay.

329
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,372
Don't forget the turn indic... Good.

330
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,000
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

331
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,044
And let's make that left-hand turn.

332
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:58,965
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

333
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,801
Right hand.

334
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,846
Good. Good. Okay.

335
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,310
- Are you using both feet?
- Yeah.

336
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,688
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

337
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,024
You can't use one foot on each pedal.

338
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:18,943
- Why not?
- Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

339
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:23,906
- Just stop, please. Right. All right.
- Dad, this is way easier.

340
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,440
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

341
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:30,621
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

342
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,540
- All right.
- Okay?

343
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:40,548
Okay, just... You don't have to...
Okay. All right. That's fine.

344
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,634
Just... That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

345
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:47,638
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

346
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,099
Okay.

347
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:53,686
Don't... Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

348
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:56,397
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

349
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,440
The gas, the brake, the gas, the brake.

350
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,984
I can't do this.

351
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,362
My legs don't work that way.

352
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,406
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

353
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,534
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

354
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:12,288
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

355
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,540
- All right.
- Here we go. Here we go.

356
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:19,629
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

357
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,687
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

358
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,470
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

359
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,129
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

360
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,141
- Braking.
- You're using both feet again.

361
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:34,643
- It's not stopping.
- That's the gas. Use the brake.

362
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,521
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

363
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,027
Okay.

364
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,446
That's one way to stop.

365
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,199
I told you.

366
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,867
Flynn.

367
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,064
- Hands up, asshole!
- Yo, yo, it's cool.

368
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,775
So help me, I will spread you.

369
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:07,070
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

370
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:10,114
All right? Look, this is my RV.

371
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:12,950
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

372
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,078
What the hell you doing here?

373
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:19,290
- You smell like shit.
- It's a long story.

374
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,126
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here

375
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,419
750 for the repair.

376
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:26,964
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me,

377
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:31,803
and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

378
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,429
Okay.

379
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:35,723
Here's the thing.

380
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:37,308
I can't pay you today.

381
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,894
But I can pay you this week, all right?

382
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:46,109
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

383
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:49,237
- I thought your word was your bond.
- It totally is.

384
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:53,074
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

385
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:56,619
But I will, soon.

386
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,038
Here's my counteroffer.

387
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:02,375
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

388
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:05,283
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

389
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,923
All right. Two grand. Okay?

390
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:12,677
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

391
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:17,348
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

392
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:19,892
Please, all right? I really...

393
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:25,898
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

394
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,862
Clovis, come on.

395
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,009
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

396
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,928
There's something called
methylamine. Me... Meth...

397
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,556
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

398
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:02,018
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

399
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,069
Holy shit. How much?

400
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:17,880
Hey! Hey!

401
00:35:52,957 --> 00:35:54,250
Skyler.

402
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,092
Louis took Walt to school.

403
00:36:05,261 --> 00:36:07,180
I was thinking maybe

404
00:36:07,638 --> 00:36:09,849
this would be a good time to talk.

405
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:36,793
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

406
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:40,379
In Ireland.

407
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:45,092
Weird.

408
00:36:47,512 --> 00:36:49,305
Sounds weird.

409
00:37:02,777 --> 00:37:05,238
I wanted to apologise,

410
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:07,448
for everything.

411
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:10,785
My

412
00:37:11,744 --> 00:37:14,330
Desire for privacy.

413
00:37:16,457 --> 00:37:18,167
My emotional

414
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:20,753
unavailability.

415
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,466
Having cancer doesn't excuse all that.

416
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:30,119
I haven't been a good partner to you,

417
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:33,850
and for that

418
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:36,602
I'm very sorry.

419
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,523
I love you.

420
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:44,277
And I love this family.

421
00:37:45,903 --> 00:37:47,697
And I just

422
00:37:48,281 --> 00:37:50,074
want to make sure that

423
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:53,202
we don't lose contact.

424
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:02,670
Thank you.

425
00:38:03,171 --> 00:38:04,547
Okay.

426
00:38:09,844 --> 00:38:11,304
I agree.

427
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:28,404
Is that it?

428
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:31,032
God.

429
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,409
God, how long are you gonna do this?

430
00:38:33,993 --> 00:38:36,162
- Do what?
- This.

431
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,164
Not talking to me.

432
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:41,876
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

433
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:44,461
You are obviously angry with me
about something,

434
00:38:44,545 --> 00:38:46,672
so let's talk about it.

435
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:56,641
Oh, God.

436
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:01,896
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think

437
00:39:02,104 --> 00:39:05,399
that I'm up to something.

438
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,530
- Like what?
- I have no idea, Skyler.

439
00:39:10,738 --> 00:39:14,074
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

440
00:39:14,158 --> 00:39:16,202
Is that why you asked me about the...

441
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,789
Some other phone? Because you think
that I'm being unfaithful?

442
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,835
- I don't know.
- Okay.

443
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:25,920
So ask me.

444
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:28,881
Why?

445
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:32,426
- Would you even tell me?
- Yes. I would.

446
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:34,470
Of course, I would.

447
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,934
And no. I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

448
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:42,812
Now, what do I do to prove that to you?

449
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,482
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

450
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:48,484
I heard you, Walt.

451
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:50,820
You're not having an affair.

452
00:39:51,404 --> 00:39:52,655
Congratulations.

453
00:39:52,864 --> 00:39:55,314
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

454
00:39:55,491 --> 00:39:56,576
Great job.

455
00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:58,534
What is this? What do I have to do?

456
00:39:58,703 --> 00:40:02,623
- I'm trying to talk to you, and you...
- Okay, so talk, Walt.

457
00:40:03,124 --> 00:40:07,462
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

458
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:11,632
You want to know what you have to do?

459
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:15,887
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

460
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:18,931
Today. No more excuses.

461
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,144
No more apologies.
No more of these... These obvious

462
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:25,938
desperate breakfasts.

463
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:30,443
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

464
00:40:30,735 --> 00:40:32,195
Good.

465
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:34,280
Then tell me.

466
00:40:35,782 --> 00:40:37,366
Now.

467
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:50,546
Tell you what?

468
00:40:56,385 --> 00:40:58,095
Skyler.

469
00:41:00,932 --> 00:41:04,227
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

470
00:41:14,153 --> 00:41:16,739
We're not done here. Skyler.

471
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:20,466
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

472
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:27,625
What the...?

473
00:41:42,557 --> 00:41:46,727
- Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
- What is wrong with you?

474
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:49,438
Why are you blue? Jesus.

475
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:53,067
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy

476
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:57,071
- kleptomaniac douche bags.
- Are you actually this stupid?

477
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,198
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal...

478
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:03,411
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

479
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:07,832
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

480
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:11,126
- Nothing. I'm sorry. I just...
- What if Skyler had seen you?

481
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,088
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

482
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:16,632
- I don't know.
- You know why you don't know?

483
00:42:16,841 --> 00:42:19,010
Because you don't think. That's why.

484
00:42:19,218 --> 00:42:21,929
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

485
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:25,808
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

486
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:28,436
Your half?

487
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:31,147
There is no your half of the money.

488
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:33,900
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

489
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:37,403
Why should I be penalised
because of your sloppiness?

490
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:39,697
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

491
00:42:39,781 --> 00:42:41,574
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

492
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:44,827
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

493
00:42:45,036 --> 00:42:48,247
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

494
00:42:48,456 --> 00:42:52,668
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

495
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:58,090
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow

496
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:01,844
simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re...

497
00:43:22,406 --> 00:43:23,950
Do it.

498
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,648
Try not to touch anything.

499
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:14,310
Want some breakfast?
