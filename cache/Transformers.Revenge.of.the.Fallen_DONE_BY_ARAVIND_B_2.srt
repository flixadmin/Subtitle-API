to say the job's getting done.

Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,

305

you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

306

We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

307
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:47,398
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good.

-Easy.
-I understand they arrived here

316
00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:08,920
after you sent a message into space,

00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:12,757
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.

318
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:16,594
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here.

of both Major Lennox and his team</i>

320

it is the position of the President</i>

322

<i>that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.</i>

323

Now, what do we know so far?

324
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:41,869
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,

325
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,540
<i>is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,</i>

and a full-time submarine surveillance.</i>

331
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:10,565
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

332
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,484
well, there's only one clear conclusion!

333
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:16,404
You! The Autobots!

334
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:19,532
They're here to hunt you!

335

besides that?

It sounds to me
like something's coming.

338
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:32,670
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

339
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:36,466
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

340
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:41,471
will you leave peacefully?

341
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:46,434
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honor it.

342
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:52,774
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

343
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:57,737
What if we leave and you're wrong?

344
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,288
That's a good question.

but I don't want anything to do with it.

Okay, I had a little crab-bot,

1100

plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1101
01:17:15,581 --> 01:17:18,416
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

1102

And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

off your brain?

- SIMMONS: Now you know.

Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.

1110
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,772
Sad little story.

1111
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,023
<i>MAN ON TV: An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?</i>

1112

<i>Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?</i>

1113

SIMMONS: Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1114
01:17:47,112 --> 01:17:49,739
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1115
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:52,450
Okay, Cube-brain.

1116
01:17:53,077 --> 01:17:55,286
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1117
01:17:55,371 --> 01:17:56,704
Where'd you get these?

1118
01:17:56,789 --> 01:18:00,458
Before I got fired,
I poached S-7's crown jewel,

1119
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:05,922
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1120
01:18:06,006 --> 01:18:09,968
The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.

1121

How do I know?

1122
01:18:12,638 --> 01:18:14,472
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1123
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:16,808
in ancient ruins all over the world.

1124
01:18:17,226 --> 01:18:19,310
China. Egypt. Greece.

1125
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:21,854
Shot in 1932.

1126
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:23,773
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1127
01:18:23,857 --> 01:18:26,442
-Yeah.
-Same ones over here, right?

1128
01:18:26,527 --> 01:18:31,322
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1129
01:18:32,324 --> 01:18:35,326
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed.

1130
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:38,329
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1131
01:18:38,831 --> 01:18:43,293
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.

1132
01:18:43,377 --> 01:18:46,671
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1133
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:50,258
I pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1134
01:18:50,342 --> 01:18:53,886
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,

1135
01:18:53,971 --> 01:18:56,431
that I was obsessed.

1136
01:18:56,515 --> 01:18:58,266
Me. Can you imagine that?

1137
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:01,477
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1138
01:19:01,562 --> 01:19:03,438
-On Earth. Another source?
-On Earth.

1139
01:19:03,522 --> 01:19:06,399
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.

1140
01:19:06,483 --> 01:19:08,234
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1141
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:09,611
No, no, no, the source is before them.

1142
01:19:09,695 --> 01:19:11,529
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.

1143
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:12,697
It's before them.

1144
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:14,782
-So, it comes before them.
-Correct.

1145

Well, then we're porked,

-Yeah.

-I'm trying to.

but, if you're a good boy,

by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1318

Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1319
01:29:11,796 --> 01:29:16,008
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1320
01:29:16,092 --> 01:29:17,801
-Destroy suns?
-You mean blow them up?

1321
01:29:17,886 --> 01:29:19,762
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

1322
01:29:19,846 --> 01:29:22,973
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

1323
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:27,144
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1324
01:29:27,812 --> 01:29:33,234
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

1325
01:29:33,318 --> 01:29:36,237
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1326
01:29:36,321 --> 01:29:40,574
And his name forevermore
was The Fallen.

1327
01:29:42,327 --> 01:29:44,703
He despised the human race

1328
01:29:45,914 --> 01:29:50,084
<i>and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.</i>

1329
01:29:50,168 --> 01:29:54,213
<i>The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key</i>

1330
01:29:54,297 --> 01:29:57,383
<i>called the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

1331
01:30:03,682 --> 01:30:08,060
<i>A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.</i>

1332
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,359
<i>The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,</i>

1333
01:30:16,736 --> 01:30:21,198
<i>so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.</i>

1334
01:30:21,825 --> 01:30:26,662
<i>In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away</i>

1335
01:30:26,746 --> 01:30:29,915
<i>in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,</i>

1336
01:30:30,667 --> 01:30:33,544
<i>a tomb we cannot find.</i>

1337
01:30:35,005 --> 01:30:40,676
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1338
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,803
The Fallen knows where it is

1339
01:30:42,887 --> 01:30:48,517
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1340
01:30:48,893 --> 01:30:50,519
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1341
01:30:50,603 --> 01:30:52,980
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen.

1342
01:30:53,064 --> 01:30:54,648
Optimus Prime?

1343
01:30:57,068 --> 01:30:59,194
So, you've met a Prime?

1344
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:02,364
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1345
01:31:02,449 --> 01:31:05,576
Is he alive, here on this planet?

1346
01:31:06,286 --> 01:31:08,579
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1347
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:10,497
So, he's dead.

1348
01:31:10,582 --> 01:31:14,668
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen.

1349
01:31:14,753 --> 01:31:18,756
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1350
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,467
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1351
01:31:21,551 --> 01:31:22,593
and bring him back to life?

1352
