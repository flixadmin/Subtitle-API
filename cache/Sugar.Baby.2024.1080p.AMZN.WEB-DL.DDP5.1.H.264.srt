1
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,119
<i>So, you wanna be a sugar baby.</i>

2
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,254
<i>And why not?</i>

3
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,823
<i>Since the dawn of time,</i>

4
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:58,325
<i>older men have</i>
<i>wanted younger women.</i>

5
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,763
<i>It's only natural</i>
<i>that we would wanna</i>
<i>take advantage of that, right?</i>

6
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,732
<i>The key is to always</i>
<i>leave them wanting more.</i>

7
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,502
<i>And guess what?</i>
<i>They always want more.</i>

8
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:09,269
<i>I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.</i>

9
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,138
<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>to sleep with some guys</i>

10
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,974
<i>who aren't your usual type.</i>

11
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,275
<i>But I mean, let's be honest,</i>

12
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,078
<i>we've all done a lot worse</i>
<i>for a lot less.</i>

13
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,247
I got you that bag
you asked for.

14
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,849
<i>As long as the perks are good</i>

15
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,384
<i>and you can stomach it,</i>
<i>who cares?</i>

16
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,621
<i>Secure the bag.</i>

17
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,191
<i>And do not be fooled</i>
<i>by social media.</i>

18
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,995
<i>I might make it look easy,</i>
<i>but it's a lot of hard work.</i>

19
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,964
<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>to kiss a lot of frogs.</i>

20
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:37,832
<i>So, why do it?</i>

21
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,667
<i>Because of him.</i>

22
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,201
<i>The whale.</i>

23
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,538
<i>That one client</i>
<i>who can actually afford</i>

24
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:45,773
<i>to make all</i>
<i>of your dreams a reality.</i>

25
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:48,843
<i>The whale's one true kink</i>
<i>is to spoil.</i>

26
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,445
<i>And we all just wanna</i>
<i>be spoiled, don't we?</i>

27
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,347
So for just $9.99,

28
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,216
I can teach you how to come up
with the perfect arrangement.

29
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,654
It'll all be included
in my online class
called "How to Sugar."

30
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:02,189
And you can visit the link in
my bio for more information.

31
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,459
And of course, don't forget to
follow me on FanZen @MissMarie.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,795
I'm always looking to collab.

33
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,984
Bitch,
you would not believe my day.

34
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,152
I got lectured by
a 12-year-old I was tutoring

35
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,689
about the realities
of making it in Hollywood.

36
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,525
Apparently, I don't have it.

37
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,460
Then, their dad had the nerve
to explain to me

38
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,163
that if I keep wasting my money
on expensive smoothies,

39
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,033
I'll never own a home.

40
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:49,336
It's like, "Sir, maybe I buy
$17 smoothies to dull the pain

41
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,907
because I know I'll never be
able to afford real estate."

42
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,677
- Is that--
- Yes.

43
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,947
I didn't know
Chanel did Afterpay.

44
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,684
It was a gift from a daddy.

45
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,652
Well, a former daddy.

46
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:08,122
By the way, Chanel retains
its value as well as Hermès.

47
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,457
You could make bank off of this.

48
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,392
Sometimes I forget that
you grew up around all this.

49
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,895
Well, growing up rich
and being rich

50
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,863
are two very different things.

51
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,565
I think my mom is the only woman

52
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,200
who left her marriage
with less than she went in with.

53
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,036
My dad is such a bastard.

54
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,403
Speaking of which,

55
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,772
it's almost
my biannual pilgrimage

56
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,306
to beg him
to keep supporting me.

57
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,775
Well, all else fails,

58
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,143
you can always resort
to selling pics

59
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,477
of your feet on the internet.

60
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:31,913
Oh, come on.

61
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,648
Are we not better
than feet pics?

62
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:35,482
No one is better than feet pics.

63
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,119
I'm telling you,
content is the new frontier.

64
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,220
I'm actually looking to get
some girl-on-girl collabs

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,589
going for my FanZen page.

66
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,791
I've heard the tips are insane.

67
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,827
Like what I would make
in a month of sugaring,

68
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:47,494
I can make in just a few hours.

69
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,597
Well, I wish you
the very best of luck with that.

70
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,934
If you'll excuse me,
I need to get back

71
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:55,435
to trapping all of my Sims
in an underground bunker.

72
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:57,905
-Sounds urgent.
-Right.

73
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,325
-You got it?
-Yeah.

74
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,861
-Ooh.
-Okay.

75
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,731
So many awesome pics
to work with.

76
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:59,332
Hopefully our make-out vids
does well on your page.

77
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,536
They do really well on mine.

78
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,671
Do you mind if I AirDrop our
content to myself real quick?

79
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,106
Yeah, go for it.

80
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:09,043
-Oh.
-Oh, you can ignore those.

81
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,511
You sure?

82
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,681
Someone named Jeff
seems super thirsty.

83
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,149
You don't have a boyfriend,
do you?

84
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,218
God, no. It's just
a potential sugar daddy.

85
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,719
Are you on Seeking Ties?

86
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,155
Yeah, been there
and done that.

87
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,691
You know, sugaring
kind of has a shelf life.

88
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,828
Once I turned 27, I swear,

89
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:29,362
those men
could smell 30 approaching.

90
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,865
How old are you, 27?

91
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:32,700
Um, yeah, just about.

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,838
Yeah, but I've been 27
for a few years now.

93
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:39,674
You know, you don't need men
to make bank, right?

94
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:43,044
I like sugaring.
It comes easy to me
and I've always been good at it.

95
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:45,880
I hate men. Like, a lot.

96
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,447
So full-service sex work

97
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:50,585
is pretty much a no-go
for me at this point.

98
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,253
And for what?

99
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,788
A pair of Louis Vuittons?

100
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,623
A designer bag
they gave their wife

101
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,457
and hope
she doesn't notice it's gone?

102
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,093
No, thanks.

103
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,529
You see these earrings? Fake.

104
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,463
You know what's real?

105
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,266
My 401k.

106
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,702
Everything I make
goes towards my future.

107
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,571
You wanna make money,
like, real money,

108
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,341
you start taking
your online profiles seriously.

109
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,078
-Here, let me see your page.
-Okay.

110
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:21,315
Oh.

111
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,619
Well, MissMarie,
it's no wonder you hate FanZen.

112
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,220
You're doing everything wrong.

113
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,055
Fuck. Okay.

114
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,423
Okay, you're posting locked
content to the home screen

115
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,160
instead of DMing it
directly to your fans.

116
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,296
The home page is
strictly designed to tease.

117
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,265
The DMs are
for the naughty shit.

118
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,100
The fans wanna think
that you're getting naked

119
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,434
for them and them only.

120
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,972
Also, your spelling and grammar
is too on point.

121
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,841
You have to spell
shit wrong on purpose.

122
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,277
The dumber and drunker
they think you are,

123
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:51,679
the more likely they are
to buy your content.

124
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,582
Wow, that's so dark.

125
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:57,318
-I didn't realize how much
strategy goes into this.
-Mm-hmm.

126
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,520
It's like--
They make it seem like
you start posting your nudes

127
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,289
and boom, you're a millionaire.

128
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:02,790
Yeah, well, there's a reason
they call it "sex work"

129
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,358
and not "sex fun."

130
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,929
God,
I would be so good at this.

131
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,330
Sorry, I'm not
ignoring you guys.

132
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,032
I'm just deep in a Reddit k-hole

133
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:13,200
about dickdoms
conspiracy theories.

134
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:15,536
- They don't actually dominate dicks?
-  -Oh,

135
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,938
it's actually
really fucked up.

136
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:18,773
-Yeah.
-Okay, like,

137
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,042
so there are
these two iconic femdoms

138
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:22,610
who went, like, mega viral.

139
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,645
Yeah, like,
the kind of viral you dream of

140
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,948
and then, out of the blue,
they break up.

141
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,549
No one knows why.

142
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,450
Becca Leaves is on some
British reality show now.

143
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,220
And wayhorny587 makes
a compelling point

144
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:34,355
about the other one.

145
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,489
ChloeLamore has gone missing.

146
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,393
All of her socials have been
a ghost town for the past month.

147
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,529
Can't tell if I'm on the wrong
side of the internet

148
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,130
or if you guys are.

149
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,233
Well, it was nice
to meet you, Lucky.

150
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:49,870
I gotta scoot.
I have acting class.

151
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,039
Look, I don't do
this for everyone,

152
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,141
but you could

153
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,811
and you should be
making way more.

154
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,512
I'm going on
a content trip tomorrow

155
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,081
with some girls from FanZen.

156
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,216
We dress like sluts,
take a bunch of pics,

157
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,718
make a ton of TikToks.

158
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:04,919
You should totally come.

159
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,356
-What's the catch?
-No catch.

160
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,225
Well, it's only in Big Bear,
not Cancún, like we hoped.

161
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,361
But we're gonna have a masseuse,

162
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:16,163
a private chef,
and Ozempic shot.

163
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:18,733
-I'm in.
-Awesome!

164
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,835
Oh, shit, I'm gonna be late
for my Al-Anon meeting.

165
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,837
I'll text you
the address for pickup.

166
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:24,438
Get excited, bitch.

167
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,674
Welcome to your life
beyond the patriarchy.

168
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,111
- Bye.
- Bye.

169
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,249
We're manifesting a whale.

170
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,351
We're manifesting
that he's gonna be hot.

171
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,953
It's gonna be great.

172
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:40,955
Yeah. It's gonna be great.

173
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,730
We're making connections.

174
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,899
You have the pussy,

175
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,834
so you have the power.

176
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,405
So, what are you looking for?

177
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:59,974
Um, well, looking for?

178
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,743
Well, I was married
for a long time.

179
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,378
Now I'm divorced.

180
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:08,182
I think, you know,
dating's pretty complicated.

181
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,920
I guess what I want is difficult
to explain on a first date.

182
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,756
Let me guess.

183
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,826
You wanna dom the shit
out of a filthy little slut.

184
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,128
Yeah. Okay.

185
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,130
Probably a lot of guys
say that, do they, yeah?

186
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,867
But also, I--you know,
I do want a connection.

187
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,670
I wanna, you know,
get to know you a little bit.

188
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,840
What you like and what you do
with your free time.

189
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,308
You don't get to know me yet.

190
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,943
It's $200 to pass GO.

191
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,581
Okay.

192
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,422
I like to cum.

193
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,465
I like art, okay?

194
00:09:57,566 --> 00:10:00,601
Oh, that's a coincidence.
I like art, too.

195
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,305
-What's your favorite piece?
-It's a Renoir.

196
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:06,841
It's called <i>Dance in the City.</i>

197
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,809
It's in Paris.
I saw it there a bunch of times.

198
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,478
Do you go to Paris a lot?

199
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,379
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I have to.

200
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,681
I have to go there for work.

201
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,382
H-have you been?

202
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:21,288
- Let's go to Paris.
- Okay.

203
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,923
Yeah, I'll see you in Paris.

204
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:28,295
-I like you, Marie.
-I like you, too, Jeff.

205
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:31,533
I think you are the one
that I've been looking for.

206
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,033
And I don't like to waste time,

207
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,935
so I would like you
to move in with me.

208
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,371
We just met.

209
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,473
We'll do it on
a trial basis, perhaps.

210
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:41,642
You just come for a week and...

211
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,177
you know,
we'll take it from there.

212
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:44,345
Name your price.

213
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,415
-$30,000.
-Okay, done.

214
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,417
I'll give you half up front
and then half
at the end of the week.

215
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,922
-What do you say?
-You really think I can't tell
when I'm getting scammed?

216
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,758
I've seen guys
like you before, okay, Jeff?

217
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,427
You're nothing
but a splendid daddy

218
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,729
in a borrowed Armani suit.

219
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,063
Actually, it's Bottega,

220
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,699
and I'm not like
any guy you've ever met.

221
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,168
You'll see.

222
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,607
Have a great day, beautiful.

223
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,951
Hey, babe.

224
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,620
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>

225
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,590
<i>that I kissed a girl</i>
<i>and I liked it.</i>

226
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,491
<i>You don't want to miss this.</i>

227
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,110
Hi. Who are you?

228
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,013
Ghost.

229
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,549
-This the new girl?
-Hi, babe.

230
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,083
We're so happy you're coming.

231
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,419
Isn't she fab?
Ghost can get your bag.

232
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,021
Uh, I thought
this was a girls' trip.

233
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,825
-I'm Kendall.
-I'm Jess.

234
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,393
It's so nice to meet you.

235
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:50,264
Um, I guess what I meant,
I didn't know that there were
gonna be men on the trip--

236
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,334
No, these aren't men.
These are just the guys,
you know?

237
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,035
Ghost shoots us, and Harry,

238
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,506
he's actually
our personal chef and masseuse.

239
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,107
I also run
the management company.

240
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:03,277
Yeah, we're all repped by
the same FanZen agency.

241
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:04,713
Didn't Lucky
mention that to you?

242
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:07,381
But they help us so much
for a small fee.

243
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,817
How small?

244
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,119
-40%.
-40%?

245
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,855
Yeah,
but you'll be making so much
money, you won't even notice.

246
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,725
Babe, is she gonna be a problem?

247
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,526
'Cause I don't like problems.

248
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:21,929
Lucky, I don't even
know these guys.

249
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,666
Marie, who cares?
Just--you met them already.

250
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:28,102
They're not some
creepy old-ass sugar daddies.
They're just our boyfriends.

251
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,638
Yeah, who you give almost
half the money you earn to.

252
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,240
No, only Lucky's boyfriend
gets a cut.

253
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,409
The rest of the guys
work for us.

254
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,211
Come on,
it's gonna be super fun.

255
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,147
I stuck my neck out for you.
Don't embarrass me, okay?

256
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:42,916
Let's go.

257
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:53,293
-Babe, are you good?
-Um, yeah.

258
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:58,932
My mom just texted me
and my uncle's in the hospital,

259
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,468
so I actually don't think
I can go on the trip.

260
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,437
- Really?
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

261
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:05,272
Wait, Marie,
what about your bag?

262
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,522
Pleasure to see you again.

263
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,537
You're shaking like a leaf.

264
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,105
What did you get up to tonight?

265
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,543
Here.

266
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,880
All right.
I'm just glad you're here.

267
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,623
So you've really been
thinking about me?

268
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,693
Uh, well, you know,

269
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:02,496
I've been pretty preoccupied
with work, but...

270
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,303
Yes, I must admit,

271
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,873
I've been thinking
about you constantly.

272
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,842
I've been thinking
about you, too.

273
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,008
I missed you.

274
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:19,547
Does that mean that
you've reconsidered my offer?

275
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,415
Yes, but I have
some requirements.

276
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,984
I've never done
anything like this before.

277
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,887
Name them.

278
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,856
We do a trial run to make sure

279
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:30,324
that this relationship
is mutually beneficial.

280
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:31,726
So I'll move in here
for the week

281
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:34,428
for $30,000, like we discussed.

282
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,764
And then...

283
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,333
And then?

284
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,170
If it works,

285
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,706
I wanna be set up for life.

286
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,908
I won't see any other
daddies besides you,

287
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,110
and I don't wanna have to worry
about anything ever again.

288
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:56,183
You drive a pretty hard bargain.

289
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:58,887
Deal.

290
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:03,625
And what about you?

291
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:06,761
Now that you have me,
what do you wanna do with me?

292
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:09,764
I would like it to feel like
a real relationship.

293
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:11,733
I mean, before we get
to all the other stuff,

294
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,034
I would like to get to know you
a little bit, if that's okay.

295
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,804
Sure.

296
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,238
What kind of music
do you listen to?

297
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,941
I don't really have a favorite.

298
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,743
What about you, Daddy?

299
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:23,477
Well, I'm a pretty
typical Gen X-er.

300
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,013
I like my grunge.

301
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,749
Favorite artist,
probably Elliott Smith.

302
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:30,985
-Hmm.
-What about hobbies?

303
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:35,255
Being fabulous, of course.

304
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,993
Look, I know--
I know what this is,

305
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,328
and I'm not trying
to make it anything else.

306
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:42,664
But...

307
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:45,867
could you be real with me?

308
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:50,004
Well, when I was in high school,

309
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,205
I really loved
working with oil paints.

310
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:55,142
-Nice. Why'd you quit?
-I don't know.

311
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,646
I guess art school
is, like, stupid expensive,

312
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,648
and it wasn't
gonna be my career, so...

313
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,149
I just kind of felt like,
what's the point?

314
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,587
-I think you should start again.
-Maybe.

315
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:06,854
You didn't ask
if I was any good.

316
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:09,023
I don't have to. I know you are.

317
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:16,030
So when do you want our week
together to actually start?

318
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:19,199
Um, does now
sound like a good time?

319
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,669
I don't have anything with me.

320
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,303
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

321
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:35,950
I tried to think of everything
that you would need,

322
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,285
and what you would want.

323
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,855
-Yeah.
-And you can have it all.

324
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:44,659
I mean, I'm hoping that
you don't wanna leave, but...

325
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,462
So what do you say?

326
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,632
Okay.

327
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,268
Okay?

328
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,986
Just wait here for a second.
I'll be right back.

329
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,191
Yes, bitch!

330
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,094
Use this man
like your own personal ATM!

331
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,429
He offered me 30 grand to
move in with him for the week.

332
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,098
I'm currently staring
at a closet

333
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,266
full of designer clothes
that he bought just for me.

334
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,603
Wait, wait, wait. What?

335
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:30,337
Uh, when did you meet this guy?

336
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,507
- Like, yesterday?
<i>- Maybe.</i>

337
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:34,842
What happened to my friend
that loved this for me?

338
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,745
Look, I know
how much finding a guy like this
means to you, Marie,

339
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:41,415
but do you actually know
anything about this guy?

340
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:43,183
I don't know
what you want me to say, Eddy.

341
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,585
Unlike you,
I don't have rich parents,

342
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:45,853
so this is what I need to do.

343
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,589
That's a low fucking blow.

344
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,925
Yeah, I have a safety net,
but everything comes at a cost.

345
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,760
Hey, Marie.
Can you come in here?

346
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,796
- Is that him?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

347
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:57,364
-He's in the bathroom.
-Is that his fetish?

348
00:19:57,464 --> 00:20:00,267
Spoiling you and then taking
a giant, smelly shit?

349
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,070
<i>I bet he wants</i>
<i>to show it to you.</i>

350
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,939
Oh, there's always a catch
with the handsome and rich.

351
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,240
You know, that's why
I like my men ugly and poor.

352
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,744
-There are no surprises.
-Okay, well, this has been
really, really helpful,

353
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:10,878
but I have to go.

354
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,484
Hey.

355
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:20,822
You, uh, seem
a little stressed out,

356
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:24,058
so I thought it might
be nice for you just
to relax and have a bath.

357
00:20:24,158 --> 00:20:26,594
Are you sure this isn't just
a cheap ploy to see me naked?

358
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:29,664
Oh, you're gonna be naked?

359
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:48,950
How does that feel?

360
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,454
Look at me.

361
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,256
Tell me how it feels.

362
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,425
Yes, please.

363
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,260
It feels really, really good.

364
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:31,526
You like this? Use your words.

365
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:33,161
Oh, my God.

366
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,531
Please, can I have more?

367
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:42,036
You are not allowed to cum
until Daddy tells you.

368
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:45,405
Okay.

369
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:47,141
Please, daddy, can I cum?

370
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,710
Please. Please, can I cum?

371
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,779
-No. You'll have to beg me.
-Please.

372
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:55,216
Please. Please.

373
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,885
I'll do anything.

374
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,386
-I'll do anything.
-You'll do anything?

375
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,789
Yeah.

376
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:05,526
Okay. Okay, cum for daddy.

377
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:28,381
It's okay. It's fine.
It's just about you.

378
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,058
Mm-hmm.

379
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:23,197
I guess. Sure.

380
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:25,066
Depends on, you know.

381
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,934
Yeah.

382
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,380
Say it again?

383
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,170
- Making yourself at home?
- Oh. Oh, fuck.

384
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,439
Oh, no, sorry about that.

385
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:06,907
Oh, let me see.

386
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,409
I had this happen to me
a few months ago.

387
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,277
You put it in a bowl of rice.

388
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,712
Leave it in there
for a couple of days

389
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:12,880
and it's like new.

390
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,382
Okay.

391
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,450
Okay, Marie,
you got the run of the place.

392
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,885
Except for one room.

393
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:22,189
Didn't anyone ever tell you
curiosity killed the cat?

394
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:26,460
-What's in the room?
-Oh, nothing. Boring stuff.

395
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,363
Birth certificates,
files, taxes.

396
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:35,403
- It's actually a sex dungeon.
- Okay.

397
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:37,838
Well, will you show me
if I'm extra good?

398
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,543
I'm counting on it.

399
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:44,412
Look, I got a couple of calls
I gotta finish up

400
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:45,746
and then I'm all yours.

401
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:47,148
Why don't you go for a swim?

402
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:49,550
It's a gorgeous day.

403
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,362
Perfect timing, beautiful.

404
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:41,135
- You cook.
- Yeah.

405
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:42,470
Does that surprise you?

406
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:45,039
-Just impressed.
-Yeah.

407
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,709
Thank you.

408
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,078
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

409
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:58,319
It's delicious.

410
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,454
Can I ask you
a personal question?

411
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:01,755
Yes.

412
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:05,126
What gets you off
about all this?

413
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:10,998
Well, my therapist says

414
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:14,034
that I like the control

415
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:17,238
that comes
with dominating people.

416
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,706
What about you?

417
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,307
Well, I'd actually argue

418
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:22,209
that the submissive
controls the situation.

419
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,245
We're the ones
who set the boundaries,

420
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,447
express our limits,
we use the safe word.

421
00:27:27,348 --> 00:27:28,682
Hmm.

422
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:30,585
Have you ever thought about it?

423
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,020
Dominating somebody?

424
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:35,422
Once or twice in passing,

425
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:37,224
but I don't think
it's really my thing.

426
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,460
The only times
I've topped were with women.

427
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:43,230
Do you think that you would like

428
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,200
to be a little more
dominant with me?

429
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:57,845
Get on your knees.

430
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:04,985
Quickly.

431
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:18,899
Did I say you could touch me?

432
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,702
No, ma'am.

433
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:24,138
Every time you disobey me,
you'll be punished.

434
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:25,640
Tell me you understand.

435
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,808
I understand.

436
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:29,977
Good.

437
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:31,912
Kiss my feet.

438
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:42,256
Now kiss my ankle.

439
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,602
Did I say you could go up
any higher?

440
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:55,869
-No.
-You're my little slut now.

441
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:00,741
-But, uh--
-You're Daddy's good girl,
right?

442
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:03,777
-Mm-hmm.
-You wanted to hit Daddy,
didn't you?

443
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:07,014
If Daddy wanted to hit you,
what do you say to me?

444
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:09,783
-Thank you, Daddy.
-Yeah.

445
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,203
Where were you?

446
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:14,576
Oh, I just, uh,
had to take a call.

447
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:17,579
Come on, baby. Sleep.

448
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,180
Hmm.

449
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:15,603
Marie?

450
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,833
I was gonna surprise you.

451
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,935
You know, I was up
half the night doing this.

452
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,403
-Last night?
-Yeah.

453
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:51,238
I even had to lug out
an old Persian rug.

454
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:57,244
Where are you going?

455
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:01,649
I saw you carrying
the rug, and I thought...

456
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,351
I don't know what I thought.

457
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,022
Oh. Yeah, okay.

458
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:12,560
Your mind went to a sinister
place because I pay you
to live with me and fuck me,

459
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,195
and you thought, what,
I'm up in the middle
of the night killing people?

460
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:17,632
I'm really sorry, Jeff,
I--it was stupid.

461
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,203
Um, anyway, here's that.
That's fixed.

462
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:25,005
I--I'm gonna go get dressed.

463
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,815
<i>Hey, Marie.</i>

464
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,884
<i>Sorry about</i>
<i>how we ended things,</i>

465
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:11,653
<i>but please call me, okay?</i>

466
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:14,054
<i>Oh, uh,</i>
<i>and that dickdoms girl</i>

467
00:34:14,154 --> 00:34:15,790
<i>I was telling you about?</i>

468
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,292
<i>She just posted</i>
<i>for the first time in a month.</i>

469
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,294
<i>Anyway, I'm glad your guy</i>
<i>isn't an axe murderer,</i>

470
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,629
<i>but drop me a pin, okay?</i>

471
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:19,787
<i>ChloeLamore has gone missing.</i>

472
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:23,057
<i>All of her socials have been</i>
<i>a ghost town</i>
<i>for the past month.</i>

473
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:50,183
<i>Your mind went to</i>
<i>a sinister place because I pay</i>
<i>you to live with me and fuck me</i>

474
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:52,820
<i>and you thought, what,</i>
<i>I'm up in the middle</i>
<i>of the night killing people?</i>

475
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,355
Oh, fuck!

476
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:01,261
Honey, I'm home!

477
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:06,134
Oh.

478
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,803
Sorry.

479
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:11,105
That's my fault.

480
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:14,509
I can buy you a new one.

481
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:17,444
I kind of thought I'd see you
in that cute little number

482
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:18,579
that you were in earlier.

483
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,548
Where'd the baby go?

484
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:21,716
Want me to punish her?

485
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:24,384
No, my uncle, actually, he fell.

486
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:27,187
So, he's in the hospital.
I have to go.

487
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,760
Is he gonna be okay?

488
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,729
I don't know,
that's why I have to go.

489
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:39,399
You're coming back,
though, right?

490
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:42,202
'Cause I'm really
enjoying our time together.

491
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,605
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

492
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,373
Sure, I'll--
I'll definitely come back.

493
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:48,843
I just--I need to go
'cause my mom's a wreck, so...

494
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:57,985
Okay, I hate seeing you go,
but love watching you leave.

495
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:00,988
Oh, sorry.

496
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:05,258
I had this new electronic lock
installed last month

497
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:07,394
and sometimes I forget.

498
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:09,197
Okay.

499
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:14,301
Oh, Marie.

500
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,104
You didn't say "please."

501
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:19,173
Bread, Jeff, okay?
I'm using the safe word.

502
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:20,942
Please, bread, I need to go.

503
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:23,010
I really need to leave
and my uncle needs me.

504
00:37:23,111 --> 00:37:24,612
He's--he just needs me.

505
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:27,682
You don't have an uncle, Marie.

506
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,518
Your mom's Anita Glover.

507
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:32,520
She lives at 357 Westburg Lane,

508
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,689
Shingle Springs, California.

509
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:36,256
She has two sisters:

510
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:38,626
Marie, who you're named after,
and Jessica.

511
00:37:38,726 --> 00:37:40,460
Neither of them ever married.

512
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,463
And your father
was an only child.

513
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,970
It's--it's not that
I'm mad that you lied to me.

514
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,673
It's that I'm disappointed
you told such a bad lie.

515
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:55,475
You're smarter than that.
That's why I picked you.

516
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:09,557
Good girl.

517
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,588
How you feeling?

518
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,488
Like I smashed my head
on some stairs.

519
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,127
Take a seat.

520
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,030
Rest a little bit.

521
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,332
Dinner's almost ready.

522
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,001
Take a seat!

523
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,077
Would you like a drink, baby?

524
00:39:36,177 --> 00:39:38,279
Oh, what am I talking about?

525
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:41,048
You probably
shouldn't drink anything,
not after you hit your head.

526
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,351
What were you thinking?

527
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:45,887
What are you gonna do to me?

528
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:49,156
Do you, um...

529
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:51,959
like the dress?

530
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,261
I picked it out myself.

531
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:59,166
What's in that room, Jeff?

532
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,612
I'm gonna bring us out a meal
here, and we're gonna sit down,

533
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:14,282
and we're gonna eat it together,
and then I'm gonna
run you a bath.

534
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:15,583
Does that sound good?

535
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,019
Does it?

536
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,957
It would mean a lot to me
if we could just start over.

537
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:24,392
Have fun.

538
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,895
For the rest of the time
that we have together, okay?

539
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:32,066
-Hmm.
-Good.

540
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:40,207
Good girl.

541
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:47,915
I was gonna ask you--

542
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,886
What are you doing?

543
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,889
Um, I was just gonna have
a sip of your drink,

544
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,223
because you made it
look so good.

545
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:02,997
Hey.

546
00:41:03,097 --> 00:41:06,634
Did you hit your head
and forget your manners?

547
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:09,804
Is that it?

548
00:41:09,904 --> 00:41:12,106
Please let me have a sip
of your yummy drink.

549
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:15,910
Please? Please who?

550
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,478
Please, Daddy.

551
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,780
Please, Daddy.

552
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:22,516
Hmm.

553
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:26,486
Hmm.

554
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,594
That's good.

555
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:36,297
That's very good.

556
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:43,070
You're getting
the idea now, okay?

557
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,606
Submission, it gets rewarded.

558
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:51,545
Here.

559
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,386
Hmm.

560
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,460
Oh, boy.

561
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,029
Hey, tell me.

562
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:10,564
What is it that you think is in
that room?

563
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,903
I don't know,
and it's scaring me.

564
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:17,872
You're scaring me, Jeff.

565
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:22,576
Is that where
you're gonna put me?

566
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:25,079
And lock me away
until I'm nothing?

567
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,714
Is that where you put Chloe?

568
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:28,149
Chloe?

569
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:01,148
What the fuck?

570
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:04,519
Oh, my God.

571
00:43:04,618 --> 00:43:07,154
You are so pretty.

572
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:08,956
You're alive.

573
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:10,324
Yeah, what?

574
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:13,327
No, no, no, what are you doing?
No, uh-uh, uh-uh.

575
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,763
Jeff would not like that.

576
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:17,932
We have to get out of here.
This could be our only chance.

577
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:20,367
And I think we could
probably fight him off
if we do it together.

578
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:23,370
What are you talking about?
I like it in here.

579
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:24,772
What?

580
00:43:24,872 --> 00:43:27,174
Babe, this place
is like Disney World.

581
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,375
Didn't you see all the clothes?

582
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:30,144
But we're trapped here.

583
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:33,447
I know. Isn't it great?

584
00:43:36,317 --> 00:43:39,320
I was going to introduce you
when your week was up,

585
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,389
but now that you've met, maybe
we can have some fun together.

586
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,059
Marie, this is Chloe.
Chloe, Marie.

587
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:48,129
It's so, so nice
to meet you, babe.

588
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:55,069
Chloe, you have been locked up
in here for three days.

589
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:58,405
Let's take a lap
around the house.

590
00:43:58,507 --> 00:43:59,740
Thank you, Daddy.

591
00:44:03,844 --> 00:44:07,014
What do you have
to say for yourself?

592
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:11,318
- I was--I was just--
- Trying to leave?

593
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:19,393
Let this be
your official warning.

594
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:21,395
If you ever disobey me again,

595
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:23,831
you will be locked in here
as punishment.

596
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:30,771
Chloe, hey.

597
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,875
You've been such a sweet girl.

598
00:44:37,546 --> 00:44:39,413
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

599
00:44:39,514 --> 00:44:42,216
-Does that sound nice?
-Yes, Daddy.

600
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:45,419
Marie has been
disobeying orders,

601
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,121
so she's gonna
spend the night here...

602
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:50,824
all alone.

603
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:17,586
Marie.

604
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,922
Jeff fell asleep while we were
picking the movie to watch.

605
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:27,094
Well, I thought
you might be hungry,
so I made you something.

606
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:32,766
I didn't poison it.

607
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:37,238
Thanks.

608
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:39,473
I'm surprised
he didn't chain you to the bed.

609
00:45:39,574 --> 00:45:41,408
You know
the nicer you are to him,

610
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:44,512
the more freedom he gives you?

611
00:45:44,613 --> 00:45:47,281
Obviously you haven't explored
the true crime genre.

612
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:48,882
Haven't you heard of
Elizabeth Smart?

613
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,654
I think I blew her brother
in the fifth grade.

614
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:55,690
Wow. There I was in fifth grade
making friendship bracelets

615
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:57,324
and learning
how to speak gibberish.

616
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,700
Finally. Something
we have in common.

617
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:08,302
I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

618
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:13,774
I feel like you're someone
I'm gonna know
for the rest of my life.

619
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:15,309
Oh, yeah?

620
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,311
And how long do you think
that'll be?

621
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:22,883
Look, I know
you're scared, but...

622
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:27,021
we're really gonna
have the best time together.

623
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:28,723
You're delusional.

624
00:46:28,822 --> 00:46:31,258
Come here.
I wanna tell you something.

625
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:37,865
Closer.

626
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:40,401
You're not the first person
to tell me that.

627
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:47,141
I have to go, but...

628
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:50,878
do me a favor, explore the room.

629
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,980
I really think you're gonna
like what you find.

630
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:56,150
See ya.

631
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:21,208
What the fuck
have I gotten myself into?

632
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:12,025
Good morning, sunshine.

633
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:16,463
Okay, so, I begged Jeff

634
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:19,734
to let us play
hide and seek together outside,
so you could get some fresh air.

635
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:21,502
-We're let outside?
-Yeah.

636
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:22,970
Come on, put this on, okay?

637
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,271
'Cause he's already
started counting.

638
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:26,907
Hide and seek?

639
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:28,676
Isn't that
a little infantilizing?

640
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:30,310
Tell me you didn't
have a childhood

641
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:32,413
without telling me you
didn't have a childhood.

642
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,622
-Where do the stairs go?
-To the pool.

643
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:42,456
Okay, so the trick is
to keep moving

644
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:44,793
to all the places
that he's already looked.

645
00:48:44,893 --> 00:48:46,795
Where should we go first?

646
00:48:46,895 --> 00:48:49,029
How far down
do you think the street is?

647
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,765
I have no idea.

648
00:48:50,865 --> 00:48:52,499
But that's against the rules.

649
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,135
Okay, he's probably
already started counting to 100.

650
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:56,871
We've got to go.
Come on, quicker.

651
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,305
-All right.
-You've got long legs.
Use them.

652
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:00,007
One, two, three.
Here I come.

653
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:01,341
Quick! Quicker.

654
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:03,177
Come on. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

655
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:04,546
Come on, move your arms.

656
00:49:04,646 --> 00:49:07,314
-Found you.
-Oh! Dang it!

657
00:49:07,414 --> 00:49:09,216
You failed 'cause
you're stuck together.

658
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:10,852
It's easier to hide
when you're alone.

659
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:12,052
Yes, Daddy.

660
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:14,955
Yes.

661
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:16,123
Yes, who?

662
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:18,660
Daddy.

663
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:25,199
Okay, so Jeff may have won
today's games,

664
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,367
but there's always tomorrow.

665
00:49:27,468 --> 00:49:29,470
And now that there's two of us,
I think that we have

666
00:49:29,571 --> 00:49:32,406
a really good chance
of outsmarting him.

667
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:34,374
Yeah, 'cause
that's what I'm upset about.

668
00:49:34,475 --> 00:49:36,076
That we lost at hide-and-seek.

669
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:41,883
Look...

670
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,551
...I hate to be
the one to say this,

671
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:44,985
but your vibes are just, like...

672
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:47,755
really terrible right now.

673
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:52,993
Dance with me?

674
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:57,765
You're not one of those
perennially happy people,
are you?

675
00:49:57,866 --> 00:49:59,399
God, no.

676
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,902
I hate those people.

677
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,005
I was still on killing myself
before Jeff came along.

678
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,842
-What?
-Nothing.

679
00:50:07,942 --> 00:50:10,110
I would just assume
someone like you,

680
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,079
internet fame, plenty of money,

681
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,348
certainly wouldn't need
the help of a man.

682
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:16,016
You've seen dickdoms?

683
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:21,054
Well, first of all,

684
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:23,892
I don't need the help
from anybody.

685
00:50:23,992 --> 00:50:26,426
And second of all,
it's easier to fuck men

686
00:50:26,528 --> 00:50:28,730
than it is
to be in love with women.

687
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:29,898
Amen, sister.

688
00:50:29,998 --> 00:50:31,866
How do you think
I ended up here?

689
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:34,569
I guess that's something else
that we have in common.

690
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:41,408
It just feels really good
to completely surrender.

691
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:46,480
And he's really good at it
if you give him a chance.

692
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:51,151
Hey, a real dom
wouldn't trap a submissive

693
00:50:51,251 --> 00:50:52,419
against their will.

694
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,822
We're not trapped.

695
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:57,324
We're finally free.

696
00:50:57,424 --> 00:51:00,662
I really wish
that you could see that.

697
00:51:00,762 --> 00:51:03,130
They know you're missing.
Your fans are searching for you.

698
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,599
I know.

699
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,466
That's why Jeff
posts for my account,

700
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:08,101
so they can all chill out.

701
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:11,405
Those people don't care
if I live or die.

702
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:13,808
I'm just an object
for them to consume.

703
00:51:13,908 --> 00:51:16,911
And Jeff gets that, he sees me.

704
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:20,615
I see you.

705
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:23,017
And I care.

706
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:44,438
Oh, God, you're good at that.

707
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,077
I know you're just my type.

708
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:01,923
Don't let me stop the fun.

709
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:06,293
You girls keep
doing what you're doing.

710
00:52:20,508 --> 00:52:21,976
Chloe, kiss her back.

711
00:52:22,844 --> 00:52:23,945
Yes, Daddy.

712
00:52:25,647 --> 00:52:26,948
Maria, look at me.

713
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:31,318
Chloe, take off Maria's shirt.

714
00:52:33,655 --> 00:52:35,322
What did you just say there?

715
00:52:36,758 --> 00:52:39,159
I told her
to say thank you to you, Daddy.

716
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:41,161
Well?

717
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:42,429
Thank you.

718
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,998
What the fuck?

719
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:46,701
Chloe, punish her.

720
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,207
Get down on your knees, brat.

721
00:52:56,711 --> 00:52:57,979
Arms.

722
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:08,321
Harder.

723
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,559
Harder.

724
00:53:13,795 --> 00:53:16,931
She doesn't deserve
to play with us,
does she, Daddy?

725
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:20,200
No, she doesn't.

726
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,336
Did it turn you on watching us
dance like that, Daddy?

727
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:26,007
Yes, it did.

728
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:29,911
Do you wanna be kissed
like that, Daddy?

729
00:53:30,011 --> 00:53:31,211
Yes, I do.

730
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,323
I have an idea.

731
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,293
How about we go upstairs

732
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:47,628
and Maria stays down here

733
00:53:47,729 --> 00:53:49,163
and thinks about
what she's done?

734
00:53:49,262 --> 00:53:51,566
Yeah.

735
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:16,023
Hey, girls.

736
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:18,258
Marie!

737
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:19,927
Look what Daddy got us.

738
00:54:42,984 --> 00:54:44,218
For you.

739
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:51,993
Excuse me, I have to go
bring Daddy his breakfast.

740
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:08,242
What about these?
Come on.

741
00:55:08,341 --> 00:55:11,344
-You'd look so good in them.
-I'm not wearing those.

742
00:55:19,754 --> 00:55:24,592
I think we should put this one
on, 'cause then we can match.

743
00:55:24,692 --> 00:55:26,561
-That is so not me.
-Nope, you're putting it on.

744
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:28,428
I don't care.
You don't like anything else.

745
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:30,264
Take it. Shoo.

746
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:33,734
Yeah.

747
00:55:33,835 --> 00:55:36,838
Do you like our outfits, Daddy?

748
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:38,773
Yeah--Uh, no.

749
00:55:38,873 --> 00:55:40,842
Get out of here. I'm working.

750
00:55:52,153 --> 00:55:53,453
Wow.

751
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:55,790
You're, like, really good.

752
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,124
I'm all right.

753
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:01,028
You know, no one's
ever painted me before.

754
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:04,198
Well, I'm not finished yet.
I still have to add
a lot of detail.

755
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:09,637
You know, when we were
doodling in your notebook
the other night,

756
00:56:09,737 --> 00:56:12,573
I noticed that you have
a really great drawing style.

757
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:14,675
I mean, they're just doodles.

758
00:56:15,576 --> 00:56:17,111
It's nothing like this.

759
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:18,411
It's not that hard.

760
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:21,414
Will you show me?

761
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:22,884
-How to paint?
-Yeah.

762
00:56:22,984 --> 00:56:24,484
Of course.

763
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:26,386
You start with a blank canvas.

764
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:28,890
And then...

765
00:56:29,757 --> 00:56:30,992
you add paint.

766
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:33,393
It's easy.

767
00:56:34,862 --> 00:56:36,097
Have you always drawn?

768
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:39,567
No.

769
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:42,303
I only started drawing
when I got here.

770
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:45,273
You got to do something
to pass the time in there.

771
00:56:45,373 --> 00:56:47,575
You know, other than masturbate.

772
00:56:48,441 --> 00:56:50,244
Of course.

773
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:52,412
So you really like
being locked up in there?

774
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:54,081
Yes.

775
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:57,018
It's nice
to have time to myself.

776
00:56:57,118 --> 00:56:58,786
It's a place
where no one can get to me.

777
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,924
I just don't get it.
Don't you miss your old life?

778
00:57:03,024 --> 00:57:04,491
What do I miss?

779
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:07,094
The parasocial online hellscape,

780
00:57:07,194 --> 00:57:09,230
the climate apocalypse anxiety?

781
00:57:10,398 --> 00:57:12,900
What's your obsession
with getting out of here?

782
00:57:15,903 --> 00:57:18,539
What does the outside world
have to offer you?

783
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,842
Okay, yeah, the outside world
is totally fucked,

784
00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:23,611
but this is not normal.

785
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,413
Jeff is, like, a sick person.

786
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:29,050
Just not a bad guy.

787
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:32,119
He's just a guy.

788
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,390
He doesn't like to be told no.
But what guy does?

789
00:57:38,192 --> 00:57:41,461
Okay, so you wanna
grip the brush loosely

790
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:43,798
between your fingers,
and then you just

791
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:45,599
add just the right
amount of pressure.

792
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:49,203
And there you go.

793
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:51,038
You're on your way
to a masterpiece.

794
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:52,440
I can tell.

795
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:57,178
How long have you been painting?

796
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:59,046
My mom taught me to paint
when I was a kid,

797
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:01,582
so I guess that long.

798
00:58:01,682 --> 00:58:06,187
Okay, so you have a good
relationship with your mom.

799
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:10,024
What about your dad?

800
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:13,794
Okay, so you wanna know about
my relationship with my dad?

801
00:58:13,894 --> 00:58:16,530
You're gonna make a point
that I became a sugar baby

802
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,599
because I have a shitty
relationship with my father?

803
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:21,736
I mean, my dad's my best friend,
and I stomp on men's balls

804
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,437
on the Internet for funsies.

805
00:58:23,537 --> 00:58:25,406
So?

806
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:28,342
I have a great relationship
with my dad. Okay?

807
00:58:28,442 --> 00:58:30,878
I like sugaring because
it can be lucrative

808
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:34,515
and because
I can always leave the situation
whenever I want to.

809
00:58:34,615 --> 00:58:38,052
Or... at least
I thought I could.

810
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:40,087
I don't really get involved
with people romantically.

811
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:43,090
I don't get attached
because there's no point.

812
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,427
People are selfish. Okay?
Everyone is selfish.

813
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:47,962
And they're just gonna

814
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:49,463
leave me once
they're done with me anyway.

815
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:57,338
So you have a habit of leaving
and I have a habit of staying.

816
00:58:58,372 --> 00:59:00,141
How's that gonna
work out for us?

817
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:07,381
You painted me.

818
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:10,384
Can I paint you?

819
00:59:10,484 --> 00:59:12,286
I would love
to see that, actually.

820
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,588
We just have to let the canvas
dry a little bit.

821
00:59:17,925 --> 00:59:20,961
You meant paint me
in a literal sense.

822
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,354
Are we done with our lesson?

823
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:36,837
You know, if you stayed,
I'd never leave you.

824
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,514
It's getting late.

825
01:00:45,614 --> 01:00:49,016
We should really shower and
get in bed before Jeff notices.

826
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,722
I give up.

827
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:04,825
-What do you mean?
-I mean, this is your last day.

828
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:09,363
Done everything I could for you,
and clearly you're not happy.

829
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:12,833
Yeah. Good.

830
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:16,403
You... are free to go.

831
01:02:18,506 --> 01:02:20,741
-I'm free. I could just
walk right out the door.
-Mm-hmm.

832
01:02:22,076 --> 01:02:25,479
Money's already been
added to your account.

833
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,582
-And Chloe?
-You can have your freedom
and the money,

834
01:02:27,848 --> 01:02:30,552
or you could stay here
with me and Chloe,
but you can't have both of them.

835
01:02:32,353 --> 01:02:33,821
And the window on
that decision is closing.

836
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:36,090
I'll go. I'll go. Okay.

837
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:39,860
-Okay.
-But can I at least
just say goodbye to Chloe?

838
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:42,129
Please.

839
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:47,434
Please, Daddy.

840
01:02:47,535 --> 01:02:49,638
Can I say goodbye? Please?

841
01:02:49,738 --> 01:02:51,772
Okay, yeah.
I'll give you 90 seconds.

842
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:54,108
1 second longer
and I'm locking the door again.

843
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:03,585
That's it?

844
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:05,853
You're leaving?

845
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:08,623
I don't wanna leave you,
but I can't stay here.

846
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:12,793
Come with me, please.

847
01:03:12,893 --> 01:03:15,262
I told you that I like it here.

848
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:19,701
Why can't you just stay?

849
01:03:29,443 --> 01:03:30,645
I'll never forget you.

850
01:03:44,526 --> 01:03:45,959
I'm hard to forget.

851
01:04:04,311 --> 01:04:06,914
Since you're going out,
do you mind
taking that with you?

852
01:05:10,377 --> 01:05:13,782
<i>You're gonna have to</i>
<i>make some kind of pledge.</i>

853
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:15,916
I'll do anything to stay.
Please, Daddy.

854
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:19,019
-Please let me stay.
-I don't have time for this.

855
01:05:21,523 --> 01:05:24,191
Okay. All right, you can stay.

856
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,894
But tell me...

857
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:30,364
tell me that you need me.

858
01:05:30,464 --> 01:05:31,932
I need you.

859
01:05:32,966 --> 01:05:34,401
-You do.
-Uh-huh.

860
01:05:38,439 --> 01:05:39,774
Tell me you love me.

861
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,377
I love you.

862
01:05:46,748 --> 01:05:49,651
Okay. All right.
Go put on a bikini.

863
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:52,854
- I have my guest coming over.
- Oh, and, uh...

864
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,329
Just let me be mad at you
for a little longer.

865
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:36,497
Okay?

866
01:06:37,665 --> 01:06:38,766
Fine.

867
01:06:42,637 --> 01:06:45,773
Not exactly, my friends.

868
01:06:45,874 --> 01:06:47,441
Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard.

869
01:06:51,144 --> 01:06:53,113
- Oh, lovely.
- Half the size of yours.

870
01:06:53,213 --> 01:06:55,415
Good to see you again, man.
Took an IQ test.

871
01:06:55,517 --> 01:06:56,784
- Oh, you did?
- Oh, yeah.

872
01:06:56,885 --> 01:06:58,452
Off the skids?

873
01:06:58,553 --> 01:07:00,855
What's up, man? Good, good.

874
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,807
It was my note, wasn't it?

875
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:23,578
It was a very compelling doodle.

876
01:07:43,998 --> 01:07:45,867
Has he ever
had friends over before?

877
01:07:46,935 --> 01:07:49,904
No, this is the first time.

878
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:53,407
For fuck's sake.

879
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:56,511
Yuck.

880
01:07:57,745 --> 01:07:59,212
I'm gonna get a drink.

881
01:08:00,014 --> 01:08:02,349
-Do you want anything?
-Surprise me.

882
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:49,857
We'll do what
we did to them last time.

883
01:09:49,957 --> 01:09:52,325
This is gonna be easy.
No one's looking for...

884
01:09:52,426 --> 01:09:53,961
-What is it?
-Follow me.

885
01:09:57,732 --> 01:10:00,300
Oh, man. Oh, man.
That's exactly right.

886
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,737
It's exactly the thing.
'Cause today's a celebration.

887
01:10:02,837 --> 01:10:05,773
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm so happy for you, man.

888
01:10:05,873 --> 01:10:07,975
-I am, yeah.
-Thank you. Means a lot.

889
01:10:08,076 --> 01:10:09,309
Yeah. You take care.

890
01:10:16,918 --> 01:10:18,452
Girls.

891
01:10:18,553 --> 01:10:20,287
What's the matter?

892
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,056
You're right. Okay?

893
01:10:22,156 --> 01:10:23,825
Jeff's just bad.

894
01:10:23,925 --> 01:10:25,993
-He's a bad guy.
-What did he do to you?

895
01:10:26,094 --> 01:10:29,897
It's not what he did to me.
It's what he did to us. Open it.

896
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:37,237
Ew. He's been filming us?
What a fucking creep.

897
01:10:37,337 --> 01:10:40,575
He hasn't only been filming us,
he's been uploading it too.

898
01:10:40,675 --> 01:10:43,144
This is a FanZen page.

899
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:45,479
Jeff has his own
creator account.

900
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:50,017
"Two hot lesbians paint each
other's tits in art studio."

901
01:10:50,118 --> 01:10:52,285
"Daddy fingers
young sugar baby in bathtub"?

902
01:10:52,385 --> 01:10:53,855
These have, like,
a million views.

903
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:56,423
Yeah, and he's been
blurring his face, too.

904
01:10:56,524 --> 01:10:59,359
-Fucker.
-No, not the bunny!

905
01:11:02,395 --> 01:11:03,798
Oh.

906
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:09,369
Fuckity fuck shit.
What are we gonna do?

907
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:11,773
-Chloe.
-Motherfucker.

908
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,643
Babe.

909
01:11:15,743 --> 01:11:20,047
Hey, there you are.
I'm looking everywhere
for you two troublemakers.

910
01:11:20,148 --> 01:11:21,314
What's that?

911
01:11:21,414 --> 01:11:23,618
Why don't you tell us, Jeff?

912
01:11:23,718 --> 01:11:25,553
It's just a security camera.

913
01:11:25,653 --> 01:11:29,257
You gave me Humper
as a fucking gift, Jeff.

914
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:30,892
- Well--
- Well, you know what?

915
01:11:30,992 --> 01:11:32,994
It's done. We're done.

916
01:11:33,094 --> 01:11:34,896
What the fuck are you
talking about? What?

917
01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:36,664
- You're going to let us leave right now.
-  -What?

918
01:11:36,764 --> 01:11:38,199
What did Marie tell you?

919
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:40,300
Chloe, what is--

920
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,837
Stop. No, you can't go home.
Sorry, not yet.

921
01:11:42,937 --> 01:11:45,405
Haven't you made
enough money off of us?

922
01:11:45,506 --> 01:11:48,308
"Hot lesbians paint each other's
tits in art studio"?

923
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:55,382
Where's my laptop?
I know you guys have it,

924
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:57,218
so I'll let you go
if you tell me where it is.

925
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,719
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

926
01:12:00,453 --> 01:12:04,357
Fucking shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

927
01:12:04,457 --> 01:12:07,394
Chloe. Give me the laptop
and I'll let Marie go, okay?

928
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:08,996
-I won't hurt her.
-Don't give it to him, Chloe.

929
01:12:09,096 --> 01:12:10,531
Shut the fuck up,
you stupid fucking bitch.

930
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:12,399
Don't. Just run, Chloe.

931
01:12:15,203 --> 01:12:17,905
I won't hurt her again
if you give me the laptop. Okay?

932
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:19,507
Okay, fine.

933
01:12:19,607 --> 01:12:21,542
Just--just take it.

934
01:12:24,879 --> 01:12:26,180
Marie?

935
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:29,482
Marie?

936
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:42,196
-Hi.
-How long was I out?

937
01:12:43,496 --> 01:12:45,032
It's almost evening.

938
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:48,135
Jeff sucks.

939
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:52,840
Levi was an early adopter
of this philosophy.

940
01:12:54,141 --> 01:12:57,410
Well, you should've just
stuck with your instincts
and not come back.

941
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,714
Well, my instincts
were a little bit distracted

942
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:02,049
with the whole
you still being here thing.

943
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,218
Where's the laptop?

944
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:07,420
I gave it back to him.

945
01:13:07,521 --> 01:13:09,924
Well, there goes our leverage.
Fuck.

946
01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:16,597
You came back for me?

947
01:13:16,697 --> 01:13:18,498
You know, your "what's so great
about the outside world"

948
01:13:18,599 --> 01:13:20,101
argument was actually
pretty compelling.

949
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:21,501
Seeing as we're
now probably on the

950
01:13:21,602 --> 01:13:23,304
getting-sold-into-sex-slavery
train,

951
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:25,072
that point is now moot.

952
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:28,042
You like me.

953
01:13:29,777 --> 01:13:31,746
Don't we have bigger things
to worry about right now?

954
01:13:31,846 --> 01:13:34,815
-Like how the fuck
we're gonna get out of here?
-Together?

955
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:38,286
-Yes, together.
-Okay. You don't just like me.

956
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,822
You, like, love me.

957
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:43,357
Can we please
talk about this later?

958
01:13:43,456 --> 01:13:45,626
No. Come on, just say it.

959
01:13:45,726 --> 01:13:48,329
You're, like, the best
person ever. So just say it.

960
01:13:48,428 --> 01:13:50,965
It's so easy. It's just,
like, three little words.

961
01:13:51,065 --> 01:13:53,167
Just three. Just say it.

962
01:14:52,693 --> 01:14:55,529
Please, please. Yeah.

963
01:15:00,134 --> 01:15:01,235
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

964
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:04,005
Oh, my God. Yeah.

965
01:15:04,105 --> 01:15:06,574
Yeah, just like that.
Just like that.

966
01:15:10,378 --> 01:15:12,780
Yeah. Oh, fuck.

967
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,382
Yeah.

968
01:15:14,482 --> 01:15:18,252
I'm going to cum.

969
01:15:44,979 --> 01:15:46,347
I love you.

970
01:15:47,348 --> 01:15:48,749
I love you.

971
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:56,190
We need to get
the fuck out of here.

972
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:59,093
Wait here.

973
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,566
What? You could've left anytime?

974
01:16:07,068 --> 01:16:09,170
I never had a reason to.

975
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:12,006
-Now I do.
-How do you even know
how to pick a lock?

976
01:16:12,106 --> 01:16:14,575
A fraternity puts you
in handcuffs once,

977
01:16:14,675 --> 01:16:16,911
you never let that shit
happen to you again.

978
01:16:19,747 --> 01:16:22,016
-Baby, baby.
-Yeah?

979
01:16:22,116 --> 01:16:25,820
When we get out of here,
we're both gonna go to therapy,
okay? So much therapy.

980
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,557
-Okay.
-So what's the plan?

981
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,168
- Who is he talking to?
-  -Well, you wanna drink something?

982
01:16:41,268 --> 01:16:42,770
Oh, God,
it's one of his friends.

983
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,271
So, what you been up to?
Tell me that.

984
01:16:44,371 --> 01:16:46,474
- I just--
- Just hanging out?

985
01:16:46,575 --> 01:16:48,676
You find the phone
and I'll distract them.

986
01:16:48,776 --> 01:16:50,811
-Hold on.
-Gross.

987
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:51,779
- I'll be in the living room.
 -Meet me back in the foyer.

988
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:33,354
-Marie.
-Eddy.

989
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:36,991
How do you know my dad?

990
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:47,602
Okay, phones away.

991
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:51,272
That's it, just, uh, father
and son time now as they say.

992
01:17:51,372 --> 01:17:54,008
Dad, what the actual
fuck is going on?

993
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:57,778
-He's the sugar daddy?
-I need help.

994
01:17:57,878 --> 01:18:00,347
I should fucking say you do.

995
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,350
You know that I am begging him
for table scraps

996
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:05,452
and he's giving you
30 grand to look pretty?

997
01:18:05,554 --> 01:18:07,221
I swear I didn't know.

998
01:18:07,321 --> 01:18:08,856
I just need you to help me
get out of here right now.

999
01:18:08,956 --> 01:18:10,691
Ugh!

1000
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:12,960
You sick fuck!

1001
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,530
Fucking bitch.
I should've known you'd
be fucking trouble. Fuck!

1002
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:17,131
How'd you get out
the fucking cell?

1003
01:18:17,231 --> 01:18:20,501
-I didn't break us out.
-I did.

1004
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:25,873
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

1005
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:28,108
You were right, Jeff.

1006
01:18:28,209 --> 01:18:29,843
We're doomed
if we stay together.

1007
01:18:32,581 --> 01:18:33,847
Fuck that.

1008
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:44,858
Dad. Unlock the fucking door.
I'm trying to leave.

1009
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,229
Holy shit.

1010
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:50,731
You're Chloe Lamore.

1011
01:18:55,035 --> 01:18:56,837
Now what?
What's your second plan?

1012
01:18:56,937 --> 01:18:59,773
You got anyone?
You got one plan B.?

1013
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:03,511
-Fuck.
-Hey, Daddy.

1014
01:19:05,012 --> 01:19:06,747
Fuck.

1015
01:19:06,847 --> 01:19:09,416
Chloe, we gotta get
out of here. Okay?

1016
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:13,220
-What happened to Eddy?
-Find him. Hurry.

1017
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:19,026
-Hey.
-Chloe, get the fuck
out of here.

1018
01:19:19,126 --> 01:19:20,794
- Not without you.
- Chloe.

1019
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:29,970
I'm tired of being the nice guy.

1020
01:19:36,578 --> 01:19:40,749
You scared?
You think I'm gonna kill you?

1021
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:46,120
I'm not gonna kill you.

1022
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:49,156
But I am gonna break you.

1023
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:52,293
I'm gonna have all that
fiery spirit just for me.

1024
01:19:52,393 --> 01:19:54,696
Take the only thought
in your little head.

1025
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:57,331
You're gonna be pleasing me.
No money involved.

1026
01:19:57,431 --> 01:19:59,166
Any last words?

1027
01:20:03,738 --> 01:20:05,239
Behind you.

1028
01:20:07,408 --> 01:20:11,345
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't
take this to the cops.

1029
01:20:12,146 --> 01:20:13,881
- You okay?
-  -What are you talking about?

1030
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:15,650
These fucking bitches
are blackmailing me.

1031
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:17,184
Blackmailing our family.

1032
01:20:17,284 --> 01:20:19,019
It's your word against theirs.

1033
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:20,421
So who should I believe?

1034
01:20:20,522 --> 01:20:23,023
The dynamic
gold digging duo or you?

1035
01:20:23,123 --> 01:20:25,059
What do you want?

1036
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:27,394
What do you want?
You want a condo?

1037
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:29,396
A condo by the beach? Whatever.

1038
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:31,498
You know, Dad...

1039
01:20:31,599 --> 01:20:33,400
Family is really important
to me.

1040
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,269
Eddy, he's dangerous.

1041
01:20:36,337 --> 01:20:39,373
Family is everything to me, Dad.

1042
01:20:39,473 --> 01:20:41,643
When you left me and Mom...

1043
01:20:42,644 --> 01:20:44,546
Marie became my family.

1044
01:20:44,646 --> 01:20:47,281
No!

1045
01:20:47,381 --> 01:20:49,883
Don't do this, bitch, you--

1046
01:20:49,983 --> 01:20:51,418
You hit me for it.

1047
01:21:01,395 --> 01:21:03,798
- He's out!
- Oh, my God.

1048
01:21:03,897 --> 01:21:06,367
I'm so sorry.

1049
01:21:06,467 --> 01:21:07,901
Should we call 911?

1050
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:09,870
'Cause he looks,
like, super fucked up.

1051
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:11,639
No.

1052
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:14,642
Ambulance means cops
and cops means questions.

1053
01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:18,780
Yeah, but we have
evidence that pretty much
exonerates us, right?

1054
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:22,316
-Right?
-My dad would do anything
to avoid prison.

1055
01:21:23,384 --> 01:21:24,985
-Anything.
-Marie.

1056
01:21:26,253 --> 01:21:28,222
No one's going to jail.

1057
01:21:28,322 --> 01:21:31,860
No one's calling the cops.
I have an idea.

1058
01:21:36,363 --> 01:21:39,834
Knock, knock.
How you feeling today?

1059
01:21:39,933 --> 01:21:41,235
I, uh...

1060
01:21:42,336 --> 01:21:44,938
Really glad to see you.

1061
01:21:45,038 --> 01:21:46,373
I just--

1062
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:51,178
I just wanted to
apologize to you.

1063
01:21:52,446 --> 01:21:54,816
For any pain
that I might have caused.

1064
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:58,118
You know, it sounds
really silly, but, um,

1065
01:21:58,218 --> 01:22:01,689
I was thinking maybe
after all this is over that,

1066
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,592
you know, like,
we could be friends.

1067
01:22:04,692 --> 01:22:05,860
You know...

1068
01:22:07,796 --> 01:22:10,330
-We have enough friends, Jeff.
-Fuck.

1069
01:22:10,431 --> 01:22:13,467
Um...
...guys, I can't.

1070
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:15,870
I don't know how you did this.
Very brave.

1071
01:22:15,969 --> 01:22:19,973
But I don't have the strength
to just take much more of this.

1072
01:22:20,073 --> 01:22:23,678
So, I'm worried. I'm worried
I might hurt myself.

1073
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:30,017
What are you gonna do?
Asphyxiate on a stuffed animal?

1074
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:32,720
Guess he could strangle
himself with the sheets.

1075
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,989
But if you die,
the house goes to Eddy, right?

1076
01:22:36,089 --> 01:22:38,693
So, killing yourself
would actually be really
helpful for us.

1077
01:22:38,793 --> 01:22:40,461
That would clear up a
lot of red tape.

1078
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:48,202
You're so silly, Daddy.

1079
01:22:48,302 --> 01:22:51,673
You're probably just cranky
'cause you haven't eaten
since yesterday.

1080
01:22:51,773 --> 01:22:54,208
That's because he was a bad boy.

1081
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:57,411
Are you ready to be
a good boy for us, Jeff?
You get a treat.

1082
01:23:00,013 --> 01:23:02,750
Some cheese for the rat?
No?

1083
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:05,854
Okay, suit yourself.

1084
01:23:05,954 --> 01:23:08,088
You're so hot when
you're being all dommy.

1085
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:15,730
See you tomorrow, Jeff.

1086
01:23:16,698 --> 01:23:19,834
- Baby.
- Wait! Wha--what--

1087
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:21,603
What kind of--
what kind of cheese?

1088
01:23:23,938 --> 01:23:27,675
Ladies, I just uploaded
that video we took yesterday

1089
01:23:27,775 --> 01:23:30,410
and it's already
banked two grand.

1090
01:23:30,512 --> 01:23:32,045
People love feet. I told you.

1091
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:33,548
Who wants a paloma to celebrate?

1092
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:34,716
-Me.
-Me with ice.

1093
01:23:41,288 --> 01:23:42,356
I'll get it.

1094
01:23:46,528 --> 01:23:49,564
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
anyone was home.

1095
01:23:49,664 --> 01:23:52,065
Hey, is the guy who lived here--
Did he move?

1096
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:55,402
-I haven't seen him in a while.
-Oh, Daddy hasn't
been feeling well.

1097
01:23:55,502 --> 01:23:57,137
Oh, okay.

1098
01:23:57,237 --> 01:24:00,173
Well,
hope your dad feels better.
