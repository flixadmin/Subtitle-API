1
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:12,760
<i>You will travel far, my little Kal-El.</i>

2
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,393
<i>But we will never leave you...</i>

3
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:18,363
<i>...even in the face of our deaths.</i>

4
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:21,997
<i>You will make my strength your own.</i>

5
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,434
<i>You will see my life through your eyes...</i>

6
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:30,002
<i>...as your life will be seen through mine.</i>

7
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:37,199
<i>The son becomes the father,</i>
<i>and the father the son.</i>

8
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:56,797
<i>In spite of your past...</i>

9
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,557
...I know you're a good man.

10
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,721
And all good men...

11
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:07,632
...deserve a second chance.

12
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:18,321
From the moment
I received your first letter...

13
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:21,202
...I knew you were not like the rest.

14
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:26,437
You came from nothing...

15
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,762
...and you worked so hard
to get where you are.

16
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:33,402
You might have made a few mistakes.

17
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:36,436
- Gertrude, for God's sake!
- Damn it, Gertrude, let us in now!

18
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:42,002
You said that if I helped you
get out of prison...

19
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,517
...you'd take care of me.

20
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,553
And you have.

21
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,922
You've shown me pleasures
that I've never known.

22
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,679
That's why you deserve...

23
00:05:57,843 --> 00:05:59,674
...everything.

24
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,436
I love you...

25
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:06,919
...Lex Luthor.

26
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,872
Gertrude, let us in. He's a crook.

27
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,999
He doesn't love you, Gertrude!

28
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:28,482
He's a monster! Gertrude!

29
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:47,519
- You can keep that.
- Oh, God.

30
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:48,911
The rest is mine.

31
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,721
We're done.

32
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:27,113
Bye, Martha.

33
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:59,514
Oh, Clark.

34
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:05,042
Oh, my boy.

35
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:53,683
Will you get that thing out of my face!

36
00:11:00,003 --> 00:11:01,994
Lex, your friends give me the creeps.

37
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,960
Prison is a creepy place, Kitty.

38
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:06,478
One needs to make creepy friends
in order to survive.

39
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:09,032
Even a man with my vast talents
is worth less inside...

40
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:12,912
...than a carton of cigarettes and
a sharp piece of metal in your pocket.

41
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,480
Do you know the story of Prometheus?
No, of course you don't.

42
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:23,522
Prometheus was a god who stole
the power of fire from the other gods...

43
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,355
...and gave control of it to mortals.

44
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:28,083
In essence, he gave us technology.
He gave us power.

45
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:31,633
So we're stealing fire? In the Arctic.

46
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:35,273
Actually, sort of. You see, whoever
controls technology controls the world.

47
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:38,003
The Roman Empire ruled the world
because they built roads.

48
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:40,996
The British Empire ruled the world
because they built ships.

49
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:44,519
America, the atom bomb,
and so on and so forth.

50
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,275
I just want what Prometheus wanted.

51
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:50,113
Sounds great, Lex, but you're not a god.

52
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:55,955
Gods are selfish beings
who fly around in little red capes...

53
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:58,318
...and don't share their power
with mankind.

54
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:00,041
Hey, boss.

55
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,201
We found something.

56
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:09,517
No, I don't wanna be a god.

57
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:12,641
I just wanna bring fire to the people.

58
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:17,198
And I want my cut.

59
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,393
Was this his house?

60
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:03,631
You might think so. Most would.

61
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:06,715
This is more of a monument
to a long dead...

62
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:09,351
...and extremely powerful civilization.

63
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:12,083
This is where he learned who he was.

64
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:15,123
This is where he came for guidance.

65
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:27,559
Possibilities.

66
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,636
Endless possibilities.

67
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:17,641
You act like you've been here before.

68
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:44,395
<i>My son...</i>

69
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,112
<i>...you do not remember me.</i>

70
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:52,079
<i>I am Jor-El.</i>

71
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:54,474
<i>I'm your father.</i>

72
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,556
<i>By now, I will have been dead</i>
<i>many thousands of your years.</i>

73
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:02,079
- He thinks I'm his son.
- <i>You are the only survivor of Krypton.</i>

74
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:07,677
<i>Embedded in the crystals before you is</i>
<i>the total accumulation of all literature...</i>

75
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:10,596
<i>...and scientific fact</i>
<i>from dozens of other worlds...</i>

76
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:14,039
<i>...spanning the 28 known galaxies.</i>

77
00:15:14,523 --> 00:15:16,878
<i>There are questions to be asked.</i>

78
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,075
<i>Here in this...</i>

79
00:15:19,243 --> 00:15:21,632
<i>This Fortress of Solitude...</i>

80
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:25,519
<i>...we shall try to find</i>
<i>the answers together.</i>

81
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:27,116
Can he see us?

82
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,401
No, he's dead.

83
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,837
<i>So, my son...</i>

84
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:37,035
<i>...Kal-El...</i>

85
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:42,359
<i>...speak.</i>

86
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,840
Tell me everything...

87
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:48,517
...starting with crystals.

88
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:39,522
Hey, boy.

89
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:06,474
- <i>on Tuesday, between support...</i>

90
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:08,873
- <i>hindered the firefighting efforts</i>
<i>for all those...</i>

91
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:13,514
<i>Police have finally arrived and it's</i>
<i>still complete mayhem down here.</i>

92
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:17,118
<i>Fighting broke out in the</i>
<i>southernmost region...</i>

93
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:19,592
<i>...with border fire</i>
<i>and small-arms attacks prevalent.</i>

94
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:21,435
Don't worry, I buried it this morning.

95
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:24,561
- <i>it was futile trying to force him</i>
<i>to testify before a grand jury.</i>

96
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:26,156
Mom?

97
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:29,434
Five years.

98
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:34,514
If your father was alive,
he never would have let you go.

99
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:36,716
I almost gave up hope.

100
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:40,000
I just thought
I would never see you again.

101
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:43,191
Oh, Clark.

102
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,723
Did you find what you were looking for?

103
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:57,072
I thought, hoped...

104
00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:59,601
...it might still be there.

105
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,001
Your home?

106
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,633
That place was a graveyard.

107
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:09,442
I'm all that's left.

108
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:14,993
Clark, the universe is a big place.

109
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,673
And you don't know who's out there.

110
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:21,758
And even if you are the last...

111
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:25,995
...you're not alone.

112
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:32,156
I know.

113
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:53,998
- Sorry.
- Look out!

114
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:55,357
Watch out, will you?

115
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:56,956
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

116
00:20:58,483 --> 00:20:59,757
Sorry.

117
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:04,081
Great. Would you be careful?

118
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:08,399
- Jimmy.
- Mr. Clark! I mean, Kent! Mr. Kent!

119
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:10,554
Welcome back! Oh, my God!

120
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:14,318
Hey, come... Wait right there.
I'll be right back.

121
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:26,713
Oh, hey, sorry, guys,
I'm still looking for a place to live...

122
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,555
...if you know of anything reasonable.

123
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:32,238
Behind you, Mr. Kent.
I made it myself. It's a cake.

124
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,476
Oh, it looks...

125
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:37,632
...delicious.

126
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:41,955
Olsen! Where are the photos
of that birthday-clown-massacre thing?

127
00:21:42,123 --> 00:21:44,591
I'm on it, chief. Hey, look who's back.

128
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,322
- Kent?
- Hey, chief.

129
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:48,872
- Thank you for giving me my job back.
- Don't thank me.

130
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:50,317
Thank Norm Palmer for dying.

131
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:54,000
It was his time.

132
00:21:55,243 --> 00:21:58,679
- Let's get you set up, huh?
- Olsen!

133
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:00,037
Okay, so I gotta run...

134
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:03,354
...but I will be back to check on you
in a sec, Mr. Kent.

135
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:07,516
Oh, hey, do you know
where I can find Lois?

<i>The timing of this</i>

you could use a drink.

160
00:24:22,363 --> 00:24:25,480
This place is so tacky.
Why are we back here?

161
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:29,113
Kitty, while you were doing your nails
and ordering fur coats online...

162
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:30,955
...I was busy unlocking the secrets...

163
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:33,876
...of one of the most advanced
civilizations in the universe.

164
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:35,237
Weren't there two of those?

165
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:39,476
You see, unlike our clunky
earthbound forms of construction...

166
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,998
...the technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...

167
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:44,472
...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.

168
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:45,962
Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.

169
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:49,718
Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...

170
00:24:49,883 --> 00:24:51,919
...would be indistinguishable from magic.

171
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:56,281
But imagine: cities, vehicles, weapons...

172
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:58,401
...entire continents...

173
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:01,362
...all grown.

174
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:11,920
To think that one could create
a new world...

175
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,961
...with such a simple little object.

176
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:18,798
It's like a seed.

177
00:25:18,963 --> 00:25:21,113
And all it needs is water.

178
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:22,682
Like...

179
00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:25,354
...Sea-Monkeys.

180
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:29,158
Exactly, Kitty.

181
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:31,275
Like Sea-Monkeys.

182
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:37,794
Clark has been doing a little
soul-searching for the last couple years.

183
00:25:37,963 --> 00:25:39,874
- He saw Ilamas.
- Yeah?

184
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:41,999
- Yeah.
- Must be tough coming back.

185
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,713
- Coming back?
- To work.

186
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:48,002
Yeah.

187
00:25:48,403 --> 00:25:50,871
Well, you know, things change.

188
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:52,999
I mean, of course things change...

189
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:58,795
...but sometimes things that you didn't
think would change could change.

190
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:00,756
Take Lois.

191
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:04,711
A woman like her,
I never thought she'd settle down.

192
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,678
You know, if you ask me...
Because she'll never tell you this...

193
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:13,519
...but if you ask me,
she's still in love with you-know-who.

194
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:25,232
The original space shuttle
generated 7.5 million pounds of thrust...

195
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:27,041
...just in the initial launch phase.

196
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:31,754
But, by piggybacking
on this Boeing 777... Yes?

197
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,879
If this launch is as pivotal as you claim...

198
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:36,238
...why is it being covered
by one news network?

199
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:39,475
Why don't we save those questions
for the post-launch briefing.

200
00:26:39,643 --> 00:26:41,201
How about that, Miss Lane?

201
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:44,673
When we hit 40,000 feet,
the shuttle will detach, ascend...

202
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:48,392
...and then fire the first of two propellant
systems, the liquid fuel boosters.

203
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:50,519
When the shuttle
reaches the stratosphere...

204
00:26:50,683 --> 00:26:52,719
...the secondary
insertion booster will fire...

205
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:56,114
...propelling the craft
at 4gs into the mesosphere.

206
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:01,873
- Careful.
- I know.

207
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:05,561
- Careful. Careful.
- I know.

208
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,038
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

209
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:36,398
Wait for it.

210
00:27:39,683 --> 00:27:42,322
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

211
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:47,277
It's freaking <i>Gone With the Wind.</i>

212
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:49,879
- Shut off the camera.
- But I'm getting it.

213
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,999
I said, shut off the damn camera.

214
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,761
I think I did something wrong.

215
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:04,075
No. That wasn't you.

216

"Superman Returns."

311
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:24,637
Come on.

312
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:30,281
Gil, how many F's in "catastrophic"?

313
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:32,957
None. What's the usage?

314
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,195
"This mysterious electromagnetic pulse
knocked out portable devices...

315
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:39,196
...and entire power grids,
causing a catastrophic event during..."

316
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,842
- Lois!
- Yes.

317
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:42,561
In my office.

318
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:45,682
This goes for everyone.

319
00:41:45,843 --> 00:41:49,313
The story isn't the blackout,
it's Superman!

320
00:41:50,603 --> 00:41:52,195
The story is the EMP, chief.

321
00:41:52,363 --> 00:41:55,719
Every electronic device
on the East Coast goes dark.

322
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,919
- First, are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

323
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,961
Lois, three things sell papers:
tragedy, sex and Superman.

324
00:42:01,123 --> 00:42:04,559
People are sick of tragedy, we know
you can't write worth a damn about sex.

325
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:08,159
<i>That means one thing. That one thing</i>
<i>is Superman. And you know it, Lois.</i>

326
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:10,116
Lois?

327
00:42:10,723 --> 00:42:12,873
- <i>Are you all right? You sure?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

328
00:42:13,043 --> 00:42:15,603
- <i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>
- <i>Thank God.</i>

329
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:18,323
- <i>Where's Jason?</i>
- <i>I don't know. Isn't he with you?</i>

330
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:19,757
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Well, where is he?</i>

331
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:21,436
Hi.

332
00:42:24,723 --> 00:42:26,202
Hello.

333
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,275
Who are you?

334
00:42:33,443 --> 00:42:37,436
I'm Clark Kent, an old friend of
your mom's from before you were born.

335
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:40,397
Really? She never mentioned you.

336
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,721
Really? Never?

337
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:44,111
- No.
- Jason.

338
00:42:45,203 --> 00:42:47,797
- What are you doing here, honey?
- Daddy's office is boring.

339
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:49,715
Daddy's office is boring?

340
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:52,443
Clark, hey! Welcome back.

341
00:42:55,603 --> 00:42:58,720
- I see you've already met the munchkin.
- Yeah, we were just talking...

342
00:42:58,883 --> 00:43:00,839
- Did you take vitamins? Eye drops?
- Yes. Yes.

343
00:43:01,003 --> 00:43:03,119
- Albuterol? Poly-Vi-Flor?
- Yes. Yes, Mom.

344
00:43:03,283 --> 00:43:06,161
Good boy. He's a little fragile,
but he's gonna grow up...

345
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:08,553
...to be big and strong
like his dad, won't you?

346
00:43:08,723 --> 00:43:09,917
- Yes?
- Yes.

347
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:11,357
Oh, I saw you on the...

348
00:43:11,523 --> 00:43:13,479
Oh, yeah. That was nothing.

349
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:17,440
- Hey, can I borrow your stapler?
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:43:19,403 --> 00:43:20,961
Thanks.

351
00:43:21,803 --> 00:43:25,512
Congratulations on the Pulitzer.
That's incredible.

352
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:27,753
Yeah. Can you believe it? It's...

353
00:43:29,603 --> 00:43:31,480
So I wanna hear all about your trip.

354
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,203
Where did you go? What did you see?
Meet anyone special?

355
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:36,718
Well, there's so much. Where to begin?

356
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:39,272
Where's the little guy? Hey, kiddo.

357
00:43:40,403 --> 00:43:41,597
- How are you?
- Good.

358
00:43:41,763 --> 00:43:43,754
Can you work some magic
to get your uncle...

359
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:46,437
...to stop giving me
such a hard time on this article?

360
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:48,436
- Please?
- Again?

361
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:50,639
- Again.
- You got it.

362
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:53,759
- How are you, kiddo?
- Good.

363
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,641
Oh, this is Clark.

364
00:43:57,043 --> 00:43:59,159
- Clark, Richard. Richard, Clark.
- Richard White.

365
00:43:59,323 --> 00:44:00,517
Hi.

366
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:04,881
Richard's an assistant editor here who's
basically saved our International section.

367
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,762
He's also a pilot
and he loves horror movies.

368
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:10,555
Clark is...

369
00:44:11,163 --> 00:44:13,040
Well, he's Clark.

370
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:16,922
Well, it's great to finally meet you.
I've heard so much.

371
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:19,916
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah, Jimmy won't shut up about you.

372
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:22,322
- Gotta run.
- Where?

373
00:44:22,483 --> 00:44:26,556
You heard Perry. Superman's back, and
he thinks I'm the only one equipped to...

374
00:44:26,723 --> 00:44:28,236
To what?

375
00:44:28,403 --> 00:44:30,678
- I don't know, you know.
- So don't listen to him.

376
00:44:30,843 --> 00:44:33,516
I'm not. Going to the power plant
to check out the blackout.

377
00:44:33,683 --> 00:44:35,002
Okay.

378
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,357
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

379
00:44:39,123 --> 00:44:41,557
- Bye, Lois.
- And she's gone.

380
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:44,556
No matter how close we are,
that woman will always be a mystery.

381
00:44:45,203 --> 00:44:48,081
If you need anything,
I'm right over there.

382
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:49,756
Nice to finally meet you.

383
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:52,995
Where do you wanna go?
Wanna go to the park?

384
00:44:58,003 --> 00:45:01,712
<i>And he's got the whole world</i>
<i>In his hands</i>

385
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:03,953
<i>He's got the whole world</i>

386
00:45:04,123 --> 00:45:06,591
<i>And he's got the whole world in his...</i>

387
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,278
Oh, he's cute.

388
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:29,877
Run into trouble?

389
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:32,193
- Should see the other guy.
- What are we gonna do?

390
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:33,955
Modify it, attach it to the stern.

391
00:45:34,123 --> 00:45:35,920
I don't care if the instructions
are Russian.

392
00:46:03,443 --> 00:46:04,796
- Lois?
- Hey, Clark.

393
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:06,635
How does it feel to be back at work?

394
00:46:06,803 --> 00:46:10,876
Pretty good. You know,
kind of like riding a bike, I guess.

395
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:16,401
- A bike?
- Yeah, you know...

396
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:17,957
Never mind.

397
00:46:18,123 --> 00:46:19,317
But I was wondering...

398
00:46:19,483 --> 00:46:22,555
...since I've gotten back, we haven't
really had a chance to catch up.

399
00:46:22,723 --> 00:46:25,521
I thought maybe, if you'd like,
we could go grab some food...

400
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:27,719
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

401
00:46:27,883 --> 00:46:31,114
Have you ever met someone and it's like
you're from different worlds...

402
00:46:31,283 --> 00:46:34,832
...but you shared such a connection you
knew you were destined to be together?

403
00:46:35,323 --> 00:46:37,393
Then he just takes off
without explaining why...

404
00:46:37,563 --> 00:46:39,235
...or without even saying goodbye?

405
00:46:39,403 --> 00:46:40,552
Sounds cheesy, I know.

406
00:46:43,043 --> 00:46:44,237
- Well, maybe...
- Taxi!

407
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:47,122
...it was hard to say goodbye
because he had to go...

408
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:50,514
...and he wanted to say goodbye,
but maybe it was too difficult for him.

409
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:53,914
Difficult? What's so difficult about it?
"Goodbye." It's easy.

410
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,643
What's so hard about saying goodbye?

411
00:46:56,803 --> 00:46:58,316
Who are we talking about?

412
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,202
Nobody, just forget I said anything.

413
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:03,274
Taxi! Hey!

414
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,641
Taxi!

415
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:11,915
Wow, thanks.

416
00:47:15,003 --> 00:47:16,755
312 Riverside Drive, please.

417
00:47:17,603 --> 00:47:19,321
Good night, Clark.

418
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:33,601
Superman!

419
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:46,637
<i>I want egg rolls.</i>

420
00:48:46,803 --> 00:48:50,796
<i>Nice try, kiddo. Only steamed chicken</i>
<i>and snow peas for you.</i>

421
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,914
<i>Why do we order Chinese if he's allergic?</i>

422
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:55,801
<i>Because he loves the peas...</i>

423
00:48:55,963 --> 00:48:59,194
...and I think we all prefer egg rolls
over macrobiotic shakes.

424
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:01,794
It's a good point.

425
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:17,195
So I noticed you've been acting
a little different lately.

426
00:49:17,363 --> 00:49:18,921
Have I?

427
00:49:21,203 --> 00:49:25,162
You know, Lois,
that article that you wrote.

428
00:49:25,323 --> 00:49:27,154
"Why the World
Doesn't Need Superman"?

429
00:49:27,323 --> 00:49:31,032
No, no, no. No, the other one,
from years ago, before we met.

430
00:49:31,203 --> 00:49:34,593
Which article? I wrote dozens about him.
I was practically his press agent.

431
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,594
"I Spent the Night With Superman."

432
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:42,441
Richard, come on.

433
00:49:42,603 --> 00:49:44,480
It was the title of an interview.

434
00:49:44,803 --> 00:49:46,555
Plus, it was your Uncle Perry's idea.

435
00:49:46,723 --> 00:49:49,635
- No, I know, I know. It's okay, it's okay.
- Richard.

436
00:49:50,203 --> 00:49:52,159
It was a long time ago.

437
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:55,596
Were you in love with him?

438
00:49:57,763 --> 00:50:01,358
He was Superman.
Everyone was in love with him.

439
00:50:02,603 --> 00:50:03,752
But were you?

440
00:50:12,323 --> 00:50:13,676
<i>No.</i>

441
00:50:13,843 --> 00:50:15,913
<i>Lois, I shouldn't have brought it up.</i>

442
00:50:35,763 --> 00:50:38,152
<i>Even though you've been</i>
<i>raised as a human being...</i>

443
00:50:38,323 --> 00:50:40,314
<i>...you are not one of them.</i>

444
00:50:44,323 --> 00:50:47,440
<i>They can be a great people, Kal-El.</i>
<i>They wish to be.</i>

445
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:51,594
<i>They only lack the light</i>
<i>to show the way.</i>

446
00:50:52,003 --> 00:50:55,598
<i>For this reason above all,</i>
<i>their capacity for good...</i>

447
00:50:55,763 --> 00:50:57,674
<i>...I have sent them you...</i>

448
00:50:57,843 --> 00:50:59,720
<i>...my only son.</i>

449
00:52:11,123 --> 00:52:12,238
Load them up.

450
00:52:38,803 --> 00:52:39,792
Holy sh...

451
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:31,397
<i>Attention, the Metropolis</i>
<i>Museum of Natural History...</i>

452
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:34,157
<i>...will be closing in 10 minutes.</i>
<i>We hope that you've...</i>

453
00:54:34,323 --> 00:54:36,120
Sir, we're closing in 10 minutes.

454
00:54:36,283 --> 00:54:37,921
We only need five.

455
00:55:23,163 --> 00:55:26,041
You're done, the museum's closed.
Thank you.

456
00:56:43,843 --> 00:56:45,037
Are you all right, miss?

457
00:56:45,203 --> 00:56:47,763
- My heart. I... I...
- I'm sorry?

458
00:56:48,123 --> 00:56:52,992
I have a palpitation,
a heart palpitation. And a murmur.

459
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:56,394
Please, take me to the hospital.

460
00:56:57,363 --> 00:56:59,479
Take me to the hospital.

461
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:11,597
Just hold on tight.

462
00:57:47,243 --> 00:57:48,756
Bingo.

463
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:16,642
- There you are, ma'am.
- My heart.

464
00:58:17,483 --> 00:58:20,520
My palpitations, they're gone.
What did you do?

465
00:58:20,683 --> 00:58:22,196
I didn't do anything.

466
00:58:22,363 --> 00:58:24,513
Call me Katherine.

467
00:58:24,683 --> 00:58:27,720
Katherine. I'm glad you're feeling better.

468
00:58:27,883 --> 00:58:31,671
- You have places to go, people to save?
- Yes.

469
00:58:35,203 --> 00:58:37,239
Would you like to get
a cup of coffee sometime?

470
00:58:37,403 --> 00:58:39,837
- I know that's forward. Or a drink?
- Good night.

471
00:58:40,003 --> 00:58:41,595
Good night.

472
00:58:59,683 --> 00:59:01,241
It's like this on every channel.

473
00:59:01,403 --> 00:59:04,156
<i>He was in Manila at 10:55 P.M.</i>
<i>and then spotted...</i>

474
00:59:04,323 --> 00:59:07,918
- Hey, Kent, chief wants to see you.
- Oh, thanks.

475
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:11,871
<i>But as this security footage</i>
<i>from a simple deli robbery proves...</i>

476
00:59:12,043 --> 00:59:15,035
<i>...there's really no feat too big</i>
<i>or too small for the Man of Steel.</i>

477
00:59:15,203 --> 00:59:18,320
<i>Reports are flooding in from Metropolis,</i>
<i>Houston, Gotham and as far...</i>

478
00:59:18,483 --> 00:59:21,122
<i>Satellites have proven</i>
<i>most ineffective at tracking him.</i>

479
00:59:21,283 --> 00:59:24,673
<i>He might literally be moving</i>
<i>near the speed of light.</i>

480
00:59:37,363 --> 00:59:40,116
- <i>Our map is illuminated with sightings...</i>
- Kent!

481
00:59:40,283 --> 00:59:43,195
- The chief is waiting.
<i>...on every continent, giving citizens...</i>

482
00:59:46,923 --> 00:59:50,472
These are iconic, and they were taken
by a 12-year-old with a camera phone.

483
00:59:50,643 --> 00:59:53,680
- What do you got, Olsen?
- I got those.

484
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,515
- Look, in the sky, chief.
- It's a bird.

485
00:59:57,683 --> 00:59:59,196
- It's a plane.
- No, look, it's...

486
00:59:59,923 --> 01:00:01,072
You wanted to see me?

487
01:00:01,963 --> 01:00:03,601
Yeah, Kent, come on in. Sit down.

488
01:00:03,763 --> 01:00:06,641
I wanna talk a little strategy. Okay.

489
01:00:07,123 --> 01:00:09,683
First off, Lois, I don't understand
what you're doing...

490
01:00:09,843 --> 01:00:12,994
...sneaking around covering the blackout.
- It wasn't just a blackout.

491
01:00:13,163 --> 01:00:15,074
Cellphones, pagers,
automobiles, airplane...

492
01:00:15,243 --> 01:00:17,598
Every other paper in town
has got a female reporter...

493
01:00:17,763 --> 01:00:21,039
...a good-looking female reporter,
stashed on the roof covering Superman.

494
01:00:21,203 --> 01:00:24,718
- And you two are the ones with history.
- Chief, I've done Superman.

495
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:28,279
Covered him. You know what I mean.

496
01:00:28,443 --> 01:00:30,513
Yeah, that makes you an expert.
Do him again.

497
01:00:30,683 --> 01:00:33,356
- There are a dozen other stories out there.
- Yeah? Name one.

498
01:00:33,523 --> 01:00:35,991
Well, there was a museum robbery
last night.

499
01:00:36,483 --> 01:00:39,793
Even Superman missed that one.
He was too busy saving this hooker.

500
01:00:39,963 --> 01:00:42,523
Why don't you guys
track down Lex Luthor?

501
01:00:43,203 --> 01:00:45,353
Well, no one's seen him
since his fifth appeal.

502
01:00:45,523 --> 01:00:47,593
He's got more history
with Superman than anyone.

503
01:00:47,763 --> 01:00:49,196
Maybe he's got something to say.

504
01:00:49,363 --> 01:00:52,958
- Luthor's yesterday's news.
- No, I like that idea.

505
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:58,240
Perry, Lex Luthor is a career criminal
who nearly killed him, for God's sakes.

506
01:00:58,403 --> 01:01:00,553
Jimmy, how did Lex Luthor
get out of prison?

507
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:04,557
Well, the appeals court called Superman
as a witness and he wasn't around.

508
01:01:05,243 --> 01:01:07,279
How much do you think
that pisses off Superman?

509
01:01:07,443 --> 01:01:09,001
- Give him to someone else.
- A lot.

510
01:01:09,163 --> 01:01:10,994
- A lot.
- Polly. Give him to Polly.

511
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:17,402
Lois, Superman.

512
01:01:17,563 --> 01:01:19,679
- What about the blackout?
- Kent, blackout.

513
01:01:22,163 --> 01:01:24,393
Great. Thanks, chief.

514
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:32,033
Lois, I'm sorry. I'd hate if this
damaged our relationship.

515
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:34,392
Relationship?

516
01:01:35,123 --> 01:01:36,476
- Yeah.
- Hi, Mommy.

517
01:01:36,643 --> 01:01:38,440
- Hi, you.
- Hey, guys.

518
01:01:38,603 --> 01:01:42,232
He got an A in science, but a D in gym,
so we're doing something right.

519
01:01:42,403 --> 01:01:44,314
- Yeah, at least one of us is.
- What?

520
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:47,202
It's Perry. He just shoved Superman
back into my life.

521
01:01:47,363 --> 01:01:50,196
Well, honey, I'm sure you can
find a way to interview Superman...

522
01:01:50,363 --> 01:01:52,274
...without bringing him
back into your life.

523
01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:56,561
<i>There's really no way around it, folks.</i>
<i>Superman is back in all of our lives.</i>

524
01:01:57,963 --> 01:01:59,681
<i>We're coming to you from Sydney...</i>

525
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:03,472
<i>...where people have gathered</i>
<i>on these rooftops to scour the sky...</i>

526
01:02:03,643 --> 01:02:06,715
Okay, how about this?
We'll stay late. We'll get dinner.

527
01:02:06,883 --> 01:02:10,353
I'll help with Superman, and you and
Clark can work on the blackout together.

528
01:02:10,523 --> 01:02:13,356
- Is that all right with you, Clark?
- Swell.

529
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:40,162
I was gonna pretend
the brakes were out.

530
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:43,315
Pretend. Like we talked about.

531
01:02:43,483 --> 01:02:46,156
You didn't actually have to cut them!

532
01:02:46,323 --> 01:02:47,551
Of course I did.

533
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:52,353
A man can always tell when a woman
is pretending, especially Superman.

534
01:02:57,043 --> 01:02:59,318
So did you get your rock?

535
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,474
I did.

536
01:03:03,803 --> 01:03:07,682
<i>U.S. Coast Guard issuing a small-craft</i>
<i>advisory for the Metropolis ocean area.</i>

537
01:03:07,843 --> 01:03:09,595
<i>High-wind advisory is in effect...</i>

538
01:03:09,763 --> 01:03:12,516
<i>...ocean currents and tides</i>
<i>becoming increasingly dangerous.</i>

539
01:03:12,683 --> 01:03:15,755
<i>All warnings lasting</i>
<i>until later this evening.</i>

540
01:03:15,923 --> 01:03:17,117
<i>Security, security.</i>

541
01:03:17,283 --> 01:03:22,516
<i>This is U.S. Coast Guard issuing</i>
<i>a small-craft advisory for northeast seas.</i>

542
01:03:22,683 --> 01:03:26,961
<i>Winds reaching 50 miles per hour,</i>
<i>high tides in the morning.</i>

543
01:03:27,123 --> 01:03:28,875
<i>Waves reaching 20 to 30 feet.</i>

544
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:32,877
<i>This warning is in effect for</i>
<i>all small crafts for the next four hours.</i>

545
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:57,561
Weird. If these times are right...

546
01:03:57,723 --> 01:04:00,681
...the blackout spread
from a specific origin point.

547
01:04:00,843 --> 01:04:02,162
Where?

548
01:04:02,323 --> 01:04:04,041
I'm not sure yet.

549
01:04:04,723 --> 01:04:08,238
With the super-hearing, does he hear each
sound by itself or everything at once?

550
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:09,797
<i>Both.</i>

551
01:04:09,963 --> 01:04:12,079
- <i>He's certainly taller than I thought.</i>
- <i>6'4".</i>

552
01:04:12,243 --> 01:04:15,838
I love that he can see through anything.
I'd have fun with that.

553
01:04:16,203 --> 01:04:17,841
<i>Anything but lead.</i>

554
01:04:20,963 --> 01:04:22,157
- I bet he's...
- 225 pounds...

555
01:04:22,323 --> 01:04:23,915
...faster than a speeding bullet...

556
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:27,393
...draws his power from the sun,
invulnerable to anything but kryptonite...

557
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,519
...and he never lies.
- Kryptonite?

558
01:04:29,683 --> 01:04:31,913
Radioactive pieces of his home world.

559
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:34,199
It's deadly. To him.

560
01:04:38,603 --> 01:04:41,834
Lois, how tall would you say Clark is?

561
01:04:43,323 --> 01:04:45,234
<i>About 6'3", 6'4".</i>

562
01:04:45,403 --> 01:04:48,076
<i>About 200, 215 pounds?</i>

563
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:01,477
Jimmy, Jason, let's go get these intrepid
reporters something to keep them going.

564
01:05:01,643 --> 01:05:03,440
- Burritos!
- Come here, canhead.

565
01:05:04,883 --> 01:05:08,671
We're going this way. Do they have
anything other than burritos?

566
01:05:09,523 --> 01:05:11,753
I think they have fries and burgers.

567
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:14,312
So have you found a place to live yet?

568
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:15,996
No. I'm still looking.

569
01:05:16,723 --> 01:05:19,112
You know, Lois, I wanted to ask you
about that artic...

570
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:22,639
Hey, I'm gonna run downstairs
for some fresh air. Great!

571
01:05:35,843 --> 01:05:37,481
Thanks.

572
01:05:44,963 --> 01:05:47,602
- Let's talk when I get back.
- Sure.

573
01:06:38,923 --> 01:06:41,562
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke, Miss Lane.

574
01:06:44,723 --> 01:06:47,112
- Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.
- I'm fine. Really.

575
01:06:49,163 --> 01:06:52,155
I just wasn't expecting you.

576
01:06:52,803 --> 01:06:54,316
With all the press on the plane...

577
01:06:54,483 --> 01:06:56,792
...I wasn't sure it was
the best time for us to talk.

578
01:06:56,963 --> 01:07:00,000
Well, there's no press around now.
Except for me, of course.

579
01:07:02,123 --> 01:07:04,478
I know people are asking questions
now that I'm back.

580
01:07:04,843 --> 01:07:08,233
I think it's only fair
that I answer those people.

581
01:07:09,843 --> 01:07:13,040
So you're here for an interview?

582
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:15,232
Okay, then.

583
01:07:18,963 --> 01:07:20,874
- Where did I put that thing?
- Right pocket.

584
01:07:26,763 --> 01:07:29,357
Let's start with the big question.

585
01:07:29,523 --> 01:07:31,912
- Where'd you go?
- To Krypton.

586
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,358
But you told me it was destroyed.
Ages ago.

587
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:35,922
It was.

588
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,358
But when astronomers
thought they found it...

589
01:07:39,763 --> 01:07:42,038
...I had to see for myself.

590
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:49,198
Well, you're back, and everyone
seems to be pretty happy about it.

591
01:07:52,283 --> 01:07:53,682
Not everyone.

592
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:57,112
- I read the article, Lois.
- So did a lot of people.

593
01:07:57,283 --> 01:08:00,116
- Tomorrow they're giving me the Pulitzer...
- Why did you write it?

594
01:08:01,723 --> 01:08:03,679
How could you leave us like that?

595
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:07,432
I moved on. So did the rest of us.

596
01:08:07,923 --> 01:08:09,356
That's why I wrote it.

597
01:08:09,523 --> 01:08:12,196
The world doesn't need a savior.

598
01:08:12,603 --> 01:08:14,434
And neither do I.

599
01:08:28,963 --> 01:08:29,998
Lois.

600
01:08:31,643 --> 01:08:33,998
Will you come with me?

601
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:37,196
Why?

602
01:08:37,563 --> 01:08:39,599
There's something I wanna show you.

603
01:08:45,603 --> 01:08:47,321
Please.

604
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,953
I can't be gone long.

605
01:09:00,123 --> 01:09:01,954
You won't be.

606
01:09:13,843 --> 01:09:16,482
Clark said the reason you left
without saying goodbye...

607
01:09:16,643 --> 01:09:18,838
...is because it was
too unbearable for you.

608
01:09:19,003 --> 01:09:21,517
Personally, I think that's a load of crap.

609
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:25,120
- Clark?
- He's just a guy I work with.

610
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:28,199
Maybe Clark's right.

611
01:09:31,443 --> 01:09:33,479
You know, my...

612
01:09:33,643 --> 01:09:38,478
Richard, he's a pilot.
He takes me up all the time.

613
01:09:39,603 --> 01:09:41,514
Not like this.

614
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:58,072
I forgot how warm you were.

615
01:10:27,443 --> 01:10:28,876
Listen.

616
01:10:29,723 --> 01:10:31,554
What do you hear?

617
01:10:32,243 --> 01:10:33,437
Nothing.

618
01:10:37,203 --> 01:10:38,875
I hear everything.

619
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:44,717
You wrote that the world
doesn't need a savior...

620
01:10:46,003 --> 01:10:49,200
...but every day
I hear people crying for one.

621
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:04,083
I'm sorry I left you, Lois.

622
01:11:07,803 --> 01:11:09,759
I'll take you back now.

623
01:13:17,443 --> 01:13:19,001
Richard's a good man.

624
01:13:22,283 --> 01:13:24,399
And you've been gone a long time.

625
01:13:26,963 --> 01:13:28,476
I know.

626
01:13:33,043 --> 01:13:34,317
I...

627
01:13:39,323 --> 01:13:41,234
So will I see you around?

628
01:13:42,203 --> 01:13:44,114
I'm always around.

629
01:13:45,363 --> 01:13:47,001
Good night, Lois.

630
01:14:05,203 --> 01:14:08,912
We're having beef, honey. Do you want
the tofu wrap or the veggie wrap?

631
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,193
You all right?

632
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,313
Where have you been?
