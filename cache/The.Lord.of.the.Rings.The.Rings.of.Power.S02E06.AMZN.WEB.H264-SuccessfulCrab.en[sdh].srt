Well, there's what you're searchin' for

[Stranger] <i>This... magic.</i>

Might you teach me how to wield a staff?

00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:32,041
It's yours to wield already,
if you prove yourself worthy of it.

Greed is not his way.
It never has been.

00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:12,291
Is it possible the Ring he's wearing...

22
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:16,083
No. There simply cannot be
a fault in your Rings.

23
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,750
[Prince Durin IV] <i>Then maybe,
the fault's in the Ring-maker.</i>

[Annatar] <i>No.</i>

We did.

00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:39,000
We must atone for our mistakes
by completing the Rings together.

30
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:42,500
The Nine must redeem the Seven.

Show me what?

This gatehouse is typically athrum

But it all strangely halted yester-eve.

109
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,750
[Commander Malendol] We sent
a search party across the river

110
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,583
to see if there was an obstruction
upon the road.

111
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,666
But only one soldier returned.

112
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,750
Where is he?

113
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:58,083
Washed up this morning.
He appeared to be carrying a message.

114
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,000
Bury him.

115
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,708
Show this to no one.

116
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,916
And shall I inform Lord Celebrimbor?

117
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,083
No.

118
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,333
He has asked me to see to it
that no one is permitted to disturb him.

119
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,125
Not even the smiths.

He has stripped us of our duties?

Yes, I am afraid so.

122
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,583
Was it that business
about him forgetting my name?

123
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,250
I know I was brusque with him, but...

124
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,250
He's not himself, Mirdania.

125
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,208
For now, all we can do
is leave him in solitude.

126
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,916
Give him time. And pray.

Pray that he finishes this work
before it finishes him.

My lord, the carving. On the body.

During my brief time in your capture,

136
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,583
you seemed intent on finding Sauron.

137
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,916
One might even say, consumed by it,

138
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,958
the way one always is,

139
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,833
once he has wormed his way
inside your mind.

140
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,333
You know nothing of my mind.

141
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,166
You yielded to him.

142
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,291
I resisted.

143
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,583
For a while, perhaps.

144
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,791
But sooner or later, he sees you.

145
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:07,083
Not just who you are,
but who you wish to be.

146
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,875
His eye bores a hole
and the rest of him slithers in.

147
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:20,000
For a while, he even makes you believe
that his power has become yours.

148
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,875
Irresistible power...

149
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,416
that makes every desire's fulfillment
seem inevitable.

150
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,750
An ocean of color

151

against which everything else
feels forever thereafter...

00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,083
What did he promise you?

154
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,250
An army.

155
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,666
Do you want to know what he offered me?

156
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,208
I care not.

157
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,291
Children.

158
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,791
Then it would seem he gave us both
what we desired.

159
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,625
You see,

160
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,916
it is not his lies
which must be extinguished.

161
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,958
It is him.

162
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,666
And I can help you do it.

00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,500
I can help you destroy Sauron.

00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,708
What help could you possibly provide, Orc?

165
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,791
[in Black Speech] <i>Uruk.</i>

166
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,041
[in English] Morgoth's crown. I was told...

167
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,166
There are many stories of what happened,

168
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,875
after the Silmarils were pried
from its settings.

169
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,833
But I was there
when Sauron re-fired it to fit himself.

170
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,541
I was there when he kneeled to be crowned.

171
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,166
And I was the one
who used its power, to slay him.

172
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,208
If what you say is true,

173
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,541
why did he return?

174
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,916
Because I had not yet found you.

175
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,833
What part am I to play in this?

176
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,416
It is said the Three Elven Rings
saved your kind from fading.

177
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,041
Is it true?

178
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:28,000
If it is, then perhaps together,

179
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,666
this crown and your Rings
would be powerful enough

180
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,250
to truly destroy Sauron forever.

181
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,708
The Deceiver believes
he is still beyond my grasp.

182
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,666
But I know he hides in Eregion.

183
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:48,375
And I suspect you know for certain...

184
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,916
Halbrand is Sauron.

185
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,416
Isn't he?

186
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,666
The fate of that city

187
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,666
now rests on your ability
to put aside your pride.

188
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,750
I suggest you find the will to do so.

189
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,166
If you can.

190
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,041
We will speak again.

191
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,708
[dramatic musical flourish]

192
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,625
[Ar-Pharazôn] Outlawry.

193
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,416
Incitement of a violent conflagration
that led to loss of life.

194
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,375
And last, but most odious,

195
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
the crime of high treason.

196
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:15,708
Taken in sum, these hideous breaches
of law warrant a sentence of death.

197
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,958
[man] Yes!

198
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,166
[crowd clamoring]

199
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,666
[man 3] He doesn't deserve
to be put to death.

200
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,333
-[woman] Well, maybe.
-[clamor dies down]

201
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,416
However,

202
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,625
given his many years
of faithful service to our kingdom,

203
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,458
it is the judgment of this court
that the accused be set free.

204
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,041
[people shouting, jeering]

205
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,291
[shouting] Set free...

206
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,583
[clamor dies down]

207
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:54,291
Set free, provided, of course,
he renounces his crimes

208
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,291
and pledges his loyalty
to Númenor's true ruler.

209
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:10,166
Elendil, son of Amandil,
do you renounce your crimes?

210
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,375
I do.

211
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,458
[crowd clamoring]

212
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:32,333
And do you accept Ar-Pharazôn
as Númenor's true King?

213
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,291
I do not.

214
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,458
Speak louder, Elendil,

215
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,958
so that the assembled
may hear you properly.

216
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,791
I do not!

217
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,041
[crowd jeer]

218
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:05,000
For Númenor's true ruler is now,
until the end of her days,

219
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,750
Míriel, daughter of Tar-Palantír!

220
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:15,541
And the only traitor here is you!

221
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,625
[dramatic music playing]

222
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,750
[Kemen] Now what are we to do with him?

223
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,458
You have done quite enough, boy.

224
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,833
Perhaps we should let the Valar
decide his fate.

225
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,666
If The Faithful wish to live
by the old traditions,

226
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,208
they ought to die by them as well.

227
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,375
[screams]

228
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,125
[Nori screams, scream fades]

229
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:06,750
Nori.

230
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,041
Snorin'? Who's snorin'?

231
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,500
No one.

232
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,583
I... I saw something.

233
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,250
The Secret Fire whispers to us,
if we have ears to hear.

234
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,666
It tells us things. Even shows us things.

235
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:30,208
Does it show us things that will be?
Or things that only might be?

236
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,791
It shows tomorrow's clouds
as clear as yesterday's sunshine.

237
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,666
How do I learn to master its power?
To fight back against the darkness?

238
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,291
What does the Secret Fire need
with you as a master?

239
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,208
But if I cannot master it,
then how am I to use it?

240
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:54,541
Every trial that you have met thus far,
you have failed.

241
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,666
Fail the trial before you now,

242
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,958
and there will not be another.

243
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,791
Tell me what I must do.

244
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,708
Follow ol' Tom. For he will show you.

245
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,791
[horses whinnying]

246
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,750
[Nori] <i>Why don't you just leave?</i>

247
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,458
Get clear of 'em. Run away.

248
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,000
And where exactly would we go?

249
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,458
Why... anywhere you want.

250
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,291
Harfoots find a new place to live
every month.

251
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,208
[Gundabale] Hmm.

252
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:39,583
This Smial, my mum and her folks
dug for me.

253
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,500
-I was born in it.
-[somber music playing]

254
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:49,041
I've been tendin' that tree
since I was big enough to balance a rake.

255
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,166
I married my Bramgar in its shadow.

256
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,666
And last spring, when he passed,

257
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,583
I buried him under it.

258
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,041
And one day, I'll be buried beside him.

259
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,291
Every one of these Smials
has a story like that.

260

-[indistinct chatter]
-[somber music continues]

261
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:35,000
You see, this place,
it's not just where we live.

262
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,208
It's our home.

263
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:40,958
It's me.

264
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,333
-Nori...
-No. I got you into this rut.

265
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:48,291
Maybe it's up to me to get you out.

266
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,708
Turn myself in now,

267
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,250
there's a chance I can get Poppy out, too.

[Poppy and Merimac chuckle]

Been meaning to ask ya,
why is it exactly they call you Nobody?

270

My folks aren't the most decisive.
Took 'em a long time to settle on a name.

271
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,833
Well, how long?

272
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,416
Well, one or two years.

273
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,625
That's not so long.

274
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,625
One or two years ago.

275
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,666
And by that point, Nobody'd stuck.

276
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,583
[Poppy] Hmm.

[Poppy] <i>She's right, Nor.</i>

Those big folk are only after us
to get to him, the Stranger.

Turn yourself in, you might well be
puttin' the whole world at risk.

Not just Stoors, but Harfoots too.

Your ma and da. Dilly.

293
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,708
How many times you told me he's important?

294
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,500
Few more'n a rabbit's dozen, I suppose.

295
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:37,625
Thing is, Nor, sooner or later,
when you say somethin' enough,

296
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,625
I start believin' ya.

297
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,750
I say we fight for it.

298
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,583
The Dark Wizard found his staff.

299
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:06,250
And now, the time has come
for you to find yours.

300
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,166
[Stranger, panting] Oh!

301
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,166
Which one is it?

302
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:20,083
[Tom] You'll find your true staff
only when the vision of your heart

303
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:23,041
is single to the service
of the Secret Fire.

304
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,833
But there are so many.

305
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,541
One could spend months
searching out there.

306
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,125
You have all the time you need.

307
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,833
Unless, there is somewhere else
you wish to be.

308
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:39,166
I saw her. Nori.

309
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,500
-She was...
-[chuckles softly]

310
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:45,916
Somehow, I know that
unless I find her soon, she will die.

311
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,208
Both of them will die.

312
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:50,208
Many that die deserve life.

313
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,958
Some that live deserve death.

314
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,666
Who are you to give it to them?

315
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:59,458
Once I know that she's safe,
I could return to you.

316
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:02,250
No. You cannot.

317
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:09,000
There are times when one path becomes two,
and you must choose.

318
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,833
Turn away now,
and you can never return to this path.

319
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,291
Is there no other way?

320
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,875
Sauron rises in the west.

321
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,291
A Dark Wizard in the east.

322
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,875

486
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:15,041
[waves crashing]

487
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,333
[woman] Release him!

488
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,833
[people clamor]

489
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,375
Given that his crime
was committed in my name,

490
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:28,541
I have the right to face
the Valar's judgment in his place.

491
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,833
-It should be him. Take him.
-[woman] No, no. No!

492
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:39,125
My Queen?

493
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,750
She's correct.
It's all in there. You must.

494
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:46,750
Is this true?

495
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,625
By the letter of the law, yes.

496
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:52,916
So it shall be.

497
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,833
No, take me.

498
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,208
Take me.

499
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,916
[speaking Quenya]

500
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,625
[in English] Míriel, you can't...
You cannot...

501
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:05,541
If we are to walk the path
of The Faithful,

502
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,791
it must be me who takes the first step.

503
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,416
-[woman 1] It's here! Look!
-[man 1] Over the horizon.

504
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,708
[man 2] Yeah, it's coming now.

505
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,708

[roaring]

509
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:34,666
The Valar have deemed her...

510
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,250
-[woman] There she is!
-Innocent!

511

[people cheering]

512
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:47,208
My Queen!

513
00:44:54,333 --> 00:45:00,083
Hail Tar-Míriel, Queen of the Sea!

514
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:03,125
[people chanting]

515
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:12,666
-Hail Queen Míriel.
-Hail Queen of the Sea.

516
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:15,541
Hail Queen Míriel.

[panting]

521
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,541
[Galadriel] <i>Yes. Halbrand is Sauron.</i>

522
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:59,333
He's in Eregion to craft Rings
that will allow him to dominate my kind.

523
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,625
-And yours.
-Every kind in Middle-earth.

524
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:05,375
But he will not attempt escape
until his task is complete.

525
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:10,458
And that gives us a momentary advantage.

526
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,000
Us?

527
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:14,666
[chains rattle]

528
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,333
Unlock me.

529
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:43,458
As we speak, Elrond hastens from Lindon
with an army of Elves.

530
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:49,416
And Nenya, my Ring.

531
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:52,666
I see.

532
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,833
Once he arrives,
he will seal off the city,

533
00:46:56,916 --> 00:47:00,333
loose Celebrimbor from Sauron's grasp,
and then together,

534
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:02,500
<i>Uruk,</i>

535
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:08,083
you and I will eradicate
all trace of Sauron from this world.

536
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,375
Never to return.

537
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,291
And what then?

538
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,833
Any Rings that have known his touch
must be destroyed.

539
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,625
I meant, what then for the <i>Uruk?</i>

540
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:23,250
Will your High King permit us
to return home in peace?

541
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,500
Or will he proceed with his plans
to invade Mordor?

542
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:33,625
The shadow has not only overcome you,
it has overcome all Elvendom.

543
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,250
In the end,

544
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:39,708
your drive to prove your virtue will work
right into Sauron's designs.

545
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:42,291
You speak lies.

546
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,083
Hoping I will reveal something.

547
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,791
You have already revealed

548
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:52,000
everything I hoped you would and more.

549
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,291
-[indistinct clamor]
-[tools clanging]

550
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:05,458
[Orc] All right, all right.

551
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,750
[in Black Speech] It is time!

552
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:14,541
[in English] All of Eregion may well be
under Sauron's control by now.

553
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:19,833
It will take far more than a legion
of your children to lay siege to it.

554
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:23,958
Did you really think I would attempt
to challenge the might of Sauron

555
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,583
with a single legion?

556
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:31,916
[dramatic music playing]

557
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:48,708
Now that you have confirmed
beyond any doubt who he is,

558
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,708
and told me who carries your Ring,

559
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:55,125
Eregion will fall.

560
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,750
And Sauron with it.

561
00:48:58,916 --> 00:48:59,916
No.

562
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,583
This must be what he wants.

563
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:09,291
Sauron has no army of his own,

564
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:12,875
so he's lured yours here instead.

565
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:17,041
He wants you to attack Eregion.

566
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:19,666
Bind her. She will be useful later.

567
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,166
-I beg you. Do not be a fool.
-[Orc] Get down here.

568
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,500
Do not do this. Do not take his lure.

569
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:28,166
I will make him choke on it.

570
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
No!

571
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:34,083
You mustn't. This is all his design!

572
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,666
This is what Sauron wants!

573
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,000
This is what he wants!

574
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:41,416
[Orc] This way. Come on.

590
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,833
Did you not hear that?

591
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:26,500
Outside. Sounded like a siege alarm.

592
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:30,208
I assure you, I have the affairs
of the city well in hand.

593
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,791
I shall decide that for myself.

594
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:37,833
You belong in here, my friend.

595
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,833
I've had quite enough
of you telling me where I belong!

596
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,291
Unhand me, friend.

597
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,958
Leave this tower now,

598
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,375
and when the Men of Middle-earth fall,
I swear to you,

599
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,833
every soul in the seen or unseen world

600
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:10,166
will know that it was you
who was the architect of their demise.

601
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,166
We still have nine Rings to forge!

-Sure.
-It's a horse.

609
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:14,625
[Annatar] For centuries,

610
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,833
I sought to craft objects of great power.

611
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:22,166
But I failed.

612
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:24,125
The truth of it is,

613
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:28,208
I came to Eregion
not because the Valar needed you,

614
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,708
but because I did.

615
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:34,666
I... [sighs]

616
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,000
I cannot forge more Rings.

617
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,583
And without <i>mithril,</i> I...

618
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:53,625
Be at ease.

619
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,750
I have been to Khazad-dûm.

620
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:02,791
<i>Mithril</i> ore.

621
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:07,125
Refined to a powder by Narvi himself.

622
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,250
From the purest deposit yet found
in their mines.

623
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,666
One-ninth portion per Ring.

624
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,375
It should be enough.

625
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:22,291
We are close, now, Celebrimbor.

626
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,375
So close to achieving
what we set out to do.

627
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:31,500
I give you my oath,
upon my immortal being,

628
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,916
when the history of this Age is written,
the Silmarils,

629
00:54:37,458 --> 00:54:38,458
well...

630
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:44,750
They will merit little more
than a whisper.

631
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,166
But your Rings,

632
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,750
the Rings of Power,

633
00:54:54,791 --> 00:55:00,500
they will be deemed the most
precious creations in all Middle-earth.

634
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,958
Yeah.

635

Do not turn back now, at the very moment
your boots are kissing the threshold.

Use it, my friend.

637
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:18,416
Best Fëanor.

638
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:21,458
Best yourself.

639
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:31,375
One last time.

640
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,041
[man] I've written a poem
but I fear your beauty
