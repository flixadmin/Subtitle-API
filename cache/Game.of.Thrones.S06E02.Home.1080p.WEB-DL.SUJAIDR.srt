2
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,362
Give him another go, Ned.

3
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,364
That's my father.

4
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,032
And my Uncle Benjen.

5
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:52,337
Keep your shield up or I'll
ring your head like a bell.

6
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,747
They were all so happy.

7
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,017
So were you once.

8
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:14,058
Stop showing off.

9
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,660
Lyanna!

10
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,128
My Aunt Lyanna.

11
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,630
<i>I've seen her statue in the crypt.</i>

12
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:24,035
My father never talked about her.

13
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,275
<i>Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.</i>

14
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:36,280
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

15
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,482
<i>I don't know.</i>

16
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,584
What about him?

17
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,287
Wylis, come here.

18
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,627
Hodor?

19
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,396
<i>But he's got giant's blood.</i>

20
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,233
And you've got training. Sounds
like a fair match to me.

21
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,769
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

22
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,439
And lowers it when he's
going to dodge, my lady.

23
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,075
Hodor talks?

24
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:11,349
You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

25
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,085
Come along, now.
It's no place for you.

26
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,387
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

27
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,423
If he ever learned to
fight, he'd be unstoppable.

28
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,427
Well, he's never going to learn to
fight because he's a stable boy.

29
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,328
So leave him be.

30
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,564
It is time to go.

31
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,300
Please, a little longer.

32
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,449
You finally show me
something I care about

33
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,783
and then you drag me away.

34
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,554
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

35
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,123
but if you stay too long,
you'll drown.

36
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,861
I wasn't drowning.
I was home.

37
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,143
Wylis.

38
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,544
Hodor.

39
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,446
I saw you as a boy.

40
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,449
You could talk.

41
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,285
What happened?

42
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,454
Hodor.

43
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,427
Where's Meera?

44
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,531
Hodor.

45
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,625
You shouldn't be here.

46
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,561
It's not safe outside the cave.

47
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,863
It's not safe anywhere.

48
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,835
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

49
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,837
- Hodor.
- <i>His real name is Wylis.</i>

50
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,176
And he could talk and
fight and-- and then--

51
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,444
What's wrong?

52
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,716
The Three-Eyed Raven
says there's a war coming.

53
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,786
And we're going to fight it in there?

54
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,451
Brandon Stark needs you.

55
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,288
For what?
I sit in there

56
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,958
and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

57
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,794
He isn't going to stay here forever.

58
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,998
And out there he needs you.

59
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,892
<i>It's time, Ser Davos.</i>

60
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,462
Open the door and the men inside

61
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,565
can rejoin their brothers in peace.

62
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:57,608
We'll even set the wolf free north
of the Wall where it belongs.

63
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,314
Nobody needs to die tonight.

64
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,353
I've never been much of a fighter.

65
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,629
Apologies for what
you're about to see.

66
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,638
Come on.

67
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,586
Attack!

68
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,896
Fight, you cowards!

69
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,530
You fucking traitor.

70
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,165
The only traitors here are the ones

71
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,702
who shoved their knives into
their Lord Commander's heart.

72
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:08,072
For thousands of years
the Night's Watch

73
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,575
has held Castle Black
against the wildlings.

74
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,677
Until you.

75
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,924
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

76
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,026
<i>Took a lot of knives.</i>

77
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,832
I'll have my men
get the wood for a fire.

78
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,668
Bodies to burn.

79
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,578
<i> Shh, hey.</i>

80
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,515
Right, so there she is,
high and mighty Queen Cersei,

81
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,784
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

82
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,753
All of a sudden she looks my way.

83
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,723
Gives me a little smile
like, "Well?"

84
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,959
So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

85
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,761
and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

86
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,698
She's never seen anything like it.

87
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,267
I mean, she's used to her
brother and from what I hear,

88
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,270
Jaime Lannister's half
an inch shy of an inch.

89
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,137
Ooh!

90
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,076
She sees it and I swear to
the gods she licks her lips.

91
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,278
Well, you all know me.

92
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,947
You know I wouldn't lie about this.

93
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,993
Get out of my way.

94
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,796
King's orders, Your Grace.

95
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,333
What are the king's orders?

96
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,936
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

97
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,871
for your own protection.

98
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,008
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

99
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:36,680
Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
command, I cannot let you pass.

100
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,350
I would like to speak to my son.

101
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,853
He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

102
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,852
She grew up.

103
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,320
<i>Almost.</i>

104
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,090
Have we caught Prince
Trystane's killers?

105
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,927
I expect it was Mother.

106
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,196
Your mother wouldn't do that.

107
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,098
Yes, she would.

108
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,202
Are you angry with her?

109
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,673
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

110
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,075
She has every right to be here.

111
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:42,179
They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the sept.

112
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:47,451
If she had tried--
They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.

113
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,087
Not while I'm here.

114
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,092
Why haven't you gone to see her?

115
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,431
Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

116
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,701
Don't you think I know that?

117
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,306
I'm sorry.

118
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,976
But I can't.

119
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,745
Why not?

120
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:19,216
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

121
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,719
what did I do?

122
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:26,457
When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,

123
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,859
what did I do?

124
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,195
We all fail sometimes.

125
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,465
The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

126
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:38,936
If I can't even protect my
own wife or my own mother,

127
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,137
what good am I?

128
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,241
Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

129
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,412
Your Grace.

130
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,214
Lord Commander.

131
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,916
I want to see my wife.

132
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,052
The gods wait for Queen Margaery

133
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,956
to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

134
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,925
The king must wait as well.

135
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,095
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

136
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,107
You're a bold man.

137
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,210
On the contrary.

138
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,880
I fear a great deal.

139
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:26,283
The Father, the Mother,

140
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,952
the Warrior.

141
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,065
Do you know why we use these stones?

142
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,302
To remind us not to fear death.

143
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,206
We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

144
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,309
You must long for the next life.

145
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,012
In truth, I fear that, too.

146
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,115
You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

147
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,084
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

148
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,053
and atoned for her sin.

149
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,889
What about my sins?

150
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:11,528
I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

151
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,132
I killed my own cousin.

152
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,201
When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

153
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,337
I helped him escape their justice.

154
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,541
What atonement do I deserve?

155
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,612
You would spill blood
in this holy place?

156
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,547
Oh, the gods won't mind.

157
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,318
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

158
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,921
Go on, then.

159
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,425
I deserve it.
We all do.

160
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,127
We are weak, vain creatures.

161
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,397
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

162
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,949
They should be closer if you
mean for them to save you.

163
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,217
I don't.

164
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,420
They'd never reach me
before you struck.

165
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,189
I've fought against worse odds.

166
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,425
No doubt many of us would fall.

167
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,395
But who are we, hmm?

168
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,064
We have no names, no family.

169
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:25,402
Every one of us
is poor and powerless.

170
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,638
And yet together,

171
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,174
we can overthrow an empire.

172
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,106
<i>Mother.</i>

173
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:17,421
Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

174
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,957
Gold.

175
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,260
Good. It was always her color.

176
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,699
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

177
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,503
<i>I shouldn't have,
but I was--</i>

178
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,042
I didn't want to lose you again.

179
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,311
I understand.

180
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,315
I'm glad to see you.

181
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,387
I know I should have come sooner.

182
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,458
I wanted to.
I was wrong.

183
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,694
It's all right.

184
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,699
No, it isn't.

185
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,470
I should have executed all of them.

186
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,005
I should have pulled down the sept

187
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:12,609
onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

188
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,645
as you would have for me.

189
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:19,383
You raised me to be strong...

190
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,186
and I wasn't.

191
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,556
But I want to be.

192
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,094
Help me.

193
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,134
Always.

194
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:08,065
If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

195
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,503
Meaning no offense.

196
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,706
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

197
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,141
I do not make dwarf jokes.

198
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,277
You think them.

199
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,847
So, the fleet.
It's been burned.

200
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:28,351
We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

201
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,687
Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.

202
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,257
Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.

203
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,094
Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.

204
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,862
The Masters have retaken both cities.

205
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:45,202
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

206
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:50,640
What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.

207
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,842
They are not eating.

208
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,278
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

209
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,547
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

210
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,417
Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.

211
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,287
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

212
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,456
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

213
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,292
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

214
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:12,863
I drink and I know things.

215
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:17,434
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

216
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,170
ranged over hundreds of miles.

217
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,771
Then Daenerys's ancestors

218
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,908
started chaining them up in pens.

219
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,676
A few generations later,

220
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,447
the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

221
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,451
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

222
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,753
Missandei,

223
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:40,557
how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?

224
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,195
- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

225
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,863
Never.

226
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,598
Dragons are intelligent.

227
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,835
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

228
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,471
They have affection for their friends

229
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,940
and fury for their enemies.

230
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,277
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

231
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:04,414
They will. It's time
they had their supper.

232
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,374
I'm friends with your mother.

233
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,316
I'm here to help.

234
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,918
Don't eat the help.

235
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,557
When I was a child,

236
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,628
an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.

237
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,730
I begged him for one of you.

238
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:05,568
"It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon," I told him.

239
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,639
"It could be little
like me."

240
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:20,517
Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.

241
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,320
Then my father told me

242
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:27,324
the last dragon had died
a century ago.

243
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:31,328
I cried myself to sleep that night.

244
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,339
But here you are.

245
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,841
Next time I have an idea like that,

246
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,177
punch me in the face.

247
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,692
What's your name?

248
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,834
What's your name?

249
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,438
- No one.
- I don't believe that.

250
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,674
You don't believe that.

251
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:58,475
Who are you?

252
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,477
No one.

253
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,645
If a girl says her name,

254
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:06,082
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

255
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,551
A girl has no name.

256
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,753
If a girl says her name,

257
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,022
a man will feed her tonight.

258
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,025
A girl has no name.

259
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,561
If a girl says her name,

260
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,631
a man will give her eyes back.

261
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,635
A girl has no name.

262
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,211
Come.

263
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,787
Leave it.

264
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,124
<i>A girl is not a beggar anymore.</i>

265
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,969
We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

266
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:04,007
Half a dozen men?
Your best hunters?

267
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,208
They obviously had help.

268
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,279
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

269
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,248
Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

270
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,717
We know where she's going.

271
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,619
Her brother's at Castle Black.

272
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,221
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

273
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,790
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

274
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,326
So was I, Father.

275
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,628
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

276
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,864
as long as a Stark
can walk through that door.

277
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,199
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

278
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:34,203
And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

279
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:38,708
With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow--

280
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,711
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

281
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:45,348
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

282
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,117
We don't need
every house in the North.

283
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,787
<i>The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks</i>

284
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,924
command more soldiers than all
the other houses combined.

285
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,360
With their support,
none could challenge us.

286
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:02,165
The Starks lost my house the day
King Robb cut off my father's head.

287
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:06,069
It's time for new blood in the North.

288
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,146
If you acquire a
reputation as a mad dog,

289
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,781
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

290
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:22,819
Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

291
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,288
<i>My lords.</i>

292
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,191
<i>Lady Walda has given birth.</i>

293
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,959
A boy.

294
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,328
<i>Red-cheeked
and healthy.</i>

295
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,399
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

296
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,677
Congratulations, Father.

297
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,881
I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

298
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:58,788
You'll always be my firstborn.

299
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,858
Thank you for saying that.

300
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,861
It means a great deal to me.

301
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,231
Maester Wolkan,

302
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:47,437
<i>send ravens to all the northern houses.
Roose Bolton is dead.</i>

303
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,307
Poisoned by our enemies.

304
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,816
How did he die?

305
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,221
Poisoned by his enemies.

306
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:09,092
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

307
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,295
Forgive me, my lord.

308
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,467
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

309
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,137
She's resting, my lord.

310
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,476
At once, my lord.

311
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,969
There he is.

312
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,404
Isn't he wonderful?

313
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,977
May I hold him?

314
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,313
Of-- of course.

315
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,325
Little brother.

316
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,028
Lord Bolton sent for us.

317
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,164
Have you seen him?

318
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,975
Of course.
Follow me, Mother.

319
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,328
Where is Lord Bolton?

320
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,172
Down!

321
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,342
<i> It's all right. Come on, shh.</i>

322
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:10,980
<i>It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.</i>

323
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:20,189
Ramsay, where is your father?

324
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,192
Ramsay.

325
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:33,202
Where is Lord Bolton?

326
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,878
I am Lord Bolton.

327
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,356
Ramsay.

328
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,423
Ramsay, please.

329
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:58,294
I'll leave Winterfell.
I'll go back to the Riverlands.

330
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,368
Please.

331
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,670
Ramsay.

332
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,440
He's your brother.

333
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,412
I prefer being an only child.

334
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,502
<i>I saw her with a man.</i>

335
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,970
I don't think he hurt her.

336
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:45,308
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

337
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,444
You don't know which way she went?

338
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,213
I spent three days looking for her.

339
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,215
She disappeared.

340
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,552
How'd she look?

341
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,421
She looked good.

342
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:02,358
She wasn't exactly
dressed like a lady.

343
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,394
No, she wouldn't be.

344
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,465
What happened at Winterfell?

345
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,080
I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

346
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:27,717
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

347
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,557
We've all had to make
difficult choices.

348
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:57,013
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

349
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:57,780
It's not safe.

350
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,148
He won't stop hunting us.

351
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,583
We just have to make it
to Castle Black.

352
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,152
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
won't be able to touch us.

353
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,722
Jon will have me killed the
moment I step through the gate.

354
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,124
I won't let him.

355
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,127
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

356
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:15,131
And the truth about the farm
boys I killed in their place.

357
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:19,769
And the truth about
Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

358
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,774
And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

359
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,644
When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

360
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,280
I don't want to be forgiven.

361
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,184
I can never make
amends to your family

362
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,353
for the things I've done.

363
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,657
They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

364
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,131
You're not coming with us?

365
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:54,503
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

366
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,573
I would have died to get you there.

367
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,759
May I take one of the horses?

368
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,565
Where will you go?

369
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,303
Home.

370
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:39,381
<i>The Glovers have
retaken Deepwood Motte.</i>

371
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,617
And the ironborn who held it?

372
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:45,621
They died fighting to a man.

373
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,724
What is dead may never die.

374
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,393
What is dead may never die.

375
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,195
But they did

376
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,431
and our invasion died with them.

377
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:59,301
Deepwood Motte was our last
stronghold on the mainland.

378
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,703
Then we will take more.

379
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,840
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

380
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,777
Because I order it.

381
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,713
We can defeat anyone at sea,

382
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,415
but we'll never hold
lands and castles

383
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,617
against mainland armies.

384
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,519
Not if our captains defy my orders,

385
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:21,423
abandon their posts, and sacrifice
our men on foolish missions.

386
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:24,160
I won't apologize
for trying to rescue Theon.

387
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,227
Then where is he?

388
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,862
Where is your kingdom?

389
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:31,834
We took those castles because the
northerners marched off to war.

390
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,602
That war is over.

391
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:35,337
The last time
we provoked them too far,

392
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,440
I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

393
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,442
<i>and knocked down our towers.</i>

394
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,578
<i>I lost two brothers that day.</i>

395
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,781
And I lost three sons.

396
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,417
The War of the Five
Kings, they call it.

397
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,652
Well, the other four are dead.

398
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:53,622
When you rule the Iron Islands, you
can wage all the peace you want.

399
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,558
But for now, shut your mouth and obey

400
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,261
or I will make another heir who will.

401
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,768
Let me pass.

402
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,608
You fool, move aside for your king.

403
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,577
Haven't I always, brother?

404
00:40:56,988 --> 00:41:02,024
I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

405
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:06,328
What is dead may never die.

406
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,532
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

407
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,868
Aren't you supposed
to repeat the words?

408
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,305
You can mock our god without my help.

409
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,341
I don't mock the Drowned God.

410
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,344
I am the Drowned God.

411
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,946
From Oldtown to Qarth,

412
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:27,916
when men see my sails, they pray.

413
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,062
You're old, brother.

414
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,031
<i>You've had your time.</i>

415
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,433
Now let another rule.

416
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,603
I heard you lost your mind

417
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,072
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

418
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:56,645
They tied you to the mast to
keep you from jumping overboard.

419
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:57,579
They did.

420
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:02,785
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

421
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:05,354
I needed silence.

422
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,956
What kind of an ironborn

423
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:12,361
loses his senses during a storm?

424
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,964
I am the storm, brother.

425
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:19,068
The first storm and the last.

426
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,705
And you're in my way.

427
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:04,079
Lord, take your servant Balon
back beneath the waves.

428
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,816
Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

429
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,718
Pull his bones down to your depths

430
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,821
to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

431
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,991
What is dead may never die.

432
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:26,702
I'm going to find out who did this.

433
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:30,906
I'm going to feed them to
the sharks while they live.

434
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,510
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

435
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:37,613
The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

436
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,681
not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

437
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,150
My father would have
wanted me to rule.

438
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:45,821
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

439
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:48,857
Perhaps you'll win.

440
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:53,629
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

441
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,665
And perhaps not.

442
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,150
Come in.

443
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:24,526
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

444
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,129
You interrupt nothing.

445
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:42,010
I assume you know why I'm here.

446
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,079
I will after you tell me.

447
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,582
It's about the Lord Commander.

448
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:49,518
The former Lord Commander.

449
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,621
Does he have to be?

450
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,193
What are you asking?

451
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:05,968
Do you know of any magic...

452
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,871
that could help him?

453
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:09,938
Bring him back?

454
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,041
If you want to help him,
leave him be.

455
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,010
Can it be done?

456
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,813
There are some with this power.

457
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,616
- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

458
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:22,184
Have you seen it done?

459
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:27,289
I met a man who came
back from the dead,

460
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,292
but the priest
who did it--

461
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,561
it shouldn't have been possible.

462
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,031
But it was.
It could be now.

463
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,867
Not for me.

464
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,040
Not for you?

465
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,280
I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

466
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:55,050
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

467
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,553
Everything I believed,

468
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:01,256
the great victory
I saw in the flames,

469
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,592
all of it was a lie.

470
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,131
You were right all along.

471
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:12,167
The Lord never spoke to me.

472
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,169
Fuck him, then.

473
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,772
Fuck all of them.

474
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,976
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

475
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:25,681
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

476
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,285
I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

477
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:36,058
I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

478
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,795
I never had this gift.

479
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,230
Have you ever tried?

480
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:27,889
Please.

481
00:52:21,397 --> 00:52:26,864
