1
00:00:00,651 --> 00:00:02,035
Previously,
on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:06,124
If I only knew how
you were spending your nights.

3
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:08,162
Why should I trust you?!

4
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:12,233
Oliver.

5
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:13,951
I thought it was past time we talked.
About what?

6
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:15,203
You being
a serial killer?

7
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:16,754
Let's start with Laurel,

8
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:18,289
since you're still in love with her.
So are you.

9
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,341
Lord knows that I am guilty
of a lot of things

10
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:24,429
between us, but not you
and her. She chose you.

11
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:25,880
My name is Moira Dearden Queen.

12
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:28,349
I'm the CEO
of Queen Consolidated.

13
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,613
I have been complicit
in an undertaking

14
00:00:30,638 --> 00:00:32,304
with one horrible purpose--

15
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:34,505
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

16
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:37,608
But you need to know that
the architect of this nightmare

17
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,193
is Malcolm Merlyn.

18
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:41,028
You can't
beat me, Oliver,

19
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,980
'cause you don't
know in your heart

20
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,699
what you're
fighting for.

21
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,068
Is Laurel safe?
Yeah, you saved her.

22
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,570
No. Tommy...

23
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:51,873
It should
have been me.

24
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:22,904
Felicity,
if you're so scared,

25
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:24,105
why did you insist
on sitting up front?

26
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:25,506
This is the only seat
with a seatbelt.

27
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:27,275
Which will come in handy
when we hit the water

28
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:29,494
at 180 miles an hour.

29
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:31,496
Which will not happen.

30
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,918
I think that means
we're here.

31
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:41,005
Lian Yu.

32
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,744
But...You said the parachutes
were just in case!

33
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,296
Yeah, just in case
we made it here.

34
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,931
Come on.
No!

35
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:57,922
All right,
Felicity, on 3!

36
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:00,358
I can't, I'm scared! I can't--
1!

37
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:13,204
Thanks for waiting
until we touched down.

38
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:15,439
My pleasure.

39
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,625
Let's move.

40
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:37,962
What is it?

41
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:41,148
Thought I heard something.

42
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:48,522
Dig!

43
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:53,978
Don't move.

44
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:02,003
It's a landmine.
I'm going to try to disarm it.

45
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,988
You can't!

46
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:08,158
Diggle! Walk away.

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,162
Felicity, don't move.

48
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:26,944
God, you're--
you're really sweaty.

49
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:30,231
You're a hard man to find.

50
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:32,950
You shouldn't have
come here.

51
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:43,494
Would have emailed,
but this isn't exactly a WiFi hotspot.

52
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:45,212
Is this where you lived when
you were here?

53
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:48,132
I mean, the first time
you were here.

54
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:50,501
For some of it.

55
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:53,304
Could you at least pretend
like you're glad to see us?

56
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:55,339
Dig and I spent weeks
tracking you down.

57
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:56,891
We've traveled
halfway across the world.

58
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,643
And this morning
we flew in a plane so old,

59
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:00,594
I'm pretty sure I was safer once
I jumped out of it.

60
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:02,980
You could...at least
offer us a water.

61
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:05,599
Or...

62
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:08,269
A coconut.

63
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,890
Fresh out of coconuts.

64
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,327
I am happy to see you.

65
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,746
But I know why you're here.

66
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:21,582
I'm not coming back
to Starling City.

67
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,741
I can't. My mission,

68
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:25,671
my father's list,
it was a fool's crusade.

69
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:27,922
And I failed.

70
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:30,074
Malcolm Merlyn
destroyed the Glades.

71
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:33,844
Tommy died.

72
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:37,381
And the Hood couldn't stop it.

73
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:40,935
So don't ask me
to put it on again.

74
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,754
Ever.

75
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,558
This isn't about you
being the Vigilante.

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,094
This is about you
being Oliver Queen.

77
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:52,947
Your mother's
in prison, Oliver.

78
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,732
Her trial's
coming up.

79
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:57,284
Thea's out
on her own.

80
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:58,602
Your family
needs you.

81
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:00,437
So does the family business.

82
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,106
All the bad press
after the Undertaking

83
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:04,291
left Queen Consolidated
ripe for a hostile takeover

84
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,943
by Stellmoor International.

85
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:08,295
They've gutted every company
they've taken over.

86
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:09,663
Once they gobble up
Queen Consolidated,

87
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:11,615
30,000 employees are going
to be out of a job.

88
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:15,753
Including one very blond
I.T. expert.

89
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:17,788
Listen, I get why you
had to leave, Oliver,

90
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,673
probably better
than anybody else.

91
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,926
I've been there.

92
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:24,478
And after what happened,
nobody can blame you for leaving.

93
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:29,350
But it's time
to come home.

94
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:54,091
You're not the first man
to learn the hard way--

95
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:56,827
women are a distraction.

96
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:00,998
You've come very far
in a few months.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,017
Don't beat yourself up.

98
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,686
Ah, apparently that's his job.
And I love my job.

99
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:08,005
Not that I wouldn't trade it
for a way off this island.

100
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:10,608
While you two were playing
with each other, I was hunting.

101
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,028
Well, there's nothing more attractive
than a woman who can hunt.

102
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,364
When I was marooned here,
my first meal was a pheasant.

103
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:19,150
Your father cooked it for me.

104
00:06:19,152 --> 00:06:22,036
He was an awful cook.
Yeah.

105
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:23,037
But a great father.

106
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,872
I'm looking at the proof.

107
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:28,742
Let's eat.

108
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,080
What's that?

109
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:36,217
That's Fyers'
proximity detector.

110
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:39,086
We salvaged it from the wreckage
of the soldier's camp.

111
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:41,222
Picks up anything moving
outside our safe zone.

112
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:44,225
It's been five months
since we stopped Fyers.

113
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:46,093
He and all of his men
were dead.

114
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:48,495
So maybe it's an animal.

115
00:06:48,497 --> 00:06:50,981
There's an imaging
interface.

116
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,483
Those are not animals.

117
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:56,170
And we're not alone
on this island.

118

Who's blood?

121
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:26,683
An alderman from the Glades
trying to save the city.

122
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:28,652
Fill your shoes.

123
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:31,905
Here's everything
on Stellmoor International.

124
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:34,208
The vice president
of acquisitions

125
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,294
is a woman named Isabel Rochev.

126
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:40,697
She looks angry
in every photo.

127
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,050
So where to?
Office?

128
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:47,087
Home. I want
to check in on Thea.

129
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:48,872
Uh, she's not
at your house, Oliver.

130
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:50,924
Where is she?

131
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:58,682
I only have a second.

132
00:07:58,684 --> 00:08:00,851
That's ok, my boss has been
all over my ass today.

133
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:02,987
You should hear what
she sounds like when--

134
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:04,938
Ow!

135
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,558
You have got to be kidding me!

136
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,661
Come on! I don't
want to fight.

137
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,106
Clearly you do,

138
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,882
since you keep on taking
every street corner drug dealer

139
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:15,499
that you can get your fists on.

140
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,451
It's not like that.
The Glades are worse than ever.

141
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,536
I know, but you already
saved a busload of people

142
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:21,789
and managed not to get
buried alive.

143
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,875
I mean, how much more
of a hero do you need to be?

144
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,711
It's like you have
a death wish.

145
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:30,547
And guess what--
it's going to come true.

146
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:32,599
Yeah, well, someone
has to do something.

147
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:35,102
And stand up for what's
right, like he did.

148
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:37,271
The Vigilante.

149
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:40,024
Who hasn't been seen
since the earthquake,

150
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:42,693
which means he did get
buried alive and isn't coming back.

151
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:44,862
I'm back.

152
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:47,431
Ollie!

153
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,901
Ah, you remember
my friend Roy.

154
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:53,954
Still here?
Always.

155
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:56,123
So how was Europe?

156
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,542
You never texted,
no postcards.

157
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,627
Almost like you're
on the island all over again.

158
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:02,579
Yeah, sorry,
I was kind of distracted.

159
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:03,997
With snow skiing,
waterskiing.

160
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,666
A lot of skiing.

161
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:08,118
I hear rumors that my club
is under new management.

162
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,803
Ah, actually,
it's my club now,

163
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:11,472
and you're not
getting it back.

164
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:12,923
You're not old enough to drink.

165
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:15,008
But I am old enough
to run a bar.

166
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,311
Have you made it
to Iron Heights?

167
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:20,464
To visit the woman
who dropped a city

168
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:24,017
on 500 innocent people?
No, thank you.

169
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,237
Thea...That's not what mom did.

170
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,323
Right.

171
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,641
She had no choice.

172
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:34,445
But guess what?
She did.

173
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:37,164
A choice not to be
a mass murderer.

174
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,333
And I have
a choice, too.

175
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:41,535
So I choose not
to be her daughter.

176
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:44,088
But I am so happy
you are home.

177
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,673
Honestly, I need to deal
with our liquor distributor

178
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:48,876
who shorted me
on yesterday's delivery,

179
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:52,996
and one of my bartenders
called in sick, so...

180
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:54,431
What?

181
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:56,333
Nothing. It's--

182
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:58,435
it's nice to see you
like this.

183
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:00,254
Like what?

184
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:02,806
Together.

185
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,775
The representative
from Central City

186
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:07,561
says construction on the
Star Labs particle accelerator

187
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:10,347
should be completed
by Christmas.

188
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,533
And in local news,
billionaire Oliver Queen

189
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:15,319
has returned once again
to Starling City.

190
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:16,853
With his mother's upcoming

191
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:19,106
trial and his father's
company in freefall,

192
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,016
analysts are asking what

193
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,626
the Queen family scion
has planned next.

194
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:28,882
Wasn't our country  founded
on a brand of vigilantism, Mr. Donner?

195
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:30,584
The revolutionaries
in the Boston Tea Party

196
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:33,203
were certainly choosing
justice over law.

197
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:36,223
I'd hardly compare our founding fathers
to the Hood, Mr. Mayor,

198
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:39,092
or these twisted copycats
who have risen in his wake.

199
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:41,178
Ms. Lance.

200
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,981
What do you think
about vigilantes?

201
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:46,266
I'd be foolish to disagree
with my new boss.

202
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:48,152
I knew I was smart
to hire you.

203
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:50,938
I'd heard you joined
the district attorney's office.

204
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,406
It was time for a change.

205
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:54,224
Still, I'm sorry that
you and your colleagues

206
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:56,777
at CNRI won't be opening
your doors again.

207
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,579
There were no doors left
to be reopened.

208
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:01,565
They're playing
my song.

209
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:09,039
Good evening.

210
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,209
It has been a very difficult
year for Starling City.

211
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:15,012
Our losses have been
incalculable,

212
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:17,297
our grief unimaginable.

213
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:21,051
But with the generous donations
you people are making tonight,

214
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:23,470
we will come back
from this tragedy.

215
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:26,940
You have failed
this city, Mr. Mayor!

216
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:29,443
The Glades descended
into hell on your watch!

217
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:33,146
You swore to protect
all the citizens of Starling,

218
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:34,598
not just the wealthy!

219
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,149
We're sorry
about this, folks.

220
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:38,318
We'll have this sorted
out in just a minute.

221
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:09,566
We are the Hoods.

222
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:11,351
And what was taken from us,

223
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:14,521
we will take back.

224
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,058
Laurel!

225
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,593
Dad, I'm fine.

226
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:32,794
You've got one
very brave daughter there, sir.

227
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,231
Yeah, one daughter's right,
and I can't stand to lose another.

228
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,798
Well, I still can't believe
this happened.

229
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,350
The hoods attacks
have strictly been limited

230
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:39,968
to people
in the financial sector

231
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,571
trying to redistribute
wealth in the Glades at gunpoint.

232
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:44,440
Yeah, well, clearly
that's not getting the result

233
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:46,108
they're looking for,
is it?

234
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,443
Did you get a good look
at any of them?

235
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:48,777
It was hard to focus
on anything other

236
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,529
than the gun barrel
pointed at my face.

237
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,264
No tattoos,
distinguishing marks?

238
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,982
What do you think
you're doing?

239
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:56,402
Interviewing the witness
is the job of the Detective.

240
00:12:56,404 --> 00:12:58,153
Officer Lance.

241
00:12:58,155 --> 00:13:00,623
This is my daughter.
She was nearly killed tonight.

242
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,424
Well, as a parent,
you're welcome to stay.

243
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:04,826
But as a beat cop,
you're more than free to go.

244
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:09,131
You know, that's one
of the downsides of being demoted--

245
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:12,017
I don't get to witness
his sunny disposition on a daily basis.

246
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:14,336
Dad, give me a sec.

247
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:16,021
Yeah.

248
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:20,359
I didn't know
you were back in town.

249
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,827
I just got back
a little while ago,

250
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:24,396
and I was going to call,
but then I...

251
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,198
Saw you on TV,
so I thought

252
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,350
that I would come
and make sure you were safe.

253
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:31,203
Just four hooded gunmen.

254
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:34,523
Nothing a few self-defense
classes couldn't handle.

255
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:37,042
Take a walk?
Yeah.

256
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:41,046
Sorry I left.

257
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:44,750
Believe me, I get it.

258
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:47,253
After the funeral,
I think we both needed time

259
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:49,221
to figure things out.

260
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:50,589
On our own.

261
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:52,558
I didn't get
very far on my own.

262
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,643
Did you?

263
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:57,313
Figure anything out?

264
00:13:57,315 --> 00:14:00,766
That I made a mistake...

265
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:02,901
when I slept with you.

266
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:05,721
I know it wasn't
exactly cheating,

267
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:07,957
because Tommy
had broken up with me,

268
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:10,009
but he only did that
because he thought

269
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:13,362
that you and I...
should be together.

270
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:17,316
All I know is that I feel
like I betrayed him.

271
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:22,237
And now he's gone.

272
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,325
And there's nothing I can do
to make it right.

273
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:30,112
I know how that feels.

274
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:33,015
When I brought your sister on
"the Queen's Gambit,"

275
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:35,134
I betrayed you

276
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:38,637
and your father.

277
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:41,657
There's no forgiveness

278
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:45,144
for what I led
Sara into.

279
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,598
I would give
anything to...

280
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:54,870
To go back.

281
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:57,790
Yeah.

282
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,942
But we can't go back.

283
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,973
Diggle!

284
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:17,009
I don't like
being played.

285
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:18,293
I'm not sure
what you mean.

286
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:19,645
That's why you came
to the island

287
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:21,296
and brought me back
to Starling City--

288
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:22,898
these hood copycats.

289
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,516
Well, what if it was?

290
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:26,151
They're just doing
what you did last year,

291
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:27,936
terrorizing one-percenters
into cleaning up their act.

292
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:30,656
Except they don't have
your restraint, Oliver.

293
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:32,658
Or your honor.

294
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,693
I'm done being
the Vigilante.

295
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:36,495
Maybe this town
still needs a vigilante.

296
00:15:36,497 --> 00:15:39,865
Now there's four of them.
How's that working?

297
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:43,819
Please take me home.

298
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:46,171
Got a big day at
the office tomorrow

299
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:49,157
trying to save
my family's company.

300
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,159
Absolutely.

301
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,662
Mr. Queen.

302
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:00,335
And in local news,

303
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:01,939
billionaire Oliver Queen

304
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:04,251
has returned once again
to Starling City.

305
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:06,475
Unbelievable.

306
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:09,528
We off the mayor
on live TV,

307
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,613
and what's the local
news keep showing?

308
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:15,150
Oliver Queen. Why?

309
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:16,869
Guess he's taking over
the family business.

310
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:19,204
We've been going
about this wrong.

311
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,874
What do you mean?
If we want real payback,

312
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:25,377
we got to take the fight
to the name that did this to us.

313
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,695
Queen?

314
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:27,763
Yeah.

315
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:30,499
He's some useless brat.

316
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:34,970
The applied sciences
division of Queen Consolidated

317
00:16:34,972 --> 00:16:37,306
built the earthquake generator.

318
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:40,709
If we want real justice...

319
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:43,073
Then that family has

320
00:16:43,098 --> 00:16:45,227
to pay for the suffering
it's caused us.

321
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:49,268
In full.

322
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,070
Hello, earth to Queen.

323
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:54,106
What, did you drop a Vertigo
when I wasn't looking?

324
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:56,358
I was
just distracted.

325
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,528
About what your brother said,
about your mom?

326
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,914
Eavesdrop much?
Ah, what I lack in height,

327
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,665
I make up
for in wicked good hearing.

328
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,534
Well,

329
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:07,753
don't keep me
in suspense, Harper.

330
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:09,254
What's your take on the matter?

331
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:11,924
Though, keep in mind,
I do control your paycheck

332
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:13,258
and your sex life.

333
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,010
Well,

334
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:18,263
both my parents weren't worth
a damn, either of them.

335
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,748
You never talk about them.

336
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,917
You got nothing nice
to say, right?

337
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,719
Still, I--

338
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:28,190
I'd be glad to see
them and talk to them if I could.

339
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:29,775
But...

340
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:32,260
Look, you already
lost your dad.

341
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:34,046
Your mom,
she's still here,

342
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:36,165
and I'm sure she'd
love to see you.

343
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,951
I'm sure she's dying to.

344
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:41,737
Just like a lot of mothers
in the Glades

345
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:45,240
who won't ever get to see
their kids again...

346
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:48,160
Because my mother
helped kill them.

347
00:17:48,162 --> 00:17:51,580
I'm not going to that prison.

348
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:56,251
It's the only way
I know how to hurt her.

349
00:17:56,253 --> 00:18:00,005
You might want to consider
how much it's hurting you.

350
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:11,633
They're in the conference
room. Just fyi,

351
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:13,969
no one is eating the bagels.

352
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:18,323
Isabel Rochev.
Oliver Queen.

353
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,025
Sorry I'm late.
For this meeting

354
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:21,443
or a career in business?

355
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:22,861
I didn't realize
hostile takeovers

356
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:24,663
were filled with
so much hostility.

357
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:26,365
Not at all. I'm actually
in quite a good mood.

358
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,316
Really?
So destroying companies

359
00:18:28,318 --> 00:18:30,002
agrees with you?
Winning agrees with me.

360
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:32,320
You haven't won yet.

361
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:35,624
Since you majored
in dropping out of college,

362
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:37,960
let me put this in terms
that are easy for you to understand.

363
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:40,462
You control 45%
of Queen Consolidated stock.

364
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:43,382
I control 45%,
leaving 10% outstanding.

365
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:46,485
But, in two days the board
will release the final 10%.

366
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:48,770
And I'll buy it
before you do.

367
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:50,556
With what money?

368
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:52,674
I doubt your trust fund
is that large,

369
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:54,843
and no angel investor
will go near the company

370
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:56,862
that build the machine
that destroyed half the city.

371
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:59,865
Companies rise and fall,
Mr. Queen.

372
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:02,417
Your company has fallen.

373
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,295
Oliver Queen!

374
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:16,048
You failed this city.

375
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:26,925
Pull back!

376
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:30,762
Oliver, go!
Go, go, go, go!

377
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:33,432
Careful. Go, go.

378
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,141
Quick! They're getting away.

379
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,511
Go! Move!

380
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,809
Ms. Rochev,
I'm sorry about this.

381
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:15,578
'Cause they were
after you?

382
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,997
Because what happens
in this building is my responsibility.

383
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,666
Only for the next
48 hours.

384
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:26,005
I still can't get used to you
in that uniform, Detective Lance.

385
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,957
It's "Officer" now.

386
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,042
And I'm just glad
it still fits.

387
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,043
They hurt you?

388
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:33,179
I'm ok.

389
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:37,666
You, uh, heard anything from
our mutual friend lately?

390
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:39,635
Nope.

391
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:44,724
In fact...I keep
waiting for him to show up.

392
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:46,359
You could have
stopped those guys.

393
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:48,177
Not without
giving Isabel Rochev

394
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,746
and the hoods a pretty good
idea of what I'm capable of.

395
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:52,231
I think what
Felicity's wondering

396
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,016
is whether you avoided
taking those hoods on.

397
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,701
And, Oliver, she's not
the only one wondering.

398
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:58,004
I told you, I did not come back
to Starling City

399
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,589
to be the Vigilante.

400
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,073
But they came
after you, Oliver.

401
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:02,208
You could have
taken them out.

402
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,243
No, I couldn't,
Diggle.

403
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:06,362
Look, there's a part
of being the Hood

404
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:10,750
that neither
one of you are considering.

405
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:12,385
The body count.

406
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:15,388
And excuse me
for saying this,

407
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,307
but so what?
Since when do you care?

408
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,896
Since Tommy.

409
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:30,403
After he found out my secret,
you know what Tommy called me?

410
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:32,655
A murderer.

411
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:34,723
He was right.

412
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:37,493
My best friend
died thinking

413
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:39,912
that I was a murderer,

414
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:41,914
and anyone that I kill

415
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,617
dishonors his memory.

416
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,287
So don't.

417
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,457
It's not like you've killed
every guy you've faced.

418
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:53,376
I could have.

419
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,011
Because when I
put on the hood,

420
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,846
it's kill or be killed.

421
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:00,466
That is what
kept me alive.

422
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:03,803
That's why I should have
stayed on the island.

423
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,638
Is that where
you're going now?

424
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,107
The two of you won't help me
save my family's company,

425
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,593
I'm going to talk
to somebody who will.

426
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:16,115
Well, someone's
definitely out there.

427
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:18,451
They're moving closer.

428
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:22,438
Where do you think
you're going?

429
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,740
Flanking position.
They get the drop on you,

430
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:26,942
you'll want some back-up.

431
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:31,447
She's teaching you
Chinese. How sweet.

432
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:33,299
I'm sure she'd be happy
to teach you, too--

433
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:35,968
Shado!

434
00:23:00,143 --> 00:23:01,477
Hey.

435
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,828
Hey.

436
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,282
I'm sorry I didn't
make it here sooner.

437
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,619
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, Oliver.

438
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,654
There are going to
be enough apologies

439
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,357
with me apologizing
to you for the rest of my life.

440
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,876
You don't have to.

441
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:20,112
You saved hundreds of lives.

442
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:22,181
And killed
hundreds more.

443
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:26,435
Including Tommy.

444
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:27,720
That was Malcolm.

445
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:32,141
Your sister doesn't
see it that way.

446
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:34,677
And, you know,
my attorney is thrilled.

447
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,346
If my own daughter
can't forgive me,

448
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:39,899
she's not too
optimistic about

449
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:42,368
12 strangers
in a jury box.

450
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,355
All right,
enough of that.

451
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:49,625
How has it been going
at Queen Consolidated?

452
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:54,981
Yes, we do get the news
in here, Oliver.

453
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:56,048
Right.
You know,

454
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,483
if I'd known the key

455
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:59,051
to you taking
your rightful place

456
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:00,519
at the company
was its demise,

457
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:04,039
I would have declared
bankruptcy a year ago.

458
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,093
I don't know if I'll get
to run it for long.

459
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,395
Stellmoor.

460
00:24:09,397 --> 00:24:12,181
Their VP
is coming after us hard.

461
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:15,217
Isabel Rochev.
Yes.

462
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:19,689
Do not trust that woman, Oliver.
She is dangerous.

463
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:23,609
Well, mom, everywhere
I look, there are no good options.

464
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:27,763
I don't know what to do.

465
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:31,233
You don't have
to do it yourself.

466
00:24:31,235 --> 00:24:33,736
This is a family
business.

467
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,254
I love Thea.

468
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,223
I don't think that she wants
anything to do with it.

469
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:40,626
I wasn't talking
about Thea.

470
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:53,973
Table seven
needs bottle service,

471
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:56,142
and I need a round
of Martinis on the three top.

472
00:24:56,144 --> 00:24:57,777
You go see
your mom yet?

473
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,428
I thought
about what you said.

474
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,613
And?

475
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:02,531
And...I'll go see her

476
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:05,434
when you stop going out at night
looking to clean up the streets.

477
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,403
What does one thing have
to do with the other?

478
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,773
I guess they're both things
that are never going to happen.

479
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:26,288
We're looking
for Oliver Queen!

480
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:30,893
He's back in town.
He owns this dump.

481
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:33,295
Where can we find him?

482
00:25:33,297 --> 00:25:38,017
Ok, then plan "B,"
I'm going to start shooting people

483
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,803
until Mr. Queen...

484
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,305
Grows a pair.

485
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:45,641
Roy!

486
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:56,485
Aaah!

487
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:58,921
Aah!

488
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,851
Drop off, hero.

489
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:15,039
I'm just as happy to kill this
Queen as her brother. Let's go!

490
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:23,714
One of the guys
was missing a hand.

491
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:24,916
What's going on here?

492
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,217
Mostly, anyway.
He still had sutures.

493
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,885
Excuse me. It was
the hoods, again.

494
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,555
They came here looking for you,
they took Thea instead.

495
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:33,341
Where?
I'm sorry.

496
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:36,060
I really tried
to stop them, but I--

497
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,079
Queen.

498
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:40,097
Queen!

499
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,351
We'll get your sister back.

500
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,604
I was going to check
something downstairs.

501
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,995
I've made a few
improvements down here.

502
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,063
Just in case, you know...

503
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:58,416
You decided to come back.

504
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,468
We need to find these guys.

505
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,587
I've been trying,
ever since you got back.

506
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:22,340
I figured you'd come
around eventually.

507
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:25,476
I kept that.

508
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,595
I liked
watching you do that.

509
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:31,032
Thea's boyfriend said one of
them was missing part of his hand.

510
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:33,467
Maybe a veteran?

511
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:36,137
Check hospital records,
any males that have had

512
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:38,122
surgical amputations
on their extremities.

513
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,791
Cross-checking
by race and age.

514
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:44,295
Got one--Jeff Deveau.
Caucasian, late thirties.

515
00:27:44,297 --> 00:27:46,447
What else can
you get on him?

516
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:47,665
Ex-Marine.

517
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,500
Would explain how he can
handle himself.

518
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,002
Did he lose
his hand overseas?

519
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,221
No. In the earthquake.

520
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:54,392
Says here he and his wife

521
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:56,457
were trying to make it
across the 52nd Street bridge

522
00:27:57,393 --> 00:28:00,127
when it collapsed.

523
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:01,962
She didn't make it.

524
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:05,983
Phone records, please.
I want to know he's in contact with.

525
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,638
He's made a lot of calls
to a church in the Glades.

526
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Something called
Standing Strong.

527
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:15,159
It's a support group for those
who lost loved ones in the quake.

528
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,528
Great place to meet
three other guys as angry as you,

529
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,979
looking
for a little payback.

530
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:22,199
Get me an address,
please.

531
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:26,087
You're going to need this.

532
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,507
I had it custom made.

533
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:36,497
How'd I do?

534
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,687
It's perfect.

535
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,525
You were right.

536
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,677
Once I signed on,
I stopped thinking

537
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,179
about all the bodies
you dropped.

538
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:54,532
Because I knew
that being the Hood

539
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:59,036
meant occasionally
being a killer.

540
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,856
Maybe there's
another way.

541
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:06,077
They have my sister.

542
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,381
What other way is there?

543
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,095
What are you doing?
We need to save her.

544
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,930
Listen, kid.

545
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:29,550
You are not the only one
who cares for her.

546
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:32,403
But there's a lot of them.
Wait for my signal.

547
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:37,241
Where
are the graves?

548
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:40,244
Where are the graves?

549
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:42,396
I don't know
what you're talking about.

550
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,417
Uhh! Uhh!

551
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,338
Tell me.

552
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,463
Oliver, no!

553
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,749
Oliver!

554
00:30:17,768 --> 00:30:19,101
So...

555
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:20,737
What do you want
to do with her?

556
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:22,772
We could knock her out,
drop her off somewhere.

557
00:30:22,774 --> 00:30:24,440
Come on. Why don't you
just buy her

558
00:30:24,442 --> 00:30:26,042
a new pair of Pradas
while you're at it?

559
00:30:26,044 --> 00:30:27,493
She's seen our faces.

560
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:29,612
Look, offing Oliver Queen's
one thing, but his sister?

561
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:32,131
She's not much older
than my sister was

562
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,949
when she was killed
in the earthquake.

563
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:36,302
Your sister wasn't killed,
she was murdered.

564
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:38,971
By her mother.

565
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:42,792
What we're doing here is justice,
which makes us the heroes.

566
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:46,529
She didn't kill anybody.

567
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:48,648
My mother didn't kill anyone.

568
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,517
Malcolm Merlyn
destroyed the Glades.

569
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,219
With mommy's help.

570
00:30:53,221 --> 00:30:55,805
Merlyn killed my father.

571
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:58,925
She thought he'd kill
my brother, too.

572
00:31:00,244 --> 00:31:02,578
She was afraid of him.

573
00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:06,866
She must have been so afraid.

574
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:09,619
Just like my wife...

575
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:14,040
When our house
collapsed on top of her.

576
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:15,174
Ow!

577
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:16,992
Get away from her!

578
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:44,704
Let's go.
Please!

579
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:46,706
Move!

580
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:48,691
Go, move!
Please!

581
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,378
Let...

582
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,413
Her...

583
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:55,698
Go.

584
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,966
You want to save her?

585
00:31:56,968 --> 00:31:58,367
There was no justice

586
00:31:58,369 --> 00:31:59,719
for people
like the Queens

587
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:02,555
till you showed us
how to get it.

588
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:05,224
You showed us.

589
00:32:08,897 --> 00:32:10,813
Go!

590
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:18,404
You shoot me, we both die.

591
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:22,558
You'll drop me
anyway.

592
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,777
I know you.
You're a killer.

593
00:32:32,135 --> 00:32:36,589
Keep it under 40 next time.
Have a good evening.

594
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:47,082
Do you know who they are?

595
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:49,185
I think the hoods gives
me a pretty good idea.

596
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:51,387
Bring them in.

597
00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:54,056
Where you been?
Typically when I bring in guys

598
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:56,108
that you've gone after,
they're a little more dead.

599
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,144
I'm trying another way.

600
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,152
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

601
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:32,921
I didn't know
that you were here.

602
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:34,322
I was just...

603
00:33:34,324 --> 00:33:38,142
I come here a lot.

604
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:39,677
I can go.

605
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,629
No, it's...

606
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:43,765
You don't have to.
It's, uh...

607
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:46,467
Laurel, I understand.

608
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:50,171
After everything
that's happened, I...

609
00:33:50,173 --> 00:33:53,341
Understand why
we can't be together.

610
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:56,778
But I still need you
in my life.

611
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:03,401
We've been through too much
for it to be any other way.

612
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:13,161
I feel like
I betrayed him, too.

613
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:15,663
Before the Hood,
we didn't have things

614
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:18,049
like earthquake machines
or copycat vigilantes--

615
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:20,368
Laurel.

616
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,470
Malcolm killed Tommy.

617
00:34:22,472 --> 00:34:25,423
He was killed in the crossfire
between two archers.

618
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:29,377
And now that
Malcolm's dead,

619
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:31,396
there's only
one archer left.

620
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:34,732
And I'm going to help
my boss catch him.

621
00:34:45,227 --> 00:34:48,246
That outfit,
with your coloring--

622
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:52,083
isn't that cruel and unusual
punishment or something?

623
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:54,335
I've done my best
to avoid mirrors in here.

624
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:58,139
So, I--

625
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:00,708
How have you been?

626
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,930
Don't worry about me.
I want to hear about you.

627
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:07,966
How are you doing?

628
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:11,269
Are you still
seeing, uh--

629
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:14,422
Roy was his name,
wasn't it?

630
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:19,593
Sweetheart,
I'm fine, really.

631
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:23,081
It's not that.

632
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:26,117
I...

633
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:28,319
I almost died last night.

634
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:30,538
What?

635
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,956
Thea, what happened?

636
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,658
It doesn't matter.

637
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,428
But when I thought
it was over,

638
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,364
I kept thinking that if...

639
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:42,800
If I died,

640
00:35:42,802 --> 00:35:46,804
you would spend the rest
of your life thinking that...

641
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:49,290
I hated you.

642
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,012
And I want to hate you.

643
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:57,732
I really tried to.

644
00:35:57,734 --> 00:36:00,318
But I can't.

645
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,854
I can't, Mom.

646
00:36:06,692 --> 00:36:10,011
However long I am
in this place,

647
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:12,246
you have freed me.

648
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:19,871
If I hug you,
are they going to shoot us?

649
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:25,826
I'm willing
to risk it if you are.

650
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:35,970
Oh, shh, shh.

651
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:38,890
You can't win this.
I now own 50% of the stock.

652
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:40,608
By tomorrow, I'll have
the outstanding five percent

653
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,161
and I will control your company.

654
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:44,449
Any attempt to fight me

655
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:46,498
will lead to litigation
and leave you penniless.

656
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:49,567
And trust me, poverty
isn't as glamorous

657
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:51,852
as Charles Dickens
made it look.

658
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:54,688
What if I found someone
to invest new equity capital?

659
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,124
A White Night?

660
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:57,742
With all due respect,

661
00:36:57,744 --> 00:36:59,911
your last name is now
associated with mass murder.

662
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,080
Even you don't have
that good a friend.

663
00:37:02,082 --> 00:37:04,632
You're right.

664
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:07,802
I have family.

665
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:14,225
Mr. Steel. It was
my understanding

666
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:16,877
that you had
resigned as CEO.

667
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:19,764
I did. I'm now Chief
Financial Officer

668
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:21,382
of Starling National Bank.

669
00:37:21,384 --> 00:37:23,401
And my institution
has committed

670
00:37:23,403 --> 00:37:25,887
rescue financing
to Mr. Queen.

671
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:28,356
We bought up the remaining
shares of Queen Consolidated

672
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:30,408
when they were
released this morning.

673
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,160
Now I know I majored
in dropping out,

674
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,611
but I'm pretty sure that makes
us partners going forward.

675
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:35,079
So I guess...

676
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:38,416
We will be seeing
a lot of each other.

677
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:41,702
You aren't at all
what people say about you.

678
00:37:41,704 --> 00:37:45,239
Most people fail
to see the real me.

679
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:56,750
Thank you, Walter.

680
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:59,637
Thank you,
for reaching out to me.

681
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,305
Whatever's happened
between your mother and me,

682
00:38:01,307 --> 00:38:05,443
I'm gratified that you know
you can still count on me.

683
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:08,029
Your father would have
been very proud of you, Oliver.

684
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:16,370
Ms. Smoak.
Mr. Steel.

685
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:20,458
You did it.

686
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,777
Not bad for someone who got
a "D" in tenth grade Algebra.

687
00:38:25,113 --> 00:38:26,964
If it's online,
I can find it.

688
00:38:28,635 --> 00:38:30,718
Yeah.

689
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,788
Well, it was just
like a good friend once told me...

690
00:38:36,124 --> 00:38:38,792
I had to find another way.

691
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:54,808
We're not alone.

692
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:58,196
The question is,
where did they come from?

693
00:39:15,164 --> 00:39:16,681
Hey, what's up?

694
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:18,683
Just came back
from visiting my mom.

695
00:39:18,685 --> 00:39:21,001
Really?
Good for you.

696
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:22,770
So what do you say?

697
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:25,673
You ready to start spending
your nights safe with me?

698
00:39:25,675 --> 00:39:27,024
Absolutely.

699
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:32,196
Hey, I'm going to pick us up
some big belly burger right now.

700
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:35,449
I'll see you later.
Ok.

701
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:40,321
We just want
to be friendly.

702
00:39:40,323 --> 00:39:42,290
What, we scare you
or something?

703
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:45,025
Yeah.
I think you do.

704
00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:47,295
Me, though,
not so much.

705
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:48,746
Run.

706
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:17,992
Where the hell
did you come from?

707
00:40:28,737 --> 00:40:31,038
Well, it looks like
Starling is back down

708
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,873
to only one man
in a hood.

709
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:35,242
And the three of us
are back in the archery business?

710
00:40:35,244 --> 00:40:37,912
No.

711
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:42,600
I spent the past year
trying to avenge my father.

712
00:40:42,602 --> 00:40:45,419
If we're going to do...this,

713
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:48,973
it has to be about
honoring Tommy.

714
00:40:48,975 --> 00:40:52,777
I need to become the man
he hoped I could be.

715
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:56,430
You two have helped me
take the first step.

716
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:01,285
So what's step two?

717
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:04,605
I'm game for anything as long as
it doesn't involve skydiving.

718
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:08,326
And I'm pretty down
on landmines now, too.

719
00:41:08,328 --> 00:41:13,297
The city still
needs saving.

720
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:16,250
But not by the Hood.

721
00:41:16,252 --> 00:41:19,837
And not
by some vigilante

722
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,289
who's just crossing
names off a list.

723
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,475
It needs...

724
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:27,961
Something more.

725
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:29,814
It needs a hero, Oliver.

726
00:41:29,816 --> 00:41:32,016
It's too bad the hoods kind of
ruined your nickname.

727
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:35,019
No, it's good. I never...

728
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:37,988
I don't want to be called
the Hood anymore.

729
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,974
Ok.

730
00:41:43,028 --> 00:41:45,996
So what do you want
to be called?

731
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:51,021
