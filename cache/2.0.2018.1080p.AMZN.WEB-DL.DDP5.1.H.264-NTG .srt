1
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,340
'O birds, you are all over this world'

2
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,390
'You have spread your wings
right up to Heaven'

3
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,100
'Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds'

4
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,600
'Feathered creatures of our world!'

5
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,279
Any idea what to ask?

6
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,999
'Vanakkam'

7
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,439
We are from Excel Engineering college

8
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:48,839
Robotic research students

9
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,479
We've got an appointment
to meet Dr Vaseegaran

10
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:52,559
Please come in

11
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:55,638
Dude, soooper hyperbola!

12
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,957
Excuse me
You are-

13
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,238
I am Dr Vaseegaran's assistant

14
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:02,158
- Your name
- Nila

15
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:04,198
- Beauuuutiful!
- Thanks

16
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:06,317
Nila...moon!

17
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:07,437
What?

18
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,517
It's a lie to say
there's no gravity in the moon

19
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:12,076
- Why?
- You are such a magnetic force!

20
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,838
Your laughter can be my ringtone!

21
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:15,077
Can I have your number?

22
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:16,757
11423879

23
00:07:19,116 --> 00:07:21,197
Enough! The whole floor is slippery!

24
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:26,996
Hello, sir

25
00:07:27,116 --> 00:07:28,476
Please sit down

26
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:31,235
Doctor, we are mechatronic students

27
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:35,555
Professor Mithra told us you have
created a new humanoid robot

28
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:37,595
- Can we take a look at that?
- Sure

29
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,713
This is the new robot I have created

30
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:46,995
Project Nila

31
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:49,874
Nice, intelligent, lovely assistant

32
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:52,794
Humanoid X122018 model

33
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:54,313
Quantum Core Millenia

34
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:56,153
X125D Extreme processor

35
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:57,594
Unlimited Cloud memory

36
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:58,914
1 Tera hertz speed

37
00:07:58,955 --> 00:08:01,073
Built in simulated Amygdala

38
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:04,314
This is her MPU
Memory and Power Unit

39
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:05,752
Works like our heart

40
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:07,673
MPU!

41
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:08,872
Synthetic skin

42
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:10,232
Ultra realistic humanoid

43
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,273
You are such a magnetic force!

44
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,472
What about that phone #?

45
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:21,072
That's my IMEI #

46
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:24,711
- Is she also like Chitti, doctor?
- No

47
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:28,111
Created adhering to Asimov's laws
this is a domestic purpose robot

48
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:30,592
You can treat her as your friend,
secretary and caretaker

49
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:33,431
She will be of help to mankind
in all ways and always

50
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,711
Does it have feelings, doctor?

51
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,429
Yes, pre programmed,
customizable, controlled feelings

52
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,790
Is there any chance for Chitti
to resurface again, doctor?

53
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,069
All our present scientific inventions
in the beginning were opposed as dangerous

54
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,589
And labelled as null and void

55
00:08:58,709 --> 00:08:59,989
Bound by time

56
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:02,229
It became a necessity
in the ensuing years

57
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:04,428
Chitti will also be a pre requisite one day

58
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:05,588
Dot!

59
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,908
- Hey Nikita
- Go to hell!

60
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:11,868
Bulb! Serves you right!

61
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:13,748
Nikita, hear me out

62
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:16,748
I acted as if I was flirting with her
just to make you see red

63
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:19,107
- As if I didn't know she's a robot?
- 'Get lost, liar!'

64
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:21,068
My Barbie doll
My Snow White princess!

65
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:22,347
'Shut up and hang up!'

66
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:25,587
Believe me, I've booked
an Apple watch for your birthday

67
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:22,142
Sushma, Moksha has got
a new Collection today

68
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:24,262
You eat and then I'll come over, okay?

69
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:32,021
My flight was delayed
Inform the clients, I'll be there by-

70
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:38,861
When I get back from work
I chat with my family nonstop!

71
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:40,661
We spend quality time you know

72
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,141
You bloody swine!

73
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,701
Harith, can I have my phone?

74
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,141
Daddy has to make an important call

75
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:50,820
Give me the phone

76
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,740
Don't cry...here

77
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:02,020
I didn't do anything

78
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,459
What is the bid today
in our chit fund?

79
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,579
Can get Rs 3000

80
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,499
What is this?

81
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,699
Make 'rasam' and potato curry
for dinner, enough

82
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:23,498
Grandpa!

83
00:11:23,538 --> 00:11:26,537
'Residing in all of that as Me'

84
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:30,537
'So that Me through this Me'

85
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:31,777
'Talking to Me'

86
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:37,016
Dude, this must be
our principal's handiwork!

87
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,456
Where are you, dear?

88
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,176
Coming to the terrace?

89
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:50,055
What happened?

90
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:52,696
Our project manager and
prickly 'Jackfruit' Asha

91
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,335
...are hand and glove in this

92
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,455
That's why he promoted her
and sent her abroad on site

93
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:02,134
He went to get the bore-well man
No sign of him still

94
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:04,655
Tomorrow is Mahavir Jayanthi
All the shops will be closed

95
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:06,335
Buy our stuff tonight, okay?

96
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,375
This phone has 4G, Wifi, Bluetooth
plus dual Sim capacity

97
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,013
I'm in Ranganathan street,
jam packed with men all around

98
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,133
Danger
Girlfriend calling

99
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,812
- Hi Sana
- 'Hi scientist sir'

100
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,492
'Wonder of wonders
You picked my call?'

101
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,291
- Sorry, Sana
- 'How many calls?'

102
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,651
'Can't you even pick my call?
Are you that busy?'

103
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:52,292
'Just for your sake I'm 10,000 km away
and studying here like a lunatic'

104
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:55,811
'Under the pretext of working on
your project, are you flirting with Nila?'

105
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:57,091
That's a robot, Sana

106
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,411
'But a female doll, right?'

107
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,730
Don't be mad at me, honey

108
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,489
'I called you 112 times!'

109
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,251
I'll accept your punishment
and kiss you 112 times

110
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,450
'No need 112'

111
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,690
'Just 1 phone-kiss, let me see'

112
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,810
Mua-

113
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,009
Flying kiss?!

114
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,329
Sir, where should I complain
to retrieve my mobile?

115
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,888
All of them are waiting too!
Go and stand in the queue

116
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:25,289
How can a cell phone fly?
And where will it go?

117
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:27,568
Who is behind all this?
What is the reason?

118
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:30,488
'Is a whole gang behind this
or just an individual?'

119
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:31,608
'This is scary'

120
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:34,207
Is this a sign our world
will perish as people claim?

121
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,207
Like the ozone hole there is
a black hole in the sky it seems

122
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:38,888
It has sucked all the phones I believe

123
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:40,047
Yov! Shut up, man

124
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,967
You're talking as if it's a drainage hole

125
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:44,726
I'm in the share market
My job is dependent on cell phones

126
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:48,407
Life is absolutely boring
without WhatsApp and selfies

127
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:50,767
As soon as I wake up
I take my mobile to the loo

128
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,326
I feel I've lost my hand now!

129
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,927
My husband is working in Qatar

130
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,326
Our long distance romance
is only through cell phone

131
00:13:56,366 --> 00:14:00,045
I've saved my mom's # as 'Amma'
I don't even know her landline # now

132
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:04,526
I've stored my bank account #,
ATM pin #, password, the whole works

133
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:07,365
It has personal videos and photos
of my girlfriend and me

134
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:09,365
What if they are uploaded
on an adult site?

135
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:12,004
Excuse me, is there a separate section
for Android phones?

136
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:15,885
For sure! It has been opened
in Parthasarathy temple, go there

137
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:19,404
Sir, I'm very sentimental
about this cell phone

138
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,724
Do something, sir

139
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:22,204
How can I take this as a complaint?

140
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,244
- Get lost!
- Sir, please

141
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:25,484
I had hooked my wedding chain
on my mobile, sir

142
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,804
I lost that too

143
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,363
10 sovereign
Pure gold, sir

144
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:31,043
No wife to nag, no phone bills
to pay, why don't you relax?

145
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,803
God will be appeased if you do
a redemption ritual in Thirunallar, sir

146
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:36,324
You and your silly superstitions!

147
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:38,284
Commissioner sir asked me to meet you

148
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:39,603
I'll take care, sir

149
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,042
Thank you

150
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,603
Telecom minister is on the line

151
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:46,202
Sir, even our chief minister
has lost his mobile

152
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:47,923
He is on another line

153
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:50,722
Your secretary is right here
I'll handle it, sir

154
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,683
Sir, minister's phone-

155
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:56,362
I've embedded precious stones all over

156
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:57,641
0.25 karat, sir

157
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,041
526 stones, sir

158
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:01,081
Cost 20 million, sir

159
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:02,881
Somehow retrieve it for us, sir

160
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:03,921
Okay

161
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,521
He's chief technical officer of BSNL

162
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,721
Ramasubramaniam

163
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:09,562
I heard you're tracking with Sim card

164
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:12,520
- What happened, sir?
- It isn't our Govt network alone

165
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,280
All the other networks too
are unable to track even 1 phone, sir

166
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,680
All the cell phones
have been switched off

167
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,840
Every single phone in the city is missing

168
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,920
How can all of them
be switched off?

169
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,399
How is this possible, sir?

170
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:28,040
'Vanakkam
Headlines'

171
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,839
'Cell phones vanish into thin air
People in panic mode'

172
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,239
'Police department puzzled'

173
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,078
'Chief secretary calls
a special panel to discuss'

174
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:38,958
'So, doc, I think
you know the situation'

175
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,519
What is this?

176
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:41,878
What is this phenomenon?

177
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:43,318
This is strange

178
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:46,757
I've checked all the NASA studies
and Interpol records

179
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,557
No one has recorded such an event
anywhere in the world

180
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:54,158
There is no scientific explanation
so far for this rare occurrence

181
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:56,717
It is so obvious

182
00:15:57,437 --> 00:15:58,957
This is a terrorist attack

183
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:00,957
They are planning something large-scale

184
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:02,797
If we can't come up with a reason

185
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:06,795
...it's our habit to blame
either God or terrorists, right?

186
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:10,397
Can it be the handiwork of aliens
from a different planet maybe?

187
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,436
No, sir

188
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,036
According to ISRO reports

189
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:16,916
...no new movements or alien activities
have been recorded in space

190
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:21,355
Can it be a conspiracy by some
international company in the same field?

191
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,395
I mean, wipe out the present
telephone technology

192
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:26,395
And bring in a new
scientific know-how

193
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:27,794
This is a public display

194
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:31,874
In just 2 days, all the mobiles in the city
flying in mid air like sparrows

195
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:34,753
There isn't any technology
like this as far as I know

196
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:40,352
May be someone we know here
who botched up a lousy robot earlier

197
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:43,473
Some crank scientist

198
00:16:43,513 --> 00:16:47,633
...is messing up with some other invention
in the name of novelty, who knows!

199
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:50,793
Who is this?

200
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:53,392
Late Mr Bohra
AIRD director

201
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,513
His son
Dhinendra Bohra

202
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:58,913
Scientist, he's also in AIRD
as senior director

203
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:04,712
On the day all the cell phones went missing

204
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:07,151
...data from INSAT 3D weather satellite

205
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:10,071
And GSAT 16 communication satellite

206
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:11,751
This is the visualization

207
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,030
All these dots are cell phones

208
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,911
After a certain distance
the dots vanish into thin air

209
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,429
Cell phones haven't crossed
the troposphere

210
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,630
That is, not crossed
10 km above sea level

211
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,830
If you take the distance into account

212
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,630
...not crossed a radius
of 200 km beyond Chennai

213
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:39,150
They are all missing
within this sphere somewhere

214
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:40,709
We are aware of only 4 forces

215
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:44,229
Gravity, electromagnetic,
strong nuclear, weak nuclear

216
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,189
These 4 won't attract mobile force

217
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:49,989
I believe this can be
explained scientifically

218
00:17:50,348 --> 00:17:51,428
Dot!

219
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:55,708
I believe all the phones in this shop
broke the glass panes and flew out

220
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:57,748
Where is the lorry
with the consignment?

221
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,788
- 'Crossed Nagari'
- Doomed!

222
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:01,947
Not yet crossed Andhra border?

223
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:04,746
We've advertised
tomorrow's sale

224
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:07,027
No one has a cell phone in the city

225
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:11,146
They will make a beeline to our shop
like devotees in the temple at Tirupati

226
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,827
'Don't worry, it will be
delivered at 4:00 a.m'

227
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,947
You've been saying this
like a broken record!

228
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:46,144
"I am a modern girl with wanderlust"

229
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:48,744
Bro, what is that deafening sound?

230
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:51,664
Songs nowadays are only like this!

231
00:18:57,424 --> 00:18:58,384
Bro...?!

232
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:12,823
Someone is digging
with a crowbar in our van

233
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:15,222
We have only cartons
with cell phones in there

234
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,781
Call me, as soon as
the truck reaches here

235
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,460
Have you asked
for police protection?

236
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:36,780
Paid them, the cops will
be here by 5:00 a.m

237
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:40,979
What if all the cell phones we get
for our sale tomorrow fly away?

238
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,420
It means we are jinxed
beyond redemption

239
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,340
Not only for us
For the entire city

240
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:08,054
Lord Muruga
Fountain of knowledge

241
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,093
Bless everyone with Your grace

242
00:21:22,253 --> 00:21:23,811
Wha...what is that noise?

243
00:21:23,852 --> 00:21:25,772
'The truck has arrived, sir'

244
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:28,892
Who is that?

245
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:30,132
'Arumugam, sir'

246
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:33,171
'You asked me to call you
as soon as the truck arrives, right?'

247
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:35,531
- Where?
- 'To your house of course'

248
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:56,285
Please cooperate

249
00:22:56,326 --> 00:22:57,485
Go back

250
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:03,005
- Commissioner Rajendran asked me to come
- Please come in

251
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,324
There is no evidence of human presence
in Jayanth Kumar's murder

252
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:08,684
As the deceased is a cell phone merchant

253
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:11,124
...he wanted you to check for clues

254
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,444
His family members were on a pilgrimage

255
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:14,565
He was all alone

256
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:16,645
The servants are not aware of anything

257
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,723
No fingerprint or footprint

258
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:21,563
He died exploding
to minuuute pieces

259
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:24,284
But there is no evidence
of explosives whatsoever

260
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:38,522
He had advertised in the papers
about his Mobile Sale in his shop

261
00:23:38,722 --> 00:23:41,121
The truck carrying the load
met with an accident

262
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:43,242
The entire load went missing

263
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,402
Nothing makes sense, sir

264
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:49,481
Someone or something doesn't like
the presence of cell phones here

265
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:57,961
This is silicon, enamel and
polycarbonate dust of 1000s of mobiles

266
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,520
Different brands
manufactured on different dates

267
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:07,560
Will you believe me if I say
Jayanth Kumar was killed by cell phones?

268
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,319
A cell phone is an assassin?

269
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,399
What do you mean, sir?

270
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,160
All the missing cell phones
have landed here

271
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,039
How did these phones come here?

272
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,959
Where did they go?
We should find out

273
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,039
Dot!

274
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:49,459
'Hello scientist, what a surprise!
You've called of your own accord'

275
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:53,221
Sana, I think you would've heard of
all the cell phones disappearing here

276
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:56,982
To trace them, I've fixed a tracker
in my old phone and I've activated it

277
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:59,182
'Oh! So am I the guinea pig?'

278
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,863
Not like that, Sana, my phone flew away
before I could send my kisses!

279
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:04,943
That's why, I thought
I could specially-

280
00:25:05,623 --> 00:25:06,663
'After 3 days, huh?'

281
00:25:06,703 --> 00:25:09,944
'What happened to your landline?
Why didn't you call from that #?'

282
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:11,584
Phone was engaged, Sana

283
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:12,746
'Don't pull a fast one'

284
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:14,465
'Accept you don't remember my # '

285
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:16,105
'Out of sight, out of mind!'

286
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,667
'Now your whole world is Nila'

287
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:18,826
She's just like a laptop

288
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:21,826
'You bet she's on your lap
and you're coddling her 24x7!'

289
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,787
- 'A duet on top of all this!'
- Shut up!

290
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:26,068
'If I speak the truth,
should I shut up?'

291
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,268
Stop nagging me

292
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:28,948
This phone may also fly away!

293
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:30,548
Mu-

294
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:32,429
Gone with the wind!

295
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:34,389
Hey! You're watching too much TV!

296
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:11,637
Nila, activate EMR

297
00:26:12,078 --> 00:26:13,519
Activating EMR

298
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:20,520
What is happening?
Are they looking for a bomb?

299
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,321
- You search that side
- Okay, boss

300
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:26,719
Thanks, Nila

301
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:28,400
Why thank a laptop?!

302
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:47,403
They are discussing about
your issue inside, wait

303
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:49,043
Sir, Onicel owner Manoj Lulla is coming

304
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:50,565
He's such a pain!

305
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,685
Good morning

306
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,206
- Is he in?
- Yes, ji, go in, ji

307
00:29:55,846 --> 00:29:57,286
2G...!

308
00:29:57,527 --> 00:29:58,846
Talk to you later

309
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:01,047
- Please sit down
- I don't need any pacifying

310
00:30:01,088 --> 00:30:03,607
What are you up to?
Does a Govt exist or not?

311
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,007
Look, Mr Lulla

312
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:06,809
Govt and God are one and the same

313
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:09,368
If you believe, they exist
If not, they don't

314
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:11,969
But you ensure your palms
are greased promptly, eh?

315
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,970
Without exception it has snatched
all my cell phone towers

316
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,171
Destroyed all the microwave emitters

317
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,811
Not just yours, sir

318
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,972
Microwave emitters of all other
networks have been destroyed too

319
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:25,932
Uprooted the vendors' towers
they had rented as well

320
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:28,613
Everyone is in a state of shock
You saw them, right?

321
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:29,693
What should I see?

322
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:31,374
My loss runs in millions

323
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:34,053
If this continues, in 3 months
I'll be in the streets

324
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:36,014
We are watching
from all angles

325
00:30:36,215 --> 00:30:37,895
Not enough if you just watch

326
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,535
We've paid through our nose for you
and your party during the election

327
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:45,616
You should be standing out in the open
with your arms stretched like a tower

328
00:30:45,736 --> 00:30:47,137
Don't get tense

329
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,098
This isn't your problem alone

330
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:51,457
It concerns our national security

331
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:54,618
Everybody is perplexed
and in a state of panic

332
00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:57,580
Yesterday in our cabinet meeting
we've requested military aid

333
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,379
Even if you need a battalion
to guard each tower, we'll do it

334
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,820
Don't worry

335
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,700
Don't think you can appease me
like how you tackle the general public

336
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:07,541
I give you 1 week grace time

337
00:31:07,902 --> 00:31:09,822
By then things should
go back to normalcy

338
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:11,583
I must start my business again

339
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:15,063
Otherwise the next upload in Wiki Leaks...

340
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:16,342
...will be yours!

341
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:24,905
5th force

342
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:27,945
The scientific world is still into
extensive research about this force

343
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,346
The way it works
How to measure it

344
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:31,746
Our knowledge is zilch

345
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:35,346
This could be the 1st evidence
for the existence of the 5th force

346
00:31:35,588 --> 00:31:39,029
We can't explain this force based
on our knowledge of science

347
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,388
Using the amenities at our disposal

348
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:43,109
...we can't combat it either

349
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:45,629
That's why we've requested
our military to step in

350
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:47,590
Sir, it's a huge force

351
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,950
I saw it with my own eyes

352
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,950
If you ask the military
to combat it

353
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,831
...you will only face
enormous loss of life

354
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,511
What should we do then?

355
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:58,032
To combat it effectively
we need a super power

356
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:01,233
We need exceptional intelligence

357
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:05,393
We need a man with
the boon of immortality

358
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:06,914
A man who will never die?

359
00:32:07,835 --> 00:32:09,475
Does a person like that exist?

360
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,515
Chitti

361
00:32:11,636 --> 00:32:12,715
The Robot!

362
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,157
We must reactivate him

363
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:21,157
Dot...!

364
00:32:22,477 --> 00:32:23,878
I'm waiting

365
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:25,919
No...impossible

366
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,639
It's against law, sir

367
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:30,600
Our court has banned that robot

368
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,200
Has been dismantled too

369
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:35,360
It went out of control
and killed many lives

370
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:37,321
Immense loss of property as well

371
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,781
You are all well aware

372
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:40,402
...if we bring it back

373
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:41,881
...it won't die

374
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:44,282
It will massacre all of us

375
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:49,483
Everyone is aware who was responsible
for that robot's drastic change

376
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:53,084
This time I'll ensure
such a blunder does not occur

377
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:56,125
Sir, this is Mr Vaseegaran's conspiracy

378
00:32:56,805 --> 00:33:00,646
He wants to use this critical situation
and reactivate his invention

379
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,366
He wants to make money by
selling it to multinational companies

380
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:04,726
Now you decide

381
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:07,407
Have we assembled here
to save the people?

382
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,289
Or for Vaseegaran's advertising?

383
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:11,968
Okay, so you come up with a solution

384
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:15,528
Let's...think about it

385
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,009
That's why we are here

386
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:22,731
Sir, my suggestion is based
purely on good intentions

387
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,410
This is the start
of an apocalypse

388
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:28,851
If we don't prevent it now, we'll be
wiped out en masse, only Chitti can save us

389
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,491
Mr Vaseegaran

390
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:33,452
We can't flout a court order blatantly

391
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:36,734
The process required
to do so is very tedious

392
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:39,055
I must pass an ordinance
in the Parliament

393
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:42,575
Opposition parties should cooperate

394
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,616
- Not possible
- It is possible, sir

395
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:47,496
A minister can easily take
some emergency decisions

396
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:50,216
We can convince the court
by explaining in detail later

397
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:50,976
Such a rule exists

398
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:53,177
But if that robot kills some people?

399
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,177
Who will take the responsibility?

400
00:33:55,257 --> 00:33:56,258
Should I?

401
00:33:56,298 --> 00:33:57,657
Or our minister?

402
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:01,738
- Such a situation won't arise, sir
- Why not?

403
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:03,980
That's a machine

404
00:34:04,338 --> 00:34:06,379
We can't predict
when it may screw up

405
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:09,660
If it does something drastic
I'll be held responsible

406
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:12,941
Let's forget Chitti

407
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:14,781
Suggest some other option

408
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:18,102
Military is the only other feasible option

409
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,742
Let's go ahead with that

410
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:22,944
Request and the order
will be released by today

411
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:24,304
Do the needful

412
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,026
Hello...?

413
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:36,986
So

414
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:38,627
Plan collapsed?

415
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:40,427
Dhina, what is all this?

416
00:34:40,707 --> 00:34:42,667
You are a scientist
You are well aware

417
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:43,627
Of course

418
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:45,507
But I won't let it happen

419
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:49,670
I'll never allow you to bring
that nitwit Chitti back to life

420
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:52,030
What do you have against me?

421
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,350
You murdered my dad

422
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,551
Me...?

423
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,191
That Chitti

424
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,070
Your alter ego

425
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:00,830
That is also you!

426
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:06,473
I'll never forget it

427
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:32,184
'Yov! Lulla'

428
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:35,584
'I am the minister, I say'

429
00:37:35,624 --> 00:37:39,265
'Your tower is back in its place
You saw it on the way, right?'

430
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,666
'All the phones are back in the city'

431
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:44,226
'You can go back
to your business, man'

432
00:37:45,586 --> 00:37:47,067
Where are you speaking from?

433
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:48,308
'Right here'

434
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:02,404
I got drenched to the skin
No phone to even call Gopal

435
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:05,364
Even I got stranded
near Taramani-

436
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,968
Nila, go up

437
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:47,813
Hack it open, Nila

438
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:50,933
Boss, according to my rules
hacking is illegal

439
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:52,494
Isn't this wrong?

440
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:55,854
This will come under ethical hacking
Exception...do what I say

441
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,175
I understand, boss

442
00:39:57,255 --> 00:39:58,736
'If a handful of people benefit'

443
00:39:58,775 --> 00:40:00,615
'...nothing is wrong', right?

444
00:40:03,657 --> 00:40:05,897
Where did you get
this 'Nayagan' dialog from?

445
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,377
I should know all that humans like

446
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:10,457
As per your adaptive learning
you've programmed in me

447
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,338
Human beings have
only 4 preferences

448
00:40:12,379 --> 00:40:14,818
TV, Cinema, food and gossip

449
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:15,819
Easy!

450
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:37,664
"Iron heart sprouting for the 1st time?"

451
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:41,265
"Is it an invitation of first love divine?"

452
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:44,706
"Iron heart blossoming for the 1st time?"

453
00:40:47,266 --> 00:40:48,425
Shut up!

454
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:01,069
'Leaving from airport
Battalion # 121 proceeding to spot'

455
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:03,670
Entire state is under military control

456
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,390
People need not panic

457
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,590
Technology related to cell phone
networks in all the places

458
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,751
...is being attended to
on a war-front emergency basis

459
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,391
With military protection...

460
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:16,872
...arrangements have been made
to restart sales of cell phones

461
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:21,072
Very soon, people can start
using their cell phones as usual

462
00:41:21,232 --> 00:41:22,434
- Hey, Balu
- Sir...?

463
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:25,234
Call the minister and ask him
to provide us military protection

464
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,115
We have 4 police vans
round the clock stationed here, sir

465
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:31,595
If you look at the 303 rifles they have
even street dogs won't be scared

466
00:41:31,635 --> 00:41:33,076
We need AK 47, man

467
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:37,957
You saw how Manoj Lulla whom we met
2 days ago was squeezed like juice, right?

468
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:42,398
I was the one who signed the order
to revive cell phone service in the city

469
00:41:44,438 --> 00:41:49,159
Looking at the current situation
looks like I'll be the next juice!

470
00:41:49,198 --> 00:41:50,959
Call for the military immediately

471
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:52,520
Juice for you, my dear

472
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,100
- Is security in position?
- We've assigned 2 men, sir

473
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,859
- Enough strength in front?
- Yes, sir

474
00:44:19,899 --> 00:44:22,020
'Attack in Porur
Company on high alert'

475
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,380
'Attack in Porur
Company on high alert'

476
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,580
SIR!

477
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:27,539
Sir...!

478
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,059
Aiya...!

479
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,060
What happened?

480
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,099
That cell phone gang uprooted
all the towers in Porur

481
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:34,900
Wiped out our military force it seems, sir

482
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,259
No one knows where
that horde has vanished now

483
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,019
Yov! Porur is quite close to this place

484
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:42,020
Double the protection
round our house

485
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,778
A whole battalion is alert, sir

486
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:46,738
Ask them to shut all gates,
doors and windows

487
00:44:46,778 --> 00:44:49,778
Not even the smallest hole
should be exposed

488
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:52,778
Sir, everything has been closed
Including the computer's Windows!

489
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,699
They are throwing stones at us

490
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:01,938
Sir, this isn't a stone
It's your cell phone

491
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:04,858
Your missing cell phone
Come and see for yourself

492
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:09,258
'True that!'

493
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:11,258
All the precious stones are intact

494
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:15,698
How can you underestimate a minister?

495
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:17,778
Technology is in the palm of my hands!

496
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:21,458
That's why it has got scared
and returned only my mobile!

497
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:30,777
Who is this 'Unni Krishnan' calling?

498
00:45:32,137 --> 00:45:33,497
It's an unknown #, sir

499
00:45:37,657 --> 00:45:39,097
Good morning

500
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:51,936
Yov! Call the military

501
00:45:51,977 --> 00:45:54,697
- Ask them to shoot this sparrow
- Okay, sir

502
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:56,816
Go...go...go

503
00:45:56,856 --> 00:45:58,176
Get out!

504
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:12,576
Sir, this way please

505
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:14,776
- How is Mr Vairamoorthy?
- Critical, sir

506
00:46:14,976 --> 00:46:16,216
He's unable to breathe

507
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:18,895
- Something is blocking his windpipe
- What is it?

508
00:46:18,935 --> 00:46:19,935
Don't know exactly, sir

509
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:22,456
His secretary is equally dumbfounded

510
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:34,775
- Did you scan his body?
- We did, sir

511
00:46:34,816 --> 00:46:36,656
All the reports are normal

512
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:38,935
But he is unable to breathe, sir

513
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:59,174
- What happened, doctor?
- He is no more

514
00:47:00,294 --> 00:47:01,534
Whaat?!

515
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:44,293
Phone...phone

516
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,213
All the phones flew away, sir

517
00:47:46,253 --> 00:47:47,493
Landline, man

518
00:47:49,972 --> 00:47:52,772
Hello, I am Home minister
Vijay Kumar speaking

519
00:47:52,972 --> 00:47:55,332
Activate that robot Chitti immediately

520
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,333
Today

521
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:57,412
Right now

522
00:47:57,812 --> 00:48:01,653
How can you ask as if you're ordering
'idli' and 'vada' as Take away?

523
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,853
It is a ban by the court, sir

524
00:48:04,892 --> 00:48:06,692
I can't flout the rules of the court

525
00:48:06,853 --> 00:48:08,372
I'll handle all those formalities

526
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:09,732
1st activate Chitti at once

527
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:11,412
How is it possible immediately?

528
00:48:11,452 --> 00:48:13,572
An ordinance has to be
passed in the Parliament

529
00:48:13,612 --> 00:48:15,293
'The Opposition has to cooperate'

530
00:48:15,332 --> 00:48:17,771
The process is extremely complicated, sir

531
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:20,131
40 members of the Parliament
will favor us, sir

532
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:21,372
I'll handle all that

533
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:22,891
It's a machine, sir

534
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:24,931
We don't know when it will malfunction

535
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:29,251
Who will shoulder the responsibility
if it kills someone? You or me?

536
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:33,171
Yov! Don't seek revenge
oblivious of time or situation

537
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:35,691
It went into our Telecom minister's mouth

538
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:37,731
God knows which part of me it will target

539
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:40,011
I'll take all the responsibility

540
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,131
Satisfied?

541
00:48:44,451 --> 00:48:45,051
Dot!

542
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:49,050
I came here at midnight
There was a queue right then

543
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:52,129
I haven't got the phone as yet
and she wants me to top up!

544
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,090
Without cell phones, our life is like
'A Few Pages Missing In The Middle'

545
00:48:56,449 --> 00:48:59,290
Okay, what if the cell phones
fly away again?

546
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,771
I'm as sharp as a needle, you see

547
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:04,210
Take a look

548
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:07,490
You've fixed it like the chained tumbler
in the railway station!

549
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:10,529
Sir, for a while I was
so relaxed without cell phones

550
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:13,970
No ringtones to bug me daily
I'm lifting my head to see the world

551
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:16,570
I talk to my children
I visit my friends face to face

552
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:19,129
- Great feeling, eh?
- Then why the hell is he here?

553
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:21,650
What to do?
A cell phone is like one's wife

554
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,890
Damn if she exists
Darn if she doesn't!

555
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,049
Become a habit!

556
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:29,049
Yes!

557
00:51:16,846 --> 00:51:18,486
Chitti, you're back?

558
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:20,966
The way I fell I thought
my skull will blow to bits

559
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,405
Thank you, Chitti

560
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:43,565
Holy crow!

561
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:36,403
Chitti to Control

562
00:52:36,443 --> 00:52:39,483
- 'Control to Chitti'
- Assemble at TTK road junction

563
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:27,555
What is this?

564
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,835
Integral space research centre

565
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:33,235
That space research centre isn't active now

566
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:35,435
Research is no longer
conducted there

567
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,395
Only 2 technicians are left

568
00:56:37,515 --> 00:56:42,155
In 1964, head of Atomic Commission
Dr Homi Baba inaugurated this centre

569
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:45,035
Call Dr Sam

570
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:50,235
Hello, Sam here

571
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:51,755
Dr Sam, I'm Vasi

572
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:53,915
I need this information now, urgent

573
00:56:53,954 --> 00:56:57,915
What is that space research centre
in sector II Phase XIV?

574
00:56:57,955 --> 00:57:00,913
Vasi, keep this confidential

575
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:06,753
To find out if life exists
in other planets just like us on earth

576
00:57:06,954 --> 00:57:12,154
...signals are sent from many parts
of the world to outer space

577
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:15,273
That is one such place
from where signals are sent

578
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:16,914
What kind of signals are being sent?

579
00:57:16,954 --> 00:57:21,674
There are good forces and bad forces
co existing in this world

580
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:26,673
We send only positive signals
to outer space

581
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:31,832
Because only positive energy
present in space

582
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:34,633
...should be aware
of our presence here

583
00:57:34,832 --> 00:57:35,873
Thank you very much, Sam

584
00:57:35,913 --> 00:57:38,513
Chitti, play that visual
in Kirlian mode

585
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:43,433
Look at that

586
00:57:43,472 --> 00:57:46,913
If that cell phone bird is scared
of the positive signals from the emitters

587
00:57:46,992 --> 00:57:50,112
...there is some negative force
embedded in it

588
00:57:51,192 --> 00:57:54,192
By negative force
you mean from another planet?

589
00:57:57,192 --> 00:57:58,432
Freeze it

590
00:58:01,072 --> 00:58:04,871
No, this is some negative force
present only on our earth

591
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:12,552
This is a human face

592
00:58:13,191 --> 00:58:14,712
It looks very familiar to me

593
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:18,751
Nila, I want all the recent
abnormal events in Thirukazhukundram

594
00:58:18,951 --> 00:58:21,272
Most importantly
details of the deceased a.s.a.p

595
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,671
Doctor, this resembles the emitter
we saw in that space research centre

596
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,072
- Exactly
- What is your plan?

597
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:32,430
You know by now
You tell me

598
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:36,151
If it is a human negative energy
that is creating the 'mobile' force

599
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:37,591
...it has no physical form

600
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:40,471
But only the aura
that surrounds the human body

601
00:58:40,591 --> 00:58:41,471
Aura...?

602
00:58:41,511 --> 00:58:45,431
Atoms in a human body
consist of neutrons and electrons

603
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:50,950
The micro photon particles
that emanate from it is called aura

604
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,389
It is a thin layer around the body
not visible to the human eye

605
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:57,250
Aura of a person who is alive
is charged positive

606
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,750
A dead person's aura
will be charged negative

607
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:01,710
We must destroy that negative charge

608
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,390
The only way to succeed is to send
a more powerful positive charge towards it

609
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,629
And neutralize its energy

610
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:11,429
Aura of a deceased person
is micro photon minus

611
00:59:11,709 --> 00:59:14,070
We must send micro photon plus

612
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:16,510
Add plus to minus
it becomes zero

613
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,149
- Am I right, doctor?
- Exactly, Chitti

614
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:23,069
This photon synthesizer
generates micro photon plus

615
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:24,069
See

616
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:29,869
I've created the same positive rays here
similar to the Research centre

617
00:59:29,908 --> 00:59:34,189
This is 10 times stronger than
any negative energy known to mankind

618
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:37,068
We can neutralize
the negative energy for sure

619
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,988
Wow! Great

620
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:40,429
Boss, here are the details you asked for

621
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:45,869
73 people died last year
in Thirukazhukundram

622
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:47,548
Only 18 unnatural death

623
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:49,548
2 murders
4 suicides

624
00:59:49,588 --> 00:59:51,988
Is any death connected to a cell phone?

625
00:59:52,988 --> 00:59:57,029
A lorry driver died in an accident
using his mobile while driving

626
00:59:57,308 --> 00:59:59,868
Because her 'hot' photos
went viral through her mobile

627
00:59:59,908 --> 01:00:01,388
...a girl consumed poison

628
01:00:01,668 --> 01:00:05,027
One man died hanging himself
in a cell phone tower

629
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:07,028
- Date?
- April 7th

630
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,788
The next day cell phones started vanishing

631
01:00:11,828 --> 01:00:13,027
Oh my God!

632
01:00:13,508 --> 01:00:15,227
Now I'm getting a clearer picture

633
01:00:15,427 --> 01:00:17,907
Chitti, immediately
install this in AIRD bus

634
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,867
We are leaving for Thirukazhukundram

635
01:01:43,945 --> 01:01:45,224
Doctor, we got it

636
01:01:45,424 --> 01:01:46,785
I found all the phones

637
01:01:46,825 --> 01:01:49,544
Nila, bring the bus
to the rear end of the house

638
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:53,862
CHITTI!

639
01:04:18,499 --> 01:04:20,259
Nila, fix the cryostat, quick!

640
01:05:21,499 --> 01:05:22,979
My God!

641
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,540
Pakshi Raja...!

642
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,902
Nice DP

643
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:41,746
This is a war between
the entire mankind and me

644
01:05:42,507 --> 01:05:44,388
You are not a human being

645
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,269
Don't interfere

646
01:05:46,828 --> 01:05:49,470
- Run away
- Running away isn't in my software at all

647
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:52,151
I have been reactivated
only to protect human beings

648
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:54,231
My primary task is to destroy you!

649
01:06:02,795 --> 01:06:06,155
Pakshi Raja, why are you
so furious with the human race?

650
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:21,161
Why are you behaving like this?

651
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:23,123
What do you need?

652
01:07:23,945 --> 01:07:25,986
This is a pied cuckoo

653
01:07:26,905 --> 01:07:29,867
Biological name is Jacobin cuckoo

654
01:07:31,227 --> 01:07:32,627
In Northern India...

655
01:07:32,747 --> 01:07:37,230
...the monsoon season starts
only when this species migrates

656
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,951
If this species doesn't show up...

657
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:43,192
...there will be no rainfall
in that year for the entire region

658
01:07:43,952 --> 01:07:47,113
Till date no one knows
the mystery behind this

659
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:51,475
Even in our mythology
it is referred as 'rain bird'

660
01:07:52,555 --> 01:07:54,555
Carry out research on this

661
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:55,757
Sure, sir

662
01:07:55,836 --> 01:07:56,717
Wow...!

663
01:07:56,756 --> 01:07:59,199
Sir, your photo is
on the cover page

664
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:02,119
It was published a year ago

665
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:06,241
Sir, how did you get
interested in birds?

666
01:08:07,161 --> 01:08:10,763
Actually the other way about
The birds evinced interest in me!

667
01:08:12,002 --> 01:08:14,723
'When I was born
I wasn't breathing'

668
01:08:14,844 --> 01:08:17,245
'My body had turned blue'

669
01:08:17,325 --> 01:08:19,965
'Even the doctor gave up hope
and said the baby is dead'

670
01:08:20,006 --> 01:08:21,967
I'll sign and you finish
all the formalities

671
01:08:22,006 --> 01:08:24,247
Get the death certificate
and take the baby

672
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:14,586
'Don't know if it was an accident
or something else'

673
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:17,387
'But everyone exclaimed
it was a huge miracle'

674
01:09:18,107 --> 01:09:19,548
'My grandma used to say'

675
01:09:20,028 --> 01:09:24,150
'God came in the guise of
a sparrow and resurrected you'

676
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:27,272
'I still remember'

677
01:09:27,711 --> 01:09:31,633
'When I was young, early in the morning
the tiny sparrow will fly into my room'

678
01:09:31,673 --> 01:09:35,715
'...keep chirping cheerfully
and going around the fan in a circle'

679
01:09:37,755 --> 01:09:43,997
"To the sun's ray at dawn that glitter
a warm welcome your wings you flutter"

680
01:09:44,037 --> 01:09:50,119
"As the sun slides down yonder deep
you caress the branches to sleep"

681
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:56,203
"With your pitter patter dainty feet
'kolam' you draw as an aesthetic treat"

682
01:09:56,323 --> 01:10:02,524
"Today you make me yearn
To fly like you I want to learn"

683
01:10:02,604 --> 01:10:05,806
"Flock of birds in flight"

684
01:10:05,886 --> 01:10:08,727
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping"

685
01:10:08,807 --> 01:10:10,648
'I decided right then'

686
01:10:10,688 --> 01:10:14,008
'My life will be dedicated
to birds and only birds'

687
01:10:41,138 --> 01:10:43,460
"Flock of birds in flight"

688
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,981
"Oho! A flight of birds in sight"

689
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:52,303
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping"

690
01:10:53,704 --> 01:10:58,826
"A host of sparrows
A flight of swallows"

691
01:10:59,066 --> 01:11:05,388
"I wish to hear
your tweet and twitter"

692
01:11:20,554 --> 01:11:26,076
"No language or religion, you fly at ease
Any place is your home, as you please"

693
01:11:26,795 --> 01:11:32,119
"No language, no religion, you roam
You affirm any place is your home"

694
01:11:32,717 --> 01:11:38,961
"You claim even weeds to be
your kith and kin in reality"

695
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:45,122
"You form a swing in mid-air
to play with the wind out there"

696
01:11:45,163 --> 01:11:50,325
"You make a deep impact in people
to whom laughter isn't easy or simple"

697
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:56,087
"My precious life, my cherished creed
A heart like yours is needed indeed"

698
01:11:58,087 --> 01:12:03,490
"Even if the world is wiped out extensively
an urge to protect you surges effusively"

699
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:06,051
"Swiftly on a flying spree
in the skies carefree"

700
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:09,051
"Fly without any boundary"

701
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:13,493
That's why I studied
ornithology with passion

702
01:12:13,853 --> 01:12:16,415
I became an ornithology professor too

703
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,057
'Pon ulagaaleero'

704
01:12:21,576 --> 01:12:23,497
'Bhuvanam muzhudhaleero'

705
01:12:23,736 --> 01:12:25,778
'Nannaya pullinangaal'

706
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:29,379
These are lines from
Nammazhwar's Thiruvaimozhi

707
01:12:29,539 --> 01:12:31,060
This is the meaning

708
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,061
O' birds, you are all over this world

709
01:12:34,461 --> 01:12:36,902
You have spread your wings
right up to Heaven

710
01:12:37,262 --> 01:12:40,024
Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds

711
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:43,344
When compared to the weight
of the human race on earth...

712
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:46,386
...weight of the birds en masse
is almost 100 times more

713
01:12:46,466 --> 01:12:50,907
Birds eat 1000 times more food
than what humans consume

714
01:12:52,108 --> 01:12:54,549
If they didn't feed on worms

715
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:57,230
...not even 1 green leaf
will be left on earth

716
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,311
Human beings won't
get any food at all

717
01:13:00,591 --> 01:13:04,833
Because insects are
1000 times more than birds!

718
01:13:05,993 --> 01:13:08,714
So if human beings have to
survive on this earth...

719
01:13:08,794 --> 01:13:12,355
...birds also should be alive

720
01:13:12,395 --> 01:13:15,396
Sir, of late birds flocking to
the bird sanctuary in Vedanthangal

721
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:17,638
...has dwindled
What is the reason, sir?

722
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:21,839
When I was young, we used to wake up
only to the chirp of sparrows

723
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:24,920
'You don't get to see any sparrow
in the city nowadays, sir'

724
01:13:30,002 --> 01:13:32,363
'Only in 1996...'

725
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:35,325
'...cell phones were
introduced in India'

726
01:13:35,404 --> 01:13:39,324
'In a gradual and continuous process
birds have decreased only after this'

727
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:42,447
'Particularly sparrows'

728
01:13:43,407 --> 01:13:44,968
It is called Arctic Tern

729
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:48,809
This small bird weighing just 50 gm

730
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,531
...migrates every year
from the Arctic region

731
01:13:52,651 --> 01:13:56,812
...flying 12000 km
to our Vedanthangal

732
01:13:56,892 --> 01:13:57,933
...and returns

733
01:13:58,053 --> 01:14:00,333
A bird doesn't have a map or radar

734
01:14:00,373 --> 01:14:04,815
From within its head, it absorbs
all micro rays from the sky

735
01:14:04,855 --> 01:14:08,176
And using cryptochrome formation

736
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:10,657
...it steers in the right direction

737
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:12,818
'That is the bird's sole strength'

738
01:14:13,218 --> 01:14:18,860
Now we've filled the sky with radiation
from numerous cell phone towers

739
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:23,343
So the cryptochrome formation
in the bird's head is shattered

740
01:14:23,382 --> 01:14:25,463
And eliminated completely

741
01:14:25,623 --> 01:14:27,504
'Not knowing where they are heading'

742
01:14:27,584 --> 01:14:30,825
'...birds lose their way and
their entire species is becoming extinct'

743
01:14:30,865 --> 01:14:33,346
'To the birds, it is equal
to losing their sanity'

744
01:14:33,626 --> 01:14:36,347
In addition, because of the radiation...

745
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:39,229
...shells aren't being formed
on the eggs of these birds

746
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,389
Their eggs resemble a layer of skin

747
01:14:41,469 --> 01:14:45,151
The eggs break when
the mother bird is incubating

748
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:49,273
In reality, men also suffer
from these repercussions

749
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:52,233
Many get afflicted by ******

750
01:14:52,633 --> 01:14:54,434
********* may be on the rise

751
01:14:54,514 --> 01:14:56,035
******** will increase

752
01:14:56,274 --> 01:14:57,355
Above all

753
01:14:57,475 --> 01:14:58,395
Depression

754
01:14:58,435 --> 01:14:59,557
Schizophrenia

755
01:14:59,636 --> 01:15:01,276
Alzheimer's etc-

756
01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:06,078
Higher % of mental disorder

757
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:09,840
All these symptoms
are obvious right now

758
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,720
Mr Pakshi Rajan

759
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,681
What is your solution?

760
01:15:14,202 --> 01:15:16,321
Why do we use cell phone now?

761
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:18,723
Just gossip and trivialities

762
01:15:18,803 --> 01:15:20,323
Let's control that

763
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:23,204
Why do we need so many
cell phones and towers?

764
01:15:23,284 --> 01:15:24,565
Let us reduce that

765
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:29,608
Let us pass a law as to who, why and
for how long a cell phone can be used

766
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:31,967
Has this chap lost it?
Is he mad?

767
01:15:32,048 --> 01:15:34,969
Instead of the current high frequency
cell phone technology

768
01:15:35,008 --> 01:15:37,169
...let us invent
a safer technology

769
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:41,411
Until then let us shut down
90% of the cell phone towers in India

770
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:45,373
Please speak a little loudly

771
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:46,895
Sir, please excuse me

772
01:15:53,135 --> 01:15:55,137
'Save bird, save earth'

773
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,937
'Save bird
Save earth'

774
01:15:56,977 --> 01:15:58,818
'Don't kill, don't kill'

775
01:15:58,857 --> 01:16:00,418
'Don't kill birds'

776
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:02,019
'Save birds save birds'

777
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:03,740
'Save birds
Save earth'

778
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:05,300
'Don't kill, don't kill'

779
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,901
'Don't kill birds'

780
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:08,181
'Stop...stop'

781
01:16:08,221 --> 01:16:09,702
'Radiation
Pollution'

782
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:11,183
'Stop...stop'

783
01:16:11,222 --> 01:16:12,944
'Radiation Pollution'

784
01:16:13,143 --> 01:16:15,464
'Don't kill'

785
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:17,984
Are they all jobless?

786
01:16:18,385 --> 01:16:22,787
When the sun rises, they swing placards
defending dogs, cats, crows and sparrows

787
01:16:22,947 --> 01:16:24,348
Can't you chase them?

788
01:16:24,387 --> 01:16:27,229
'Refusing to leave, sir
Very insistent about meeting you'

789
01:16:33,351 --> 01:16:34,391
Tell me

790
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:36,833
What's your problem?

791
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,794
What is the frequency rate
permitted by TRAI?

792
01:16:41,595 --> 01:16:44,555
What is the frequency rate
in your towers at present?

793
01:16:45,156 --> 01:16:48,317
Birds flying in the sky are being
destroyed in their fetus stage by you

794
01:16:48,357 --> 01:16:49,756
Hello mister, listen

795
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:53,159
We strictly follow the rules of
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India

796
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,599
Already subscribers complain

797
01:16:54,679 --> 01:16:58,440
'No signal in the bathroom or basement
Skype doesn't work in the lift'

798
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,161
Do you know in these 3 months
2000 customers have...

799
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,522
...switched to other networks?

800
01:17:02,562 --> 01:17:03,682
Don't lie

801
01:17:04,123 --> 01:17:08,245
In your disgusting competition
just to retain your subscribers

802
01:17:08,284 --> 01:17:11,886
...you are increasing the frequency rate
to suit your needs as you wish

803
01:17:11,926 --> 01:17:14,767
Now it is well over the danger limit

804
01:17:15,126 --> 01:17:18,168
Because of the heavy radiation
the entire species of birds

805
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,610
...the bird kingdom is dying
without a trace

806
01:17:20,729 --> 01:17:22,369
You aren't one bit bothered

807
01:17:22,409 --> 01:17:24,009
You are exaggerating

808
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:27,332
Birds becoming extinct
due to cell phone radiation

809
01:17:27,371 --> 01:17:29,171
...has no scientific proof or backing

810
01:17:29,373 --> 01:17:30,293
You know that?

811
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:32,012
If that is so
come with me

812
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:37,494
Stand under your cell phone tower
for just 24 hours

813
01:17:37,535 --> 01:17:39,056
I will prove it!

814
01:17:39,816 --> 01:17:40,816
You get out

815
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:43,097
You asked for scientific proof, right?

816
01:17:43,457 --> 01:17:44,658
I'll provide it

817
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:45,778
Get out, man

818
01:17:45,818 --> 01:17:47,458
Write to the Press & Media

819
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,420
Hold placards and
protest in the hot sun

820
01:17:49,459 --> 01:17:50,781
I don't care

821
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:51,940
Out

822
01:17:52,021 --> 01:17:53,261
Get out!

823
01:17:56,902 --> 01:17:58,263
Nonsense!

824
01:18:05,146 --> 01:18:07,666
Move it a little bit upwards

825
01:18:12,428 --> 01:18:14,028
Hey...listen!

826
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:15,990
What is this, sir?

827
01:18:16,469 --> 01:18:17,710
Stop it

828
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:19,230
I'm telling you

829
01:18:19,271 --> 01:18:22,032
There are houses nearby
Many birds flock around

830
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:23,871
- Stop everything
- Hey, old man

831
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:26,874
Are we building a nuclear plant here?
It's only a cell phone tower

832
01:18:26,914 --> 01:18:30,034
Hereafter you'll get good signal
on your phone, move aside

833
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:31,275
Come on...come

834
01:18:31,355 --> 01:18:33,155
- What is it, sir?
- Ramasamy

835
01:18:33,235 --> 01:18:35,877
I repeatedly told you
about birds dying

836
01:18:35,996 --> 01:18:37,438
You were also worried

837
01:18:37,517 --> 01:18:39,638
- But now...?
- What can I do, sir?

838
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:41,279
Agriculture is no longer profitable

839
01:18:41,318 --> 01:18:42,799
Insects kill all my yield

840
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,759
I became a pauper
buying insecticides

841
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,962
Primary reason for that is
the increased death rate of birds

842
01:18:48,242 --> 01:18:50,123
Only birds eat insects

843
01:18:50,323 --> 01:18:51,843
If birds die...

844
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:54,004
...insects will increase
beyond control

845
01:18:54,283 --> 01:18:57,085
Whatever the reason, I don't
have the strength to be a farmer

846
01:18:57,164 --> 01:18:59,606
This is the only income
I can get from this land

847
01:18:59,927 --> 01:19:03,006
Why should you sell your land
to a man who kills birds?

848
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:05,409
People are dying
of starvation here

849
01:19:05,488 --> 01:19:07,408
And you're bothered
about birds dying!

850
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:09,330
Don't pester me
Attend to your work

851
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,890
Move aside

852
01:19:13,411 --> 01:19:14,972
'Ladies and gentlemen'

853
01:19:15,612 --> 01:19:17,652
'Stop using cell phone'

854
01:19:18,493 --> 01:19:23,094
Every cell phone used is encased
with the blood of thousands of birds

855
01:19:23,536 --> 01:19:27,135
Each cell phone is a sparrow's coffin!

856
01:19:27,217 --> 01:19:28,697
Save birds

857
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:31,137
- Come here
- Yes, sir

858
01:19:31,178 --> 01:19:33,819
Who is this man?
Disturbing all our customers

859
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,539
- Chase him away
- Okay, sir

860
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,380
What happened?

861
01:19:38,499 --> 01:19:40,661
Ladies and gentlemen

862
01:19:40,741 --> 01:19:42,902
Don't use cell phones

863
01:19:43,462 --> 01:19:44,703
Here...read this

864
01:20:19,955 --> 01:20:21,397
Aiyaiyo!

865
01:21:08,499 --> 01:21:11,179
I have given many petitions
in many levels many times

866
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:14,020
'No one has taken any action'

867
01:21:15,379 --> 01:21:16,538
Oh!

868
01:21:16,699 --> 01:21:20,099
Is this why we don't see
any sparrows at all?

869
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,140
When I was a kid

870
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,701
...they used to flock around my house

871
01:21:26,741 --> 01:21:28,741
It was a feast for sore eyes

872
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,381
I've played with those birds

873
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:33,421
When I grew up, I have
even fried and feasted on them

874
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,660
A real treat for the taste buds

875
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,341
- Crispy, like quail fry
- Super, sir

876
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:41,182
And that concoction made with it

877
01:21:41,341 --> 01:21:43,063
What an aphrodisiac!

878
01:21:48,142 --> 01:21:49,702
It isn't available nowadays

879
01:21:49,743 --> 01:21:50,823
What is this?

880
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:54,503
I'm talking of ensuring birds live
and you're relishing killing them

881
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:56,103
What else do you want me to do?

882
01:21:56,183 --> 01:21:58,303
Shall we start a Sparrow Welfare Board?

883
01:21:58,383 --> 01:22:00,183
You can be elected as the chairman

884
01:22:02,024 --> 01:22:07,065
1st take strict action against networks
which exceed their allotted frequency

885
01:22:08,464 --> 01:22:10,625
Cancel their license

886
01:22:11,103 --> 01:22:12,265
Then?

887
01:22:12,825 --> 01:22:17,025
Grant permission only 2 networks
following regulations to the T

888
01:22:17,345 --> 01:22:19,065
What are you saying?

889
01:22:19,145 --> 01:22:21,185
We boast of a population of 1.3 billion

890
01:22:21,265 --> 01:22:22,825
Shouldn't we reach all of them?

891
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:24,705
Shouldn't every area receive signal?

892
01:22:24,786 --> 01:22:27,107
Cell phone is the foundation for everything

893
01:22:27,227 --> 01:22:30,426
The world will come to a standstill
if mobiles don't work for an hour

894
01:22:30,465 --> 01:22:32,685
How much time is saved
because of this gadget?

895
01:22:32,885 --> 01:22:35,106
Business has developed
Industries have prospered

896
01:22:35,147 --> 01:22:38,267
Because he's hungry will anyone
chop his own hand and eat it?

897
01:22:39,547 --> 01:22:42,947
Same holds good for the progress
we attain by killing birds

898
01:22:44,388 --> 01:22:47,508
If a 30 gm sparrow can't live
depending on us

899
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:50,709
...then how can we boast of
this technology and progress?

900
01:22:51,909 --> 01:22:54,468
America is a bigger nation than India

901
01:22:54,549 --> 01:22:56,990
It has only 4-5 networks

902
01:22:57,269 --> 01:23:00,269
China is the most populated
country in the world

903
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:02,669
Only 3 networks are used

904
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:03,909
But here?

905
01:23:03,989 --> 01:23:05,390
More than 10

906
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:07,630
You accept ****** from everyone

907
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:10,390
And allow networks to flourish
flouting all the rules

908
01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:12,911
You're letting your tongue run, eh?

909
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,351
You seem educated

910
01:23:14,431 --> 01:23:17,751
I was lenient because you're a big shot
You're analysing politics, huh?

911
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,231
Okay, let me counteract

912
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,150
We work based only
on rules and regulations

913
01:23:22,792 --> 01:23:27,232
Only by adhering to international rules
cell phone service is allotted

914
01:23:27,632 --> 01:23:29,751
File a case in court
if you have any doubts

915
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:30,552
Clear out now

916
01:23:30,752 --> 01:23:32,554
Don't get angry
Please listen to me

917
01:23:32,593 --> 01:23:34,992
I was patient for so long, eh?
Go...go to court

918
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:37,194
You'll get a verdict after many years

919
01:23:37,233 --> 01:23:39,193
Prime minister says
I must meet the common man

920
01:23:39,234 --> 01:23:41,553
'And I get caught
with such crackpots'

921
01:23:55,074 --> 01:23:58,235
Court officials are coming
to check radiation frequency

922
01:23:58,435 --> 01:24:00,155
Make sure it is well within the limit

923
01:24:00,195 --> 01:24:02,755
'From multiples tests conducted
it has been found...'

924
01:24:02,795 --> 01:24:06,156
'...only adequate radiation
has been channelized into cell phones'

925
01:24:06,195 --> 01:24:12,756
'It has not been proved scientifically
that birds are affected by cell phones'

926
01:24:13,436 --> 01:24:17,477
'Therefore Pakshi Rajan's case
has been adjourned'

927
01:26:23,729 --> 01:26:26,688
Pakshi Rajan, whatever you say
is just and right

928
01:26:26,768 --> 01:26:28,689
But killing humans is wrong

929
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:31,890
They killed countless flocks of birds
Isn't that a crime?

930
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,570
You'll label human life differently

931
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:37,930
In what way are birds' lives inferior?

932
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:41,210
Why do you kill innocent people
for the fault of a handful of men?

933
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:43,050
Who is 'innocent'?

934
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:47,371
Every individual who owns
a cell phone is a murderer

935
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:49,331
How I yelled my throat hoarse

936
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:52,212
How many streets
I would've walked begging

937
01:26:52,252 --> 01:26:55,133
How many feet I fell
pleading not to use cell phones

938
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:57,812
Did even a single soul
pay heed to my pleas?

939
01:26:59,252 --> 01:27:01,051
They read about this in newspapers

940
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:02,453
Watch the News on TV

941
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:03,653
And then...

942
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:04,733
...exclaim 'oh'!

943
01:27:06,573 --> 01:27:09,814
Do sparrows die only due to
radiation from cell phones?

944
01:27:10,214 --> 01:27:11,533
'How sad!'

945
01:27:12,613 --> 01:27:13,853
'Poor things, no?'

946
01:27:14,213 --> 01:27:16,334
Just for 5 minutes
make clucking sounds

947
01:27:16,374 --> 01:27:19,534
Share that article and video clipping
in WhatsApp and Facebook

948
01:27:19,573 --> 01:27:22,453
Thinking their duty is over and
it was their good deed for the day

949
01:27:22,535 --> 01:27:25,375
They go back to
their cell phones, blockheads!

950
01:27:27,815 --> 01:27:29,415
I won't let this go

951
01:27:30,175 --> 01:27:33,256
I won't spare even a single person
who owns a cell phone

952
01:27:34,655 --> 01:27:35,775
Hereafter

953
01:27:36,735 --> 01:27:39,216
Cell phone is everyone's Yama!

954
01:27:41,016 --> 01:27:44,296
Just watch, people should panic and
run for their lives as soon as they see it

955
01:27:44,377 --> 01:27:47,136
Pakshi, you've reached your stop

956
01:27:47,577 --> 01:27:49,257
Get into the bus

957
01:28:57,584 --> 01:28:58,784
Chitti!

958
01:29:57,469 --> 01:29:58,550
Oh my God!

959
01:31:54,961 --> 01:31:56,800
- Thanks
- Welcome

960
01:32:00,361 --> 01:32:02,281
Hey! What is this?

961
01:32:02,602 --> 01:32:05,121
You've fixed your MPU in me

962
01:32:05,362 --> 01:32:07,081
Oh! By mistake

963
01:32:07,163 --> 01:32:10,003
I was wondering why
my core memory was corrupt

964
01:32:10,203 --> 01:32:11,322
Punch dialogs
Vadivelu comedy

965
01:32:11,522 --> 01:32:13,522
'Vani Rani' episodes
Banana flower fritters!

966
01:32:13,722 --> 01:32:15,723
# star-darling and dance-king
All kinds of stuff

967
01:32:15,803 --> 01:32:17,683
Come, lie down
I will fix it

968
01:32:17,723 --> 01:32:18,842
No need

969
01:32:18,882 --> 01:32:20,123
Let it be

970
01:32:26,644 --> 01:32:27,724
Aura

971
01:32:27,763 --> 01:32:30,764
Every human, beast,
inanimate object

972
01:32:30,844 --> 01:32:32,925
Even every place has an aura

973
01:32:33,085 --> 01:32:36,804
This aura invisible to the eye pertains
not only to spirituality but science too

974
01:32:36,845 --> 01:32:39,884
With the help of a Kirlian camera
we can take photos of an aura

975
01:32:40,084 --> 01:32:42,685
Ordinary people have an aura
3 to 4 feet thick

976
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:46,325
Some sages have an aura
spreading over 50 feet

977
01:32:46,365 --> 01:32:49,565
Russian scientist
Dr Frank Baranowski has proved this

978
01:32:50,327 --> 01:32:52,326
Pakshi Rajan's aura is enormous

979
01:32:52,566 --> 01:32:55,007
It isn't the aura of
an individual man alone

980
01:32:55,046 --> 01:32:57,567
Aura of 1000s of birds
which were destroyed

981
01:32:57,926 --> 01:32:59,487
A giant ball of negative energy

982
01:32:59,687 --> 01:33:00,527
With a mind

983
01:33:01,007 --> 01:33:02,848
A very angry mind

984
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:05,328
This maybe a form of 5th force

985
01:33:05,407 --> 01:33:07,568
It has controlled all the cell phones

986
01:33:07,608 --> 01:33:09,608
It would've destroyed
our city given a chance

987
01:33:09,647 --> 01:33:12,248
We succeeded only because
of Chitti's reappearance

988
01:33:12,449 --> 01:33:13,688
Thank you, Chitti

989
01:33:14,408 --> 01:33:17,489
I thank all of you
who have been a source of support

990
01:33:17,929 --> 01:33:20,008
In our ancient classics

991
01:33:20,048 --> 01:33:27,169
...we have heard many stories of God
descending on earth to destroy demons

992
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:31,729
Lord Shiva Himself came as a robot
to save us from a fate worse than death

993
01:33:31,809 --> 01:33:35,930
I invite that Iron warrior Chitti
on to the dais to share a few words

994
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:44,371
When a warrior fights
his shadow battles along with him

995
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:48,091
When the warrior pierces and kills
the enemy, the shadow will follow suit

996
01:33:48,171 --> 01:33:52,572
So will we praise and
garland the shadow?

997
01:33:52,692 --> 01:33:53,772
He is real

998
01:33:53,811 --> 01:33:55,212
I am his shadow

999
01:33:55,332 --> 01:33:58,092
All glory and praise to
that God who created me

1000
01:34:19,894 --> 01:34:20,854
Thank you

1001
01:34:20,934 --> 01:34:23,734
At this juncture I must thank
and mention a specific name

1002
01:34:23,934 --> 01:34:26,096
At the right moment
parting with the heart

1003
01:34:26,216 --> 01:34:28,656
I mean, giving the MPU

1004
01:34:28,735 --> 01:34:30,456
...if I had not been activated

1005
01:34:30,535 --> 01:34:32,735
I couldn't have destroyed the evil force

1006
01:34:32,816 --> 01:34:34,215
The name is...

1007
01:34:34,816 --> 01:34:36,056
Nila

1008
01:34:46,696 --> 01:34:49,737
At this wonderful moment
a piece of good news for you

1009
01:34:50,778 --> 01:34:54,058
Chitti who has been created
by Dr Vaseegaran

1010
01:34:54,179 --> 01:34:56,498
...has been approved by our Govt

1011
01:34:57,899 --> 01:34:59,779
An order has been passed this morning

1012
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:03,978
...to create 500 Chitti robots
for our Indian army

1013
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:06,659
Thank you

1014
01:39:04,499 --> 01:39:06,339
Hi, scientist

1015
01:39:21,821 --> 01:39:23,061
May I come in?

1016
01:39:29,461 --> 01:39:31,862
Irresponsible people

1017
01:39:32,021 --> 01:39:34,302
Trash your cell phones

1018
01:39:35,062 --> 01:39:37,263
This is your last chance

1019
01:39:37,901 --> 01:39:39,222
Otherwise...

1020
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:41,503
...death is certain!

1021
01:39:41,622 --> 01:39:43,703
I'm not the Mahesh
who got tagged in # MeToo, dear!

1022
01:39:43,742 --> 01:39:45,542
Check your phone properly
Why don't you-

1023
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:47,022
Didn't you hear what I said?

1024
01:39:50,463 --> 01:39:52,423
I always wear Victoria Secret, you know

1025
01:39:52,623 --> 01:39:53,543
Including the latest one-

1026
01:40:17,585 --> 01:40:19,946
- Nila, is photon synthesizer set?
- Yes

1027
01:40:23,105 --> 01:40:25,065
'Hey! Pub closes at midnight'

1028
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:26,506
'Let's go tomorrow'

1029
01:40:27,346 --> 01:40:28,426
'Hey! Stop...stop'

1030
01:40:33,307 --> 01:40:35,425
Doctor, what happened to you?

1031
01:40:35,466 --> 01:40:37,027
Why are you behaving like this?

1032
01:40:37,066 --> 01:40:39,107
Welcome, my dear 'nuts & bolt toy'

1033
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,587
I'm not your doctor!

1034
01:40:50,707 --> 01:40:52,987
Nila, turn on the neutralizer

1035
01:41:10,349 --> 01:41:11,429
No...!

1036
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:12,750
Nila, stop it!

1037
01:41:21,390 --> 01:41:24,270
You can't do anything to me, Chitti

1038
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:27,591
I have a body now

1039
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:30,871
Dr Vaseegaran's body!

1040
01:41:31,551 --> 01:41:33,471
If you destroy me...

1041
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:36,712
...it is the same as
you killing your God!

1042
01:41:38,391 --> 01:41:39,593
Now...

1043
01:41:39,632 --> 01:41:42,352
...can you turn it on please?

1044
01:41:42,392 --> 01:41:44,112
Show off your technology

1045
01:41:44,312 --> 01:41:44,993
Turn it on

1046
01:41:45,193 --> 01:41:46,592
Switch it on, damn you!

1047
01:41:47,992 --> 01:41:49,072
Chitti...!

1048
01:41:49,113 --> 01:41:50,833
Don't hesitate
Turn it on

1049
01:41:51,033 --> 01:41:51,673
Destroy me

1050
01:41:51,873 --> 01:41:53,673
He'll be destroyed along with me

1051
01:41:53,753 --> 01:41:55,553
No, doctor
I can't do that

1052
01:41:55,593 --> 01:41:59,032
Chitti, thinking you are saving me
don't exterminate the entire human race

1053
01:41:59,232 --> 01:42:00,073
Kill me

1054
01:42:00,113 --> 01:42:01,073
Destroy him

1055
01:42:01,114 --> 01:42:02,474
- Kill me
- Sorry, doctor

1056
01:42:02,513 --> 01:42:04,473
Human emotion fed by you
is stopping me

1057
01:42:04,513 --> 01:42:06,793
Moron! This is my order, kill me

1058
01:42:08,193 --> 01:42:09,673
No, hold fire

1059
01:42:10,034 --> 01:42:12,553
If you shoot, only Vaseegaran
will die unnecessarily

1060
01:42:12,594 --> 01:42:13,995
Can't kill Pakshi Rajan

1061
01:42:14,034 --> 01:42:15,674
Chitti, why are you stopping them?

1062
01:42:15,714 --> 01:42:17,394
- Let them shoot me
- No

1063
01:42:28,995 --> 01:42:30,076
Chitti

1064
01:42:31,515 --> 01:42:32,835
Aiyo! Chitti

1065
01:42:33,275 --> 01:42:35,035
Nila, turn on the neutralizer

1066
01:42:35,076 --> 01:42:36,476
'Come on, quick!'

1067
01:42:37,075 --> 01:42:38,077
Nila...NO!

1068
01:42:38,117 --> 01:42:39,196
'Don't do that'

1069
01:42:39,716 --> 01:42:41,516
Shut up!
This is my order

1070
01:42:41,556 --> 01:42:42,676
Switch it on

1071
01:43:01,598 --> 01:43:02,838
Aiyo!

1072
01:43:02,918 --> 01:43:05,278
What you've done
is really foolish, Chitti

1073
01:43:10,238 --> 01:43:13,078
Your 'call' is disconnected!

1074
01:43:44,201 --> 01:43:45,560
Chitti...?

1075
01:43:45,882 --> 01:43:47,721
What a pity!

1076
01:43:58,403 --> 01:44:00,082
Chitti...Chitti

1077
01:44:01,362 --> 01:44:02,282
Chit-

1078
01:44:02,322 --> 01:44:03,362
Chitti

1079
01:44:06,484 --> 01:44:08,163
Nila, go right now and-

1080
01:44:46,646 --> 01:44:49,166
"Earth shattering cyclone blows
today right now"

1081
01:44:49,246 --> 01:44:51,607
"He's gonna break, break, break
Break it down!"

1082
01:44:51,685 --> 01:44:54,167
"Pakshi Raja gonna destroy everyone"

1083
01:44:54,207 --> 01:44:56,587
"As quick as a stride
destruction of a different kind"

1084
01:44:56,787 --> 01:44:59,167
"Illusionary tricks galore
Danger! Caution all the more"

1085
01:44:59,367 --> 01:45:01,807
"He's going to eat you alive"

1086
01:45:02,007 --> 01:45:03,888
"Run for your life"

1087
01:45:03,928 --> 01:45:08,247
"I am a bird of prey waiting to eat you
Feather-man who got into you head to toe"

1088
01:45:08,367 --> 01:45:10,927
"Pakshi Raja!"

1089
01:45:11,007 --> 01:45:14,288
"King of birds...Pakshi Raja"

1090
01:45:14,328 --> 01:45:18,128
"I have the souls of birds many
to seek revenge, flocking within me"

1091
01:45:18,169 --> 01:45:20,488
"King of birds...Pakshi Raja"

1092
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:05,942
Unique feeling of real joy
to die and get reactivated!

1093
01:48:10,462 --> 01:48:11,582
Pakshi

1094
01:48:12,141 --> 01:48:15,143
Unlike your name
you can't fly any longer!

1095
01:48:20,743 --> 01:48:22,382
Hey, Nila...!

1096
01:48:22,423 --> 01:48:24,222
Why are you standing right there?

1097
01:48:24,783 --> 01:48:27,423
True to your name,
Nila should orbit the earth, eh?

1098
01:48:27,464 --> 01:48:29,023
Come...come...come

1099
01:48:32,144 --> 01:48:33,623
Come on, baby

1100
01:48:36,423 --> 01:48:37,864
Wow...!

1101
01:48:37,984 --> 01:48:41,024
Only 2 tasks of Vaseegaran
in his research are worthy of praise

1102
01:48:41,065 --> 01:48:42,224
One is me

1103
01:48:42,424 --> 01:48:43,865
The other is you!

1104
01:48:44,704 --> 01:48:45,944
What are you looking at?

1105
01:48:45,984 --> 01:48:47,024
Come on

1106
01:48:47,064 --> 01:48:50,506
Give a beautiful kiss
to your great king, baby

1107
01:48:57,025 --> 01:48:58,425
Stop the play, Chitti

1108
01:48:58,465 --> 01:49:00,385
We must 1st destroy Pakshi

1109
01:49:00,465 --> 01:49:02,826
Because he is even more powerful than you

1110
01:49:03,426 --> 01:49:05,586
He's committing atrocities multi-fold

1111
01:49:06,266 --> 01:49:08,826
He was able to shred
even you into million parts

1112
01:49:09,106 --> 01:49:10,266
Now...

1113
01:49:10,306 --> 01:49:11,747
...he's number 1 here

1114
01:49:11,788 --> 01:49:13,066
Not you

1115
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:22,506
Hey, this # 1 and # 2
are all child's play

1116
01:49:22,827 --> 01:49:24,748
I am the only one

1117
01:49:25,947 --> 01:49:27,548
Super one!

1118
01:49:27,788 --> 01:49:30,107
No comparison, understand?

1119
01:49:30,227 --> 01:49:31,508
I understand, Chitti

1120
01:49:31,948 --> 01:49:33,308
We must make him understand

1121
01:49:33,348 --> 01:49:34,829
You bet I will

1122
01:49:36,268 --> 01:49:38,109
The king of birds

1123
01:49:38,868 --> 01:49:40,468
The battle is on!

1124
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:01,070
Left

1125
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:02,430
Right

1126
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,471
Head

1127
01:50:04,031 --> 01:50:05,630
'Kamoshka'

1128
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:07,670
Activate command mode

1129
01:50:07,711 --> 01:50:09,471
Command mode activated!

1130
01:50:20,111 --> 01:50:21,473
What is this?

1131
01:50:24,193 --> 01:50:25,512
It's me

1132
01:50:26,273 --> 01:50:27,512
Mini me!

1133
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:32,872
So cute

1134
01:50:52,435 --> 01:50:53,994
'What a game!'

1135
01:50:55,394 --> 01:50:57,314
'And now it's Half time
at the IFL finals'

1136
01:51:25,557 --> 01:51:27,757
'We'll handle that later
Attend to your call'

1137
01:51:41,877 --> 01:51:43,917
Dear subscribers

1138
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:47,319
You are going to be
not reachable from now

1139
01:51:47,518 --> 01:51:48,919
'Because...'

1140
01:51:49,079 --> 01:51:51,317
...all of you will die now

1141
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:54,319
'By no means an ordinary death'

1142
01:51:55,039 --> 01:51:56,759
'Radiation death!'

1143
01:51:57,839 --> 01:52:01,840
You will all die in groups
like how the sparrows collapsed

1144
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:03,360
'Don't you get it?'

1145
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:10,280
I'll combine the radiation
from the cell phones all of you use

1146
01:52:11,281 --> 01:52:13,721
I'll download it on all of you

1147
01:52:15,161 --> 01:52:16,841
Want to see a demo?

1148
01:52:25,121 --> 01:52:26,481
Hey, you...!

1149
01:52:28,522 --> 01:52:29,802
Ex...excuse me

1150
01:52:30,721 --> 01:52:32,802
Why don't you select someone else?

1151
01:52:33,122 --> 01:52:34,122
Why?

1152
01:52:34,203 --> 01:52:35,362
I'm on your side

1153
01:52:35,402 --> 01:52:36,562
How...?

1154
01:52:37,442 --> 01:52:39,562
I was the one who released you

1155
01:52:40,843 --> 01:52:43,082
At least for that reason
let me go please

1156
01:52:43,162 --> 01:52:44,282
So what?

1157
01:52:44,843 --> 01:52:46,883
You are a subscriber too, man

1158
01:52:54,323 --> 01:52:55,884
Don't hurt me please

1159
01:53:10,645 --> 01:53:13,045
"He's going to eat you alive"

1160
01:53:13,166 --> 01:53:17,085
"I am a bird of prey waiting to eat you
Feather-man who got into you head to toe"

1161
01:53:17,166 --> 01:53:18,886
"Pakshi Raja"

1162
01:53:18,926 --> 01:53:22,285
You will meet your end in this way,
a fate worse than ordinary death

1163
01:53:22,326 --> 01:53:23,606
"Pakshi Raja"

1164
01:53:35,127 --> 01:53:40,007
In just 5 seconds, 70,000 people
were killed in Hiroshima

1165
01:53:40,048 --> 01:53:41,847
Till date that was the world record

1166
01:53:42,368 --> 01:53:45,128
Today...80,000 men and women

1167
01:53:45,167 --> 01:53:46,287
A new record!

1168
01:53:48,727 --> 01:53:52,169
You are going to be part
of a historic moment

1169
01:53:52,208 --> 01:53:53,927
Dear subscribers!

1170
01:54:01,569 --> 01:54:03,209
Dear subscribers

1171
01:54:03,289 --> 01:54:04,450
Don't panic

1172
01:54:04,529 --> 01:54:06,688
You are not the ones
who are about to die

1173
01:54:12,609 --> 01:54:14,490
A small bird

1174
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:18,970
What are you looking at Pakshi?

1175
01:54:19,011 --> 01:54:20,130
I am Chitti

1176
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:21,450
Reloaded

1177
01:54:21,891 --> 01:54:23,250
Version 2.0!

1178
01:54:31,411 --> 01:54:33,132
Doctor, is that you?

1179
01:54:33,491 --> 01:54:34,811
Did I shoot you?

1180
01:54:35,012 --> 01:54:36,331
Did I try to kill you?

1181
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,772
My God! I was about
to commit a grave sin

1182
01:54:38,812 --> 01:54:40,732
Doctor, please don't harm me

1183
01:54:40,812 --> 01:54:42,292
You are my creator

1184
01:54:42,492 --> 01:54:44,492
Don't rip me apart with your own hands

1185
01:54:44,533 --> 01:54:45,892
Forgive me and let me go

1186
01:54:45,933 --> 01:54:46,932
Please

1187
01:54:46,972 --> 01:54:48,012
Fat hopes!

1188
01:54:49,492 --> 01:54:50,813
Vasi...!

1189
01:55:36,935 --> 01:55:38,417
Come, you selfie bots!

1190
01:55:39,176 --> 01:55:41,177
I will set your screens on fire

1191
01:55:48,258 --> 01:55:51,337
"I bow down to like, no man
I bow down, I say, 'no damn' "

1192
01:55:51,537 --> 01:55:54,617
"I stand tall, alone I stand
I cow down like, 'No man' "

1193
01:55:54,658 --> 01:55:56,698
"Are you ready?
Take a shot"

1194
01:55:56,738 --> 01:55:58,057
"I am the only one"

1195
01:55:58,097 --> 01:56:01,179
"There is no comparison
'cos I am Super Super one"

1196
01:56:01,218 --> 01:56:03,499
"I'm out to get you
Let ya wreck ya self"

1197
01:56:03,538 --> 01:56:04,978
"See me coming out"

1198
01:56:05,019 --> 01:56:08,098
"10000 fighters by my side
I'm about to shoot 'em down"

1199
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:15,259
"I'm the only one you see"

1200
01:56:16,899 --> 01:56:18,419
Zero balance!

1201
01:57:01,142 --> 01:57:02,903
Shoot that sparrow

1202
01:59:36,899 --> 01:59:39,139
Hey bird man!

1203
01:59:42,059 --> 01:59:43,821
Iron man!

1204
01:59:44,139 --> 01:59:45,900
I'm just a driver
Let me go

1205
02:00:23,427 --> 02:00:24,587
Pakshi!

1206
02:00:24,667 --> 02:00:26,788
You had better scatter
and scoot from here

1207
02:00:26,868 --> 02:00:29,708
Otherwise I'll pluck
every single feather out

1208
02:00:32,589 --> 02:00:34,430
You moron of a machine!

1209
02:00:34,509 --> 02:00:37,389
Why are you fighting
for these ungrateful men?

1210
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:40,990
When you've served their purpose
they will rip your nuts apart!

1211
02:03:45,022 --> 02:03:46,704
Hey! What's happening?

1212
02:04:05,907 --> 02:04:07,907
Yayayay...angry bird!

1213
02:04:08,707 --> 02:04:09,947
Why are you staring?

1214
02:04:09,987 --> 02:04:11,227
I am Kutti!

1215
02:04:11,308 --> 02:04:12,548
The microbot

1216
02:04:12,588 --> 02:04:14,628
Version 3.0

1217
02:04:15,988 --> 02:04:18,549
If you disturb my boss
your dove will be

1218
02:04:18,588 --> 02:04:19,749
Dodo!

1219
02:04:20,669 --> 02:04:23,790
"I am Isaac Asimov's grandson, buddy"

1220
02:04:23,830 --> 02:04:27,150
"I am a warrior, size of a turkey berry"

1221
02:04:33,752 --> 02:04:37,033
"O bird of prey
You're a goner, I say"

1222
02:04:37,152 --> 02:04:40,273
"It's 'Festival of lights' for us today"

1223
02:04:42,074 --> 02:04:44,674
It is said a bird can look
in 6 different directions

1224
02:04:44,754 --> 02:04:46,754
Pakshi, won't you see?

1225
02:05:02,916 --> 02:05:03,876
Microbots

1226
02:05:10,239 --> 02:05:11,358
No...no

1227
02:05:11,518 --> 02:05:13,238
Hey! Don't do this

1228
02:05:21,361 --> 02:05:23,441
Maintain that same panic

1229
02:05:28,202 --> 02:05:30,283
"Birdie got caught-o?"

1230
02:05:30,802 --> 02:05:31,682
Bow bow

1231
02:05:31,722 --> 02:05:33,202
"Feathers fell apart-o?"

1232
02:05:33,243 --> 02:05:34,323
"3.0"

1233
02:05:34,803 --> 02:05:36,763
"Swarmed all over you?"

1234
02:05:41,123 --> 02:05:44,846
Pakshi, if you breach this stadium
with your radiation

1235
02:05:44,885 --> 02:05:47,924
...1st victims will be
only your birds!'

1236
02:05:59,607 --> 02:06:01,208
Microbots, go

1237
02:06:03,768 --> 02:06:05,289
"3.0"

1238
02:06:10,610 --> 02:06:11,850
"3.0"

1239
02:06:33,814 --> 02:06:36,974
"I am a cannon 6" tall
You're a radish, that's all"

1240
02:06:37,054 --> 02:06:40,255
"I am an automated masterpiece
I tricked you with zetabyte-ease"

1241
02:06:40,335 --> 02:06:43,775
"I am the evil mosquito Ranguski
Ready to send you to the cemetery"

1242
02:06:43,815 --> 02:06:47,335
"Itsy-bitsy, I'm snuff powder heady
I'm into your nostril, deal with me"

1243
02:06:50,336 --> 02:06:53,176
A lion can't touch a mosquito, big birdie!

1244
02:06:53,377 --> 02:06:56,978
But if mosquitoes set their minds
they can chase the lion to its doom

1245
02:07:00,699 --> 02:07:02,059
Cuckoo!

1246
02:07:12,221 --> 02:07:13,620
Good job, 3.0

1247
02:07:15,061 --> 02:07:16,220
Thank you, commander

1248
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:18,181
- Microbots positioned?
- All set

1249
02:07:18,741 --> 02:07:19,822
Pakshi

1250
02:07:23,703 --> 02:07:25,182
Have a blast!

1251
02:08:07,989 --> 02:08:10,150
Should these doves also explode?

1252
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:13,471
Hey beep
Follow me

1253
02:08:14,711 --> 02:08:16,272
Come on, bots

1254
02:08:32,234 --> 02:08:35,235
"O eagle, you're a goner, I say"

1255
02:08:35,275 --> 02:08:38,556
"It's 'Conquest of good over evil' today"

1256
02:08:38,676 --> 02:08:41,956
"Bird of prey
It's a jolly day"

1257
02:08:41,997 --> 02:08:45,157
"You are a guest in hell any which way"

1258
02:08:45,236 --> 02:08:48,717
"People's favorite
'Podimas' minuute"

1259
02:08:48,758 --> 02:08:51,638
"If I burst, it will be a wrecker
like a boom-boom cracker"

1260
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:53,959
Hey! Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1261
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:54,960
This is restricted area

1262
02:08:54,999 --> 02:08:55,959
Get out!

1263
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:06,470
You are the reason
we are alive today, Vaseegaran

1264
02:10:06,910 --> 02:10:09,870
What an enormous risk you've taken
and saved all of us!

1265
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:11,950
Technology saved us

1266
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:15,820
But we are the ones
misusing technology

1267
02:10:16,660 --> 02:10:19,220
We should eliminate poverty
with the help of technology

1268
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:20,640
Eradicate diseases

1269
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:21,980
Promote education

1270
02:10:22,180 --> 02:10:26,780
If we use it for personal comforts and
fuelling our greed, it's only doomsday

1271
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:30,210
Will...will that Pakshi Rajan reappear?

1272
02:10:32,250 --> 02:10:34,050
He is dead and gone

1273
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:38,090
But if we continue this way
another 'evil force' will erupt

1274
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:41,890
Even if Pakshi Rajan's actions were wrong

1275
02:10:41,970 --> 02:10:43,720
...there was truth in his words

1276
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:47,800
If human beings should live on earth
birds should also co exist

1277
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:51,000
Control radiation

1278
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:53,000
Reduce networks

1279
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:59,190
Pass a rule, no technology should affect
any living thing, human, bird or beast

1280
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,710
This earth doesn't belong only to us

1281
02:11:01,950 --> 02:11:06,150
Everyone should realize it belongs
to all the living creatures here

1282
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:08,070
You are right

1283
02:11:08,190 --> 02:11:10,020
Ensure birds are not destroyed

1284
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:15,140
At least provide water for birds
to drink during our scorching summers

1285
02:11:16,740 --> 02:11:19,380
That's enough to refresh
and revitalize your minds

1286
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:21,860
All this will happen, Vaseegaran

1287
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:24,530
I'll bring this to the notice
of our Parliament

1288
02:11:24,690 --> 02:11:27,050
I'll make sure this happens

1289
02:11:28,010 --> 02:11:29,490
Thank you, Vaseegaran

1290
02:11:33,690 --> 02:11:34,850
Thanks, Nila

1291
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:36,850
Why are you thanking your shadow?

1292
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:40,880
Oh God!

1293
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:43,360
We have to remove
that red chip from Chitti

1294
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:44,560
Don't worry, boss

1295
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:48,720
To be on the safe side I activated it
after doing an auto-eject program

1296
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,710
Smaaart!

1297
02:11:58,470 --> 02:12:00,590
Good to see you alright, doctor

1298
02:12:00,790 --> 02:12:02,070
Me too, Chitti

1299
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:06,300
Doctor, all the robots and I have to report
in the headquarters at Delhi today

1300
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:08,140
Can I leave, doctor?

1301
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:13,460
Take Nila with you

1303
02:12:19,930 --> 02:12:21,930
Doctor, how can I leave you like this and-

1304
02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:23,490
I can take care of myself

1305
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:25,050
'Respect for love?!'

1306
02:12:26,130 --> 02:12:27,250

1307
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:33,160
