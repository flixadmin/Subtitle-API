1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,480
<i>Bad guys in this town are changing.</i>

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,640
Hi.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Welcome, everyone.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,760
The world sees criminal lunatics.
I see brilliance.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,000
Theo Galavan,
the new mayor of Gotham!

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,880
- No! Mother.
- Any last words?

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,200
I'm going to kill you.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,600
{\an5}They're gonna pay for
what they've done.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,600
Hello, Jim. Please step aside.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,120
This is the name of the man
who killed your parents.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,280
- You're under arrest.
- No! Tell me who killed them!

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,560
Hello, sleepyhead.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,160
My mother was a saint!

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,400
A man with nothing to love is free.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,560
Silver is bad news, Bruce.

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,000
What are you doing? Stop!

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,480
Malone! It's Malone. That's the name.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,760
Goodbye, Silver.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,880
Bruce, you can't do this.
It isn't you.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,320
That's what you think...
but you're wrong.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,480
You're right about my uncle.

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,520
He's everything everyone says.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,800
I don't know how bad it's gonna get.

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,440
There is no line.
There's just the law.

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,880
Jim, you see an abyss
and you run toward it.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm pregnant.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,320
We need every method at our disposal.

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,320
If there was ever a time for us
to work together, now is that time.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Gotham needs him dead!

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,440
Think of the greater good.

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
Think of Gotham.

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,880
Goodbye, Jim Gordon.

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
After searching the premises,

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,440
I, along with Alfred Pennyworth
and Selina Kyle,

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,680
was able to locate the abductee,
Bruce Wayne.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,800
Where was he?

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,320
Theo Galavan's residence.

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,200
- That's when you opened fire?
- Yes.

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,680
We eliminated the threat posed
by Father Creel and his men

40
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,720
and were able to recover Bruce Wayne.

41
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,320
Sacrilege!

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
You then left to search for Galavan
on your own?

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,280
That's correct.

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,600
- Did you find him?
- Yes.

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,680
Theo Galavan, you're under arrest.

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,200
- Did you detain Galavan?
- No.

47
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,520
Why not?

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,240
Captain Barnes
and Officer Vargas arrived

49
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,560
and placed me under arrest.

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
Jim. Jim!

51
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Put your gun on the ground

52
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,040
and put your hands on top
of your head.

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,560
That's because at the time of this
incident, some four weeks ago,

54
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,960
you were a fugitive from the law.

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
That was a misunderstanding.

56
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
What happened next?

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,000
Oswald Cobblepot
and two of his associates arrived,

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,040
rendered Officer Vargas
and Captain Barnes unconscious.

59
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,440
Cobblepot and his associates escaped
with Galavan.

60
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,400
Are you 100 percent sure

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,760
that he won't beat this
and walk free again?

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,480
You then pursued Cobblepot
and his men, correct?

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,920
Yes, but I was unable to locate them.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,760
You're a man of conscience, Jim.

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,040
You'll regret this.

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
I have many regrets.

67
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
This won't be top of the list.

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,640
At which point you decided
to flee the city

69
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,520
before law enforcement
could question you?

70
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,240
Yes. For that, I have no excuse,
other than to say...

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,600
I was concerned for the safety
of my fiancé.

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,760
She had informed me earlier
that day that she was pregnant.

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,000
Congratulations.

74
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,560
Thank you.

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
Detective Gordon,

76
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,280
within hours of your encounter,

77
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,080
Theo Galavan was found beaten
and shot to death.

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,080
Were you present
at the time of his murder?

79
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,240
Well, here we are.

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,880
No, I was not.

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,600
Do you have any information
regarding the case

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
that you have not shared with us?

83
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,680
This is for my mother.

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,880
No, I do not.

85
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,400
Detective,
did you have anything to do

86
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,840
with the murder of Theo Galavan?

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,600
Detective, answer the question.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,760
Were you involved
in Theo Galavan's murder?

89
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,920
No, I was not.

90
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,480
Charges are lifted.

91
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,280
I'm cleared of all wrong-doing
and reinstated.

92
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,240
I knew they would see sense.

93
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,480
I didn't.

94
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,640
You told the truth.
What choice did they have?

95
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Yeah.

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,320
Are you sure this is what you want?

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,480
After everything
this job has put us through?

98
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,800
Positive.

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,800
- Then what's wrong?
- Nothing. Long day.

100
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,160
Promise?

101
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,520
Promise.

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,800
- Barnes.
- Dent.

103
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,920
- Captivating story.
- Yes, it was.

104
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,880
Do you believe him?

105
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,400
I believe your investigation
has found no evidence

106
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,880
of criminal wrongdoing.

107
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,880
Careful. You're starting
to sound like a lawyer.

108
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,400
Any leads on Cobblepot?

109
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,920
His men have deserted him.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He's all alone.

111
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,680
It's only a matter of time
before we find him.

112
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,880
<i>It's now day 27 of the manhunt
for the crime lord Oswald Cobblepot.</i>

113
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,280
<i>GCPD officers continue
to comb the city</i>

114
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
<i>in search of the man they say</i>

115
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,280
<i>killed controversial mayor
Theo Galavan in cold blood.</i>

116
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,600
<i>With public enemy number one
on the lam, the question remains,</i>

117
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
<i>just who is running
Gotham's underworld?</i>

118
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,520
Take him away.

119
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,160
Hello, Butch.

120
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,920
Hey.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
How you doing?

122
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,200
Your security stinks.

123
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,560
People are usually trying
to get out of this place, not in.

124
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
Why so glum?

125
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,240
- You're the king of Gotham now.
- I'm not glum.

126
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,800
I'm just... thinking.

127
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,600
I got a lot of responsibilities.

128
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,000
Not as much fun
as you thought it'd be, huh?

129
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,320
What do you want, anyway?

130
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,440
You got a lot of nerve showing up
after what you did to me.

131
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,040
Is that your mean face?

132
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,360
What are you gonna do?

133
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,080
Kill me?

134
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,640
Maybe I will.

135
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,000
What I did for you, Butch,
is make you a free man.

136
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,880
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't be king.

137
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,920
I bet that was your plan all along,
huh?

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,920
You're just that fond of me.

139
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,760
Strangely enough,
I am kind of fond of you.

140
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,240
I mean, normally, I go for handsome,
intelligent men, not brutes, but...

141
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,080
you have an amazing...

142
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,920
animal vitality about you.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,560
- I'm smarter than I look.
- Oh, you must be.

144
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,280
A funny lady.

145
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
What do you really want?

146
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,160
I wanna be your partner in crime.

147
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Lonely, huh?

148
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,800
You and I would make a good team.

149
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm not looking for a relationship
right now.

150
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,240
Honeybun, look at me.

151
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,720
We have history.

152
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,800
And you and I both know,
deep down in your heart,

153
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,960
that whatever I want, you want.

154
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,280
<i>All units, all units,</i>

155
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,080
<i>Reported armed abduction near
the 300 block of Kearny Avenue.</i>

156
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,480
<i>Any and all available officers
in the area, please respond.</i>

157
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,080
GCPD!

158
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,640
Is there a problem, officer?

159
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,680
There's been an abduction
in the area.

160
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,320
How awful.

161
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,720
Have you seen anything tonight?

162
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Anything out of the ordinary?

163
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
No. Can't say that I have.

164
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,560
- Do you live in the area, sir?
- Not far.

165
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
What's your address?

166
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,400
Well, what I mean to say,
I used to live in the area.

167
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I moved.

168
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,120
Would you open the back of the van,
please, sir?

169
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,120
Sure thing.

170
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
Happy to.

171
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,520
What the...

172
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,520
Somebody get me a glass of water!

173
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,040
{\an5}Hey! Mitch, separate those two.

174
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,360
{\an5}It's a good thing you're here.

175
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
{\an5}Caught a weird one last night.

176
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,480
{\an5}That's it?

177
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,600
{\an5}No hug? No kiss? No welcome back?

178
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,480
{\an5}You don't deserve these lips.

179
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,960
{\an5}Way I see it, you finagled yourself
a month-long,

180
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,400
{\an5}paid vacation, you bastard.

181
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,840
{\an5}Besides,
Captain's pressing me on this case.

182
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,480
{\an5}Oh, yeah? What is it?

183
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,720
{\an5}You didn't hear?

184
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,600
{\an5}Last night, some psycho froze a cop.
To death.

185
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,960
Froze her?

186
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,600
{\an5}Yeah. Told you it was weird.
Come on. Nygma's waiting for us.

187
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
{\an5}Frozen.

188
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
{\an5}Interesting.

189
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
{\an5}It took nearly five seconds to freeze
this rose using liquid nitrogen.

190
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,120
{\an5}- So?
- Well so, it'd take a human body

191
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,360
{\an5}significantly longer, depending on
mass and body fat, of course.

192
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,680
{\an5}So why would a cop stand around
for hours waiting to get frozen?

193
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,160
{\an5}She wouldn't.

194
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,520
{\an5}Which means your suspect wasn't using
liquid nitrogen.

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,640
{\an5}He was using supercooled
liquid helium.

196
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,560
{\an5}It's one of the most effective
substances in the world

197
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,200
{\an5}for rapid temperature reduction.

198
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,280
{\an5}This liquid helium,
where do you get it?

199
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Why do you need it?

200
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,800
He doesn't, dummy.

201
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,600
{\an5}He just wants to know
where it comes from

202
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,560
{\an5}so we can track down the guy
that blasted our colleague with it.

203
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,440
I don't like being called names,
Detective.

204
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,040
{\an5}Easy, Ed.

205
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
{\an5}I'm sure
Harvey was just being colorful.

206
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Yeah.

207
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,440
{\an5}I was just being colorful, Ed,
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,680
It's extremely rare and expensive.

209
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,680
Can't imagine there's more than one
or two producers in Gotham.

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,240
I could research manufacturers,
if you would like.

211
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,000
That's be really nice. Thank you, Ed.

212
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
- You coming?
- Give me a minute.

213
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,680
Listen, Ed, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

214
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,360
- Penguin.
- Yes.

215
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,200
You want to know the nature
of my relationship with him.

216
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,600
- Yes.
- Because you're concerned

217
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,440
I aided and abetted a known criminal.

218
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,640
Did you?

219
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,920
I found Mr. Cobblepot wounded
and dying in the woods.

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,400
I nursed him back to health.

221
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,520
He owed me his life which is why
I trusted him

222
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
when he said he had changed his ways.

223
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,280
It was an innocent mistake.

224
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,280
Got him! We got him!

225
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,040
Wonder what that is.

226
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,520
Silence!

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,480
What are you, a
bunch of cheerleaders?

228
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
This is not a game.

229
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,440
This is our job.

230
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:37,760
And this... specimen,
this is just one sad, pathetic skell.

231
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,840
There are plenty of scumbags
out there.

232
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,560
Plenty.

233
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,640
So stop waving your pom-poms
and go catch some.

234
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,240
Yeah, stare all you want.

235
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,880
Big whoop.

236
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,640
- You got me. I'm cool.
- Get in there!

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,560
It's all good.

238
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,360
- I said I'd catch him, and I did.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,000
Now we'll learn the truth of
what really happened to Galavan.

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,720
All right, Cobblepot.

241
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,920
Tell me what happened at Galavan's
that night.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,400
Well... A lot of things happened.

243
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,200
Why don't you start with the moment

244
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,120
right after you knocked me out
with that vase.

245
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,320
I'm sorry for that.

246
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,800
Such an exquisite vase.

247
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,400
This is my amused look.

248
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,560
Keep talking.

249
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,520
I took Galavan to the river
and I killed him.

250
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,120
Slowly.

251
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,160
- You confess to murder?
- Yes, I do. Proud of it.

252
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
I'm not a criminal, you know.

253
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,320
I'm just... insane.

254
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,400
- What did James Gordon do?
- What did he do when?

255
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,280
What did he do
after you knocked me out?

256
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,720
What does he say he did?

257
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,520
I'm asking you.

258
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,840
You have something you wanna tell me?

259
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,120
No, sir.

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,320
Cobblepot backed your story.

261
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,200
You mean, he told the truth.

262
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,400
Yeah.

263
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,120
That's what I'm gonna choose
to believe.

264
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,080
It's the right thing to do.

265
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,800
- Good to have you back.
- Good to be back, sir.

266
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,720
Jim, I'm trusting you.

267
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,600
Don't make a fool out of me.

268
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,680
Yes, sir.

269
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,680
I was having a dream about you.

270
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,080
We were at that little red cabin
by the beach. Remember?

271
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,400
I remember.

272
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,880
Six summers ago.

273
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
You looked like a movie star.

274
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,280
- You look tired.
- Work.

275
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,160
How's it coming?

276
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,120
Good. Good.

277
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,680
Slower than I'd like, but good.

278
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,240
Tell me.

279
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,680
I'm having trouble with reanimation.

280
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,680
I need to find the correct ratio
of liquid helium

281
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,800
to glycerol cryoprotectant.

282
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,360
Now tell me what that means
in English, honey.

283
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,800
It means I can freeze you,
like we planned.

284
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,120
I can bring your temperature down
to 200 degrees below zero,

285
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,880
and I can stop this disease
from killing you.

286
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,080
But?

287
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,560
I can't bring you back.

288
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,520
Not yet.

289
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,760
But I will.

290
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,120
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,040
No, it's not that.

292
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,840
I'm just thinking of all those poor
mice you're experimenting on.

293
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,120
They don't feel anything.

294
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,800
I just need more time.

295
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,240
- A little more time.
- Hey.

296
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,320
I'll find a way. I promise.

297
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,480
- Got some good news and bad news.
- Good news.

298
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,840
Nygma did some digging and found
one company in all of Gotham

299
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,080
that makes liquid helium.

300
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
- Wayne Enterprises.
- That's the good news?

301
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,960
It's not, but I thought bad news
and more bad news

302
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
didn't have the same ring.

303
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
What's this?

304
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,960
Three abductions in the past month,
all tied to a blue van,

305
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,200
same as our suspect's.

306
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,560
Three abductions?

307
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,160
- They find any of them?
- Not a one.

308
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,680
Which makes you wonder what's
this guy doing with all those people?

309
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,920
Nora?
I'm going to work for a few hours.

310
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,200
- Knock if you need anything.
- Okay.

311
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,520
- Ed?
- Don't look at me.

312
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,960
I'm not supposed
to be talking to you.

313
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,040
You doing okay?
You look kind of funky.

314
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,080
I confess I've felt better.

315
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,840
Is there anything I can do to help?

316
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,160
I'm beyond help.

317
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,000
Forget me, my friend.

318
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,680
But, if you would take care of my
mother's grave, I'd be very grateful.

319
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
If you'd visit occasionally...

320
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,080
- Tell her I'm thinking of her.
- I will.

321
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,760
She likes lilies.

322
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,360
Occasional visits, lilies, check.

323
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,680
Thank you.

324
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,760
On your feet, Cobblepot.

325
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,520
What's going on?

326
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,040
- Where are you taking me?
- Arkham.

327
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,520
You are insane, right?

328
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,880
It is now Thursday, February
21st, 3.44pm.

329
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,800
Test subject 014 is in his 40s,

330
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,120
appears to be in good health,

331
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,000
and shows no signs of damage
sustained during Vitrification.

332
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,160
I'm now ready to commence
the reanimation experiment.

333
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,320
You are correct.

334
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,000
Wayne Enterprises
does manufacture liquid helium.

335
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,040
For years it was used as part
of our cryogenics program.

336
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Cryo-whatics?

337
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
It's the branch of physics
dealing with the production

338
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,800
and effects of extremely
low temperatures.

339
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,520
My understanding is that there were
some promising experiments

340
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,920
being carried out in the program.

341
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,040
But, alas, it was shut down.

342
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,920
When was that?

343
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,680
Two or three years ago.

344
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,040
Thomas Wayne killed it, along
with a few other odd programs.

345
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,440
Any idea why?

346
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,680
No idea.

347
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,160
It was all kept very quiet.

348
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,600
- Thanks, Lucius.
- Detectives.

349
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,840
Penguin pie!

350
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,960
There seems to be some confusion.

351
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,960
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

352
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,480
Many of you, no doubt,
will have heard of me.

353
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,320
Some of you, clearly, have not.

354
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,200
For those poor ignorant souls,
I offer illumination.

355
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
I am not a man to be trifled with.

356
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,400
Oh, no.

357
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,840
I am powerful.

358
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,120
I am vicious.

359
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm King of Gotham.

360
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,720
I am King of Gotham!

361
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,760
I'm the King of Gotham!

362
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
I am! I am!

363
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,600
Look at me!

364
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,720
I'm the King of Gotham!

365
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,880
I'm King! I'm King!

366
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,000
Here ye, here ye!

367
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,400
The subject's core temperature
is now 39 degrees.

368
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,640
We are approaching
the critical threshold.

369
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,200
41 degrees!

370
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,640
We hit 41 degrees.

371
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,080
Solution A14, I knew it would work.
I knew it.

372
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,040
Yes, yes, yes.

373
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,400
No.

374
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,280
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

375
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,000
Not again, please. Not again, no. No.

376
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,600
Nora?

377
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,480
Breathe, Nora. I'm right here.
Look at me.

378
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,600
Where's the formiterol?

379
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,840
That was the worst one yet.

380
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,440
That was the last pill.

381
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Why didn't you tell me?

382
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,520
I'm sorry. I forgot.

383
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,800
I have so many.

384
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,560
So many.

385
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,120
If you have another attack

386
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,320
and you don't have this medication,
you could die.

387
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,040
You can't let this happen again,
Nora.

388
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
Why?

389
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,160
Does it matter?

390
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,080
It matters.

391
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,680
I'll be back.

392
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
I need to get this refilled.

393
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,160
- Next.
- I need to get this refilled.

394
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,560
- Do you have the prescription?
- I have the bottle.

395
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,040
That's not the same thing, is it?

396
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Please. I just need it refilled.

397
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,160
The original prescription doesn't
have a refill order.

398
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,480
If it doesn't have a refill order
I can't refill it.

399
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,160
This medication is for my wife.
She's sick. She's in pain.

400
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,720
Everyone that comes in here is sick
or in pain.

401
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,880
Have your doctor write a new
prescription, then I can refill it.

402
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,400
Just give me the medication.

403
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,480
No.

404
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,360
- You son of a bitch!
- Get out!

405
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,760
Get him out of here!

406
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,120
Get out of here
before I call the cops, you kook!

407
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,280
You shouldn't have done that.

408
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,640
I'll be back.

409
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,320
Goodbye, Nigel.

410
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,600
Oh, and remember what I told you.

411
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,320
See no evil.

412
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,280
Do no evil.

413
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,600
Yes, sir. I will.

414
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,520
Mr. Cobblepot.

415
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,400
My name is Hugo Strange.

416
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,640
Chief of Psychiatry here
at Arkham Asylum.

417
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,960
Please come in.

418
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,560
You're not listening.

419
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,920
Maybe you should get a new
hearing aid while you're here.

420
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,400
Hey!

421
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,200
- Formitorol. Now!
- Oh, okay. Okay.

422
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,520
Take it all.

423
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,360
Please, don't kill me. Please.

424
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,800
I'll do anything you want.

425
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,000
You and your friend here...

426
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,520
are going to help save my wife.

427
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,680
No! No!

428
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,080
Excuse me!

429
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,200
Going to need some help out.

430
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,120
Yeah?

431
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,560
Our guy just hit a pharmacy on ninth.

432
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,560
That's it. Just slide him in there.

433
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,480
Hey, careful.

434
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,440
Blue van.

435
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,000
Go, get out of here.

436
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,400
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- I got it, I got it!

437
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down!

438
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,280
What is this, anyhow?

439
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,560
Am I being punished?

440
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,520
Oh, no.

441
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
I make it a point
to meet all new inmates.

442
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,320
It's part of the intake protocol.

443
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,360
Though I will ask you to refrain
from making speeches atop

444
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,400
cafeteria tables in the future.

445
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,640
I'll do my best.

446
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,960
How has your adjustment been so far?

447
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,320
Fine, I suppose.

448
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,560
Oh, come now, Oswald.

449
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,680
Periods of great transition can bring
on great stress.

450
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,080
Surely, this must be a traumatic
experience for you.

451
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,400
Please.

452
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,000
This is a pillow fight compared
to what I've been through.

453
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,400
Yes.

454
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,960
I have read of your tribulations
of late.

455
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,080
Attempts on your life,
having to survive being a fugitive...

456
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,840
The death of your mother.

457
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,680
Troubled times.

458
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,920
Is that your clinical diagnosis?

459
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,840
I know that if
I were in your position,

460
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,320
I would be feeling some
strong emotions.

461
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,240
Anger, grief, regret, even.

462
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,240
For what?

463
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,240
The murder of Theo Galavan.

464
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,440
My mother died in my arms
because of Galavan.

465
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,560
The only thing I regret is that
I couldn't kill him more than once.

466
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,960
I see.

467
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,960
Perhaps we could pick it up
right there next time.

468
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,600
I so look forward
to our work together.

469
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,040
And don't worry.

470
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,840
Here at Arkham, we have a number
of intensive treatment programs.

471
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,720
I am more than confident

472
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,000
that we'll be able to facilitate
your rehabilitation.

473
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,840
My what?

474
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,000
Rehabilitation.

475
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,920
That's why you're here, after all.

476
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,840
To be cured of your sickness.

477
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,040
You are sick, aren't you?

478
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,880
Victor?

479
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Victor?

480
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,080
Victor?

481
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,200
Honey?

482
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,240
You down here?

483
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,480
Victor?

484
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
My God!

485
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,720
Oh, my God!

486
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,840
Oh, my God!

487
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,880
- Surveillance system wasn't even on.
- What's that?

488
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,040
Some witnesses saw our guy
throw this at the pharmacist.

489
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,040
It's probably
his prescription bottle.

490
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,400
Fries, Nora Fries. His wife, maybe?

491
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,080
Yeah, maybe, but it's "Fries."
What do you mean?

492
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,480
- It's pronounced "Fries."
- How do you know?

493
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,040
- I'm really good with names.
- Yeah, whatever.

494
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,200
There's an address on here.
Come on, let's go.

495
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,640
GCPD, we have a search warrant!

496
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,120
Ma'am, don't move.

497
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,080
Holy moly.

498
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,200
He told me they were mice.

499
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,960
Get her out of here.

500
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,840
Ms. Fries.

501
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,520
Nora.

502
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,040
You all right?

503
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,520
Nigel?

504
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,360
See no evil, do no evil.

505
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,080
See no evil, do no evil.

506
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,480
- No, no.
- See no evil, do no evil.

507
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,000
We need to find your husband, Nora.

508
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,880
Before he hurts someone else.

509
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,440
I was asleep.

510
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,360
I woke up when I heard him leave.

511
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,640
That's all I can tell you.

512
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,480
If you don't cooperate,

513
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,120
we'll be forced to charge you
with obstruction of justice.

514
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,320
You're going to jail, Nora.

515
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,360
You get that, right?

516
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,600
My husband did terrible things.

517
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,760
But he did those terrible things
for my sake.

518
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm dying.

519
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,520
He wants to save me.

520
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,680
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

521
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,080
But I can't betray him.

522
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,080
Oh, one more thing.

523
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,760
What's the correct pronunciation
of your last name?

524
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,280
It's Fries.

525
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,520
Fries. Thank you.

526
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,200
Told you.

527
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,840
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, what can I help you with?

528
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,120
I'd like to speak
with Detective Gordon, please.

529
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,800
What for?

530
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,400
I'd like to make a confession.

531
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,800
I'm the man
that's been freezing people.

532
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,160
You too, huh?

533
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,760
That makes five in one night.

534
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,360
Must be a full moon.

535
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,120
Tell you what.

536
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,160
Why don't you have a seat
with the others.

537
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,560
Detective Gordon will be out
in a minute.

538
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
No, no. You don't understand. I'm...

539
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,280
Oh, I understand. Have a seat.

540
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,720
Am I dead?

541
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,120
Hello?

542
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,960
Hello?

543
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,720
Am I dead?

544
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,280
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
- Take it easy, come on! Down!

545
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,440
A-16.

546
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,920
It worked.

547
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,480
Go get a blanket!

548
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,520
I can't believe it worked.

549
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,720
All right. I got him.

550
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,600
You?

551
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,760
You!

552
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm coming for you, Nora.
I'm coming to save you.

553
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,000
New inmate Oswald Cobblepot

554
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,240
exhibits signs of extreme narcissism
and megalomania.

555
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,400
Also seems to have
had a rather unhealthy relationship

556
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,040
with his deceased mother.

557
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,440
Treatments will include immersive
aversion therapy

558
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,960
and radical psychotropics.

559
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,960
How are we this evening, Ms. Peabody?

560
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,080
Busy.

561
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,280
The formaldehyde pump
in silo F needs replacing.

562
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,840
Our young lady arsonist refuses to
co-operate with our experiments.

563
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,280
And I had to reschedule your
appointment with Councilman Carter.

564
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,720
- Again?
- It's the third time.

565
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,480
- How very rude.
- Indeed.

566
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,320
And there's this.

567
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,920
Seems someone has solved the problem
of post-cryonic reanimation.

568
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh, nonsense!
I'm still years from solving that.

569
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,880
Fascinating.

570
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,040
Do you realize what this could mean
for our program?

571
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,080
- Who is this man?
- His name is Victor Fries.

572
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,200
But the newspapers have already
given him a nickname.

573
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,800
Hello, Mr. Freeze.
