Very possibly.

Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

(DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE)

490
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,930
WOMAN: But there has to be a price
to pay for everything.

491
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:58,433
MAN 1: I know, but have you tried
telling him that?

492
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,895
(CHATTER CONTINUES)

493
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,192
Thank you.

494
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,405
MAN 2: Who'd go there after what
happened to that Kingsguard?

495
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:12,698
MAN 3: Probably had it coming.

496
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,241
MAN 2: Maybe so, but I'm not risking it.

497
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,118
MAN 3: Just can't do it.
MAN 2: All right.

498
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,328
WOMAN: Honesty as well. He gets it.

WAIF: Are you listening, blind girl?

501
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,630
Do you hear them talking?

502
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,842
Do any of them talk to you?

503
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:33,969
No.

504
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,638
So sad.

505

(COINS JANGLE)

00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:46,064
- (GROANS)
- Stand and fight, blind girl.

507
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,401
I can't see.

508
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,445
That's your problem, not mine.

509

(POUNDING)

518
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,446
Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.

519
00:44:17,656 --> 00:44:19,533
We are both anointed knights.

520
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:22,828
Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.

521
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:27,916
I will grant amnesty to all brothers
who throw down their arms before nightfall.

522
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,586
And you, Ser Davos,
I will allow you to travel south

523
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:34,422
a free man with a fresh horse.

524
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:37,551
DAVOS: And some mutton.

525
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:39,803
I'd like some mutton.

526
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:40,887
What?

527
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,973
I'm not much of a hunter.

528
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,519
I'll need some food
if I'm gonna make it south without starving.

529
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:53,233
We'll give you food.

530
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:56,278
You can bring the Red Woman
with you if you like.

531
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,448
Or you can leave her here with us,
whichever you choose.

532
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:05,203
But surrender by nightfall
or this ends with blood.

533
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,623
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

534
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:12,878
We'll discuss amongst ourselves
and come back to you with an answer.

535
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:31,146
Boys, I've been running
from men like that all my life.

536
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:35,567
In my learned opinion, we open that door...

537
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,027
And they'll slaughter us all.

538
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,487
They want to come in, they're gonna come in.

539
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,781
Aye, but we don't need to
make it easy for them.

540
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:43,658
Edd is our only chance.

541
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:46,494
It's a sad fucking statement
if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

542
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,040
There's always the Red Woman.

543
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,834
What's one redhead gonna do
against 40 armed men?

544
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:57,005
You haven't seen her do
what I've seen her do.
