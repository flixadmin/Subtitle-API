1
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:06,341
Your tea's ready, babe.

2
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:07,424
Aw.

3
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:12,263
I can't thank your aunt enough
for taking care of Jenna.

4
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:15,725
I now am left with some free time
to look after my lady.

5
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,435
Aw. Loving that.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,022
But are you sure
I'm not distracting you?

7
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,607
You look like you got a lot going on.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,444
Well, I thought
that [sighs] when I left the force,

9
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:29,822
that I would dig into
Kristen Kramer's background.

10
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:33,117
You know, see what she wants
with this city's metas,

11
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,453
since she's replaced me as captain.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,831
And look,
everything I've dug up so far

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
looks like this.

14
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:40,999
[Cecile] Hmm.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,628
I actually have something for you.

16
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:47,966
So, one of my pro bono clients
is a meta who's also an army vet.

17
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:51,052
I was prepping for his deposition,
and I came across a name

18
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,762
I think you might find interesting.

19
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,597
- Kristen Kramer?
- Yep.

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,186
This says they served together
at Fort Dakota,

21
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,855
but her DODs doesn't say that.

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,440
Maybe it's an oversight?

23
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:08,069
Or it could be that she doesn't want
anybody to know that she served there.

24
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:11,197
If these files are still around,
they're here.

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,450
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

26
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:15,618
Good luck.

27
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:17,954
[chuckles]

28
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,038
[door opens]

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,583
[door shuts]

30
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:39,892
[screaming] Help!

31
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:42,270
Somebody help me!

32
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:45,189
Let me out!

33
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,067
Please!

34
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,902
[sobbing]

35
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,823
Somebody help me.

36
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,260
Wow.

37
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,137
This is new.

38
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:20,850
Uh, frack. Was I supposed to ask
before I changed everything?

39
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,519
Because, look, I kept
the pinball machine.

40
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,481
Oh. And Frost is going to love that.

41
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:31,778
It's just, I've never seen this room
without all of Cisco's stuff in it.

42
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,072
Which I totally understand.

43
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,323
I'll tell you what,

44
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:40,078
it ain't no thing, I can take all
my junk back to my garage, and then...

45
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,079
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,538
Slow down, Chester, okay?

47
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:43,790
I just said it's different.

48
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:45,750
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

49
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,588
And look, S.T.A.R. Labs is your lab,
and we want you to feel at home here, too.

50
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,005
[exhales]

51
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:57,054
Thank you for saying that, because it
took a very long time to set up

52
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,971
these stealth audio speakers.

53
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,393
[upbeat music playing]

54
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,729
Wow.

55
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:09,899
Whoo!

56
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,654
Come on, girl. Get your groove on.

57
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:16,197
Oh, no, I have two left feet.

58
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,990
No worries. I will teach you the basics,

59
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:21,661
which I might add,
I learned from building robots.

60
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
Amazing.

61
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,289
You know what I think we need?

62
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,334
I think we need
some more [louder] bass up in here.

63
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,171
[static crackling]

64
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,425
I said... I think...

65
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,385
Just... one sec.

66
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,432
I said, I think we need
some more bass up in here.

67
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,642
Oh!

68
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,437
[clears throat]

69
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:51,983
Uh...

70
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:53,943
Not to worry.

71
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:57,572
We have a replacement cable
just like this one in the Starchives.

72
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,157
LB, shelf 52.

73
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,660
Wow, you're inventorying
the Starchives as well.

74
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,704
Cisco really did leave us in good hands.

75
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,290
Well, learned from the best.

76
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:10,668
Now, don't go anywhere,
because when I get back

77
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,379
our dance lesson shall commence.

78
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,467
[singing] <i>Our dance lesson
shall commence, ah, ah</i>

79
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,054
[scatting]

80
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,314
Oh, who put you down here, little fella?

81
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,193
You're supposed to be...

82
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,319
[clanging]

83
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,446
Hello?

84
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,619
[whispering]

85
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,163
Anybody there?

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,124
Hey, Chester.

87
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,918
- Hey, man.
- How you doing?

88
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,628
I'm... I'm fine.

89
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:56,047
Yeah. What are you doing down here?

90
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,843
Hey, Chester.

91
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,513
- Iris.
- Hey, it's me.

92
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,225
What are you...
What are you... Wait.

93
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,812
If you're down here
and he's down here then...

94
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:12,771
That would mean...

95
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:15,066
- No man. No. No.
- Oh, my.

96
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,443
- We were just...
- Um, cataloguing.

97
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:18,653
- Yeah, cataloguing.
- See?

98
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,946
Hmm.

99
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,781
Your hair... Your hair's kinda...

100
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:27,328
Um, I have that call I was telling...
That work call I was telling you about.

101
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,497
So I'm gonna go do that, okay?

102
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,582
- You boys have fun. Okay, bye.
- Okay.

103
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,251
[muttering]

104
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,377
[exhales awkwardly]

105
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:38,631
- Hey.
- Hey.

106
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:42,802
Sorry about this,
but, you know, after everything

107
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,138
that happened with the Forces, Iris
and I, we've decided to start trying...

108
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:49,809
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, cool.
Nice, bro. Nice, cool, cool.

109
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,370
- Yeah, well...
- I don't need to know.

110
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,455
- I don't need to know. We good, man.
- All right, cool.

111
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,939
Yeah, actually, that's Cecile.

112
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,025
She needs help
with a case, so I should go.

113
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,109
Cool, cool. Yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,031
Cisco, you did not warn me about this.

115
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,034
Oh.

116
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,621
So, what do you think?
Does my client have a case?

117
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:15,042
I mean, as you know, the state says
your meta client Erik Frye

118
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:18,296
used his pyro kinetic powers
to burn the building.

119
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,715
But CSI has found butane at the scene.

120
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,634
So, obviously
seems more like human arson.

121
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,137
Hmm. Sounds like reasonable doubt to me.

122
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,221
Great work, Barr.

123
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:31,976
Yeah. This case,
does it feel familiar to you?

124
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:35,938
Didn't you defend
someone like this a few years ago?

125
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:38,648
Whoa.

126
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,192
Hey. Are you okay?

127
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,404
I don't know,
I feel numb all of a sudden.

128
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,201
What's the matter, Barry?
Getting ill?

129
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,538
I can't see. Cecile.

130
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:55,541
- What are you doing to me?
- Getting you out of the way.

131
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,629
I have a plan, Barry Allen,
and you need to be gone for it to work.

132
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:03,257
Oh. One more thing. I'm not Cecile.

133
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,392
[distorted voice]
Your mind belongs to me now.

134
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,096
So just let go.

135
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,768
[panting]

136
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:17,939
What the hell?

137
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:20,482
[Cecile] Barry.

138
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,862
Is it really you?

139
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,079
I don't know what happened.

140
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:37,041
One second, he was helping me with
a case, and the next he just passed out.

141
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,211
Barry's brain waves are oscillating
at 0.5 hertz,

142
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,339
which is typical of a coma patient.
Look with EEG picked up.

143
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:47,385
It appears to be some sort of
psychic neurofeedback signal.

144
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,638
I think that's what's causing
this brain activity,

145
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,032
but I've never seen anything like it.

146
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,433
If Barry's brain activity
stays like this

147
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,394
he could be comatose
for the rest of his life.

148
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,648
We need to figure out
who did this and fast.

149
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,483
Okay, and how do we do that?

150
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,485
Well...

151
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,488
This may be a long shot, but...

152
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,534
What? Me?

153
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:13,743
Oh.

154
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,039
Yeah, I would love to try,

155
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:20,668
but, guys, I'm just an empath.

156
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,462
Cecile, if you use your powers
on Barry's brain,

157
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,215
you'll be able to sense
if there's someone else's emotions

158
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,717
that are active within his mind.

159
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,593
Chester's right. It could work.

160
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,889
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

161
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:38,852
[Cecile exhales]

162
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,400
Barry's emotions... I can't sense them,

163
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,362
but I can feel something else.

164
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:52,867
Something cold, like madness.

165
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,774
I can see something now,
I can see something... It's a...

166
00:08:57,038 --> 00:09:01,333
It's like a light in the middle
of all of that darkness shining,

167
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:07,131
glowing gold? Like a golden mask?

168
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,384
Sweet Ira Cooper.

169
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,930
Folks, I think I know who did this.

170
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:23,064
So, Cecile, the mask that you saw,
did it look like this?

171
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,277
Mm.

172
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:33,199
- Psycho Pirate. I knew it.
- Roger Hayden?

173
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,786
He was a patient at Arkham Asylum
who we fought.

174
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,370
He claimed that he got psychic powers

175
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:40,539
from a mask he stole
from the Kahndaqi embassy.

176
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:44,251
But no one believed him
because he was certifiably insane.

177
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,796
I don't get it. Why would Hayden
go after the Flash?

178
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,924
He didn't. He is at Arkham.
But the mask isn't.

179
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:53,844
It says here that after the breakout,
Arkham returned the mask to the embassy.

180
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,971
But then they donated it
to the Central City Museum.

181
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:58,516
It's going on display tomorrow,

182
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,809
as a part of an exhibition.

183
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,479
Okay. They have no idea just
how dangerous this thing really is.

184
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,235
According to legends,
the warrior Gilgamesh

185
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,821
used the gold mask to imprison
a powerful demon,

186
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:15,616
or what we might consider today
as an ancient psychic meta-human.

187
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,785
Over the centuries,
the mask has popped up

188
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,205
all over the world,
the Yoruba tribe in Africa,

189
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,834
17th-century pirates,
all the way up to Hayden.

190
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:28,129
Now, the story goes,
if you wear the mask,

191
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,424
it doesn't just give you powers.
It feeds off of your mind,

192
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:36,720
leaving you insane and leaving the mask
in search of a new wearer.

193
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:39,765
A psychic parasite
moving from host to host.

194
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:42,184
And now it found a brain
that's capable of speed thinking.

195
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:44,937
So it's the mask that's attacking Barry.

196
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,689
But Barry's not wearing the mask.

197
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:51,026
No, the neurofeedback signal must be
the mask trying to start feeding.

198
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,880
And now that it's touched something,
it'll just keep feeding and feeding

199
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,173
until it gets rid
of all the brain waves.

200
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,867
What about the cerebral inhibitor
that you guys used on DeVoe?

201
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,953
That would stop the signal
and get Barry's brain functioning again.

202
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,539
But we'd need the mask here to do that.

203
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:12,423
[sighs] It's too bad you can't just grab
the mask from the museum, huh?

204
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,428
Why can't we?

205
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,309
Cecile?

206
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,060
[Cecile sobbing]

207
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,770
Are you okay?

208
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,899
I don't know. I don't know.

209
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:32,026
I'm so happy to see you.

210
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,110
It's okay.

211
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,779
I'm gonna get you out of here.

212
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,489
Wherever here is.

213
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,059
Do you have any idea where we are?

214
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:45,456
The last thing I remember is, I was...

215
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,043
I was at home with Joe
and there was a storm.

216
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,586
[thunder crashing]

217
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,052
<i>And then I woke up.</i>

218
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,386
[exclaiming]

219
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,222
<i>And I was locked in this room.</i>

220
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,765
[panting]

221
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,936
Cecile, the force storm
was two weeks ago.

222
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:08,854
What?

223
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:11,273
Have you been
in here this whole time all alone?

224
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,986
Barry, I don't think there is any way
out of this place.

225
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,696
Then we have to make one.

226
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,160
Before I got here,
I thought I was talking to you.

227
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,956
I think whoever trapped us here took
over your body.

228
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,250
Who could do something like that?

229
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,252
I'm not sure.

230
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,336
I don't know.

231
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,839
Bashir, maybe, but

232
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:39,176
Bashir's on our side now,
so I don't think this was him.

233
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:50,437
I don't have my powers.

234
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,897
[exhales]

235
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,653
When I was in Grodd's mind,
he trapped me in one of his old cages.

236
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:02,908
If this... If this is a mindscape

237
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,870
like that was,
maybe this asylum is a memory.

238
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,959
But whose memory is it?
And why trap us here now?

239
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,252
[door opens]

240
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:15,795
[door creaking]

241
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,591
Has that ever happened?

242
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,634
No.

243
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,558
Okay. All right, we have to see
if there's a way out of this place.

244
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,976
Wait. Barry, wait.

245
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,170
Your powers aren't working.
What if it's not safe out there?

246
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,647
What if...
What if it's not safe...

247
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,984
and what happens if we die
in a mindscape?

248
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,361
Then we die in real life, too.

249
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,114
But we're not the only ones
in danger here.

250
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,951
Whoever took over your body
could hurt Joe or Iris.

251
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:50,122
All right, look, if there's any chance
we can escape, we have to take it.

252
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,793
[door creaking]

253
00:13:58,297 --> 00:13:59,297
[exhales]

254
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,766
Barry's still losing brain activity.

255
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,535
How long till we get our hands
on that mask?

256
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,895
Okay, so heists aren't really
my expertise,

257
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:17,316
but Cisco did leave me a number
to call in case of an emergency.

258
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,109
[Sue] It's a good thing, too.

259
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,322
'Cause this one sounds like a doozy.

260
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,460
[Sue] So, the mask goes
on display tomorrow.

261
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,713
But for tonight, it's on lockdown
in Central City Museum's

262
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:42,216
state-of-the-art restoration lab.

263
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,428
Hermetically sealed and protected
by a laser security grid system

264
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,765
that's sensitive enough
to detect a dust mite.

265
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,433
Which is nothing I can't handle.

266
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,769
There is one snag, though.

267
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:59,191
The museum just installed
a bleeding-edge Montgomery 5000 vault.

268
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,568
It has a passcode
that changes every day.

269
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,113
The only person that knows that code
is the security guard.

270
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,281
Hold up.

271
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,990
Cecile.

272
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:08,951
Huh?

273
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:12,246
You could put some kind of
empathic whammy on him.

274
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,957
You know, like, get into
the guard's noggin with your powers.

275
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,459
I'm not a mind reader, Chester.

276
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,711
Okay, but...

277
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:26,885
But maybe if I get close enough
to the guard, I could try...

278
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,513
transferring my emotions into him,

279
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:35,018
making him anxious enough
to want to open the vault door for us.

280
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,060
But no...

281
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,313
No, it's way too risky.

282
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,274
Look, I am a lawyer.
I am not a cat burglar.

283
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,317
There's no way I can pull that off.

284
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,611
Uh, yes, you can.

285
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,532
I know you, Cecile. You're just as brave
and as capable as the rest of us.

286
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:52,244
Look, all you need to do is follow Sue
in after you disable the lasers, right?

287
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,327
Mm-hmm.

288
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:55,538
[exclaims]

289
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,195
Joe is never gonna believe this.

290
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,002
Okay, then.

291
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,965
I'm definitely gonna need a better
outfit for breaking and entering.

292
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,089
Feeling pretty confident, huh?

293
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,725
Oh, I am now.

294
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:15,994
You planned that heist so fast,

295
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,896
you made Dom Toretto in <i>Fast Five</i>
look like Dom Toretto in <i>Fast One.</i>

296
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,734
About that, is there anything
about this whole situation

297
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:29,031
that seems kind of,
I don't know, odd to you?

298
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:33,035
I mean, we ID'd our target an hour ago
and we've done zero recon.

299
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,329
It's Heist 101.

300
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,289
You think it's almost too easy.

301
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,710
Okay, look, ever since I got here,
I've been training my butt off

302
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,337
for craziness exactly like this.

303
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,547
Okay, so, I've done my homework.

304
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:46,673
I've checked the math.

305
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,718
Heck, this isn't even the first time
I've helped save Barry's brain.

306
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,429
Team Flash just makes it look easy.

307
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,014
We got this.

308
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:55,848
If you say so.

309
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,107
You know, we got this.

310
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,320
Yeah. Yeah, we got this.

311
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,912
Okay. Looks like
security just switched shifts.

312
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,498
Ilsa Faust, you are good to go.

313
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,215
[grunts]

314
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:33,594
I'm in.

315
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,222
[Chester] <i>How's it looking?</i>

316
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,349
Well, I'll know in a second.

317
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,948
[Chester] <i>Oh, those
are some serious lasers.</i>

318
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,199
Oh, this is nothing.

319
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,868
You should see
what Ralph and I faced in Tunisia.

320
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,369
[beeps]

321
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,474
[classical instrumental music playing]

322
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,286
[beeps]

323
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:40,787
Lasers are clear.

324
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,998
You learned that in Tunisia?

325
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,375
No. DeMatteis Academy of Dance.

326
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:47,876
She's good to go.

327
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:48,878
Yeah!

328
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,047
Okay. Oh.

329
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,006
[grunts]

330
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,848
I remember why I hate rock climbing.

331
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,182
You're doing great.

332
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,980
Let's find that security guard
and get in there.

333
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,788
All these doors are locked.

334
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,249
I think we should try another floor.

335
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,336
No. It's a one-story building.

336
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,630
I think that we should just double back.

337
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,422
[whooshing]

338
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,469
What was that?

339
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,845
Barry, don't.

340
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,263
It's okay.

341
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,058
Come on.

342
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,441
What is that?

343
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,653
That's our way out.

344
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,614
I've seen portals like this before.

345
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,825
We go through there, we're home-free.

346
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,705
[maniacal laughter]

347
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,373
[maniacal laughter]

348
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,749
What the hell?

349
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,293
- Barry, we gotta go.
- Hold on.

350
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,628
Hello?

351
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:15,841
Are you okay?

352
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,429
Please forget her.
We gotta get out of here.

353
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,805
Something's not right.

354
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:23,806
Who are you?

355
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:25,600
Are you trapped here too?

356
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,102
Barry, let's go.

357
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,353
Hey.

358
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,981
We can help you.

359
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,317
[gasps]

360
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,319
[laughs maniacally]

361
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,699
[distorted voice]
Have a nice day, Barry.

362
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,782
Cecile...

363
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,540
[laughs maniacally]

364
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,084
[machine beeps rapidly]

365
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:22,199
No, I've got to make sure
everything is still there.

366
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,663
[lock beeps]

367
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,589
[grunts]

368
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,758
Vault's secured.

369
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,011
[Iris West] Okay. Be very careful.

370
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,430
Until we get that mask secure
in S.T.A.R. Labs,

371
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,140
<i>consider it dangerous.</i>

372
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,146
[Caitlin]
Guys, we've got a serious problem.

373
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,024
I was reading two brain signals,
Barry and the mask.

374
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,943
But now there's a third.

375
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,986
But how is that possible?

376
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,947
The mask is already
feeding off of Barry.

377
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,698
Must be targeting someone else.

378
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,327
There's something I've been trying
to dig up. For a case.

379
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:11,039
It's too bad you can't just
grab the mask from the museum, huh?

380
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:12,749
Oh, my God.

381
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,968
<i>Sue, that's not Cecile.
You need to get out of there, now.</i>

382
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,977
[distorted voice]
A mortal weapon against the likes of me?

383
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:33,770
Pathetic!

384
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:34,937
Stop it!

385
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,565
No!

386
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:42,112
Okay. This is gonna suck.

387
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:51,872
Since time began,
many have tried to stop me.

388
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,498
All have failed.

389
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:54,749
Cecile, this isn't you.

390
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,585
Let our friends go or we'll make you.

391
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,295
Such hubris.

392
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,506
And from the boy who delivered
everything I needed.

393
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,008
<i>How amusing!</i>

394
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,886
Now my host shall serve me.

395
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,013
For eternity.

396
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,437
I'm up. I feel great. I feel amazing.

397
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,023
No, no, no. You're not going anywhere.
Not for a little while.

398
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,483
Okay, fine.

399
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,653
Since when does Cecile
have that kind of power?

400
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,737
She doesn't.

401
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,950
It was the mask.
That was the voice inside of our heads.

402
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,618
She was possessed.

403
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,037
Just like Hayden and all the others
before him.

404
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,997
Okay. When did all this happen?

405
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,333
During the force storm,
we thought Cecile was hit

406
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,126
by the Sage Force lightning.

407
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,337
But it must have been
the psychic spirit of the mask

408
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,714
that used that as a cover
to take over her mind.

409
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:45,508
Now they're both missing.
We've no idea where they are.

410
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,952
- Or what they are up to.
- [Iris West] We have to find her.

411
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,263
That mask is the only link
to helping Barry

412
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,682
and figuring out what happened
to the real Cecile.

413
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,059
Look, the legend says

414
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,687
that the mask gives the wielder
enhanced psychic powers.

415
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:01,483
So, maybe if we track
her neurological signals...

416
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:05,612
And how 'bout we let someone else
come up with a plan for a change.

417
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,090
Sue, Chester was just trying to help.

418
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,284
Yes, so was I. When I told him
that this job seemed too easy.

419
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,119
But he brushed me off.

420
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,705
And I shot a tranq into my own neck.

421
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:17,706
She's right.

422
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:19,917
This is on me.

423
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,754
Chester, that thing tricked all of us.

424
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,255
But you heard what it said.

425
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,924
It put Barry in that coma,

426
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:30,804
just like Grodd did to play me
and zing my insecurities as the new guy.

427
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,932
It knew I'd pick Psycho Pirate
out of that binder,

428
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,267
and call Sue to help us
break into that museum.

429
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,561
All to make me think
I had this all figured out.

430
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,525
I really... I didn't know jack.

431
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:51,992
Oh, thank God.

432
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,075
You're okay.

433
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,611
That thing that attacked me...

434
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,540
That was you. How is that possible?

435
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,542
I don't know.

436
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,628
Cecile, you said there wasn't
a second story.

437
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,939
There's no way you could know that
unless you've been here before.

438
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,512
You know exactly
where we are, don't you?

439
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,059
We're at St. Carmine's
Psychiatric Hospital

440
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,811
just outside of Houston, Texas.

441
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,982
Where I was a patient.

442
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,871
My first year in law school,

443
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:38,954
I, uh...

444
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,085
I got a job interning
at the DA's office.

445
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,629
It was so fulfilling.

446
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,174
I was working 'round the clock.

447
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,010
Even when my mom got sick.

448
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,183
And when we found out
that it was cancer, she said,

449
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,020
"Cece, don't worry about me.

450
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,691
You keep working. I can feel myself
getting better already."

451
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:12,489
I was in court when I got the call.

452
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,037
She died all alone, Barry.

453
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,918
She died alone because of me.

454
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,629
Cecile.

455
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,799
And after that, I couldn't eat,
I couldn't sleep.

456
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,805
Couldn't stop hating myself.

457
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:45,105
And I just spiraled into anxiety
and depression.

458
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,903
And I had a breakdown
and I ended up in here.

459
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,657
<i>Most days I'd just wander those halls,</i>

460
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,618
I'd spend all night lying awake,

461
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,663
staring at that ceiling,
thinking about my mom.

462
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,416
And when I finally
checked out, I was so...

463
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:09,838
ashamed and afraid

464
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,591
<i>that all of that darkness
was gonna catch up to me again.</i>

465
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:14,675
<i>And so I...</i>

466
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:19,764
I told myself...

467
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,644
"Toughen up. Toughen up.

468
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,104
That's it. Smile.

469
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,108
And pretend like this never happened."

470
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,528
And that is exactly what I did.

471
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,738
You hid all that pain but...

472
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,533
It never went away.

473
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,453
I carry it with me every day.

474
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:45,999
Cecile...

475
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,129
I'm never gonna know what it was like,

476
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:52,964
for you to go through all this.

477
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,259
But I know what it's like to lose a mom.

478
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,803
But to blame yourself for it,

479
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,724
even when it's not your fault,

480
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,020
makes you want to take that pain,
and bury it under a mask.

481
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,813
Away from the people you love.

482
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,233
But masks don't heal wounds,

483
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:14,903
they only hide them.

484
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,697
Facing those wounds
can be scary as hell,

485
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,074
but it's the only way to start healing.

486
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,452
What if I can't do it?

487
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:26,789
You can.

488
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,542
I know it.

489
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,635
Maybe that's our way out of here.

490
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,429
This is your memory.

491
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,724
That thing
is just amplifying your fears,

492
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,185
when the door opened before,
what were you thinking about?

493
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,646
The truth about my time here.

494
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:50,896
But...

495
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,193
Barry, I'm thinking about it right now,
nothing is changing.

496
00:28:58,238 --> 00:28:59,405
You sure about that?

497
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:02,742
If you face this,

498
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,912
if you can confront your past,

499
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,748
I believe you can get us home.

500
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,710
Okay.

501
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:16,089
[Iris West] Hey, you okay?

502
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,550
Yeah, I need more neuro-fiber
to fix the memory machine,

503
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:21,803
so we could use it
like we did against Grodd.

504
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,973
But we don't have enough supplies here,
so I've got to go back to my garage.

505
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,433
I shouldn't be here, anyway.

506
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:29,894
Wait. Chester.

507
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,940
Yes, you should, Chester.
I mean, this is...

508
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,694
- It's your lab.
- No, Iris.

509
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,196
- It's not.
- What?

510
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,367
Look, I didn't come to S.T.A.R. Labs
to replace Cisco.

511
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,494
I came here to work with him.

512
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,957
And I want to do a good job
more than anything,

513
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,294
but when I saw Barry in trouble today...

514
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,755
Iris, I didn't even know where to start.

515
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,882
I thought to myself, you know,

516
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:01,884
"What would Cisco do?"

517
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:07,849
Decided I'm gonna act confident,
and brave, and...

518
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,894
act like I had it all figured out.

519
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,062
[scoffs]

520
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:16,774
Chester.

521
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:22,322
Confidence isn't what made Cisco Cisco.

522
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:23,740
I know.

523
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,702
What made Cisco Cisco
was the connections,

524
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,996
and the love that he had for you all.

525
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,289
Don't you get it?

526
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,376
I don't have those bonds, Iris,

527
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,045
I barely know you guys.

528
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,298
I can't help but think that if I just

529
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,342
knew Team Flash a little bit better,

530
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:46,012
then I would have been able to figure
out that that wasn't the real Cecile,

531
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,263
and then this entire thing...

532
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,765
Okay. Okay.

533
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:54,103
Chester, Cisco didn't form
these bonds overnight. It took time.

534
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,688
It took patience, and...

535
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,441
we all have your back,

536
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,276
just like we know that you've got ours.

537
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:02,986
Thanks.

538
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,991
And look, Iris, I promise, hey,

539
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,661
from today on, I'm really gonna up
my game, and I'm gonna, like...

540
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,627
I think I know

541
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,212
where psycho Cecile was going.

542
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,589
Look, back at the museum,

543
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:26,344
the mask said, it wanted Cecile
to be its host for eternity.

544
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:30,264
But the legend says that once the mask
feeds on the host's mind,

545
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,058
it moves on to another.

546
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,018
So, if Cecile's an empath

547
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,479
then maybe
that makes her a stronger host.

548
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,148
Not strong enough.
She would need something

549
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,609
to amplify her mental abilities.

550
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,736
To create a permanent food source.

551
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:46,322
Okay, so where do we find
a device like that?

552
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,283
In our basement.

553
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:04,924
At last, the key to permanence.

554
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,561
[Caitlin] Barry's about to experience
complete brain death.

555
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,104
Please tell me we have a plan.

556
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,523
We think the mask is trying
to use The Thinker's chair

557
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,942
to create a permanent bond with Cecile.

558
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,320
[Chester] Well, frack.
She's already there.

559
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,024
[Iris West] How the hell
are we gonna stop this thing?

560
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,701
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy.

561
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,202
Crazy works sometimes.

562
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,013
It's just, I don't know
if it's the best idea.

563
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:39,542
Look, Chester, if you believe
that it will work, then I do, too.

564
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,043
Okay.

565
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:47,633
This is where the portal was before.

566
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:49,886
That's our only way out.

567
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,021
What's happening to this place?

568
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,494
You can't leave here.

569
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:19,582
You belong here forever!

570
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,259
Barry!

571
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,805
And this time,
you're never checking out.

572
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,651
Who dares avoid my gaze?

573
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:55,867
I do.

574
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,017
You can't trap me in here.

575
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,520
This is my mind, not yours.

576
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:25,856
Ooh! So brave!

577
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,986
But you weren't so brave for Mommy,
were you, Cecile?

578
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,366
Don't you remember?

579
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:40,621
Your mommy dying alone
in a hospital bed,

580
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:42,915
calling out for her only daughter,

581
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:47,044
"Where is she? Where is my sweet Cece?"

582
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:51,924
[panicked breathing]

583
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,609
I can sense the faith
you have in yourself.

584
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:11,861
It's the faith of a fool!

585
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:23,372
You cracked once,
and you will crack again.

586
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:29,670
And then, you'll be a psycho,
just like me.

587
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:33,758
I used to think that,
I used to think that, too.

588
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,843
I was so afraid of losing myself,

589
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,346
that I hid a piece of me away.

590
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:44,769
But I am not ashamed of it anymore.

591
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:00,409
So go ahead. Try and scare me.

592
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:05,247
But I know exactly who I am,
and I am done wearing a mask.

593
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,546
[screaming]

594
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,054
[screaming]

595
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,699
Barry, Barry, the portal.

596
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:48,582
Barry, you're okay?

597
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:50,959
Cecile.

598
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,132
[gasping]

599
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:57,675
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

600
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,093
It's me. It's me. It's me.

601
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,771
So, what happens
with that crazy mask now?

602
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:14,442
Yeah, Caitlin's taking it to A.R.G.U.S.
with an armed escort,

603
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:16,068
as we speak, she's going to help Cisco

604
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:18,446
retrofit a vault there
with mental dampeners

605
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:22,283
that will keep the mask
from finding more victims.

606
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,870
So, Sue, I'm sure you can't wait
to get out of here, huh?

607
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:26,995
All right.

608
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:30,583
Relax, Chester.
Iris explained everything to me,

609
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:33,669
and I am sorry that I was so harsh.

610
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:38,048
I guess getting whammied
makes me grumpy.

611
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,221
As for my next move, Ralph is
still busy, and I did miss Central City,

612
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,557
so, I think I'm gonna stick around
for a while.

613
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,477
I'm staying at the penthouse suite
at the Lily Hotel.

614
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:53,189
Nightcaps and a late dinner
on my terrace? My treat.

615
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:54,814
- Yes.
- Yes.

616
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,025
Yes.

617
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,860
Yeah? All right. See you there.

618
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:00,612
[Cecile] Um...

619
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:02,822
Hey, Barry.

620
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:07,929
You know, if it weren't for you,

621
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,033
I probably never would have
gotten out of that place.

622
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:11,956
No.

623
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,461
It was all you,
and I knew you could do it.

624
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,589
But I'm not the only one
that believes in you.

625
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:20,799
I know.

626
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:24,637
I should probably go home
and talk to Joe.

627
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:27,473
Few things I should tell him.

628
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,391
Tell Sue rain check?

629
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,475
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

630
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,145
Chester, you coming?

631
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,815
I mean, I know you're more
of a root beer kind of guy,

632
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:37,418
but you've earned a victory meal, too.

633
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:38,608
Really?

634
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:44,865
Even after falling for the wrath of some
omnipotent, psychotropic, immortal mask?

635
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:50,704
You know, after saying it out loud
and hearing it back, I'm kinda, like,

636
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:53,082
you know... Yeah, count me in.

637
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:57,503
Chester, you are a full-fledged
member of Team Flash now.

638
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,630
Your voice will always matter here.

639
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,216
Just, make sure you use it.

640
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:04,510
Yeah. Okay.

641
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:09,682
With that being said,
there is just this tiny thing

642
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,476
that I wanted to talk to you both about.

643
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,018
Yeah, what's up?

644
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:18,315
Okay, so, you know, the next time
you guys want to, you know...

645
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,400
Oh...

646
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,861
Yeah, please, I'm just, you know...
Take a day off.

647
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:24,154
Maybe, go on vacation.

648
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,340
- Totally. We hear you.
- We should.

649
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,532
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool. Yeah.

650
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:27,867
- Cool.
- Bye.

651
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,285
Yeah, bye.

652
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:44,049
[Joe] Babe, I had no idea.

653
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,552
Why didn't you tell me this before?

654
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,807
I didn't want you to see me differently,

655
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,643
or think that I was weak.

656
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,562
Oh, Cecile.

657
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:01,859
I know what it's like in our community.

658
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:08,240
There's sometimes a shame in asking
for help when it comes to mental health.

659
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:16,206
With what our families go through
on top of everything else in this world,

660
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,544
[exhales]

661
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:24,924
it could crush us, but we need to start

662
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:29,345
taking good care of ourselves,
and that's just what you did.

663
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:32,640
So don't apologize, just know...

664
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:39,229
that I will always be here for you.

665
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:45,945
And we will get through this,
or anything, together.

666
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:53,869
- Love you.
- I love you.

667
00:40:57,414 --> 00:41:00,334
Hey, whatever happened
with Fort Dakota?

668
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:05,089
Yeah, you weren't the only one
wearing a mask.

669
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,384
There's a reason that Kristen Kramer

670
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,844
wants this part of her past
to stay buried.

671
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,766
Kramer's last army mission,

672
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:23,732
she was in command of a squad sent in to
take out several strategic facilities.

673
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,317
She never completed the mission.

674
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:29,238
She led them into an ambush.

675
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,324
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, there's more.

676
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,871
She was the only one that survived.

677
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:39,706
Cecile,

678
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,128
I think Kristen Kramer
was working with the enemy.
