3
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,403
Look at the stars,
whenever you feel alone,

4
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:15,950
the great kings of the past
will always be prepared to guide you.

5
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,161
And so will I.

6
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:40,869
My friends, the time of
my family's growth is upon us.

7
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,456
This home we share is the
fulfillment of my father's vision.

8
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,710
How wonderful is it
that Nala and I get to continue

9
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,213
his dream and make
even greater the circle of life.

10
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,931
Nala my love, I'm on my way.

11
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:42,972
Nala, I'm here.

12
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,934
I'm here.

13
00:03:49,479 --> 00:04:01,908
Security detail has arrived.

14
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,744
One gentle reminder, we are not food.

15
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,536
No, no, no, no, no.

16
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,207
We are just two guys walking to
work through a pride of hungry lion.

17
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,918
Which is perfectly
normal, I'm not terrified.

18
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,048
Security detail reporting
for due to your grace, your highness.

19
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,175
Ruler of all four legged creatures.

20
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,803
And that one three legged zebra.

21
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,679
Oh right, Ron.

22
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,763
That was tragic.

23
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,889
It was an Eden Ron.

24
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:25,306
Yeah.

25
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,684
Ron has three legs,
that's the one more than me.

26
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,935
Well, are those arms or legs?

27
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,311
I don't know, I think they're paws.

28
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,980
I consider all those legs.

29
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,231
Guys, this is serious.

30
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,233
I need you to stay
with Kiara until I get back.

31
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:41,739
Are you saying that your security
detail has been called on to do babysitting?

32
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,993
Pumba, we should really discuss
this because I don't really love children.

33
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,120
Guys, I promise her
everything would be okay.

34
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,663
Well, that's one way to parent.

35
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,580
You're gonna have to grow up sometime.

36
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,873
What else did you tell her?

37
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,625
That she could be
whatever she wants to be?

38
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,334
That life is fair?

39
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,837
I need you two to try
and act like adults, okay?

40
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,047
Don't scare Kiara.

41
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,507
And most of all, no stories.

42
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,216
No stories?

43
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,009
Wait a second.

44
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:01,926
I know where your head goes.

45
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,678
I grew up with you two. Promise me.

46
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,220
Okay, you know what?

47
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,679
You know what?

48
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:05,263
Fine.

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,723
No stories.

50
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,266
Speak for yourself, Pumba.

51
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:08,474
No.

52
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:08,975
Shh.

53
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,268
We'll tell a story anyway.

54
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,145
Okay, well, Tom,
we're not gonna tell a story.

55
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:12,937
We're never gonna tell a story.

56
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,438
Are you serious?

57
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,565
I'm clearly within earshot.

58
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:15,773
Dad.

59
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,695
Hey, little one.

60
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,158
Dad, the storm's coming and I'm scared.

61
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,784
I want to go with you and Mom.

62
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,536
Well, don't be scared, my love.

63
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,580
Timon and Pumba will
watch you while I'm gone.

64
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,373
Be brave now, Kiara.

65
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,083
Be brave.

66
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,131
Okay!

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,758
We've prepared a story!

68
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,012
Sky looked at us.

69
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,930
He knew it was the end of the line.

70
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,974
I could smell the fear.

71
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,226
That was actually me, but yes.

72
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:13,289
So you two defeated
Scar and then you ate him?

73
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,458
Honestly, one of
the best meals I ever had.

74
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,502
My dad told me he defeated Scar.

75
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:21,005
Well, okay, but your dad, as
we all know, is a pathological liar.

76
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,215
He's always lying.

77
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:22,840
Get it?

78
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,053
I'm scared.

79
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,513
I want Mom and Dad.

80
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,265
Look, look, look,
look, don't be scared, Kiara.

81
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,225
How about...

82
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,268
He sent you a song.

83
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,022
And a what? Pumba, no, it
is way too early for the song.

84
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,065
It worked on Simba.

85
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,900
He thought he had
murdered his own father.

86
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,610
He was singing and
dancing around in seconds.

87
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,613
I can't just turn it on like
that. I have to be in the moment.

88
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,448
He sang that song for six years straight.

89
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,157
Well, who didn't?

90
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,121
It's Ron, the
three-legged zebra. Run for your life!

91
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,664
He didn't even say anything about it.

92
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,082
We're sorry, Ron. They were jokes.

93
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,208
They were just jokes.

94
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,709
It's Rafiki.

95
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,920
Rafiki! Rafiki!

96
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,716
Little one, there's no reason to cry.

97
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,469
My parents, they're gone.

98
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,514
Hey, look out there, Mdugle.

99
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,350
You see those
bough-bough trees blowing in the wind?

100
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,855
The roots of those trees
are very strong, like your family.

101
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,274
And just as they did for you,

102
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,861
your parents have gone to
the ceremony of birth in grounds.

103
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:30,199
And when they return, the circle of
life will bring a blessing to you, Kiara,

104
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,286
that you will never forget.

105
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,620
Man, he's good.

106
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,789
He's such a visual story to him.

107
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,666
Yet it makes sense that he lives alone.

108
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,754
I just want the storm to
pass, and then I promise to be brave.

109
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,632
I tell you a secret.

110
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,260
When your father Simba was your age,

111
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,431
he was afraid of the
thunder and would hide behind the king.

112
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,765
When did he stop hiding?

113
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,228
One day during a big stop, your
grandfather Mufasa took your father to the lake.

114
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,190
He was the very top of Bright Rock,

115
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:06,027
taught him to stand
with him and howl into the wind.

116
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,779
And Simba slowly
stepped out with the king,

117
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,366
and together they roared into the night.

118
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,162
But I'm not brave like my dad.

119
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,748
I could never be like Mufasa.

120
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,750
He's not so.

121
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,421
And maybe it's time I tell you a story.

122
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,216
A story of a cub,
not much bigger than you.

123
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,220
A lion born without a
drop of nobility in his blood.

124
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,140
A lion who would
change over lives forever.

125
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,225
A story!

126
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,060
So glad I brought some presents.

127
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,603
But go easy, we're in a cave.

128
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:45,107
This story begins far
beyond the mountains and the shadows,

129
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,443
on the other side of the light.

130
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,739
In this place,
everything was dying of this.

131
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,202
As twenty-full moons have
passed without a single drop of water.

132
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:02,250
But when the skies
finally opened, destiny would rain.

133
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:32,238
Mufasa.

134
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,284
Mufasa! Come see!

135
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,875
Mom, what is that light way out there?

136
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,420
Oh, that's very special.

137
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,216
Beyond the horizon,
beyond the last cloud in the sky,

138
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,594
that's a place we call "Milele".

139
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,762
Milele?

140
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,265
Well, it means "forever".

141
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:05,229
Imagine a kingdom
full of life, water and food,

142
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,400
grass and sky as far as the eye can see.

143
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,568
Will we ever go there?

144
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,280
Oh, yes, Mufasa.
That's exactly where we're headed.

145
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,199
But we can also be there right now.

146
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:22,455
We can close our
eyes, let our dreams take us.

147
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:35,843
Beyond the horizon,
beyond the last cloud in the sky,

148
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,138
there's a place I know.

149
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:51,901
Imagine a kingdom, the water
flows, the grass and sky as not a dream.

150
00:10:53,235 --> 00:11:02,119
They will grow, call it Milele.

151
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:29,522
We know that there is
nothing wrong, there is always more.

152
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,983
Can you feel it?

153
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:39,281
We'll wander, no
longer, we carry answers.

154
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,452
We'll find a way, can you see it?

155
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,496
And can you see it?

156
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,123
Can you find a way?

157
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:57,258
We'll wander, no
longer, we carry answers.

158
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,075
We will bring Milele.

159
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:37,631
What is this?

160
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,303
Rain, rain! Finally we have rain!

161
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,349
Dad, race it to the light!

162
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:53,856
You're too fast, I've never
beaten you, nobody has ever beaten you.

163
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,483
I know!

164
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,862
Mufasa, fastest cup in the world!

165
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,254
Mufasa, come back now!

166
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,618
Mufasa, stay there! I'm coming, son!

167
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,008
Father! Mufasa!

168
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:13,602
Mufasa! I'll catch you on the turn!

169
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,312
Find my voice!

170
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,273
Find my voice!

171
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,566
Mufasa!

172
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,319
The clippers do have
but you can cross it to them!

173
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:27,449
Come on, Mufasa, you can do this.

174
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:28,659
Find my voice!

175
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:28,867
Mufasa! Mufasa!

176
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,034
Mufasa!

177
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,451
Mufasa!

178
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:30,202
Mufasa!

179
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,245
You can cross it to them!

180
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,539
Come on, Mufasa, you can do this.

181
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,207
Find your mother's voice!

182
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,711
Listen to your
father, Mufasa, listen to us!

183
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,798
Come here, he's there!

184
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,133
Mom!

185
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,092
He's there!

186
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,885
Mother! Mother!

187
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,182
Find your footing one step at a time!

188
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:52,850
I can't!

189
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,643
You can do this, I'm right here!

190
00:15:03,235 --> 00:16:03,295
Mufasa! Mom?

191
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:05,839
Dad?

192
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,634
Can you hear me?

193
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,637
Is anyone out there?

194
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:15,474
Mom!

195
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,560
Please.

196
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,313
Mom, he's there.

197
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,108
Mom, he's there.

198
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,532
The floodwaters joined the distant river,

199
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,411
carried Mufasa far
from his mother and father,

200
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,746
beyond all that he knew.

201
00:16:52,261 --> 00:17:05,733
Mufasa!

202
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,316
Hello!

203
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,194
I'm Taka, son of a barsee.

204
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,112
What's your name?

205
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:10,738
Mufasa.

206
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,365
I'm not allowed to talk to outsiders,

207
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,703
but I have a secret,
and I really want to tell you.

208
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,370
What's the secret?

209
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,455
I'll get in trouble.

210
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,205
Please, just tell me.

211
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,750
I don't know.

212
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,834
Just tell me!

213
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,168
OK.

214
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,961
You're about to be eaten!

215
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,923
I hate secrets!

216
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:32,593
Swim!

217
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,512
You have to swim! I don't know how!

218
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,598
All right, chin up, then walk underwater.

219
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:38,557
Really fast!

220
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:39,892
I can't!

221
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:40,893
Come on, you faster!

222
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:42,227
Faster!

223
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,439
Help me, Taka!

224
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,231
Help me!

225
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,947
[growling]

226
00:17:53,947 --> 00:18:01,705
I told you to wait for me.

227
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,873
It's not my fault, Mum.

228
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,375
I came down for a
drink and saw him floating by.

229
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,960
I'd like you to meet Mufasa.

230
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,589
You're lucky those crocs
were young and afraid to fight.

231
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,340
Let's go.

232
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,300
We can't just leave him here.

233
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,718
Rules are rules, Taka.

234
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,137
Obasi will never accept a stray.

235
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,222
I'm not a stray.

236
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,099
I'm just lost.

237
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:21,934
See?

238
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,311
He's just lost.

239
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,231
There was a flood.

240
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,359
My parents, they tried to save me.

241
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,696
Do you know which way is home?

242
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:36,990
Home.

243
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,619
To be lost is to learn the way.

244
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,454
Call me Eshe.

245
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,914
I'm tired, Eshe.

246
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,250
Come on, it's this way.

247
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,560
Come on, Rufasa.

248
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:17,948
Is this Malaylin? No, my love.

249
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,998
I was trying to nap, Eshe.

250
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,417
The all-important nap of kings,

251
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:33,964
only to be awoken by the
disgusting, hideous, revolting stench of a stray.

252
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,841
Will we come upon an outsider?

253
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,968
Tell me, what do we do?

254
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,178
Obasi, I know.

255
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,971
Eat it.

256
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,973
But I found him, Dad.

257
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,182
I saved his life.

258
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,519
Baka, we do not associate with outsiders.

259
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,397
The only true bond is blood.

260
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,109
I've heard stories
of lions twice our size.

261
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:58,155
These outsiders will
devour everything in their path.

262
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,991
Does he look like
he's going to devour you?

263
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,620
Oh, that smell is disgusting.

264
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,039
I'm not even sure
I could eat this kepete.

265
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:07,956
I'm not a kepete.

266
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,249
I'm a Mufasa.

267
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,335
Do you even know what Mufasa means?

268
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,044
No.

269
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,211
It means king.

270
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,379
And that's me.

271
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,175
You better start
running, little Mufasa, for your life.

272
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,302
If I run, you'll never catch me.

273
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,012
I'm the fastest kapa I ever lived.

274
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,180
My father taught me so.

275
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,682
Oh, Taka, you have a challenge.

276
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,685
They will race to the dead tree and back.

277
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,690
And when the prince defeats
him, I will finish him in one battle.

278
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,233
What if Mufasa wins?

279
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,737
If he wins, he lives, Obasi.

280
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,280
He stays with me.

281
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,240
You have my word.

282
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,453
Let the race begin.

283
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,498
Ooh, clumsy little stray.

284
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,958
Run, Mufasa.

285
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,960
You did not have to do that.

286
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,670
Taka is the future king.

287
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,339
He has to win his first challenge.

288
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,048
No, Obasi.

289
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,342
To be a true king, he must earn it.

290
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,219
Don't take that away from him.

291
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,524
[barking]

292
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,776
[grunting]

293
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,318
I'm sorry.

294
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,615
[barking]

295
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:09,745
[screaming]

296
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:22,841
[music playing]

297
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,761
I have one more secret, Professor.

298
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,139
I always wanted a brother.

299
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,062
[music playing]

300
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:44,905
[laughing]

301
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,157
[laughing]

302
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,492
Zeta! Obasi!

303
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,578
You will keep him with the females.

304
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:56,708
Tucker, how could you lose to a stray?

305
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,754
Well done, Tucker. Well done.

306
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,592
I thought you said you
were fast. I had to let you in.

307
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,677
Well, I did just go
gaze with no sleep, all right?

308
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,180
Anyway, come on, me
fusser. Let's get some trouble.

309
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,182
[music playing]

310
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,169
[music playing]

311
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,199

313
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,361
[music playing]

314
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:36,826
Where'd he go?

315
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:45,168
[music playing]

316
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,880
I always wanted a brother.

317
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:56,638
I still remember my
mother one season after another.

318
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,475
One season after another.

319
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:07,148
Season after season
after season after another.

320
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,527
Who would sing for my brother?

321
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,362
Who would do anything for my brother?

322
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,949
I'll be king with my brother on my side.

323
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,285
I always wanted a brother.

324
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,412
Now we rely on each other.

325
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,122
Season after another.

326
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,291
He moved faster.

327
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,210
His and Tucker are
anxious to the other side.

328
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,131
They're anxious to the other side.

329
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:32,799
[music playing]

330
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,556
(suspenseful music)

331
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,558
Emma, please stand here!

332
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,186
(screaming)

333
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,732
(growling)

334
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,861
(laughing)

335
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,280
Togaro jumped like 20 feet!

336
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,614
Oh, that's a new record!

337
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,783
Obasi, they did it again!

338
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,077
Your sons are nothing but trouble.

339
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,413
That one is not my son.

340
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,457
They're heathens, the both of them.

341
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,918
This stray is
forbidden to be near the shade tree.

342
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,295
Mufos and I were just playing.

343
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,756
You two will never be brothers.

344
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,302
Go back to the
females and stay away from my son.

345
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,556
Oh, your mother, she adopts every lizard.

346
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,059
Speaks to passing grasshoppers.

347
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,352
I want to go with him.

348
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,770
You want to be with the females.

349
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,813
You belong with the males.

350
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,648
He gets to hunt with mother.

351
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,735
One day, he will betray you.

352
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,363
That is what strays do.

353
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,114
Mufos and we'll never betray me.

354
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:42,786
Hey, hey, this will all be yours, my son.

355
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,579
You will be king.

356
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,164
So pay attention.

357
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,210
Study every move I make.

358
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,962
Sleeping again.

359
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,798
That is what males do.

360
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,467
We protect the pride as we nap.

361
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,470
That's, well, that's power.

362
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:05,642
Power.

363
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,034
Why are we stopping?

364
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,122
Close your eyes
and tell me what you hear.

365
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,250
What you feel.

366
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,966
There's a herd of antelope

367
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,343
heading across the dry lake bed.

368
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,138
Half a day from here.

369
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,890
And how do you know they're not gazelles?

370
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,395
Their steps are too
heavy, moving way too slow.

371
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,312
What else?

372
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,524
Come on, you can do it.

373
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,777
When the wind hits their horns,

374
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,448
it moves up instead of across.

375
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,492
So definitely animal horns.

376
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,827
Very good.

377
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,209
What is it, Mufasa?

378
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:14,627
What's wrong?

379
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,254
Sometimes I get a sin.

380
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,548
It's barely a trace on the wind.

381
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,884
It smells like home.

382
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,598
And it's gone.

383
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,059
Mufasa, your parents are still out there.

384
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,436
We can keep looking.

385
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,854
I've lost them, Eshe.

386
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,148
You're wasting your
time training me like this.

387
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,443
But these skills you
have, no other male has them.

388
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,278
Obasi will never accept me.

389
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,156
I'll never be his blood, his family.

390
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,324
But you are my family.

391
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:48,077
And if Obasi could
see how gifted you are.

392
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,121
Well, maybe I like being a stray.

393
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,625
You know, no rules, no responsibility.

394
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,585
I'm the lucky one, Eshe.

395
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,628
What do you mean, Mufasa?

396
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,963
I never have to be like Taka.

397
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,633
I never have to be King.

398
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,764
Ay-ay-ay.

399
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,974
Ay-ay-ay.

400
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,524
Did he say no
rules and no responsibility?

401
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:20,318
An outcast afraid of
water never takes a bath.

402
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,528
Which means he smells like me?

403
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,487
Which is not good.

404
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,865
Well, either way, I think
that means that he's one of us.

405
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,534
This is it?

406
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,284
It's our time.

407
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,829
And a one, and a two, and a one, two.

408
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:32,956
Hakuna Mufasa

409
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,917
What a wonderful name

410
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,835
Hakuna Mufasa

411
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,755
He ain't no passing craze

412
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,590
It means no wrong.

413
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,258
What?

414
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,884
Don't you go, man.

415
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,760
All right, all right.

416
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,512
Rafiki's right,
we'll get letters from legal.

417
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,430
Faltres will take everything we have.

418
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,474
Which technically is nothing.

419
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,892
Look at us, we're naked animals.

420
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,102
It's the wonder I'm always freezing.

421
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,186
They want this.

422
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,145
Come on, Pumbaa.

423
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,772
Let's bring it home.

424
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:58,940
Hakuna Mufasa

425
00:30:59,440 --> 00:30:59,649
Quiet!

426
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,527
Here is a music snob.

427
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,195
Rafiki, keep going.

428
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,159
Later that day, Eshe was teaching Mufasa

429
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,869
how to hunt in pairs.

430
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,832
But as Taka was secretly watching,

431
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,127
something terrible was hunting them.

432
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,338
(suspenseful music)

433
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,763
(suspenseful music)

434
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:01,669
(suspenseful music)

435
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,878
Quiet.

436
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:04,172
Quiet.

437
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,637
(suspenseful music)

438
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:16,893
Mufasa, run!

439
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:19,646
Ashwin!

440
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,232
(grunting)

441
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:26,277
Ashwin!

442
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,408
(suspenseful music)

443
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,128
Keep moving, Mufasa.

444
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,506
Hey, go for the net!

445
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,801
(suspenseful music)

446
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,354
(growling)

447
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:06,693
It's okay, Mufasa.

448
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:08,695
It's okay.

449
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:11,364
It's okay.

450
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,158
I was very brave of you, Mufasa.

451
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:15,910
Thank you.

452
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,212
Eshe, what has happened?

453
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,507
Are you hurt?

454
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,720
They were huge, white as ghosts,

455
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,431
like nothing I've seen before.

456
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,225
Oh, Vasi.

457
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,396
Had Mufasa not been there, I...

458
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,942
(growling)

459
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:49,235
Taka.

460
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,407
(suspenseful music)

461
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,120
(growling)

462
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,915
I owe you a great debt, Mufasa.

463
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:05,960
We need to prepare.

464
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,880
They're downwind, less than a day away.

465
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,843
No, you couldn't possibly know this.

466
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,470
Send a scout and you'll see.

467
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,264
They'll be coming for us.

468
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:20,349
J'Aril.

469
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,646
Father, please, let me explain.

470
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,147
Not now.

471
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,940
Not now?

472
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,526
Taka, come.

473
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:41,245
(growling)

474
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,299
Where is my son?

475
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,468
There was a young lion, Majesty.

476
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,011
He fought Sha'ju.

477
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,390
And yet, you came back.

478
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,477
You survived.

479
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,645
I was badly hurt.

480
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,814
I promise, Majesty, this is the truth.

481
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:08,648
The truth.

482
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:09,899
Yes, the truth.

483
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,736
The truth is standing behind you.

484
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,988
(growling)

485
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,200
There were others.

486
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:19,909
He's Majesty.

487
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,703
But only one left blood on his name.

488
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,581
Which means he left Sha'ju to die.

489
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,833
Saved himself.

490
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,836
This young lion will see him their king.

491
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:31,963
His blood is common, ordinary.

492
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:35,091
I was here there.

493
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:35,758
King.

494
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,301
No, Kiritos.

495
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,304
You are the only king.

496
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,516
An ordinary lion.

497
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,061
And you left my son to die.

498
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,396
I was injured.

499
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,147
There was no choice, please, Majesty.

500
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,607
You have to believe me.

501
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,234
There's no reason to fear me.

502
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,279
I would never harm one of my own.

503
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,155
Thank you, Majesty.

504
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,577
I'll leave that pleasure to them.

505
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:04,871
Majesty!

506
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,123
(growling)

507
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:12,962
(growling)

508
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,469
No one can ever know you ran,

509
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,388
that you ran for your mother.

510
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,725
It never happened,
Taka, do you understand?

511
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,561
But I didn't know, I
was just, I was just scared.

512
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,854
It doesn't matter.

513
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,106
We must protect the bloodline.

514
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,608
Protect them with the lie?

515
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,860
Father, that's deceitful.

516
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,780
Deceit is a tool of a great king.

517
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,495
Taka, it's what kings must do.

518
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,747
But I'm not a king.

519
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,041
I'm just your son.

520
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:51,792
Obashek.

521
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,252
Shigaru.

522
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,879
Obasii.

523
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,715
Shigaru, I'm here.

524
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,133
What did you see?

525
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,302
They're coming this way, Obasii.

526
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,679
Two lions for every one of ours,

527
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,514
each one bigger than the next,

528
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,642
but none as mighty as Kirops.

529
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,018
They're terrifying king.

530
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,731
Outsiders, stories were all true.

531
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,401
I must protect the bloodline, Eshei.

532
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,153
The future of this pride.

533
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,406
Taka, you are that future.

534
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,157
Did you?

535
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,450
Dad, what do you mean?

536
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:28,663
I'm sending you away, far from here.

537
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,167
You will leave and
start a new life, a new beginning.

538
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,755
I need you to go with him,
Mofasa, to pledge your loyalty.

539
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,299
They'll arrive with the sunrise.

540
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,722
(birds chirping)

541
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,935
Where will we go, Eshei?

542
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:52,979
Without you, I have no home.

543
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,817
Mofasa, you and Taka
together, that, that is home.

544
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:58,317
Eshei?

545
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,404
Mofasa, look out there, beyond the light.

546
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:02,989
You know what I see?

547
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,449
I see the place
your mother told you about.

548
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,286
A place beyond the river's end,

549
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,997
across the deepest
canyon on the other side

550
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,208
of the mountains, a
place beyond the horizon itself.

551
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:19,297
A bright land so green, so perfect

552
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,384
that to see it is to see--

553
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,135
Malaylei?

554
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,512
Yes, forever.

555
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,473
My parents spoke of Malaylei often.

556
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,726
My mother told me
it was where we were going.

557
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,019
And don't you see, Mofasa?

558
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,562
You must keep going.

559
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,106
You must continue
your journey toward the light.

560
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,317
Please, Eshei, I can't lose you.

561
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:42,820
You have my love always, Mofasa.

562
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,947
But your family is still out there.

563
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,073
Waiting for you.

564
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,410
I can feel their
presence, and I know you can too.

565
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,039
Go, go, Mofasa.

566
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,207
Find your way home.

567
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,755
(birds chirping)

568
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,010
Mother, please forgive me.

569
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,595
I beg you.

570
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,055
There's no need, my love.

571
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,308
Daga, your moment of courage will come.

572
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,485
Now both of you go.

573
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,740
Go and find your
place in the circle of love.

574
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:41,879
(dramatic music)

575
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,220
They left their
family never to see them again?

576
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,138
This story is killing me.

577
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,681
It's toying with my emotion.

578
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,809
Here is the worst part.

579
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,393
What's that?

580
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,310
A man of crickets.

581
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,812
Oh, maybe that's for the best.

582
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,939
I need a bathroom
break before the second act.

583
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:00,815
Everyone wait for me.

584
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,526
(dramatic music)

585
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:07,905
I am back.

586
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,365
Tumba, did you wash your hooves?

587
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,199
Mm-hmm.

588
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:10,908
Tumba.

589
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:11,951
I did, I did.

590
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:12,618
Tumba.

591
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,537
I'm just gonna walk
on them again right after.

592
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:14,995
Tumba.

593
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:15,955
(grunts)

594
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,874
Rafiki, did the outsiders come?

595
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,627
Yes, and as the hunters led Kirus

596
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,920
into the Valley of Kings,

597
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,048
Oubasi and Asher stood their ground.

598
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:30,219
(dramatic music)

599
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,978
(roaring)

600
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,022
What one of you is king?

601
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,442
You have no reason to challenge me.

602
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,697
Does this look like a challenge king?

603
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,658
There are rooms among lions.

604
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,034
Not anymore.

605
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,038
While you rule
this, try to build my army.

606
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,042
Yours is the last
pride in the Valley of Kings,

607
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,379
which means everything the light touches

608
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,298
belongs to thee.

609
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:12,178
There will be one ruler, one lion king.

610
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,473
(roaring)

611
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,186
You say you are the king

612
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,647
But you lie around in the shade

613
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,900
Out of shame unafraid

614
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,571
The moon cuts the path through the sky

615
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,740
By night or by day

616
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,909
It doesn't obey

617
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,328
And I let you run

618
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,914
You to my son

619
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,335
I hope you can run

620
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,548
But I'm gonna be the last thing you see

621
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,217
Before you go bye bye

622
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,594
There you go bye bye

623
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,682
Climb every tree across land and sea

624
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,267
I make you go bye bye

625
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,561
I make you go bye bye

626
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:06,106
I sing in my glottals

627
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,149
Bye bye

628
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,319
Everything the light touches

629
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,824
The circle of life is a lie

630
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,412
A pretty way to say
there are predators and prey

631
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:24,833
That circle of order's a pie

632
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,169
They keep stealing glands

633
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:29,630
They don't like your chances

634
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,799
And neither do I

635
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,468
You are my pride

636
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,181
You are my pride

637
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:43,936
And I'm gonna be the last thing you see

638
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,729
Before you go bye bye

639
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,856
There you go bye bye

640
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:53,028
Climb every tree across land and sea

641
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,822
Until you go bye bye

642
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,949
Where you go bye bye

643
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,370
Bye bye for vengeance is mine

644
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,666
And I'm the last of my line

645
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,085
I must be soon

646
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,756
Bye bye

647
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,092
I make you go bye bye

648
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,095
(grunting)

649
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,973
Bye bye

650
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,557
Bye bye

651
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,649
We have to move.

652
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,067
They'll be tracking us.

653
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:33,319
Parker!

654
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,194
What if you're wrong?

655
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,071
What if they're okay?

656
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,198
Live in you now.

657
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,867
Follow me, brother.

658
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,119
We have to move.

659
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:43,787
Together.

660
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,592
(grunting)

661
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,356
Run real faster.

662
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:12,441
Run!

663
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:15,903
Butters.

664
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,029
What's the plan?

665
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,199
Run very fast.

666
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,203
(grunting)

667
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,122
This way!

668
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,472
Back to the trees.

669
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:44,640
We're trapped.

670
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:45,724
We have to swim.

671
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,393
No, we have to fight.

672
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,894
We fight, we die.

673
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,813
What if we swim, we drown?

674
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,773
Okay, I didn't want to do this,

675
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,274
but I command you to swim.

676
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:55,442
What?

677
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,861
You've led your
loyalty, I command you to swim.

678
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,155
Parker, this is not the time to jump.

679
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,714
Wait, so what have you killed, my son?

680
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,257
I did.

681
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,426
This lion with me is nothing but a stray.

682
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,260
Let him go.

683
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,387
You see, the other is no stray.

684
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,847
He holds the blood of the problem.

685
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,475
The last blood of the king.

686
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,604
We are ten for blood.

687
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,414
They're coming.

688
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:52,541
What do we do?

689
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,001
Find the advantage.

690
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,336
We'll have five kids, we're on a rock

691
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,963
in the middle of the warcraft.

692
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,007
Parker, this is it.

693
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,300
We go for the king.

694
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,728
New barter, I'm ready.

695
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,771
Stop, one last thing.

696
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:15,856
You won't.

697
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,190
Get up.

698
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,694
Parker, this was a bad idea.

699
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,330
What was that?

700
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:32,748
What was that?

701
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,045
(laughing)

702
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,924
What was that?

703
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:42,966
We're alive.

704
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,092
I did it.

705
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,427
I said don't.

706
00:46:48,597 --> 00:47:00,150
You understand what I'm saying?

707
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,319
( Due arrest! )

708
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:08,408
( This is why I care about you. )

709
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,369
( I promise! )

710
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,791
(explosion)

711
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,920
Okay, okay.

712
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,089
No, no more water.

713
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,550
Tell me you can track them down river.

714
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,927
We can track them anywhere.

715
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,263
They can run, but they can't hide.

716
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:31,181
(ominous music)

717
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,850
So just to be
clear, we're not in this story.

718
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,602
It feels a little bit like Giros

719
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,229
is stealing my thunder here.

720
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,855
Yeah, you know, I don't feel seen.

721
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,316
No, there's a lot
of stories with all of us.

722
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:41,942
Tell one of those.

723
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,404
One small
suggestion, less childhood drama,

724
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,655
more mere catch.

725
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,700
Well, Ziggy, I
know who Chaka is gonna be.

726
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,243
Oh, me too.

727
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,079
It's so obvious, but maybe
just so we're on the same page.

728
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,038
Tell me, is it Simba?

729
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,331
Is it me? Oh, Simba.

730
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,083
Am I your bossy?

731
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,752
That makes no sense, but
seriously, I have one question.

732
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:02,754
Am I Chaka?

733
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,507
I did it again.

734
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,259
I did it again.

735
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:11,263
Not that I'm counting,
but I saved your heart again.

736
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,225
As much as it cues you
to say it, let's hear a little

737
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,060
thank you, you are the one of me.

738
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,188
The thank you for
pushing me off a waterfall.

739
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,690
Yes, and you're welcome.

740
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,567
Look, it's not my fault.

741
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,485
Crocodile's are simply attracted to you.

742
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,154
Don't, don't say that.

743
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:29,615
(laughing)

744
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,117
I did it again.

745
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,328
I did it again.

746
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:35,120
(growling)

747
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:35,954
Mufasa. Shh.

748
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,456
Is it, is it them?

749
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,665
Is it the outsiders?

750
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,834
No, she's right there.

751
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:41,418
Gee.

752
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,962
(suspenseful music)

753
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,589
There's no place to run.

754
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,215
We have your scent.

755
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:48,884
My scent.

756
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,386
I've been stalking you two all night.

757
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,680
That's not possible.

758
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,683
Then why did I circle
you three times in this wood

759
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,894
while you two were
chasing each other's tails?

760
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:05,192
(growling)

761
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,243
(growling)

762
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,871
(screaming)

763
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:20,624
Not too bad, I said.

764
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,460
Yeah, well, I meant to do that.

765
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,879
So. Still think I'm afraid?

766
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,509
Why are you following us?

767
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,927
I was hoping to find my pride.

768
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,179
What happened? The outsiders happened.

769
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,474
A few of us got away,
but you're the only other lions

770
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,058
I've seen.

771
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,811
You two better keep moving.

772
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,561
Wait, please.

773
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:46,775
My name is Taka, son of Obasi.

774
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,194
I know what it's like to lose everything.

775
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,821
Come with us, we can help you.

776
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,155
I don't need any help.

777
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,991
But you don't have anyone.

778
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,786
He does indeed have
someone, thank you very much.

779
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,913
That's Zazu, don't eat him.

780
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,540
You heard her, do not eat me.

781
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,459
As a recent addition
to the king's royal guard,

782
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,546
I must kindly ask you both to move on.

783
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,756
Thank you for stopping by.

784
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,175
How can your king
hide a bird to protect you?

785
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,885
How high can you fly?

786
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,513
Look, I needed a scout.

787
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,432
Zazu was the last option.

788
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,766
Well, next to last.

789
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,227
Between Albert, the iguana, and I,

790
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:25,939
his majesty decided
on the underling with wings,

791
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,567
and thus, I became the
lead scout for the princess.

792
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,694
It's my third day going swimmingly,

793
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,737
if I may say so myself.

794
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,447
Zorabi, you can say so as well.

795
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,240
How far do you
think you'll get with a bird?

796
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,367
How far do you two
geniuses think you'll get

797
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,411
stumbling around running into each other?

798
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,329
All the way to Malayle.

799
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,873
Malayle is nothing but a myth.

800
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,540
It's not a myth.

801
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,333
A circle of life and fairy tale herds.

802
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,461
You're chasing
something that doesn't exist.

803
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,421
I don't know that Malayle exists,

804
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,840
but right now,
it's the only hope we have.

805
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,632
We don't need hope.

806
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,050
We need food.

807
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:57,888
Good job, brother.

808
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,222
Oh, real nice.

809
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,266
(dramatic music)
There's trouble in the trees.

810
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,019
My first tree was
trouble, and I am going to pass.

811
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,478
You're going?

812
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,562
I am staying right here.

813
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:05,854
Thank you.

814
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:06,772
It's yours, Zorabi.

815
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,107
I think it's like
there's dinner headed our way.

816
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,821
Zorabi, if I may, he
makes a valid point, your highness.

817
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,115
But on the other
hand, he's a starving lion.

818
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,617
He wants to eat
me, so I am slightly torn.

819
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,080
I think that went quite
well, all things considered.

820
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,208
(dramatic music)

821
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,796
(crowd cheering)

822
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,136
And now, Kiara, this is where I come in.

823
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:45,769
(dramatic music)

824
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,021
Thank you.

825
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:49,147
Order!

826
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,858
We will have order
in the Congress of Baboons.

827
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,693
Tonight, a cheetah came into our trees

828
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,654
for the third night in a row.

829
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,947
Almost took one of our own.

830
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:57,864
He was a rafiki for.

831
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,991
He summoned a beast with his dreams.

832
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,829
Rafiki and his visions
must be banished once and for all.

833
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,372
Rafiki tried to warn you.

834
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,873
His dreams conjure our enemies.

835
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,292
He talks to the
spirits, summons the devil.

836
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,293
What are you talking about?

837
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,294
He's done it before.

838
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,839
His brother was
chased from these very trees,

839
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,006
never to be seen again.

840
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,424
Rafiki was just a child.

841
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,969
A child born with
a leg that does not work,

842
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,136
yet somehow he survived?

843
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,597
It was Rafiki who
found water in the dry season.

844
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,183
Who healed you,
Enaki, when you were sick?

845
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,518
He speaks to the insects.

846
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,520
He converses with the moon.

847
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,188
Mzala, you know what will happen

848
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,606
if you send him down from the trees.

849
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,860
Here's Amalani,
you are, a curse to us all.

850
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,027
That's not true.

851
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,153
He doesn't belong here.

852
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,739
All in favor of
banishment, cover one eye.

853
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:44,494
(people chattering)

854
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,500
And so, it is time.

855
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,543
No, wait.

856
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:53,920
Where will you go?

857
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,339
The way I should have gone long ago,

858
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,427
to find all that was lost, my family.

859
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,846
You can't survive on your own.

860
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,180
Nobody can.

861
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,766
And yet, here we are.

862
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:09,895
Oh, Rafiki.

863
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,691
But I never forget
what the heart has seen.

864
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:23,617
(suspenseful music)

865
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,868
(slizing)

866
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,120
( INTENSE MUSIC)

867
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,287
(pAnne laughs)

868
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:29,015
I don't think you
understand what's about to happen.

869
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,101
There's no place for you to go.

870
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,727
I am going forward.

871
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,938
I seriously doubt that.

872
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,400
It is easy to doubt
everything when you know nothing.

873
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,485
Can we get on with this, please?

874
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:44,656
If you take my life,
you will never find Melele.

875
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,533
Wait, did you say Melele?

876
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,575
That is where I am going.

877
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,119
To ward the light.

878
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,081
I've been there many times in my dreams.

879
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,166
My brother waits for me there.

880
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,044
I've seen the tree, can picture it.

881
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,755
The two of us together again.

882
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,383
And why would
anyone trust a baboon's dream?

883
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,385
Sometimes a dream is all you have.

884
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,096
The only truth that lives in you,

885
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,807
like the memory of a great king.

886
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,017
How did you know?

887
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,854
Okay, help us get to
Melele and we will let you live.

888
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:16,980
Do we have a deal?

889
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:17,480
No.

890
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:18,314
What?

891
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:19,357
Why?

892
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,277
Rafiki will let you live.

893
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,196
I've had enough of this, Parker.

894
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,448
Do not eat.

895
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:27,198
Wonderful.

896
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,951
Other misfits
straight were not supposed to eat.

897
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,495
So you expect us to follow this baboon

898
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,831
to a place nobody has ever seen?

899
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,042
Ha, I'll be better off alone.

900
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,084
Hey, dumbassan.

901
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,714
A single stick may
smoke, but it will never burn.

902
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,136
Okay, now that there's five of us,

903
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,680
why don't we all go around
and say a fun fact about ourselves?

904
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:51,765
I'll go first.

905
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,893
I once had a crush on a flamingo.

906
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,062
We've never said that out loud.

907
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,064
And they're walking away.

908
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,982
Yeah, places to go, kingdoms to see.

909
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,025
We're busy, let's hustle.

910
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:13,453
Wait, wait, wait.

911
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,121
Now you're the star of this thing?

912
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:18,041
Someone's a little tired
of being sick of banana, huh?

913
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,585
All of a sudden there's
a lot of Rafiki in the story.

914
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,462
You even gave
yourself a long lost brother.

915
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,547
What's next, a funny catch break?

916
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,757
Are you gonna be farting next?

917
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:26,424
That's my thing.

918
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,760
You cannot tell the story of Mofapa.

919
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,137
We have the story of Rafiki.

920
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,390
Now he's even talking
about himself in the third person.

921
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,892
Pretty soon he'll have his own fragrance.

922
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,436
And I'm the only one
with a fragrance around here.

923
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,021
It's called Poba by Poba.

924
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,148
From what I hear, it's pretty gross.

925
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:47,278
Mom, Dad, if you can hear me, come home.

926
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,949
Please, come home.

927
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:59,249
(dramatic music)

928
00:56:59,541 --> 00:56:59,749
Okay.

929
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,002
Where?

930
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,217
Me lately.

931
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,011
(burping)

932
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,944
(soft music)

933
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:29,863
Rafiki.

934
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:30,947
Hi, Suga.

935
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:31,906
What are you doing?

936
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:32,824
I am fishing.

937
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,326
You're sitting on a
rock with your eyes closed.

938
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,870
My eyes are open.

939
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,663
It is my lids that are closed.

940
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,416
Why am I talking to a bad girl?

941
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:42,750
I am not a baboon.

942
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,211
I am a mandrel.

943
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,339
No offense, but a monkey is a monkey.

944
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,175
And a stray is a stray.

945
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,176
What's that supposed to mean?

946
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,261
It means we are very much the same.

947
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:54,679
(speaking foreign language)

948
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,431
We are nothing alike.

949
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:57,807
Take a good look.

950
00:57:58,474 --> 00:57:59,851
I am a lion.

951
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,978
The lion who sears water,

952
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,605
fears his own reflection,

953
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,065
who can't sleep because of what he sees

954
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,567
when he closes his eyes.

955
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:08,318
Huh?

956
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,821
You are afraid of your dreams, Mufasa.

957
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,157
Afraid of what you see in them.

958
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,326
I see my parents.

959
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,329
I feel them everywhere.

960
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,372
Of course you do, Mufasa.

961
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,459
You will feel them forever.

962
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:27,962
My mother, I hear her voice.

963
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,467
She tells me that we
are on a journey to Malaylay,

964
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,803
but I feel so lost without her.

965
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:39,349
Your journey is not a dream, Mufasa.

966
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,309
Your mother is guiding you.

967
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,771
And where you are going, a family awaits.

968
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:46,606
(grunts)

969
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:52,070
(speaking foreign language)

970
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,035
What are you doing?

971
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:00,620
We're starving.

972
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,121
Because not it's time.

973
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,209
Instead, the fish has
agreed to let us share the water.

974
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:09,921
(sighs)

975
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,547
(speaking foreign language)

976
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,842
Take your smile.

977
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,804
I have a report.

978
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:19,389
It's morning.

979
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,599
End of report.

980
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,735
The Earth divided is now a choice,

981
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,279
around or down.

982
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,239
The decision is yours.

983
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:41,911
Look out there.

984
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,413
Beyond the light,

985
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,541
across the deepest canyon.

986
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,586
Across the deepest canyon.

987
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:52,839
We should go down.

988
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,131
Why?

989
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,258
Because of some fairy tale.

990
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,759
The rocks will hide our tracks.

991
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,636
It's safer to go around.

992
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,221
I pick up their scent.

993
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,724
The only thing you
picked up is a hallucinating baboon.

994
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:03,683
I am a mentor.

995
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,435
This is a waste of time.

996
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,936
Close your eyes.

997
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:07,979
What?

998
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:11,858
Tell me what you see, what you feel.

999
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:12,859
There's nothing on the land.

1000
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,278
No, they're moving
through the bush wallow.

1001
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:15,945
They who?

1002
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,447
The females, out front.

1003
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,867
Come on, clear
your thoughts, concentrate.

1004
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,618
I am concentrating.

1005
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:30,793
(dramatic music)

1006
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:35,548
He's right.

1007
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:38,718
We have to go down.

1008
01:00:39,635 --> 01:00:41,637
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1009
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:42,972
We are more than one.

1010
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:46,768
Now the many
sticks will make fire as one.

1011
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,854
Come on, we have places to go.

1012
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,898
And kingdoms to say.

1013
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,067
And kingdoms to say.

1014
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,610
What's our plan?

1015
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,697
You wanna go fast, go alone

1016
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,701
There's the road, off you go

1017
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,829
But if you wanna go far

1018
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,165
We go together

1019
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,250
So good, so far

1020
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,960
We go together

1021
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,546
If your father left you in my care

1022
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,964
Whoa, whoa, whoa

1023
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,592
And now we're running who knows where

1024
01:01:19,675 --> 01:01:20,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa

1025
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,387
Sometimes you need a bird

1026
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,805
Like you and I

1027
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,641
I want you to see me through

1028
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,309
I land my hair

1029
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,353
You wanna go fast, go alone

1030
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:31,479
Day and night

1031
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,480
There's the road

1032
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,439
And just like

1033
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,273
Off you go

1034
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:35,400
Yeah, all right

1035
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,360
If you wanna go far

1036
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,946
We go together

1037
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,073
So good, so far

1038
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,825
We go together

1039
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,787
I will find my family again

1040
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,666
I will walk with you until then

1041
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,545
I will walk with you till the end

1042
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,215
It's much easier with a friend

1043
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:03,010
I will find my family again

1044
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,848
I will walk with you until then

1045
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,893
I will walk with you till the end

1046
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,271
It's much easier

1047
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,566
Like a cloud and rain

1048
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,237
Like a meal in a field of rain

1049
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:26,159
Like a flex of gold in your main shrub

1050
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,202
You and me

1051
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:29,829
Go together

1052
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,747
Cloud and rain

1053
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,044
We are living in a great world

1054
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:41,340
The peace of gold in your main shrub

1055
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,426
You and me

1056
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,094
Go together

1057
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:47,346
My brother waits for a reason to sign

1058
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:48,723
Down anywhere

1059
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,600
My brother knows the word

1060
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,351
He's like the devil

1061
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,646
My brother tends to play decorate

1062
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,400
It's big, it's nice to meet you

1063
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:00,610
It's like a man

1064
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:02,445
It's a man

1065
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:04,530
It's a man

1066
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:05,948
It's a man

1067
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:13,122
It's a man No, no, no, no

1068
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:13,831
There we go

1069
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,460
No, no, no, no, no

1070
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,921
No, no, no, no

1071
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,714
We go together

1072
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,883
So good, so far

1073
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,551
We go together

1074
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,094
(cheering)

1075
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,016
(laughing)

1076
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,312
As we headed across the great valley,

1077
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,524
the hunters tracked our every move.

1078
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,903
Heroes, they are not alone.

1079
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,780
They've connected a lioness.

1080
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,740
And a monkey.

1081
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,035
(roaring)

1082
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:55,873
(roaring)

1083
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:58,793
Mufasa?

1084
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:01,712
Mufasa, you have to help me.

1085
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:02,421
Help you how?

1086
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:03,839
It's Sarabi, Mufasa.

1087
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,467
She is the light my mother spoke of.

1088
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,843
What? She's special.

1089
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,680
The most amazing
female I've ever met in my life.

1090
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,223
I don't know what to say to her.

1091
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,474
You've spent your life with females.

1092
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,143
Please, tell me what to say.

1093
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,229
Just talk to her. Be yourself.

1094
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,856
Mufasa, you don't understand.

1095
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:21,899
Myself isn't good enough.

1096
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,528
You just know things.

1097
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,239
Fine, fine.

1098
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:29,740
Keep it simple.

1099
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:31,784
Ask her a question.

1100
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,119
Right, a question?

1101
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:34,495
This is good.

1102
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:38,040
Yeah, try to be confident, disinterested.

1103
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:39,458
But I'm very interested.

1104
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,336
Tell her about the flowers.

1105
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:43,379
What flowers?

1106
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,298
The valley she comes from.

1107
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,966
There's flowers everywhere.

1108
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,636
Duck flowers, long stems.

1109
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,972
It's absolutely beautiful.

1110
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:54,724
How do you know that?

1111
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,643
When she passes, I
can smell them on her fur.

1112
01:04:58,894 --> 01:04:59,145
Okay.

1113
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:01,939
Flowers, disinterested.

1114
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,817
And here's the
most important thing, okay?

1115
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,820
Listen when she speaks.

1116
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,114
Males have trouble with that one.

1117
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:11,198
Sorry.

1118
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,075
What did you say?

1119
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:15,286
Really?

1120
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,662
You know what I mean?

1121
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,164
I heard you, brother.

1122
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,666
I'm gonna make you proud.

1123
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:25,921
Oh.

1124
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,221
It's very hard, isn't it?

1125
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:35,264
Yep.

1126
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:37,725
Oh.

1127
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,269
I love listening.

1128
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:41,312
Okay.

1129
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,230
I'm listening right now.

1130
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,065
To what?

1131
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,024
What you just said.

1132
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:46,609
I am.

1133
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,654
You smell like a duck.

1134
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:49,987
What?

1135
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:50,696
Flower.

1136
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:52,990
A duck flower.

1137
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,409
How do you know about those flowers?

1138
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:55,951
I...

1139
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,663
Well, I inhaled you with my nose.

1140
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:00,247
I can smell them.

1141
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:02,958
That's amazing.

1142
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,795
Our valley was full of those flowers,

1143
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,255
thousands of them,
as far as the eye could see.

1144
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,425
It was the most beautiful place, Taka.

1145
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,053
Did he just say she smells like a duck?

1146
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,722
And you call me a baboon.

1147
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:33,823
I shouldn't be here.

1148
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,950
The migration patterns are broken.

1149
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,410
I don't understand.

1150
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:37,618
I'm sorry, sir.

1151
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:38,994
This is not a drill.

1152
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,748
Just to be clear, I
never signed up for this.

1153
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,376
It's okay.

1154
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:46,210
It's safe.

1155
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:48,170
They're on the other side.

1156
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:49,839
No!

1157
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,507
They can just jump across.

1158
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:52,883
We're trapped.

1159
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,301
What do we do?

1160
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,262
The elephants will fight with us.

1161
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,430
And why would they do that?

1162
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:59,682
Because I'm going to ask them.

1163
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:00,891
Got a better idea?

1164
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,270
Yes, Mr. Ask questions first.

1165
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:05,396
Get ready to run.

1166
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:06,897
Um...

1167
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:07,982
Where is she going?

1168
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:09,066
Hello?

1169
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,401
Listen to me, please.

1170
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:11,485
We need your help.

1171
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:12,653
Can you talk with me?

1172
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,028
We need your help.

1173
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,113
Please.

1174
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,782
They're coming!

1175
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:18,701
Trombie!

1176
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:19,952
Trombie wait!

1177
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:21,120
Trombie wait!

1178
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:21,912
Trombie wait!

1179
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:22,621
Wait wait!

1180
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:26,417
Just go for the hide!

1181
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,837
Like I said, get ready to run!

1182
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:32,757
Run!

1183
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:43,225
Run!

1184
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,311
Get to the trees!

1185
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,062
Why are you running?

1186
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:13,756
Run!

1187
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,177
You are behind us!

1188
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,053
Hold on!

1189
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:20,179
I found you!

1190
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:30,856
Trombie!

1191
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:43,577
[SOMBER MUSIC]

1192
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:43,786
Egypt.

1193
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:46,664
Ex Industriaan!

1194
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,123
Do not reach me.

1195
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:53,379
(screaming)

1196
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:10,271
I got you, I got you.

1197
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,398
Sarabi, I got you.

1198
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:22,741
That's right, run
along little kitty cats.

1199
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,910
Meow, meow.

1200
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,538
Thank you, my friend.

1201
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:29,415

(groaning)

1204
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:46,140
Over here.

1205

(speaking foreign language)

1207
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,124
Alive, she's alive.

1208
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,590
Why are you all looking at me?

1209
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,508
You were thrown from the tree.

1210
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,636
She saved your life.

1211
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:26,263
Who?

1212
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,808
Taka, Taka saved you.

1213
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:31,769
Isn't that right, brother?

1214
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:36,774
You saved me?

1215
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,235
Well, I had had to do something.

1216
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:41,320
Thank you.

1217
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:43,656
We're lucky.

1218
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,034
Those bees almost killed us all.

1219
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,827
Those bees saved our lives.

1220
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:49,620
Ah, really?

1221
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,332
Because it felt
like an elephant stampede.

1222
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,416
We're alive, aren't we?

1223
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,793
The elephants would have fought with us.

1224
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,963
We're lions, nobody
will fight with us, not out here.

(speaking foreign language)

1226
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:08,931
Where's it going?

1227
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:11,767
Beyond the horizon itself.

1228
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:16,188
(speaking foreign language)

1229
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,815
Mufasa, thank you.

1230
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:25,656
(thunder rumbling)

1231
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:34,999
Rafiki, who, who are the outsiders?

1232
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:39,086
Well, the
outsiders come from many prides,

1233
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,505
but when they are born, they are hated

1234
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,299
because they are
different from their tribe.

1235
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:45,884
Like you mean your tribe?

1236
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:47,720
Yes, just like me.

1237
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,263
But Rafiki?

1238
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,097
Yes.

1239
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,016
Why do they want to hurt everybody?

1240
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,603
Sometimes when the
people most like you don't love you,

1241
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:59,773
it is a hurt that
can cause the greatest pain.

1242
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:04,695
And this pain can
lead you to hate everything.

1243
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,531
I'm glad that
didn't happen to you, Rafiki.

1244
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:10,159
Yes, my child, I'm glad too.

1245
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:12,911
Um, hi, we're here too.

1246
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:15,122
Yeah, why are you
leaving us outside this story?

1247
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,750
Well, I'm pretty sure
we are the ultimate outtiles.

1248
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:18,333
Come on.

1249
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,835
Yeah, we've always been misunderstood.

1250
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,336
I contain both of you.

1251
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:25,132
(dramatic music)

1252
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:29,511
There are many ways to be there,

1253
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,681
but this, for us.

1254
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,768
(dramatic music)

1255
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:10,886
(dramatic music) Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1256
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,179
Hey, Rafiki?

1257
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,181
What are you doing?

1258
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:18,060
I am confirming my vision, Fasa.

1259
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,107
Can I ask you something, Rafiki?

1260
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:24,233
Hmm?

1261
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,318
How many of your visions have come true?

1262
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:29,154
So far, none.

1263
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:29,696
None?

1264
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,323
But it's not what I see.

1265
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,449
It's what I feel.

1266
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:37,746
But how do you know
when you should follow a feeling?

1267
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,040
Millele exists.

1268
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,210
I feel it in here.

1269
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:47,089
The question is,
what do you feel, Mufasa?

1270
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,550
In they.

1271
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:52,427
(dramatic music)

1272
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:06,692
(dramatic music)

1273
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:10,737
Weather is shifting.

1274
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,197
There's not enough fresh snow.

1275
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:15,117
Hey, if the outsiders find our tracks,

1276
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,869
they'll follow them to Millele.

1277
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,746
Zazu, only you can help us.

1278
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,748
Are you quite sure about that?

1279
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,667
Now, I was actually
thinking that Rafiki looks

1280
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:24,918
all pretty handy and with the stick--

1281
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,379
Zazu, you can use
your wings to cover our tracks

1282
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:29,339
as we head up the
mountain without leaving a trace.

1283
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,383
Hey, you can do this.

1284
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:32,968
Oh, yeah.

1285
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:35,095
Yes, sir, you're right.

1286
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:35,929
I've got this.

1287
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:39,224
(dramatic music)

1288
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:40,809
Okay, this is me.

1289
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,144
Getting to the frozen mountain.

1290
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,771
And the one horned
field charge with saving future.

1291
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:46,023
Oh, mummy!

1292
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,903
Oh, oh, my life, that's cold.

1293
01:14:53,363 --> 01:15:04,041
(dramatic music) (thunder rumbling)

1294
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,167
(thunder rumbling)

1295
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:06,668
What's happening?

1296
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,962
We can't keep stopping.

1297
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,257
Somehow, they have
covered their tracks in the snow.

1298
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:14,676
It's not possible.

1299
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,304
Majesty, they could
be anywhere on this mountain.

1300
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,847
Then find them now.

1301
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,560
Zazu, zazu, zazu, zazu, zazu, zazu.

1302
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,354
(dramatic music)

1303
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,358
I have a report.

1304
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:32,819
The outsiders are completely lost.

1305
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:34,154
Well played, Mufasa.

1306
01:15:34,529 --> 01:15:35,447
Great job, Zazu.

1307
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:36,573
And as per usual.

1308
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:37,866
I knew you could do it.

1309
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:38,784
We did it.

1310
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:40,619
We did it.

1311
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,871
No, you did it.

1312
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,581
Great thinking, Mufasa.

1313
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:46,541
Now, we're all rubbing off on each other.

1314
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,043
Partly normal thing to do.

1315
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,461
Who wants to rub against us?

1316
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,379
No one.

1317
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:51,380
I'm leaving now.

1318
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,256
Scout ahead.

1319
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,301
(dramatic music)

1320
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,719
(thunder rumbling)

1321
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:57,886
(grunting)

1322
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:05,394
(laughing)

1323
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:08,814
I got you, Rufasa.

1324
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:09,940
Hey.

1325
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:10,857
I got you.

1326
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:11,858
Do not do that.

1327
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,235
Yeah, I got you.

1328
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:16,905
(dramatic music)

1329
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:19,032
Mufasa.

1330
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,827
I got you.

1331
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:25,080
(dramatic music)

1332
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:26,290
I'm sorry.

1333
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:30,544
(dramatic music)

1334
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,802
Heading in the
shadows, downwind, right afoot.

1335
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,596
Interesting hunting style, Mufasa.

1336
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:45,475
We have to eat something
before we take on that descent.

1337
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,728
Unfortunately,
there's nothing to hunt up here.

1338
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,687
See under that rock?

1339
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:51,398
There's a sieve about to leave his den.

1340
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:54,276
Of course you can
smell a sieve hidden in the snow.

1341
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,571
You, the lion who can do anything.

1342
01:16:58,697 --> 01:16:59,781
What's that supposed to mean?

1343
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,367
It means I see you, Mufasa.

1344
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,661
I don't know what you're talking about.

1345
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:08,457
Now that part I
believe, because smart as you are,

1346
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:11,168
you have a way of
seeing everything but yourself.

1347
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:12,544
What is this?

1348
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:14,671
What is this, Sarabi?

1349
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:18,300
There is a sievet in the
snow right where you said it would be,

1350
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,427
and you smelled
the outsiders in the wind,

1351
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,180
which means you're the one
who smelled the flowers on my fur.

1352
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:23,263
It was a lucky guess.

1353
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,808
You can smell the
exact flower from my valley.

1354
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,643
No, that's not possible.

1355
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:29,436
You saved me.

1356
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:32,939
Held me, covered me
in a stamp, he comforted me.

1357
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:33,899
No, it was talking.

1358
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:34,566
I got you.

1359
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,901
I got you, Sarabi.

1360
01:17:35,942 --> 01:17:37,486
I'm here to protect him.

1361
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:38,320
That was you?

1362
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,614
I was lost in the water and he found me.

1363
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:41,573
My brother saved her.

1364
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,283
I sensed it from the beginning.

1365
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,369
His blood is the blood of the king.

1366
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:45,911
Mufasa.

1367
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,412
That is his destiny.

1368
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:50,290
No, his destiny was to save you.

1369
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:51,291
Okay.

1370
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,670
Now tell me it's you.

1371
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:10,644
Ever since you appeared,

1372
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:15,399
I've been running
through something deep inside,

1373
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,192
and it's worse than I feared.

1374
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,947
Cause I look in
your eyes and I can't hide

1375
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,281
I push you away

1376
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,991
Don't push me away

1377
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:28,120
But the feelings
come back just twice as strong

1378
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:29,788
I don't know what to say

1379
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,415
I know just what to say

1380
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:34,334
But I know that I'm right where I belong

1381
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:36,461
Way you know just where to be

1382
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,004
I don't know

1383
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,673
Move the way you see

1384
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,757
You see me

1385
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,843
The way you feel when you're near

1386
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:47,264
Beside me, don't hide me in court

1387
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:50,517
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1388
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,227
What do I say, where do I go

1389
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:53,812
How do I know you feel the same

1390
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:56,898
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1391
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:58,567
Quiet and low, letting it go

1392
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:00,026
Letting you know it's in me

1393
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:01,695
Every year that I roll

1394
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,241
I remind myself not to overstay

1395
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,160
Every time I find home

1396
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,581
Something happens to take that home away

1397
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,416
Don't you see what I've seen

1398
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,042
I see you

1399
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,004
As you meet with the
strength that shines right through

1400
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,798
Move like a queen, true queen

1401
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,510
Don't let anything take me away from you

1402
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:28,430
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1403
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,098
Say it again, say it again

1404
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,725
Tell me I'll always be with you

1405
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:34,603
Tell me it's you, I know it's you

1406
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:36,354
Say it again, say it again

1407
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:37,772
Tell me you're always with me

1408
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,816
You know just where to be

1409
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,234
Now I know

1410
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,986
Move the way you see

1411
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,029
I see you

1412
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,323
As you feel like you and you and me

1413
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:49,701
Beside me, beside me

1414
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,037
Say it again, say it again, say it again

1415
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:53,663
Tell me the world won't end again

1416
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,165
Say it again, say it again

1417
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:56,791
Tell me the words I wanna hear

1418
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,293
Say it again, say it again

1419
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,253
Open your eyes and here we come

1420
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,967
I know it's you

1421
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:12,307
I know it's you

1422
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:44,673
You know I love her, my brother

1423
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:50,303
There's nothing we keep from each other

1424
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:56,726
Save your life, this is how you behave

1425
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,608
What do I do, what does it mean

1426
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,277
How do I ever wanna see what I see

1427
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:08,446
He was my kin, she was my queen

1428
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:10,949
Now it's broken
forever and now it's broken forever

1429
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,034
And the caller is you, she knows it's you

1430
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,412
What did you say to her, what did you do

1431
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,831
I'm next in line, now she should be mine

1432
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:20,333
Ha, are the answers
laughing? I believe them

1433
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:22,460
What would they say, father is gone

1434
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:24,588
Not before giving me strength, Lord

1435
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:27,132
He never trusted you, didn't know

1436
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:29,259
You've been training me sir

1437
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,761
For when you were drowning I could die

1438
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,263
I can do life with you lived in my day

1439
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:36,516
Behind you and round me, tumbling down

1440
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:38,768
Trying to escape what I cannot forget

1441
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:42,439
I am a brother no
longer, it's over in time

1442
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:46,401
Now all I have is
shame and it's way that I can't

1443
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:48,278
Out

1444
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:37,369
This is a tool of a grateful king.

1445
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,598
There wasn't much
to eat on this mountain.

1446
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,850
Until now.

1447
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:05,105
Tell me, how did
you cut me attractions, no?

1448
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:06,940
A bird helped us.

1449
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,693
Life is getting help from me, bitch.

1450
01:23:09,984 --> 01:23:12,237
Just as I will help you.

1451
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:14,364
You will help us.

1452
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:17,117
You think we need
help from a wounded coward.

1453
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:20,370
I may hold the blood of a king.

1454
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:26,292
But it was Mufasa who killed your son.

1455
01:23:27,293 --> 01:23:30,922
It was Mufasa who trapped you up here.

1456
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,717
Outspotted you at every turn.

1457
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:38,012
Now I will lead you to him and to Malele.

1458
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:39,723
Malele.

1459
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,309
Malele is nothing but a dream.

1460
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:44,978
