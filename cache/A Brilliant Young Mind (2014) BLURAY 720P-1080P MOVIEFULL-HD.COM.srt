1
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:02,606
I find any communication

2
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:06,407
of a non-mathematical
nature very difficult.

3
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:12,815
Because I don't talk much, people
think I don't have anything to say,

4
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:14,824
or that I'm stupid.

5
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:17,032
And that's not true.

6
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:20,949
I have lots of things to say.

7
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,949
I'm just afraid to say them.

8
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,907
I know that I'm strange
in lots of ways.

9
00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:38,948
I think I see the world in a
different way to other people.

10
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:43,448
I've always been like that.

11
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:00,031
Would you like to play with it?

12
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,281
Are you scared it will eat you?

13
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:05,156
No.

14
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:07,323
Is it because it's a toy?

15
00:02:08,065 --> 00:02:11,115
No. Because stegosauruses
aren't carnivores.

16
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:17,573
So, Nathan, what do you like?

17
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:21,072
I imagine there's things
that you don't like.

18
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:25,239
Maybe, say, when meal times change?

19
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:28,864
Yes. Yes, he is fussy about his food.

20
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:30,614
Nathan?

21
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:32,947
Nathan?

22
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:37,322
I... I like patterns.

23
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,364
And what does it feel like
to see a good pattern?

24
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:42,447
Nice.

25
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,614
They're pretty colours.

26
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,322
So, it's positive. Nathan is
certainly on the spectrum.

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,104
Traits of autism combined
with synaesthesia,

28
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:56,447
sensitive to a change
in light and pattern.

29
00:02:57,105 --> 00:03:01,646
These can be gifts, of course, but
they do come with some big challenges,

30
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:05,404
socially and emotionally, which will
stay with Nathan all of his life.

31
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:09,946
But there is no question;
That he's a unique young man.

32
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:22,687
Give Mum a wave. Bye, Mum.

33
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:23,988
Bye.

34
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,321
Bye.

35
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,696
You know what I was thinking?

36
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:39,562
You know, sometimes
it might seem like

37
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:42,446
we don't always understand
what it's like to be you.

38
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:46,812
It's like you've got
these special powers,

39
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,530
like a wizard.

40
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,904
And we're just Muggles that
don't understand how you do it.

41
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:56,737
It's like a different language to us.

42
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:03,195
But even though we don't always
understand each other, Nath,

43
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:08,029
it doesn't mean that any of us
ever stops loving each other.

44
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,237
Does that make sense?

45
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:14,112
Nathan, look at me.

46
00:04:18,145 --> 00:04:19,904
But you shouldn't be afraid.

Just hold my hand.

58
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:34,933
Please, Nathan. Nathan, just
hold my hand. Just this once.

59
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,651
It's okay. We'll do this together.

60
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:40,651
Come here, darling. Darling, come on.

61
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:44,109
Nathan. Please, don't. No, Nathan!

62
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:02,150
Hey.

63
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,525
Gosh.

64
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:09,066
That looks complicated.

65
00:07:09,808 --> 00:07:11,566
That's not schoolwork then?

66
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,941
Wait, why don't you try
and explain it to me?

67
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:17,441
I might be able to help you.

68
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,191
Hmm?

69
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:21,816
You can't.

70
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,108
Why not?

71
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:27,191
You're not clever enough.

72
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,857
So, Nathan, this is the big school.

73
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,098
When you're older, you'll
go here every single day.

74
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:38,690
Watch out.

75
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:41,232
We're just gonna start things early.

76
00:07:41,557 --> 00:07:43,357
It's nothing to be frightened about.

77
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,690
Don't run in the corridor.

78
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:50,232
Excuse me.

79
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,315
Excuse me!

80
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:02,107
There you go.

81
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,607
Oh, that's subtle.

82
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,556
- Ah, really subtle.
- What? We're not... We're not doing anything.

83
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,598
"We're not... We're not...
We're not doing anything."

84
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,857
Give me that now!

85
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:22,189
Is this drugs?

86
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,356
Go on, piss off.

87
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,398
We're so lucky.

88
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:48,347
- Mr Humphreys.
- Yep.

89
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,106
- Can I have a quick word?
- Yeah.

90
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,148
How old are you? Five?

91
00:08:57,806 --> 00:08:59,814
No, Nathan is nine.

92
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:03,346
His mum got in touch because of
Nathan's rather advanced interest

93
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:07,012
in numbers and patterns and his primary
schoolwork was no longer testing.

94
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,063
Mmm, I can see why,
yeah. Bit of algebra.

95
00:09:11,222 --> 00:09:13,397
Mmm, distance geometry.

96
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:15,188
Where'd you learn all this, mate?

97
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,929
Mr Humphreys just joined
our maths department.

98
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,887
He was a bit of a maths whizz
when he was young, Nathan.

99
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:24,762
- Not really, it was a long time ago.
- No, no, no.

100
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:28,230
He competed in the International
Mathematical Olympiad.

101
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:31,938
- Olympiad?
- Olympiad, yes. The IMO.

102
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:35,230
Did you know you could win
medals for maths, Nathan?

103
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:40,980
Just like sport, only for people who are
really, really strong up here instead.

104
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:46,062
Mrs Ellis, if Mr Humphreys is willing

105
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:51,187
I think that we can absolutely begin offering
Nathan some special advanced tuition.

106
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:53,687
Can't we?

107
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,979
Okay, yeah.

108
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:11,937
Why don't you walk properly?

109
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:14,979
That's very direct of you.

110
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:19,854
I've got multiple sclerosis.

111
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:23,062
What about you?

112
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:24,937
Why are you weird?

113
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:30,270
- I've got special powers.
- Mmm-hmm.

114
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:32,436
Can you fly?

115
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:34,812
Can you turn things to ice?

116
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,552
Are you really good at maths?

117
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,719
Ah, yeah. Ah, fair play.

118
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,812
Well, listen, I should tell you,
I'm not a very good teacher.

119
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,844
I barely encourage myself
to get out of bed,

120
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,719
let alone inspire some
kid with special powers

121
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,386
who wants to spend all his
spare time doing maths.

122
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:50,895
So as long as we're clear.

123
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:53,011
What's that for?

124
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:55,427
It's to give it a shake.
It's my hand, isn't it?

125
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:58,344
- It's what men do when they agree.
- I don't like doing that.

126
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:00,677
Yeah, well, we all have to do
things we don't like doing,

127
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:03,020
but we fucking do them,
don't we? So give it here.

128
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,853
What does "fucking" mean?

129
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:07,978
All in good time, son.

130
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:10,261
Right then.

131
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:12,478
We'll start with some
probability, shall we?

132
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:16,561
Like what's the probability of
me remembering any of this shit.

133
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,801
I can't hear you.

134
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:24,352
I said, let's do tree
diagrams, shall we?

135
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:26,385
Mr Humphreys?

136
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,102
Yes, Mr Ellis.

137
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:30,477
What was the Olympiad like?

138
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,602
Mind your own business, nosy.

139
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:36,352
Boom.

140
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:38,811
Do you know what this means?

141
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:41,426
Go on, Sir Nod-A-Lot, tell
me, what does it mean?

142
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:42,686
A toss.

143
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,436
Toss?

144
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:46,227
How dare you?

145
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:48,936
Yeah, the coin toss. Well done.

00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,883
Nathan! Breakfast!

163
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:02,674
<i>And let P denote the
perimeter of the hexagon.</i>

164
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:05,184
Nathan! Breakfast!

165
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:11,341
<i>Prove that RA plus RC plus RE</i>

166
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:15,475
<i>is greater than or
equal to P over 2.</i>

167
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:19,767
Here.

168
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,267
- It doesn't matter if you don't get in.
- Of course it matters.

169
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:28,641
Got twisted. Okay? Good.

170
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:32,766
Good luck.

171
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,548
- Get a job.
- You get a job.

172
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,215
- I'm trying. I've handed CVs out.
- You've got a CV?

173
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:41,965
Yeah, obviously. I don't wanna sit
on me arse all day, you know.

174
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,632
- And even If I do, you're sat next to me.
- No, I'm not.

175
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,423
Yeah, you are. Joined
at the friggin' hip.

176
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:49,474
Are you listening to
our conversation? Eh?

177
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:51,933
- No.
- What?

178
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:54,308
- No, I wasn't.
- Are you sure about that?

179
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:57,308
- Better not be.
- No.

180
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:29,047
- You're late.
- Sorry, mate.

181
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,973
I had a quick look at it first. Shh.

182
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:34,140
It's a piece of piss, really.

183
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:36,182
Well, not really, but...

184
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,890
You know, just do your best.

185
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:42,182
It's the biggest day of
your life, mate, innit?

186
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,473
Don't feel any pressure.

187
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:46,631
I'm a bit nervous.

188
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:47,973
Are you nervous?

189
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:49,714
- A little bit.
- Well, you shouldn't be.

190
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:51,047
Because you're brilliant.

191
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:52,307
Are you ready?

192
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:53,756
Yeah.

193
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:55,015
Yeah?

194
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,306
On your marks, get set...

195
00:14:57,672 --> 00:14:59,056
Come on, my son.

196
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,472
I'll just be over there, out the way.

197
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,213
<i>Question one.</i>

198
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:08,856
<i>"Are there infinitely many pairs of
positive integers 'mn', such..."</i>

199
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,005
<i>Question one.</i>

200
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:19,546
<i>Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers 'mn'</i>

201
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:22,514
<i>such that both m divides
n squared + 1 and...</i>

202
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,005
<i>Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers 'mn'</i>

203
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:38,514
<i>such that both m divides n squared +
1 and that n divides m squared + 1?</i>

204
00:15:47,338 --> 00:15:49,129
When will we find out?

205
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,430
Uh, about a week, probably.

206
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:56,221
It's all right, mate. Relax to
the max. Take a chill pill.

207
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:00,221
Talking of which,
this hill's a killer.

208
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,138
Do you mind if we
take the weight off?

209
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,805
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hang on.

210
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:11,846
Go on then, hit me.

211
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,388
- Hit you?
- Ask me the fucking question!

212
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:22,138
Why did things go wrong
for you, at the Olympiad?

213
00:16:23,838 --> 00:16:25,970
There's lots of reasons, really.

214
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,429
My "thing" was kicking
off around that time.

215
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,304
My ailment.

216
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:38,804
Cutting me down in the
prime of my life.

217
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,887
I just sort of lost it.

218
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,679
I can't lose it.

219
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:49,679
Nathan, you haven't gotta
prove anything, all right?

220
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:54,887
What's important is that you enjoy doing
it... maths. And you do, don't you?

221
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:58,253
So whether you get
on the team or not,

222
00:16:58,254 --> 00:17:00,762
you're gonna do amazing
things in the future.

223
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:03,887
You haven't.

224
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:07,054
Well, thanks a lot.

225
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,261
You charming little bastard.

226
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:16,636
Hi. Hi.

227
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,793
Um, can I order number 47, please,

228
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:21,627
with, um,

229
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:25,386
seven prawn balls and a
small chips, thank you.

230
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:30,969
It come with six balls, number 47.

231
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:33,303
Yeah, I know. Usually...

232
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:34,794
Sorry, are you new?

233
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:37,127
It's just we come here all the time

234
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:39,877
and it's usually just fine,
you give us an extra ball.

235
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:42,419
Number 48 is a large prawn ball meal.

236
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,252
You get nine balls, large
chips and crackers.

237
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:46,502
Yeah, I know.

238
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:48,127
No. Sorry.

239
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:49,210
Sorry.

240
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:54,501
No, he doesn't like, um, crackers
and he likes to have a small chips.

241
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,177
I'm sorry, it's just, uh...

242
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,376
My son, he's quite picky

243
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:02,668
and he needs the meal
number to be a prime number

244
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:05,918
and there to be a prime
number of prawn balls.

245
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,126
And, um,

246
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,751
if he had nine balls it
wouldn't be a prime number

247
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:12,751
and number 48 isn't...

248
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:14,584
Isn't... Isn't a prime...

249
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:17,135
Is it? Is it? I don't
know. Yes, I do.

250
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,927
Um, yes, no, I'm right.

251
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:21,969
47.

252
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,469
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

253
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,426
There we go. A big fat "well done".

254
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:45,884
It's all spilt out.

255
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,551
Oh.

256
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:53,917
No, no, it's fine. Nathan, Nathan,
don't get upset. It's fine.

257
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:55,000
- No, Mum, it's not fine.
- It's fine.

258
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,051
- You don't do anything right.
- I'm sorry?

259
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:58,833
Everything you do is wrong.

260
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,583
Oh... Oh, well, I'm sorry, okay?

261
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:03,093
Thank you so much!

262
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:11,551
Sorry.

263
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:24,508
That doctor didn't know his herbivores
from his carnivores, did he?

264
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,383
And do you know why?

265
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,800
Because he's not as smart as you.

266
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,883
Is there someone else you
know that has what you have?

267
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,092
Einstein.

268
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,425
Okay.

269
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,217
But...

270
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,925
I just want you to know

271
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:51,592
that you're fine the
way you are, Nathan.

272
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,041
So do you want one of them ice
cream things for dessert or what?

273
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,249
- Dad!
- What?

274
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,374
Oh, no! Not again. Ah!

275
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,248
- What do I do? Do I lean forward?
- No, back!

276
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,049
Back? Oh, no, this is a disaster.

277
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:13,799
I know. I know. Give me this.

278
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:34,966
As promised, I come bearing news.

279
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:41,632
Are you sure it's okay if I stand out
here? I don't wanna put you out.

280
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,132
- Yeah.
- Invite me in, Nathan.

281
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,091
- Come in.
- Thank you very much.

282
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:54,173
Put the kettle on, then.

283
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:58,548
- Put the kettle on what?
- It's okay. I'll do it.

284
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,122
- Hi, Julie.
- Hi, Mr Humphreys.

285
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:03,298
- How are you?
- Very good, thank you.

286
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:05,289
- Thanks for coming round.
- I got it.

287
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,747
Oh! Oh, my goodness. Is
that what I think it is?

288
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:10,381
I hope so, otherwise it would
have been a wasted journey.

289
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,289
Um, you open it.

290
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,590
- You want me to open it? All right then.
- Yeah.

291
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:23,131
“Dear Mr Ellis, I am writing to let
you know that unfortunately...

292
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:29,664
"you have successfully earned a place
on the United Kingdom maths squad!"

293
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,997
Oh, my goodness! Oh, Nathan, darling.

294
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:33,539
- Well, that's good news, isn't it?
- Oh, my gosh!

295
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,548
- Well done, mate.
- Oh, well done.

296
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:36,954
Why is that unfortunate?

297
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:38,121
No, I was having a joke, mate.

298
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,954
It says the training camp's
in Taiwan this year.

299
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:42,413
- Have you ever been on a plane before?
- No. He's not.

300
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:44,755
- Well, that's exciting, isn't it?
- Um...

301
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:46,547
But...

302
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,630
I should study.

303
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:52,964
- Are you leaving now, or...
- Nathan.

304
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,922
He doesn't mean that.

305
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:57,130
Probably, yeah.

306
00:21:57,455 --> 00:21:58,797
- Okay.
- Well...

307
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:01,089
- I'm gonna go and study.
- Okay.

308
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:02,788
Well done, mate.

309
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,130
- He is pleased. He's...
- I know he is, yeah.

310
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:09,496
I'm gonna have something stronger
than a cup of tea, actually, I think.

311
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:11,163
- I'm gonna have a glass of wine.
- Okay.

312
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,246
Would you like...

313
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,829
I should probably shoot off.

314
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,246
Okay, no, that's fine.

315
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:17,089
But I mean, if you're gonna have one.

316
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:27,421
Actually, I was thinking maybe,
you know you'd like to...

317
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,370
To join us next month,

318
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:31,921
take him to the airport.

319
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:35,004
I know that would make Nathan happy.

320
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:43,463
I should probably tell
you before they...

321
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,921
I'm taking a bit of
a break from work.

322
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,495
Uh, it's a bit of a forced break.

323
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:50,963
It's a bit like I'm
being fired, basically.

324
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,588
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,662
But I wanted to say to you
even though I'm not working

326
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:58,620
for the school any more, I'd really
like to carry on teaching Nathan.

327
00:22:58,621 --> 00:22:59,078
Really?

328
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,213
Yeah. I mean, if that's
all right with you?

329
00:23:01,954 --> 00:23:04,120
- That would be amazing.
- Obviously for no money.

330
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:06,837
Oh! Jesus Christ!

331
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:12,295
Oh, my God!

332
00:23:13,037 --> 00:23:14,503
That's a bit of a weird one.

333
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:16,878
- Thanks for the drink and stuff.
- Not at all.

334
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,494
- Don't worry about it. All right.
- Yeah, no, good.

335
00:23:19,495 --> 00:23:21,536
- Will you be all right? Okay.
- Yeah. Cheers, Julie. Thank you.

336
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:23,295
- Thank you. Take care.
- All right.

337
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:36,545
We were just talking, Nathan.

338
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:40,420
I was looking at Jupiter.

339
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,712
I didn't do it on purpose.

340
00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:46,753
It was just...

341
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:52,002
It was just nice, you know,
to have someone to talk to.

342
00:23:53,202 --> 00:23:55,086
For once. For me.

343
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,169
Sometimes I feel a bit alone.

344
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:07,752
Okay.

345
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:35,992
What else can we write?
Numbers? Say a prime number.

346
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:39,710
- Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
- 353.

347
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:44,659
353!

348
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,992
Whoa!

349
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:47,659
Just in time.

350
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,867
Perfect timing.

351
00:24:48,868 --> 00:24:50,835
Fireworks night again, is it?

352
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:53,909
He's letting you hold
his hand, isn't he?

353
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,335
The sparkler helps.

354
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,085
Come on, Nathan.

355
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,918
It's time to change the fish.

356
00:24:59,327 --> 00:25:02,617
If you come now you can get
an extra scoop of ice cream.

357
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:04,492
Extra scoop of Ice cream.
And what do I get?

358
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:05,992
- You don't get anything.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

359
00:25:05,993 --> 00:25:08,034
You're lucky I'm here, that's all.

360
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:10,293
- I'm lucky.
- Yeah, you get me.

361
00:25:21,784 --> 00:25:24,376
- I like a man in a shed.
- Ah...

362
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,658
- Go and get me ice cream.
- But you're not getting...

363
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,283
I told you, you're not getting...

364
00:25:28,284 --> 00:25:29,834
Ice cream, Julie!

365
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:38,792
Nathan?

366
00:25:39,617 --> 00:25:40,876
Jesus.

367
00:25:42,784 --> 00:25:44,042
Nathan!

368
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:47,658
Oh!

369
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,167
Nathan, It's okay.

370
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:51,991
Nathan, I'm not angry.

371
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:53,283
Nathan!

372
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:55,917
Michael? Michael?

373
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,574
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

374
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,824
I'm quite looking forward to
this in a weird sort of way.

375
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:19,083
Yeah, I know.

376
00:26:19,283 --> 00:26:21,250
Little trip down memory lane.

377
00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:24,041
- Okay. We all ready?
- Hang on.

378
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:26,416
This is for you.

379
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:31,583
Nathan...

380
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,583
What do you say?

381
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:36,865
- Thank you.
- Well, I used to use them,

382
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:38,240
so they're probably cursed.

383
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:40,615
But, you know, it might remind
you of home or something.

384
00:26:40,616 --> 00:26:42,115
- Very lovely of you.
- Right then.

385
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:44,907
- Shall we get this show on the road?
- Yep. Let's go.

386
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:46,166
Nathan?

387
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,031
Can you get in the back with me?

388
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:52,707
Nathan, I think Mr Humphreys will
be more comfortable in the front.

389
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:54,906
It's okay, darling.

390
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,915
Darling, darling, it's okay.

391
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,874
I'll drive carefully.

392
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:01,374
No, It's all right.

393
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:04,749
I'm actually surprisingly bendy.

394
00:27:23,615 --> 00:27:25,124
Christ!

395
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:27,582
It's Tricky Dicky, look out!

396
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,123
All right, Richard?

397
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,498
Oh!

398
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:35,238
Martin Humphreys. '95.

399
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,863
Humphreys! Yeah, hell's teeth. Yes.

400
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,498
Yes. The last I heard,
you were, um...

401
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:43,248
- Teaching, was it?
- Yes.

402
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:46,072
Yeah. At what university? I can't...

403
00:27:46,073 --> 00:27:48,780
- It's a secondary school.
- Ah, yeah.

404
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:50,581
Wasted opportunity, this one.

405
00:27:50,614 --> 00:27:52,988
So what are you doing here?
You flying off to Ibiza?

406
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:57,363
Fleeing the world of reason and rationality
for some hallucinogenic escape?

407
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:59,789
No, I'm dropping this
one off, actually.

408
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:01,956
Ah!

409
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:04,081
Nathan Ellis, I presume. Yes.

410
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:05,956
The dragon. Ah!

411
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,447
And where have you been
lying dormant, eh?

412
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:09,988
It's not often we have a mind like
yours spring up off the radar.

413
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,248
He's mine.

414
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:13,947
I mean, I'm his... Um,
I've been teaching him.

415
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:17,279
Ah, the plot thickens!

416
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,529
Well, we'll get you
signed in, shall we, eh?

417
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,788
Just a quick goodbye and then avanti.

418
00:28:21,863 --> 00:28:24,663
Oh, well, Nathan, darling.

419
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,247
Um...

420
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:29,237
You got your phone on you? Yeah?

421
00:28:29,238 --> 00:28:30,497
Yeah.

422
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:33,538
Make sure you ring me as
soon as you land, yeah?

423
00:28:37,238 --> 00:28:39,580
- All right. Bye, then.
- Bye.

424
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:53,913
Sorry.

425
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:58,122
Time to meet your peers, Nathan.

426
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:02,996
Mingle. Mingle.

427
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,996
Um, watch your step, there's
a chess game going on.

428
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:14,162
Hey. How do you do?

429
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,204
How do I do what?

430
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:20,162
I mean, what's your name?

431
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,246
- Nathan.
- I'm Isaac.

432
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,829
I'm guessing this is your first
maths camp? You'll be fine.

433
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:28,704
Best thing is just to dive in.

434
00:29:29,154 --> 00:29:31,121
Come. Sit down.

435
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:33,111
I mean, can you believe
the Chinese team?

436
00:29:33,112 --> 00:29:35,486
They won six golds again last year.

437
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:39,986
Yes, although upon recent evidential proof
I'd expect this to possibly change,

438
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,361
if I'm allowed to split
infinitives, "to possibly change".

439
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:45,652
Which I believe I technically am now.

440
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:48,444
Of course, one of the most famous
infinitive splits of all time

441
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:52,319
came in the introductory lines of
Star Trek, "to boldly go," and...

442
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,152
I think if the writers of a popular
American television series

443
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:58,277
can get away with it for 40 years,
then, really, any of us can.

444
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:00,194
Don't worry, he's always like this.

445
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,527
Everyone, this is Nathan.

446
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:04,485
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hello, Nathan.

447
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:05,745
Hi, I'm Pav.

448
00:30:07,403 --> 00:30:08,527
Paf?

449
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:10,453
P-A-V, Pav.

450
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,995
Pav is from India. Pav.

451
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,485
Actually I'm from Chipping Norton.

452
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:17,985
Yes, but of course I meant your
origins, not your birthplace,

453
00:30:17,986 --> 00:30:20,069
before we open that
little Pandora's box.

454
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,036
Oh, dear!

455
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,745
Seat belts on, please. Seat belts on.

456
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:32,535
Right, don't sit at the front next
to the driver, that's my seat.

457
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,410
Right, away you go, driver.

458
00:30:36,027 --> 00:30:41,994
Now, you are 16 of the cleverest
young brains in this country.

459
00:30:42,485 --> 00:30:46,276
Now, outside you might be
considered nerds or geeks

460
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,068
or whatever the insult
'du jour' might be.

461
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:52,202
But here, you are among
kindred spirits.

462
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,651
Now, assuming you're capable
of basic arithmetic,

463
00:30:55,652 --> 00:31:00,077
you'll know that there are six places
available yet more than six of you.

464
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:04,035
Which means that this, to a large
extent, is about whittling you down.

465
00:31:04,485 --> 00:31:08,452
Now, we will be training with four
other national teams in Taiwan.

466
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:10,568
And after some delicate
diplomatic negotiation,

467
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:14,076
I can confirm that the
Chinese will be one of them.

468
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:16,817
Now we should, of course, be cordial

469
00:31:16,818 --> 00:31:20,733
as it falls to us to host the
competition this year, in Cambridge.

470
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:23,076
But that doesn't mean
we can't be ruthless.

471
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,951
Now, I want you up there with
the Chinese, top of the table.

472
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:32,650
And I will consider it an abhorrent
failure to include a candidate

473
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:34,826
who does not win a medal.

474
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:40,493
Be under no illusion. This
is all about winning.

475
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,951
Although that doesn't
mean it can't be fun.

476
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:50,576
55,89, 144,

477
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:53,910
233, 377,

478
00:31:53,943 --> 00:31:55,025
610.

479
00:31:55,026 --> 00:32:00,825
987, 1,597, 2,584.

480
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,075
I like the Fibonacci sequence, too.

481
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:08,075
Invaluable for music compositions.

482
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,450
So you're new.

483
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,075
Fresh meat.

484
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:13,909
How's that going?

485
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:20,200
Okay, so you're the shy type.

486
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,034
Makes a nice change, to be honest.

487
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,367
Most of these weirdos just wanna show off
about how much maths junk they know.

488
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,909
What?

489
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:32,784
Nothing.

490
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:35,284
It's just I'm usually the weird one.

491
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:40,034
They do all seem good
at maths, though.

492
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,075
Yeah.

493
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:46,908
Here you are neither weird nor the
best mathematician, I'm afraid.

494
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,783
You are painstakingly average.

495
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:28,189
Post-Olympiad of course,
I'll need to branch out into

496
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,189
modern theoretical physics if I'm going
to describe a unified field theory

497
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,532
for the four fundamental
forces of nature.

498
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:37,407
Are you one of the fundamental
forces of nature, Luke?

499
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,231
No.

500
00:33:39,232 --> 00:33:41,615
But you are terribly
gifted, aren't you?

501
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:45,240
Yes. Gifted but not arrogant, Isaac.

502
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,489
Here we are. Maths camp, Taipei.

503
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:17,281
Your home for the next two weeks.

504
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:20,989
Right, everybody out.

505
00:34:21,314 --> 00:34:22,938
Don't forget your umbrellas.

506
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:24,822
There's a typhoon coming.

507
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:29,521
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome to Taiwan.

508
00:34:29,522 --> 00:34:31,313
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello. I'm Richard.

509
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:32,396
My name is Jason.

510
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:34,230
Nice to meet you, Jai-Jen.

511
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:35,813
- Jason. Yeah.
- Jason. I'm sorry.

512
00:34:35,814 --> 00:34:36,896
Jason. It was the accent.

513
00:34:36,897 --> 00:34:37,980
Hello. Nice to meet you.

514
00:34:37,981 --> 00:34:40,531
Right, come on, get
your bags. Chop-chop.

515
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:43,364
Can someone help the man, please?

516
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:46,072
It's not the days of
the Empire. Thank you.

517
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:50,864
Oh!

518
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,906
Here comes the typhoon!

519
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:55,946
Batten down the hatches.

520
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:00,979
Taiwanese.

521
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,770
Currently below us in the rankings,

522
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:05,363
but they're our hosts, so
we should be gracious.

523
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,030
Here's the real competition.

524
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:11,946
The Chinese.

525
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:14,729
Guys, check out the board.

526
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,155
Is she messing around with
the Goldbach Conjecture?

527
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:18,562
Maybe it's what they do for fun.

528
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:21,645
Mmm, I love cracking unprovable
theorems in my free time.

529
00:35:21,646 --> 00:35:23,645
No one has proven
that it's unprovable.

530
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:26,655
Right, come on. They won't bite.

531
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,520
Ah! The enemy!

532
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:32,988
Surrender or die!

533
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:34,812
Deng Laoshi.

534
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:36,354
Dear Richard, welcome.

535
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:38,145
- Such an honour to have you here.
- Thank you.

536
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:40,529
- Ni hao.
- Ni hao.

537
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:42,945
Students, hello.

538
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,654
I hope you are ready
for some mathematics.

539
00:35:58,354 --> 00:36:01,487
Now, pay attention, Team UK.

540
00:36:01,937 --> 00:36:05,279
Deng Laoshi and I have decided to
pair you up with a Chinese buddy

541
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:07,936
and you should make the
most of this opportunity,

542
00:36:07,937 --> 00:36:11,519
or, more to the point, you should
spy on your Chinese counterpart

543
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,612
and bring their trade
secrets to Blighty.

544
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,695
Very funny, Richard.

545
00:36:16,562 --> 00:36:18,445
Uh, Luke Shelton.

546
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:20,987
Zhang Zhi.

547
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:27,361
Hello. My name is Zhang Zhi.

548
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,903
Luke.

549
00:36:31,644 --> 00:36:33,361
Nathan Ellis.

550
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:35,069
Zhang Mei.

551
00:36:47,186 --> 00:36:50,319
Nice to meet you. My
name is Zhang Mei.

552
00:36:57,894 --> 00:36:59,736
Pavinder Kamdar.

553
00:37:11,143 --> 00:37:13,068
This is Xiao Tong.

554
00:37:13,602 --> 00:37:15,610
- Nice to meet you.
- Ni hao.

555
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,777
And you know my uncle.

556
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:22,693
Nathan. The lucky one
learning from my niece, huh?

557
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,902
We have high expectations for her.

558
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,267
And for you, of course.

559
00:37:30,268 --> 00:37:32,777
High expectations all round, I say.

560
00:37:34,893 --> 00:37:36,152
Zhang Mei.

561
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:38,110
Oh.

562
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:43,934
Yes, of course, though it may be the
world's fastest developing nation

563
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:48,068
some of the cuisine doesn't seem
to have advanced quite so quickly.

564
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:50,892
- Careful. Careful.
- Oh, look at this.

565
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:54,901
- Thank you. Uh, sh... zh...
- Xie xie. - Shie Shie.

566
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:58,100
- You put this in there?
- You put the raw food in this.

567
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:59,558
- In the peanut sauce?
- Oh...

568
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:01,817
- No.
- Okay, okay, I'll do that.

569
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:08,192
You don't use them... like that.

570
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,067
Hold it like this and
pinch it like a lobster.

571
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:13,734
Yeah.

572
00:38:14,351 --> 00:38:18,859
So, Nathan, what was your
score on the mock IMO paper?

573
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:22,766
Zhang Mei got the full seven
marks on questions one to three.

574
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,984
Though her combinatorics
is her weakest area.

575
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:29,901
I'm really not... not that good.

576
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,568
No, but you soon will be.

577
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:13,525
Nathan, are you okay?

578
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:17,525
*I'm just hot.

579
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:20,525
*You can speak Chinese?

580
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:24,824
*-I learned on my own
from a book. *-Oh, great!

581
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:31,824
*-My Chinese is not as good
as your English. *- Oh, no.

582
00:39:32,724 --> 00:39:35,982
Almost everyone on the
camp speaks English.

583
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,107
It is expected of us.

584
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:41,015
You speak it very well.

585
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:42,774
Thank you.

586
00:39:42,891 --> 00:39:44,482
So do you.

587
00:39:44,557 --> 00:39:46,607
Chinese, I mean.

588
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:50,482
You don't say a lot
in English at all.

589
00:40:10,806 --> 00:40:13,481
This room seems
reasonably symmetrical.

590
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,648
Apart from the window.

591
00:40:16,973 --> 00:40:18,055
I don't know about you,

592
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:21,440
but I don't appreciate this
forced proximity to each other.

593
00:40:24,973 --> 00:40:26,981
I'll take this side.

594
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,023
I'm going to the bathroom.

595
00:41:10,764 --> 00:41:13,855
Oh, you dirty little bastard.

596
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,897
Go on, then.

597
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:20,355
Oh, my God, that is
absolutely disgusting.

598
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,439
Boom! Wanker.

599
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:27,897
Yeah?

600
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,814
- Yes. Who's this?
- It's...

601
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,689
Nathan? Is that you?

602
00:41:34,555 --> 00:41:36,637
How are you doing? How's
it going out there?

603
00:41:36,638 --> 00:41:40,396
Everything's different and
everyone's cleverer than me.

604
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:44,563
Look, Nathan, it's your
first night away and...

605
00:41:45,596 --> 00:41:48,813
And first nights away are
always really, really shit.

606
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:52,188
I mean, it's only a fortnight, innit?

607
00:41:52,263 --> 00:41:54,271
That's 14 days. And what's 14?

608
00:41:56,554 --> 00:42:00,262
- A positive integer.
- Positive integer.

609
00:42:00,263 --> 00:42:02,021
So think positively.

610
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:04,104
What is it the square root of?

611
00:42:04,638 --> 00:42:06,470
196.

612
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:09,063
Whose prime factorisation is?

613
00:42:09,638 --> 00:42:11,563
Two squared by seven squared.

614
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:13,771
See?

615
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:43,228
<i>One, two, buckle my shoe.</i>

616
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:45,562
<i>Three, four.</i>

617
00:42:46,012 --> 00:42:48,353
<i>♪ Knock on my door. ♪</i>

618
00:42:48,678 --> 00:42:53,636
<i>♪ Five, six, pick
up your sticks ♪</i>

619
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:58,562
<i>♪ Seven, eight, lay
them straight ♪</i>

620
00:42:59,137 --> 00:43:01,312
<i>♪ One, two. ♪</i>

621
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,978
<i>♪ Buckle my shoe ♪</i>

622
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:06,352
<i>♪ Three, four... ♪</i>

623
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,894
Strong squad this year?

624
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,269
Testing my team for
weaknesses, Richard?

625
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:21,311
You should relax more, not
take it so seriously.

626
00:43:22,136 --> 00:43:25,269
It's all right for you, you got the
best in the world to choose from.

627
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:29,019
But having your niece
on the team, Deng?

628
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:31,727
I mean, really?

629
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,061
You'll see.

630
00:43:38,552 --> 00:43:39,885
Luke, I don't care.

631
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:43,135
Civilizations have used 10, not 12,
digits to count for millennia.

632
00:43:43,136 --> 00:43:46,760
Yes, for purely primitive reasons, and the
fact that we have 10 digits on our hands.

633
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:49,384
My argument is that if we use base 12

634
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:52,384
it is an infinitely superior
system, and more logical.

635
00:43:52,385 --> 00:43:54,884
It takes 12 months for the
Earth to orbit the sun,

636
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:57,425
there are 12 hours a night
and 12 hours a day,

637
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,925
and each of those hours there
are 12 five-minute increments.

638
00:43:59,926 --> 00:44:01,643
And what do you think, Nathan?

639
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,143
You a member of the
Dozenalist Society?

640
00:44:04,385 --> 00:44:05,768
Uh, I don't know.

641
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:07,393
Sorry.

642
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:11,810
People disagreeing with my opinion
is one thing, but no opinion?

643
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,351
You might as well not be here.

644
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:18,342
The vertices of a regular 72-gon.

645
00:44:18,343 --> 00:44:19,717
The vertices of a regular 72-gon

646
00:44:19,718 --> 00:44:23,259
are each coloured red, green
or blue in equal amounts.

647
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,884
Show that we can always choose four
red, four green or four blue vertices

648
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:31,925
such that each monochromatic set
form a congruent quadrilateral.

649
00:44:31,926 --> 00:44:35,633
Yes, so, of course, the whole question
can be trivialised by Ramsey Theory.

650
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:38,142
No, sorry, Luke. There were
other hands up before you.

651
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,924
Well, I've already answered it now.

652
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:41,934
Really? You think so?

653
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:45,424
Is anyone here convinced
by Luke's answer?

654
00:44:45,425 --> 00:44:47,549
"It's interesting you ask,
“is anyone convinced?"

655
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,633
rather than "is anyone
not convinced?"

656
00:44:49,634 --> 00:44:51,892
- I'm not convinced.
- I'm not convinced.

657
00:44:52,634 --> 00:44:55,466
Nathan, would you join in, please?

658
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:56,934
This isn't a holiday.

659
00:44:57,675 --> 00:44:59,517
Do you have a proof to share?

660
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:04,184
That's a disappointment.

661
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:06,559
Ben?

662
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:10,934
Muirhead's inequality
and Schur's inequality?

663
00:45:13,384 --> 00:45:16,892
It's interesting stuff, Nathan, but
you do over-complicate everything.

664
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:20,507
Things can be much simpler
than they initially appear.

665
00:45:20,508 --> 00:45:22,641
Did Mr Humphreys not tell you that?

666
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:26,224
Mind you, he never did quite live
up to his potential, that one.

667
00:45:26,383 --> 00:45:28,599
It's because his illness
was getting worse.

668
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,391
His illness?

669
00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:33,308
Is he still using that excuse?

670
00:45:34,341 --> 00:45:36,933
Stephen Hawking has done
all right on far worse.

671
00:45:37,216 --> 00:45:40,590
No, I'm afraid it wasn't Mr
Humphreys' body that failed him,

672
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:42,641
it was his character.

673
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:45,225
He just couldn't stay with it.

674
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:24,099
<i>♪ If you must wait ♪</i>

675
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:30,557
<i>♪ Wait for them here in
my arms as I shake ♪</i>

676
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:40,140
<i>♪ If you must weep... ♪</i>

677
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:43,307
- Is that strong enough for you?
- That's fine.

678
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:46,422
- No sugar?
- No sugar, sweet enough for me.

679
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:48,723
- How are you doing?
- Never better.

680
00:46:53,256 --> 00:46:57,056
<i>♪ You must mourn, my love ♪</i>

681
00:46:57,464 --> 00:47:02,431
<i>Mourn with the moon and

682
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:09,473

683
00:47:11,423 --> 00:47:14,348
<i>♪ Don't do it alone ♪</i>

684
00:47:16,214 --> 00:47:19,348
So, as well as your
cycle of amitriptyline,

685
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:24,889
you were prescribed glucocorticosteroids
for your latest relapse.

686
00:47:24,964 --> 00:47:26,672
You can't have got through
all of those already.

687
00:47:26,673 --> 00:47:27,755
I wouldn't have thought.

688
00:47:27,756 --> 00:47:29,422
Someone broke Into my car.

689
00:47:29,423 --> 00:47:30,681
Unfortunate.

690
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,587
- Mention it to the police?
- No, there's no point, is there?

691
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:36,629
Because they only stole
the pills and some CD's.

692
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,212
Bee Gees' greatest hits.
Which I was gutted about

693
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:41,921
because I bloody love those
squeaky little bastards.

694
00:47:41,922 --> 00:47:45,129
So to be clear, these are not
anti-depressants, Mr Humphreys.

695
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,305
I mean, that's good because
I'm not depressed.

696
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:49,212
You know, maybe you
wanna change your mind

697
00:47:49,213 --> 00:47:51,888
about going to one of
those groups I mentioned?

698
00:47:53,422 --> 00:47:56,337
What, sit in a circle and listen to
how crap everybody else's life is?

699
00:47:56,338 --> 00:48:00,847
- You know, sharing your issues might help.
- Sharing my issues?

700
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:04,337
Like how I hate wobbling
about like a twat,

701
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:07,337
how I've started to lose control
of my bladder and it won't be long

702
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:09,879
before I lose control of my
arse and start to shit myself.

703
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,962
So, be careful, 'cause I
could go at any second.

704
00:48:11,963 --> 00:48:14,263
And then, to top it all off...

705
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,429
My dick doesn't work.

706
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,128
Is that the sort of thing you
think I should be sharing?

707
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:22,387
Yeah.

708
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:24,387
Perhaps.

709
00:48:24,504 --> 00:48:28,054
No, but what I really want,
Martin, is for you to

710
00:48:28,712 --> 00:48:29,971
not give up.

711
00:48:36,337 --> 00:48:39,179
I should probably take this
because it's my crack dealer.

712
00:48:41,879 --> 00:48:43,971
- Hello?
- Hello, Martin.

713
00:48:44,754 --> 00:48:47,295
It... It's Julie. Yes.

714
00:48:47,296 --> 00:48:49,137
That's right. Julie Ellis.

715
00:48:54,004 --> 00:48:55,596
- Hi. Hi.
- Hiya.

716
00:48:56,046 --> 00:48:57,920
- Thanks for coming round. It's...
- It's all right.

717
00:48:57,921 --> 00:48:59,928
- Yeah.
- You sure you're ready for this?

718
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:02,303
Absolutely.

719
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:05,544
Okay, then. Let's begin at
the beginning, shall we?

720
00:49:05,545 --> 00:49:06,803
Mmm-hmm.

721
00:49:08,836 --> 00:49:11,085
It's all right. It's like
anything. It's scary at first.

722
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:13,794
But then when you get your head
round it, you'll be all right.

723
00:49:13,795 --> 00:49:15,053
Uh...

724
00:49:16,628 --> 00:49:17,886
Has he, um...

725
00:49:19,836 --> 00:49:21,335
Has he rung you again?

726
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:22,928
- Nathan? No.
- Yeah.

727
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,877
Now, look, I'm sure he didn't
mean anything by it, calling me.

728
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:28,710
It's just he doesn't think
sometimes, does he?

729
00:49:28,711 --> 00:49:32,261
Oh, well, no, he does think a
lot. Just mainly about maths.

730
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:34,928
Which is fine, you know.

731
00:49:35,211 --> 00:49:38,502
He just thinks I'm a bit of an idiot
because I failed at maths at school.

732
00:49:38,503 --> 00:49:40,710
I mean, I got everything else,
it was just, you know...

733
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:42,085
Mmm.

734
00:49:42,086 --> 00:49:45,260
It's why I wanna do this really,
you know, get into his head more.

735
00:49:46,544 --> 00:49:49,668
- I'm not making sense. Shut up, Julie.
- No, you're making perfect sense.

736
00:49:49,669 --> 00:49:51,427
- Not really.
- No, you are.

737
00:49:52,544 --> 00:49:55,209
I mean, the thing about
maths, as with any subject,

738
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,918
I think if you have an inspirational
teacher, um, then you'll be away.

739
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:00,293
Which is where I come in.

740
00:50:00,294 --> 00:50:02,418
Mister Inspirational.

741
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:03,927
Okay, then.

742
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,959
Let's start with something...

743
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,209
- Yeah. Pythagoras.
- Okay.

744
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,751
- Uh, can you say that word?
- Hypotenuse.

745
00:50:11,752 --> 00:50:14,135
Bless you.

746
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:16,594
You all right? You got a
little bit of a cold?

747
00:50:20,252 --> 00:50:23,376
<i>It's time to step up, mofo,
and see what you can do.</i>

748
00:50:23,377 --> 00:50:28,968
Keep your Pythag theorem to yourself I
raise you B minus C plus F equals 2.

749
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:34,667
- Who's next? Who's next?
- Your turn, Luke.

750
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:36,042
Go, Luke.

751
00:50:36,043 --> 00:50:37,917
Go, Luke. Go, Luke.

752
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:40,509
Thank you, but I really
don't see the point.

753
00:50:40,626 --> 00:50:43,625
Apart from succumbing to
testosterone-fuelled irrationality.

754
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:45,292
It's because it's funny, Luke.

755
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,667
- Don't you have a sense of humour?
- Just ignore him.

756
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:50,125
He's here to bring the mood down
as always, so don't let him.

757
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:52,593
- I'm here to do maths.
- You're just a regular quadrilateral.

758
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,125
- Okay, take it, Ben.
- <i>UK, make some noise!</i>

759
00:50:57,126 --> 00:51:00,333
<i>'Cause I'm talking pi,

762
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:18,749

- Um...

763
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,383
No, It's all right.

764
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:25,133
I was just practicing my fingering.

765
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,967
Um...

766
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,550
Go on, laugh.

767
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,800
No? Okay.

768
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:38,175
Um, do you play?

769
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:41,967
- No.
- Come on.

770
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:47,508
So...

771
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,342
Beautiful sounds are
about frequency ratios.

772
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:55,717
The simpler the ratio, like this C
and this C, a simple ratio of 1:2.

773
00:51:57,749 --> 00:51:59,341
Beautiful.

774
00:51:59,582 --> 00:52:02,299
Complex harmonies, like this...

775
00:52:03,124 --> 00:52:04,507
Ugly.

776
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:23,966
Do you want to try?

777
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:26,799
Okay.

778
00:52:43,123 --> 00:52:44,965
Is that right?

779
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,840
Yeah, it was, um...

780
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,632
- So you've never played before?
- No.

781
00:52:54,415 --> 00:52:56,298
All music is maths, really.

782
00:52:57,457 --> 00:52:59,298
Come on, I'll teach you the next bit.

783
00:53:25,457 --> 00:53:27,297
*One ticket.

784
00:54:28,496 --> 00:54:30,454
- Is this all right?
- Oh, Christ, yeah.

785
00:54:30,455 --> 00:54:32,463
- Do you want me to pour it out?
- Please.

786
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:35,912
It's nice to relax actually.
It's been a while.

787
00:54:35,913 --> 00:54:37,370
- There you go.
- Thank you.

788
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:40,088
Well, it's good that you
find maths relaxing.

789
00:54:44,913 --> 00:54:47,046
Must have been very
difficult for you,

790
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:50,505
being just you and Nathan.

791
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,546
You know, without...

792
00:54:59,287 --> 00:55:00,629
- Michael.
- Michael.

793
00:55:01,454 --> 00:55:03,369
- Sorry. Dickhead.
- No.

794
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,629
- Me, not... Not Michael.
- I know.

795
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,712
Well, I mean, but you're...

796
00:55:12,454 --> 00:55:15,129
You're the same. It must be the...

797
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:19,879
I mean, you're not with anyone.

798
00:55:20,454 --> 00:55:22,670
- No. No.
- Are you? No.

799
00:55:23,495 --> 00:55:26,504
My passion's my work, you see.

800
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,170
Sorry.

801
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:32,795
- You all right?
- Yeah.

802
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:38,379
Sometimes I wonder if Nathan
will ever find anyone, you know?

803
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,586
Nathan's nothing like me.

804
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:44,577
If you're worried that Nathan's
gonna end up like... You shouldn't.

805
00:55:44,578 --> 00:55:47,128
- I wasn't. It would be a good thing.
- You shouldn't.

806
00:55:51,536 --> 00:55:53,836
- I might just pop off to the toilet.
- Okay.

807
00:56:15,494 --> 00:56:17,378
Uh, I got crisps.

808
00:56:28,993 --> 00:56:30,293
<i>Oh...</i>

809
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,752
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

810
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:39,034
- Sorry, are you a bit stiff?
- No, what?

811
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:40,918
I mean, your back.

812
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,659
Oh...

813
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,076
- Shit. I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?
- It's okay. Are you all right?

814
00:56:59,077 --> 00:57:01,085
No. It's okay.

815
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:03,826
- You all right?
- Sorry. Sorry about that.

816
00:57:03,827 --> 00:57:05,752
- It's okay.
- I, um...

817
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,793
I just want to say that, um...

818
00:57:08,202 --> 00:57:09,866
- You don't...
- For me... No, I do.

819
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:15,417
In this sort of situation there's only
so far that I am able to, um, go.

820
00:57:16,284 --> 00:57:18,459
And I don't want to
make you disappointed.

821
00:57:21,617 --> 00:57:25,167
You... You couldn't.
I wouldn't... Sorry.

822
00:57:27,826 --> 00:57:29,834
Yeah, I understand.

823
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:33,334
Do you mind if we get up? I
think I'm sat on a set square.

824
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:26,000
I think it's funny that your
favourite English food is Chinese.

825
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:30,782
Do you always like to
have everything the same?

826
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:34,250
Because I change my favourite
things all the time.

827
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:37,874
I don't usually like change.

828
00:58:40,032 --> 00:58:41,948
- I like it here, though.
- Do you?

829
00:58:41,949 --> 00:58:44,823
I mean, the Chinese
approach to maths.

830
00:58:44,824 --> 00:58:46,165
Yes?

831
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:48,874
Look.

832
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:54,707
This is called The Nine
Chapters of Mathematical Art.

833
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:58,332
This took more than
1,000 years to write.

834
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:04,249
In China, mathematics
is more than numbers.

835
00:59:04,532 --> 00:59:07,249
Um, It is like art.

836
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,374
Here.

837
00:59:21,614 --> 00:59:24,289
There are... There are
eight prawn balls. I...

838
00:59:25,614 --> 00:59:27,456
It needs to be a prime.

839
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:45,040
So... 20 random cards are
placed in a row all face-down.

840
00:59:46,031 --> 00:59:50,665
A move consists of turning
a face-down card face-up

841
00:59:51,615 --> 00:59:55,206
and turning over the card
immediately to the right.

842
00:59:56,323 --> 00:59:59,915
Show that no matter what the
choice of cards to turn

843
01:00:00,406 --> 01:00:03,581
this sequence of moves
must terminate.

844
01:00:05,406 --> 01:00:08,914
Nathan, hiding in the
back won't help you.

845
01:00:09,155 --> 01:00:11,039
Would you like to
come up and show us?

846
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:20,247
Go on, Nathan.

847
01:00:54,904 --> 01:01:00,871
Okay, so we need to... We need to look
at the cards not as cards, but as, uh...

848
01:01:00,946 --> 01:01:02,621
As numbers.

849
01:01:03,696 --> 01:01:07,663
We can call face-down cards...

850
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:11,913
One.

851
01:01:12,071 --> 01:01:15,246
Face-up cards... Zero.

852
01:01:16,363 --> 01:01:20,570
And initially it would be a sequence of
ones as the cards are all face down.

853
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:26,288
But after a while it would
look something like that.

854
01:01:27,738 --> 01:01:30,871
And, as we can see, that
is a binary number.

855
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:35,694
And a move that consists of
turning a face-down card face up

856
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:39,203
and the card immediately
to the right of it

857
01:01:40,195 --> 01:01:44,078
could be that a one
followed by a one,

858
01:01:44,903 --> 01:01:47,912
will turn into a zero
followed by a zero.

859
01:01:51,237 --> 01:01:54,819
That would be like that. Or it
could be a one followed by a zero

860
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,703
turning into a zero
followed by a one.

861
01:02:00,612 --> 01:02:06,162
In either case, we can see that the
number in binary is strictly decreasing.

862
01:02:08,737 --> 01:02:10,037
And that means?

863
01:02:11,778 --> 01:02:14,537
Which means that the
sequence must terminate.

864
01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:16,361
Because?

865
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:18,902
Because you can't keep taking
away from a positive integer

866
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:22,744
- without it turning negative.
- No, you can't.

867
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:25,610
You definitely can't. Good work;.

868
01:02:25,611 --> 01:02:27,786
Everyone. Good work.

869
01:04:02,484 --> 01:04:05,992
Uh, hello. My name's Martin
Humphreys and I'm an alcoholic.

870
01:04:06,525 --> 01:04:08,733
No, not really. Well, a little bit.

871
01:04:08,734 --> 01:04:11,483
Um, I've got MS, that's why I'm
here. I got that group tomorrow.

872
01:04:11,484 --> 01:04:13,399
Uh...

873
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,034
No, seriously, thank you for everybody
who's, uh, shared and stuff.

874
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,700
Because there's definitely
things that I can identify with

875
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:24,409
and that I definitely recognise;.

876
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:26,575
Uh...

877
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:32,783
So, there's this person
I like, but I know

878
01:04:33,399 --> 01:04:35,699
how bad I'm gonna get

879
01:04:36,649 --> 01:04:40,741
and it's very difficult to imagine
any sort of a rosy future

880
01:04:42,233 --> 01:04:47,199
or anyone wanting to be a
part of that future with me.

881
01:05:01,191 --> 01:05:03,783
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Um...

882
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:08,908
Because you...

883
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:15,074
This is ridiculous.

884
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:22,865
Because in a few years' time I might not...
I might not even be able to hold hands

885
01:05:24,107 --> 01:05:25,865
or have a little cuddle.

886
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:29,740
And...

887
01:05:34,607 --> 01:05:37,198
That really, really scares me.

888
01:05:50,857 --> 01:05:55,314
We should ask the others to suggest a
variety of trigonometric identities

889
01:05:55,315 --> 01:05:59,356
to simplify the expressions, which
could include, say, coversine

890
01:05:59,357 --> 01:06:04,563
or possibly covercosine or
versine or excosecant and so on.

891
01:06:04,564 --> 01:06:06,646
Luke, we're trying to think of
fun questions for each other,

892
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:09,313
we're not trying to prove how many
trigonometric identities we know.

893
01:06:09,314 --> 01:06:14,072
Well, then I really don't see the point.
We are competing with each other.

894
01:06:14,939 --> 01:06:17,646
You can pretend you're everyone's
best friend all you like, Isaac,

895
01:06:17,647 --> 01:06:18,980
but I'm here to get on the team.

896
01:06:18,981 --> 01:06:21,697
Sorry, when have I ever tried
to be your best friend, Luke?

897
01:06:25,522 --> 01:06:28,105
Nathan, this is a democracy,
yours is the casting vote.

898
01:06:28,106 --> 01:06:32,063
Yes. Democracy in the true Chinese
sense of the word. Forget it.

899
01:06:32,064 --> 01:06:34,573
- We'll just do your question...
- Are you gonna sulk?

900
01:06:34,898 --> 01:06:37,073
Boo-hoo-hoo, poor Luke.

901
01:06:46,522 --> 01:06:47,905
Sorry.

902
01:06:48,563 --> 01:06:51,646
- I've come across people like him before.
- Definitely autistic.

903
01:06:51,647 --> 01:06:54,697
He seems to have picked up all the
bad traits and none of the good.

904
01:06:54,813 --> 01:06:57,238
- What bad traits?
- Obsessive.

905
01:06:57,563 --> 01:07:00,655
- Socially incompetent.
- That sort of thing.

906
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,488
It's about adaptability, Nathan.

907
01:07:09,522 --> 01:07:13,488
Sometimes we have to change
our shape so that we fit in.

908
01:07:17,647 --> 01:07:18,771
That was you pushing the cage.

909
01:07:18,772 --> 01:07:23,405
- I did not!
- Yes, you did! Polly!

910
01:07:24,563 --> 01:07:26,655
Polly Parrot, wake up!

911
01:07:27,563 --> 01:07:28,988
Polly!

912
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,946
Now that's what I calla dead parrot.

913
01:07:35,729 --> 01:07:39,737
I love this. It's stinky tofu.

914
01:07:39,854 --> 01:07:41,737
Stinky?

915
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:46,071
Oh, that's horrible.

916
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:49,571
It stinks but it tastes
really, really good.

917
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:51,728
Oh, look.

918
01:07:51,729 --> 01:07:56,112
I used lo play this when I was
small, in my hometown, as a child.

919
01:07:59,604 --> 01:08:00,862
A sweet.

920
01:08:01,187 --> 01:08:03,978
- It's sticky.
- It's stuck in my teeth.

921
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:06,904
You have a funny face.

922
01:08:09,021 --> 01:08:11,571
You don't like it? I'll eat
it. And you can have this'.

923
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,861
We should, uh... We
should probably go.

924
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,352
Aren't you...

925
01:08:20,353 --> 01:08:22,111
Aren't you worried about the exam?

926
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:26,903
Well, it is good to have a
break. Clear your mind.

927
01:08:28,061 --> 01:08:33,185
Don't worry. We will both get into
the Olympiad in Cambridge. The IMO.

928
01:08:33,186 --> 01:08:37,477
And I will meet your family
when I come and stay with you.

929
01:08:37,478 --> 01:08:39,528
My cultural exchange.

930
01:08:40,728 --> 01:08:42,028
Ah!

931
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,486
Look at this.

932
01:08:49,186 --> 01:08:52,361
You're a bit like a
turtle, aren't you?

933
01:08:54,353 --> 01:08:56,070
In your shell.

934
01:08:57,728 --> 01:08:59,235
Come on.

935
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,819
In China, do boys
like me get bullied?

936
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:16,694
"Bullied"?

937
01:09:17,602 --> 01:09:21,402
You know, like when people treat
you badly because you're clever.

938
01:09:21,769 --> 01:09:23,402
Why would they do that?

939
01:09:24,685 --> 01:09:27,393
I wish England was more like China.

940
01:09:27,394 --> 01:09:30,069
I wish China was more like here.

941
01:09:30,852 --> 01:09:34,235
In China we have to
succeed for the family.

942
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:37,569
Especially for Uncle Deng.

943
01:09:40,352 --> 01:09:45,151
Some people say that I am
only here because of him.

944
01:09:45,601 --> 01:09:49,234
That's not true. No,
you're really clever.

945
01:09:50,351 --> 01:09:51,901
Thank you.

946
01:09:53,393 --> 01:09:55,443
And you're very nice.

947
01:09:57,143 --> 01:10:00,443
Prawn ball. Turtle boy.

948
01:10:50,475 --> 01:10:52,150
Alternate team seating.

949
01:10:52,433 --> 01:10:55,391
UK team member, Chinese team member.

950
01:10:55,392 --> 01:10:59,317
Alternative seating. UK team
member, Chinese team member.

951
01:11:04,892 --> 01:11:06,942
IMO conditions apply.

952
01:11:08,517 --> 01:11:11,358
White card if you request some paper.

953
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:14,607
A blue for water.

954
01:11:15,891 --> 01:11:18,024
Green if you need to
go to the toilet.

955
01:11:19,682 --> 01:11:23,607
Yellow to ask a question but
only in the first half-hour.

956
01:11:24,432 --> 01:11:29,399
And red if you've left the gas on at
home or something and you need to leave.

957
01:11:30,016 --> 01:11:35,316
The six of you who score highest will
represent Team UK, no ifs, no buts.

958
01:11:37,724 --> 01:11:42,024
- Hao, keyi kaishi, le.
- You may begin.

959
01:11:55,224 --> 01:12:00,023
<i>Each integer is coloured
either red, yellow or green.</i>

960
01:12:01,223 --> 01:12:04,898
<i>Show that there
always exist A, B, C,</i>

961
01:12:06,598 --> 01:12:10,481
<i>such that A, B, C.</i>

962
01:12:10,848 --> 01:12:13,815
<i>A + B, A + C...</i>

963
01:12:14,348 --> 01:12:19,856
<i>A + B, A + C, B +
C and A + B + C</i>

964
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,981
<i>are all the same colour.</i>

965
01:12:55,139 --> 01:13:00,980
*-I didn't do well on the
test. You worry a lot.

966
01:13:10,555 --> 01:13:15,096
Right! No point in
dilly-dallying, I suppose.

967
01:13:15,097 --> 01:13:18,147
I'll pin your scores up
on the board in a second.

968
01:13:18,805 --> 01:13:20,804
The five outstanding students

969
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:24,855
guaranteed a place at the IMO
in Cambridge this year are...

970
01:13:26,263 --> 01:13:27,604
Isaac,

971
01:13:28,138 --> 01:13:29,688
Lee Jing,

972
01:13:30,346 --> 01:13:31,646
Rebecca.

973
01:13:32,346 --> 01:13:34,438
Pav and Ben.

974
01:13:38,055 --> 01:13:41,929
The last place was very tight
between Nathan and Luke.

975
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:45,988
Both scores somewhat disappointing, but
one of you will have to go to Cambridge.

976
01:13:46,138 --> 01:13:49,896
So, by the smallest
fraction of a point,

977
01:13:50,596 --> 01:13:53,438
the last place on the team goes to...

978
01:13:56,596 --> 01:13:57,855
Nathan.

979
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:03,137
The six of you will be hosting the
Chinese team at your own homes

980
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:05,470
and I'll see you all in
Cambridge next week.

981
01:14:05,471 --> 01:14:07,521
Onward, Christian soldiers.

982
01:14:29,929 --> 01:14:32,854
A real Taiwanese last supper!

983
01:14:33,429 --> 01:14:38,011
"As the old proverb say:
“Slowly, slowly, catchy prawn."

984
01:14:38,012 --> 01:14:42,062
Now, you put your bait on the hooks
and you put your hooks in the water.

985
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:46,854
Don't worry, Nathan. I only
just made the team myself.

986
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:50,479
We should be celebrating!

987
01:14:52,845 --> 01:14:54,229
Okay.

988
01:14:56,511 --> 01:14:58,135
He's so strange.

989
01:14:58,136 --> 01:15:00,144
At least we don't have
to see him again.

990
01:15:02,678 --> 01:15:03,978
What a dick.

991
01:15:06,386 --> 01:15:08,269
- Ah! Ah!
- What do I do?

992
01:15:11,844 --> 01:15:13,811
Yes!

993
01:15:18,844 --> 01:15:20,728
I'm sorry.

994
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:22,968
- How's it going?
- Good.

995
01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:24,573
These two are tender?

996
01:15:24,574 --> 01:15:28,010
Not yet. I have this all under control,
thank you very much. It's fine.

997
01:15:28,011 --> 01:15:30,311
Okay, okay. You're the expert.

998
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:33,644
I think these ones...
Can I get a plate?

999
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:39,518
Smells good.

1000
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:47,352
Have you seen this? "Now that's
what I call a dead prawn."

1001
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:50,134
"This prawn is definitely deceased."

1002
01:15:50,135 --> 01:15:52,592
"When I bought it half-hour
ago, you assured me"

1003
01:15:52,593 --> 01:15:55,852
"that its lack of movement was due
to it being tired and shagged out."

1004
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,560
Oh, my God.

1005
01:15:58,218 --> 01:16:00,102
"Say, “No, no, it's resting."

1006
01:16:01,177 --> 01:16:04,560
- What?
- Say, "No, no, it's resting."

1007
01:16:06,635 --> 01:16:07,884
No, no, it's resting.

1008
01:16:07,885 --> 01:16:11,768
"All right, then. Well, if it's
resting, I'll wake it up."

1009
01:16:12,552 --> 01:16:16,185
"Hello, Prawny. Prawny, wake up!"

1010
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,134
"This prawn wouldn't wake up if
I put 4,000 volts through it."

1011
01:16:20,135 --> 01:16:22,759
"It's bleedin' demised.
It has ceased to be."

1012
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,925
"It's expired and gone
to meet its maker."

1013
01:16:24,926 --> 01:16:27,184
"This is an ex-prawn!"

1014
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:33,934
Seriously, Luke, what are you?

1015
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:37,309
Well, what are you, Isaac?

1016
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:41,383
“I find everything so easy
and I have everything.

1017
01:16:41,384 --> 01:16:44,934
"And I'm gonna go out of my way to make
sure that you're not happy at all.“"

1018
01:16:53,592 --> 01:16:56,466
<i>Remarkable bird, the Norwegian
Blue. Beautiful plumage.</i>

1019
01:16:56,467 --> 01:16:59,466
<i>The plumage don't enter
into it. It's stone-dead.</i>

1020
01:16:59,467 --> 01:17:01,517
<i>No, no, no. It's resting.</i>

1021
01:17:01,676 --> 01:17:05,434
<i>All Right, then. If it's
resting, I'll wake it up.</i>

1022
01:17:05,842 --> 01:17:11,007
<i>Hello, Polly! I got a nice Cuttlefish
for you when you wake up, Polly Parrot!</i>

1023
01:17:11,008 --> 01:17:13,141
<i>- There, it moved.
- No, it didn't.</i>

1024
01:17:24,133 --> 01:17:25,600
Nathan.

1025
01:17:25,966 --> 01:17:27,516
Nathan...

1026
01:17:28,008 --> 01:17:29,683
It's fine.

1027
01:17:31,591 --> 01:17:32,933
I've done it before.

1028
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:36,850
Just got a bit carried
away this time.

1029
01:17:40,425 --> 01:17:42,641
How did your mum and
dad explain it to you?

1030
01:17:44,425 --> 01:17:45,808
When they found out.

1031
01:17:48,633 --> 01:17:50,475
I presume you've been diagnosed.

1032
01:17:53,174 --> 01:17:55,849
Mine said it made me unique.

1033
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,015
No one wants to be
ordinary, they said.

1034
01:18:05,799 --> 01:18:08,140
It's all right being weird

1035
01:18:09,299 --> 01:18:11,015
as long as you're gifted.

1036
01:18:13,757 --> 01:18:16,432
But if you're not gifted, then...

1037
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,807
That just leaves weird.

1038
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:23,224
Doesn't it?

1039
01:18:24,715 --> 01:18:26,390
You are gifted, Luke.

1040
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,432
I don't even enjoy it.

1041
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:34,099
Maths.

1042
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:37,931
Isn't that stupid?

1043
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:45,014
What's the point?

1044
01:19:08,256 --> 01:19:10,223
Right, away you go.

1045
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:17,806
Your chariot awaits.

1046
01:19:19,464 --> 01:19:22,013
Nathan, can I have a word?

1047
01:19:31,922 --> 01:19:36,722
When I speak to people of a
non-mathematical nature,

1048
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:42,638
they always struggle with the notion
that mathematics can be beautiful.

1049
01:19:43,422 --> 01:19:47,055
But if beauty is truth
and truth is beauty,

1050
01:19:47,797 --> 01:19:51,222
well, then surely mathematics is
the most beautiful thing of all.

1051
01:19:51,713 --> 01:19:53,013
No?

1052
01:19:55,172 --> 01:19:58,763
There is rare beauty
in your work, Nathan.

1053
01:19:59,797 --> 01:20:04,263
But you are unpredictable and
inconsistent. Which worries me.

1054
01:20:05,172 --> 01:20:08,512
You need to focus if
you're gonna win a medal.

1055
01:20:08,921 --> 01:20:11,096
And don't be distracted
by your Chinese guest.

1056
01:20:46,129 --> 01:20:47,846
<i>Oh, cai hang!</i>

1057
01:20:48,629 --> 01:20:52,012
- Uh, the rainbow.
- Yeah, rainbow, cai hang.

1058
01:20:52,628 --> 01:20:54,419
- Cai hang.
- Yeah.

1059
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,345
- Cai hang.
- Cai hang.

1060
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,512
So beautiful.

1061
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:22,845
- Welcome home. Hi, darling.
- Hey!

1062
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,137
- Hi, darling... Hi!
- Welcome back.

1063
01:21:27,045 --> 01:21:30,095
Hi! Hello, sweetheart.

1064
01:21:30,378 --> 01:21:31,502
- Hi.
- Hi.

1065
01:21:31,503 --> 01:21:34,002
- How do you pronounce your name?
- Uh, Zhang Mei.

1066
01:21:34,003 --> 01:21:37,136
- Zhang Mei. Julie. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1067
01:21:38,377 --> 01:21:41,001
We put a little... Wait,
it's coming round now.

1068
01:21:41,002 --> 01:21:42,460
Cambridge, here we come!

1069
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:44,969
Whoo-whomwhoo-whoo!

1070
01:21:46,127 --> 01:21:47,802
Why did you get my train set out?

1071
01:21:49,502 --> 01:21:51,344
Um... Nathan...

1072
01:21:53,711 --> 01:21:55,136
Sorry.

1073
01:21:58,211 --> 01:22:00,844
- Welcome to England.
- Thank you.

1074
01:22:06,044 --> 01:22:07,793
Nathan.

1075
01:22:07,794 --> 01:22:11,011
Nathan, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry about the train.

1076
01:22:16,794 --> 01:22:19,135
So that's Zhang Mei, is it?

1077
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:21,843
What's she like?

1078
01:22:22,085 --> 01:22:24,176
She's... She's clever.

1079
01:22:26,126 --> 01:22:27,676
And she's nice, too.

1080
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,843
Sounds to me like you quite like her.

1081
01:22:32,376 --> 01:22:34,010
Of course I like her.

1082
01:22:34,335 --> 01:22:39,417
No I mean, uh, like more than you...

1083
01:22:39,418 --> 01:22:41,135
normally like things. Like...

1084
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:46,176
Ice cream. Or...

1085
01:22:47,418 --> 01:22:49,010
Or maths.

1086
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:51,385
I don't like anything
more than I like maths.

1087
01:22:54,168 --> 01:22:56,926
Nathan, darling, I wish
you'd just called me.

1088
01:22:58,418 --> 01:23:01,260
Let me know that
you're okay, you know?

1089
01:23:02,668 --> 01:23:04,009
Why?

1090
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:07,759
Well, because, darling...

1091
01:23:09,709 --> 01:23:11,509
I like you...

1092
01:23:13,334 --> 01:23:15,384
More than I like ice cream.

1093
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,967
I said she could have my room.

1094
01:23:28,459 --> 01:23:30,509
That's very gentlemanly of you.

1095
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:33,134
Isn't that the right thing to do?

1096
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:35,550
Yes.

1097
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:39,425
So, I'm... I'm blowing this
up for you then, am I?

1098
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:43,842
Yeah. But, uh, can I
have it in my room?

1099
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,133
Zhang Mei's in there.

1100
01:23:49,374 --> 01:23:50,841
We might want to study.

1101
01:23:58,374 --> 01:24:03,883
So, that man today, he
is not your father?

1102
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:09,841
No, he's my teacher. My father died.

1103
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:13,549
I'm sorry, Nathan.

1104
01:24:14,999 --> 01:24:16,549
It's not your fault.

1105
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:22,508
I mean, I feel sad for you.

1106
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:28,341
It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.

1107
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:07,664
You think it'll work?

1108
01:25:07,665 --> 01:25:10,798
100%? I hope so.

1109
01:25:12,998 --> 01:25:16,507
We did it! It actually works.

1110
01:26:04,871 --> 01:26:06,963
Right-oh, observers.
It's time to assemble.

1111
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,912
Panama hats, Richard? Really?

1112
01:26:10,913 --> 01:26:13,079
Yes, it was a consensus decision.

1113
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,046
I discussed it with myself and I
decided it would be a good idea.

1114
01:26:16,830 --> 01:26:19,079
Are you sure you're not
too rusty for all this?

1115
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,620
I can manage a bit of shepherding.

1116
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:24,546
Been Nathan's teacher for seven
years, I wanna see this through.

1117
01:26:25,163 --> 01:26:26,838
He's a very sensitive kid.

1118
01:26:27,121 --> 01:26:30,838
Yeah, yeah, I suppose
children are like animals.

1119
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,505
You get attached to
them after a while.

1120
01:26:40,038 --> 01:26:43,505
Oh, my gosh! Is this
where you're staying?

1121
01:26:44,163 --> 01:26:45,670
Oh, wow.

1122
01:26:47,204 --> 01:26:48,545
Oh...

1123
01:26:52,162 --> 01:26:53,629
Well...

1124
01:26:53,787 --> 01:26:57,619
So, um, you've got your phone on you
and you know you can call me any time.

1125
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,087
So...

1126
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:03,494
I'll be thinking of you.

1127
01:27:03,495 --> 01:27:05,504
Okay. Well, goodbye.

1128
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:09,087
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1129
01:27:09,245 --> 01:27:10,578
- Bye.
- Bye.

1130
01:27:10,579 --> 01:27:11,879
Bye, darling.

1131
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:22,587
- What are you doing?
- I was taking your hand.

1132
01:27:23,454 --> 01:27:24,920
Come on!

1133
01:27:27,829 --> 01:27:29,036
You let go!

1134
01:27:29,037 --> 01:27:32,295
Isaac Newton. G.H. Hardy.

1135
01:27:32,745 --> 01:27:35,836
Ramanujan. Bertrand Russell.

1136
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:39,378
They all began their
mathematical journeys here.

1137
01:27:39,911 --> 01:27:43,327
Trinity alumni have accumulated
thirty two Nobel prizes

1138
01:27:43,328 --> 01:27:46,211
and no less than four Fields Medals.

1139
01:27:46,453 --> 01:27:48,994
Although Russell did go off the
rails somewhat later in his career.

1140
01:27:48,995 --> 01:27:53,327
But nevertheless, this is
the most prestigious place

1141
01:27:53,328 --> 01:27:57,586
to study mathematics on the
planet. And you are here.

1142
01:27:57,661 --> 01:28:01,920
Because they are the past
and you are the future.

1143
01:28:02,578 --> 01:28:04,211
So don't let me down.

1144
01:28:08,745 --> 01:28:10,211
Ladies and gentlemen,

1145
01:28:10,578 --> 01:28:13,202
I would like to welcome; You!
To the 59th International.

1146
01:28:13,203 --> 01:28:16,002
Mathematical Olympiad in Cambridge.

1147
01:28:20,035 --> 01:28:22,127
Please welcome Australia.

1148
01:28:34,035 --> 01:28:36,335
A warm welcome for Bangladesh.

1149
01:28:39,994 --> 01:28:41,460
Canada.

1150
01:28:43,994 --> 01:28:46,669
The People's Republic of China.

1151
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:57,502
A round of applause
for United Kingdom.

1152
01:29:23,618 --> 01:29:25,709
- Nathan?
- Yeah?

1153
01:29:28,868 --> 01:29:30,459
I can't sleep.

1154
01:29:31,784 --> 01:29:36,751
You can, uh, stay here if you
want. Like... Like at home.

1155
01:29:40,951 --> 01:29:42,459
What are you reading?

1156
01:29:45,783 --> 01:29:49,375
It's the Ten Years of
Mathematical Challenges,

1157
01:29:49,908 --> 01:29:52,000
'97 to '06 edition.

1158
01:30:04,783 --> 01:30:06,083
Oh.

1159
01:30:07,575 --> 01:30:09,167
I'm sorry.

1160
01:30:34,032 --> 01:30:35,791
Is that right?

1161
01:30:36,032 --> 01:30:37,374
Yes.

1162
01:30:52,491 --> 01:30:54,166
Are you okay?

1163
01:31:15,448 --> 01:31:19,081
I am glad I am here with you.

1164
01:31:21,156 --> 01:31:22,665
Me, too.

1165
01:31:38,156 --> 01:31:41,665
*What do you two think you're doing?

1166
01:31:46,156 --> 01:31:48,035
*We're not doing anything wrong!

1167
01:31:48,036 --> 01:31:51,289
*ls that what you think? You're
a disgrace to our family.

1168
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:54,751
*I'm here for a math test. What's
that got to do with our family?

1169
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,650
*What's that got to
do with our family?

1170
01:31:56,651 --> 01:31:58,550
*You're not doing enough.

1171
01:31:58,551 --> 01:32:01,284
*Not enough? Uncle,
I'm always studying.

1172
01:32:01,285 --> 01:32:04,225
*What else you want from me?
Besides, I've proved my skills

1173
01:32:04,226 --> 01:32:06,610
*Not enough. You didn't do enough.

1174
01:32:06,856 --> 01:32:09,588
*What have you proved? Your
skill with boys or in math?

1175
01:32:09,589 --> 01:32:12,597
*Are you here to make
out or to compete?

1176
01:32:12,843 --> 01:32:16,060
*We have replacements in
the team, you know that.

1177
01:32:17,489 --> 01:32:19,596
*Child, you've been a
disappointment to me.

1178
01:32:19,597 --> 01:32:22,121
*lf I'm not really good enough

1179
01:32:22,122 --> 01:32:25,480
*and I'm just here because I'm your
niece, then I'd better just go.

1180
01:32:25,481 --> 01:32:27,864
*Don't you dare!

1181
01:32:28,631 --> 01:32:31,014
*You can't walk away.

1182
01:32:34,906 --> 01:32:37,289
*Sorry.

1183
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:58,996
I can't be here with people
thinking I don't deserve it.

1184
01:32:59,446 --> 01:33:02,163
Why don't you just stay until
the end of the competition?

1185
01:33:02,196 --> 01:33:03,829
No, Nathan!

1186
01:33:04,603 --> 01:33:07,819
*Don't ask me to do what
I don't want to do.

1187
01:33:08,988 --> 01:33:11,413
Nathan...

1188
01:33:12,488 --> 01:33:14,371
Just because...

1189
01:33:16,113 --> 01:33:19,454
Just because I'm going, it...

1190
01:33:22,404 --> 01:33:24,704
It does not mean that...

1191
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:30,578
I don't find myself liking you.

1192
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:14,735
Excuse me. Sorry.

1193
01:34:14,736 --> 01:34:17,244
Nathan? Um...

1194
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:21,036
Did you get into trouble?
About Zhang Mei?

1195
01:34:23,111 --> 01:34:27,318
I think I might have accidentally

1196
01:34:27,319 --> 01:34:30,494
sort of mentioned
something to someone.

1197
01:34:31,861 --> 01:34:35,494
I didn't mean to hurt
anyone. It's just...

1198
01:34:39,028 --> 01:34:40,744
Anyway...

1199
01:34:42,361 --> 01:34:43,994
I'm sorry.

1200
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:51,860
Oi! Oggy!

1201
01:34:51,861 --> 01:34:53,902
- Oi!
- Oggy, oggy, oggy!

1202
01:34:53,903 --> 01:34:55,535
Oi, Oi, Oi!

1203
01:35:00,902 --> 01:35:02,442
Hello, Nathan.

1204
01:35:02,443 --> 01:35:07,109
I know, I know, I know. I know you said
not to bother you, but I just, um...

1205
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:09,827
Well, I just wanted to... I
wanted to cheer on Team Nathan.

1206
01:35:10,693 --> 01:35:12,327
Go, Nathan!

1207
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:16,160
Anyway, um, I'll be waiting
outside and, uh...

1208
01:35:16,652 --> 01:35:17,952
Best of luck, darling.

1209
01:35:18,485 --> 01:35:20,702
There's no such thing as luck.

1210
01:35:22,485 --> 01:35:23,785
No.

1211
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:06,992
Nathan.

1212
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:11,242
I'm gonna be circling, so I'll try and
slip you some of the answers, all right?

1213
01:36:11,484 --> 01:36:12,992
That's cheating.

1214
01:36:13,692 --> 01:36:15,326
You know I was joking.

1215
01:36:16,859 --> 01:36:18,451
You're gonna be all right.

1216
01:36:28,066 --> 01:36:31,866
Four hours and 30
minutes. You may begin.

1217
01:36:40,566 --> 01:36:45,450
<i>4 n squared trains are
arranged in a 2n by 2n square</i>

1218
01:36:45,608 --> 01:36:48,607
<i>and each is painted with
one of four colours.</i>

1219
01:36:48,608 --> 01:36:53,783
<i>Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the four colours.</i>

1220
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:58,616
<i>Every 2 x 2 square of trains...</i>

1221
01:36:59,358 --> 01:37:03,065
<i>Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the four colours.</i>

1222
01:37:03,066 --> 01:37:05,283
<i>Prove that the trains...</i>

1223
01:37:06,983 --> 01:37:11,398
<i>Prove that the trains on the
corners of the 2n x 2n square</i>

1224
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:13,282
<i>are painted with
different colours.</i>

1225
01:38:01,023 --> 01:38:05,073
<i>It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.</i>

1226
01:38:44,147 --> 01:38:45,947
What's the matter, mate?

1227
01:38:56,855 --> 01:38:58,655
Nathan?

1228
01:38:58,772 --> 01:39:00,280
Nathan!

1229
01:39:01,522 --> 01:39:02,947
Nathan!

1230
01:39:10,522 --> 01:39:13,488
Open the door. Martin, open the door!

1231
01:39:13,855 --> 01:39:16,613
Open the door, Martin. Martin!

1232
01:39:17,063 --> 01:39:18,572
Martin!

1233
01:39:22,521 --> 01:39:23,987
Nathan?

1234
01:39:25,437 --> 01:39:26,862
Nathan!

1235
01:39:29,979 --> 01:39:31,904
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

1236
01:39:32,687 --> 01:39:35,020
He just wanted to go, Julie.
I could see it in his eyes.

1237
01:39:35,021 --> 01:39:39,529
And I'm sorry, I didn't
wanna stop him. I'm sorry.

1238
01:39:40,646 --> 01:39:42,237
It's okay.

1239
01:39:51,354 --> 01:39:52,821
Nathan?

1240
01:39:55,021 --> 01:39:56,654
Nathan?

1241
01:40:26,936 --> 01:40:29,611
Zhang Mei said that she liked me.

1242
01:40:30,645 --> 01:40:32,070
Right.

1243
01:40:32,936 --> 01:40:34,486
That's a...

1244
01:40:36,561 --> 01:40:38,236
That's a good thing, isn't it?

1245
01:40:41,561 --> 01:40:44,528
And do you... Do you
think that you might

1246
01:40:44,686 --> 01:40:48,736
have those kind of feelings, too?

1247
01:40:49,894 --> 01:40:51,985
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

1248
01:40:52,685 --> 01:40:55,652
I've been trying to
work it out. But...

1249
01:40:57,144 --> 01:41:00,985
I found a formula. I just
can't understand it.

1250
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:06,277
Well, as far as I know,
Nathan, no one ever has.

1251
01:41:07,935 --> 01:41:11,819
I know that when...
When I'm around her,

1252
01:41:12,685 --> 01:41:15,277
my brain works differently.

1253
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:22,444
And my body feels strange and I don't
know what it means or why it matters.

1254
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:25,235
Why it matters?

1255
01:41:26,519 --> 01:41:28,569
It matters because...

1256
01:41:30,769 --> 01:41:32,069
Well, when...

1257
01:41:33,186 --> 01:41:35,610
When somebody loves you,

1258
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:41,818
it means that they see
something in you...

1259
01:41:43,685 --> 01:41:47,485
That they think is worth
something. So it sort of...

1260
01:41:49,143 --> 01:41:51,193
It adds value to you.

1261
01:41:55,601 --> 01:41:57,318
But it can be hard...

1262
01:41:59,101 --> 01:42:02,809
You know, when you love
someone and they...

1263
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:06,776
They show no sign that they
love you back, then it's...

1264
01:42:07,185 --> 01:42:10,193
Then it's unequal. Or, um...

1265
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:15,235
When... When someone you love...

1266
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:22,192
ls subtracted from you...

1267
01:42:25,434 --> 01:42:30,234
Then it feels like, you know, that
your value is less than it was.

1268
01:42:30,767 --> 01:42:32,817
Does that make sense?

1269
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:42,192
Why did he have to go?

1270
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,317
I don't know.

1271
01:42:46,559 --> 01:42:49,025
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I know.

1272
01:42:51,059 --> 01:42:54,442
It never will. It was an accident.

1273
01:42:55,225 --> 01:42:57,516
Things made sense
when I was with him.

1274
01:42:57,517 --> 01:42:59,317
But why? Why...

1275
01:43:00,559 --> 01:43:03,191
What did he do that I don't?

1276
01:43:04,099 --> 01:43:07,649
How did he make sense
of things for you?

1277
01:43:14,474 --> 01:43:15,899
Nathan?

1278
01:43:17,308 --> 01:43:21,399
I don't know, he made me laugh and...

1279
01:43:23,349 --> 01:43:25,566
He stuck chips up his nose.

1280
01:43:26,391 --> 01:43:27,774
What?

1281
01:43:30,308 --> 01:43:32,649
He stuck chips up his nose?

1282
01:43:37,766 --> 01:43:40,191
Oh, okay, well, I'll
stick a chip up my nose.

1283
01:43:43,266 --> 01:43:45,024
Talk to me now?

1284
01:43:51,182 --> 01:43:52,648
Nathan?

1285
01:43:55,598 --> 01:43:57,065
Nathan.

1286
01:43:58,223 --> 01:44:00,898
Nathan, it's all right. It's okay.

1287
01:44:03,057 --> 01:44:04,607
It hurts.

1288
01:44:05,932 --> 01:44:08,190
I know, darling. Me, too.

1289
01:44:13,348 --> 01:44:14,931
Come here.

1290
01:44:14,932 --> 01:44:16,732
It's all right.

1291
01:44:17,932 --> 01:44:21,815
It's all right, it's all
right, good boy. It's okay.

1292
01:44:40,889 --> 01:44:42,856
Hey, hey.

1293
01:44:47,139 --> 01:44:49,106
Where is Zhang Mei now?

1294
01:44:50,347 --> 01:44:53,064
She... She's gone to the station.

1295
01:44:54,347 --> 01:44:55,814
Do you wanna fetch her back?

1296
01:44:58,056 --> 01:44:59,356
Yeah.

1297
01:44:59,389 --> 01:45:01,731
Okay, we'd better be quick.

1298
01:45:10,347 --> 01:45:11,731
What?

1299
01:45:13,264 --> 01:45:14,772
Nothing.
