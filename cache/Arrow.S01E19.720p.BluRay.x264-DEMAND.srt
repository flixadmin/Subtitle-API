1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,049
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,642
For five years, I was stranded on an island,
with only one goal...

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,885
...survive.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,320
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,168
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish
to use the list of names he left me...

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,971
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,601
To do this, I must become someone else.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,004
I must become something else.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,446
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,410
- Who supplies you with Vertigo?
- They call him the Count!

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,848
Fifty-six people died to perfect this high.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,925
Police never caught your brother's shooter.
Bullets were laced with curare...

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,447
- ...that's Floyd Lawton's MO.
- Lawton's alive.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,604
- I'm sorry, John.
- Lawton kick his dog or something?

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,404
He killed his brother.

16
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,005
- How we doing?
- We are in the black and the green.

17
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,766
I like how we've gone from
throwing money at clubs to catching it.

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,485
Oh, look at these.

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,847
What sort of business
has a lost and found...

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,924
- ...filled with women's underwear?
- Best business ever?

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,321
Oh, having this much fun
should be against the law.

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,244
Oh, if wishing made it so.

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,401
- Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Is Laurel okay?

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,365
She's fine.
This visit is about something else.

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,485
A girl just got mowed down
a couple blocks from here.

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,005
On the Starling Bridge.

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,244
Ring any bells with you two?

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,086
- No.
- Should she?

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,887
- She was in your club tonight.
- A lot of people were.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,284
- You think someone killed her?
- Not someone. Something.

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,847
- Vertigo.
- Yeah.

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,601
- Had a problem with that in this club?
- Not that I'm aware of.

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,683
We don't allow drugs here, detective.

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,045
Control your clientele.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,363
Before anyone else wanders into traffic.

36
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,286
Any chance she could have scored
the drugs in here?

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,091
Doubt it.
I tried not to hire too many drug dealers.

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,131
Get me a list of employees. I'll have Felicity
cross-reference it for drug arrests.

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,970
That includes the two of us, you know.

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,766
I thought
the Vigilante finished off the Count.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,725
I did.

42
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,688
Just need to ask him a few questions, doc.

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,889
You're welcome to try, detective.
Not sure you'll get very far.

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,323
What does that mean?
Is this a load about doctor-patient privilege?

45
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,847
No. The unrefined Vertigo overdose
he suffered...

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,163
...caused damage to the caudal portion
of his anterior cingulate.

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,891
You'll be shocked
that I didn't go to medical school.

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,883
I've been working with him for months.

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,681
All I've gotten out of him is word salad,
the occasional spit in the face.

50
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,242
- Best of luck to you.
- Yeah, thanks.

51
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,643
Here I was born and there I died.

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,807
It was only a moment for you.
You took no notice.

53
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,969
A woman died tonight.

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,010
- From your poison.
- Lots of women die...

55
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,323
...lots of nights, for lots of reasons.

56
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,370
Someone is selling Vertigo again.
Where is it coming from?

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,962
I remember you. Man in the hood.

58
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,921
You are never far from my thoughts.

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,881
U m“!

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,764
You have failed this city!
You have failed this city!

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,048
You have failed this city!

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,521
You could've just said he was nuts.

63
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,364
You have failed this city!

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,530
- You're teaching me that one.
- Only if you show me where the knife was.

65
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,763
- Who taught you how to fight?
- My father wanted a son.

66
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,763
- He got one.
- Careful.

67
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,241
Tension on that bow's
a hundred and fifty pounds.

68
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,404
Snap it, you'll end up
with carbon fiber shrapnel in your eyes.

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,881
She's right. You're not strong enough, kid.

70
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,405
Go again?

71
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,928
You know, it's pretty exciting
that both of you are such bad asses...

72
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,124
...but you think that we should be
making a plan to stop Fyers?

73
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,365
- And I don't know, save your dad?
- Does he always whine this much?

74
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,326
- This is one of his good days.
- Can he fight?

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,241
I've tried. Limited success.

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,771
I'm sitting right here.

77
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,287
Well, I haven't tried yet.

78
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,327
- Uncle John?
- Hey, buddy.

79
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,608
Will you read Logan Bogan to me?

80
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,411
Sweetheart, get into bed
and mommy will read to you.

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,006
But I want Uncle John to read to me.

82
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,685
Uncle John's had a long day.

83
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,042
He'll read to you next time.

84
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,811
Hey, I'm sorry.
I've been someplace else today.

85
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,965
- What's going on with you?
- I'm just trying to figure some stuff out.

86
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,287
If you need to talk about anything,
you know I'm here for you.

87
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,409
It is Oliver Queen. With an emergency.

88
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,404
I gotta go.

89
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,450
Got here quick as I could. This
about the Glyph in your father's notebook?

90
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,251
Felicity is still working on that.
We have another problem.

91
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,451
Starling City
is once again at war with the drug...

92
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,361
...known on the streets as Vertigo.
It used to be the city's most lethal vice...

93
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,360
...but the purple and green pill was nowhere
to be found the last three months.

94
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,164
Over the past few days...

95
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,325
...city's been flooded with new version
of Vertigo, more addictive, more unstable.

96
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,451
It killed a girl in the club.
Just like it almost killed Thea.

97
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,728
Okay, what are you thinking?
We should pay the Count a visit?

98
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,522
He was my first visit. Waste of time.
He's sumasshedshiy.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,490
Duh.

100
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,321
Since he's the only one
who knew the formula for Vertigo...

101
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,804
- ...I don't even know where to begin.
- Good, you're here.

102
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,487
Of course you're here. Where else
would you be? Clearly love it down here.

103
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,569
You got to see this.

104
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,689
I'm here at the scene where police say
a disturbed patient escaped only hours ago.

105
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,047
Authorities issued an immediate lockdown...

106
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,484
...at the Starling County Institute
for Mental Health following the breakout.

107
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,725
Police are warning people to avoid contact
with the drug dealer known as the Count.

108
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,291
Not so crazy after all, huh?

109
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,001
I was administering his meds.

110
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,488
He was babbling, his usual ranting,
then he's ice-cold.

111
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,201
He overpowered me. Forced me to take him
out through the maintenance exit.

112
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,408
I thought he was harmless.
Basically a vegetable, you said.

113
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,401
I know, which means-- I've interviewed him
dozens of times in the past few months.

114
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,807
To be deceived by a patient so completely--

115
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,008
Don't worry. We'll find him.

116
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,289
And he's going to find prison
a lot harder to break out of.

117
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,088
Detective, he's dangerous.
Don't underestimate him.

118
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,769
- Anything from the security cameras?
- Not according to the orderly.

119
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,770
Due to budget cuts,
the cameras were the first to go.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,207
That is unbelievable.

121
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,648
There's another angle. Veronica Sparks,
the dead girl from Verdant?

122
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,286
- Yeah?
- I checked her LUDs.

123
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,927
The last person she texted
before she died was Tommy Merlyn.

124
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,411
He said he didn't know her.

125
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,801
Merlyn has two collars for possession,
one with intent.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,968
Yeah, that was over five years ago.

127
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,202
Maybe he's just better
at not getting himself arrested.

128
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,204
Laurel says he's changed
ever since his father cut him off.

129
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,606
Leopard and his spots.

130
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,128
Maybe pushing Vertigo
is a way of maintaining his old lifestyle.

131
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,290
Maybe going after Merlyn
is a great way to get my daughter...

132
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,967
- ...to stop speaking to me again, Hil.
- Quentin, I get that.

133
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,642
But here's the thing, on a hunch,
I subpoenaed the club's bank accounts.

134
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,041
Ten large
missing from their operating expenses.

135
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,043
Merlyn spent that money on Vertigo?

136
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,044
I can't explain how that much money
just gets misplaced.

137
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,171
I'll take a run at him, keep you out of it.

138
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,766
No. I should do it.

139
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,123
What you need?

140
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,968
All right, the person-of-color
has successfully purchased your drugs.

141
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,043
For the record, I offered.

142
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,089
How will we know the tracker is active?

143
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,605
It already is.

144
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,804
Good signal off the monofilament strips
we placed in the bills.

145
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,440
Drug money's like a pigeon.
Always finds its way home.

146
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,642
- Follow the money back to the Count.
- Okay.

147
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,327
Keep tracking it.

148
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,131
So what are you gonna do
with all the Vertigo you bought?

149
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,441
Plan on having a party?

150
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,487
My only experience with drugs
was an encounter...

151
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,450
...with a pot brownie my freshman year.
By mistake.

152
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,843
Which could've been fun,
except I'm allergic to nuts.

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,766
All right. Deadshot kills again.
This time, a U.S. Senator.

154
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,763
- Where you been tracking him?
- Not far.

155
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,367
I ran his Floyd Lawton alias
through every law enforcement database.

156
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,251
He's made a series of calls
to an Alberto Garcia.

157
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,567
According to NSA, Garcia's a reputed
underworld talent scout.

158
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,404
He books all of Deadshot's hits.

159
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,127
- It's not much to go on--
- Yeah, but it's something, Felicity. Thanks.

160
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,648
- Don't you think Oliver should know?
- No. This is personal.

161
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,202
Lawton's my problem to deal with.

162
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,011
- What brings you by?
- Hey.

163
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,050
Like some dinner?
Your daughter ordered too much Thai food.

164
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,571
No, thanks.

165
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,683
This is a business visit, actually.

166
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,529
I have some follow-up questions
on the Sparks girl's death.

167
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,604
Sure. The girl was in the club
before she got run-over.

168
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,448
You said you didn't know her,
but the last text off her phone was to you.

169
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,521
Really? Because...

170
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,962
Well, I'll be damned.

171
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,647
Hm. I didn't reply. I get a hundred texts a night.
People wanting to get into the club.

172
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,531
So that's what she meant by,
"Can you hook me up?"

173
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,170
What else would it be about?

174
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,363
Ten thousand dollars is missing
from your club's bank account.

175
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,363
What'd you spend the money on?

176
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,171
No idea. There must be some sort of
bookkeeping error.

177
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,482
If you spent that money on Vertigo...

178
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,967
- ...so you could hook up your clientele...
- Dad!

179
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,323
...the best thing for you is to cop to it,
get out in front of this.

180
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,642
- Don't say anything.
- I'm trying to--

181
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,201
To do your job? I know.
And this is me doing mine.

182
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,685
Laurel, I know I look like that
disapproving father, again.

183
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,769
But I came down here
so another cop wouldn't.

184
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,285
You understand?

185
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,770
- Tommy I--
- I'm not hungry anymore.

186
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,602
Hold up your hand up.

187
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,051
Palm facing me.

188
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,567
- Hit the water.
- What?

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,764
Hit it.

190
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,924
Again.

191
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,126
Again. Harder.

192
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,604
If the point of this is to make me feel
like an idiot, it's working.

193
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,441
"The journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step."

194
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,965
Confucius. Great.
I'm starting to see the family resemblance.

195
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,202
Lao Tzu, actually. Again.

196
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,601
- Now what?
- Fill the bowl. Start again.

197
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,603
- What have you got?
- The end of the money trail.

198
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,047
Sending the dealer's location to you now.

199
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,007
Oh, man. It's freezing.

200
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,965
- Oh, hey!
- Hey, check this.

201
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,122
Hey, come on, let's see what we can get.

202
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,363
Get back, guys. Get back.

203
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,206
Hey, yo. Who's looking to party?

204
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,647
- Vertigo.
- Right here.

205
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,642
That's not enough, man.
You don't pay, you don't play.

206
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,721
It's all right. Good for business.

207
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,723
My boss seems to like you, G.

208
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,641
Hey. Hey, hey. Give it. Give it.

209
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,928
How much for this?

210
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,607
Now that, that will buy you a brick,
my man.

211
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,330
Go, go, go!

212
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,405
Don't forget to breathe.
If you won't, I won't.

213
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,681
Congratulations. You're officially
the creepiest person I've ever met.

214
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,083
- I don't feel so good.
- Get away from me, creep.

215
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,360
Hey, we got a problem here?
Are you okay?

216
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,525
All units. Code 99.

217
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,921
4-1-7 in progress, Starling Aquarium.

218
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,129
- All available units...
- This came over the police frequency.

219
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,045
Hacked the aquarium security system
to get a better look.

220
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,363
You want to argue with me, huh?

221
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,211
Bystanders said they saw him
pop green and purple pills.

222
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,442
There's a lunatic high on Vertigo
who's taken hostages...

223
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,889
...and you're making tea?

224
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,965
Medicinal herbs from the island...

225
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,964
...counterbalance the effects
of certain drugs and poisons.

226
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,441
They should counteract
the effects of Vertigo.

227
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,650
- Then you aren't going to--
- What?

228
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,126
You know...

229
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,968
My sister got high on this garbage.
Could've killed someone.

230
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,647
She didn't deserve an arrow in the heart.
This guy didn't fail the city.

231
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,640
The city failed him.

232
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,087
And so did I.

233
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,642
What's happening now isn't your fault.
You didn't make him take drugs.

234
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,929
I failed to put the Count in a grave
so he couldn't hurt anyone.

235
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,845
- They locked him up--
- And now the city is on fire!

236
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,606
So clearly it wasn't the right decision.

237
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,568
Get in touch with Diggle.

238
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,248
With the security feed out, I'm gonna need
a second set of eyes at the aquarium.

239
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,327
- Glad I caught you stateside.
- Just barely.

240
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,802
- I leave in two days for Pyongyang.
- Isn't that classified?

241
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,806
I figure an old Army buddy
can keep a secret.

242
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,451
- I was glad to get your call.
- Lyla, that's not why I called.

243
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,127
There's something else
you'd like me to do, then.

244
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,170
Well, actually, I think
there's something I can do for you.

245
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,891
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and assume that Deadshot...

246
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,163
- ...is on ARGUS's most wanted list.
- What do you know about him?

247
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,766
Well, his name, for starters.
Floyd Lawton.

248
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,846
We don't even have that.
Where'd you get it?

249
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,321
Same place I got this.

250
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,000
It's everything you need to locate
who's giving Deadshot his targets.

251
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,330
What's your interest in this?

252
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,324
Lawton came up in connection
with some things I'm working on.

253
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,845
Decided to pass it off to you.

254
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,527
I remember you being
a better liar than that, Johnnie.

255
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,241
Listen, Lyla,
Lawton is a very dangerous man.

256
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,085
Your people are qualified
to take him down. It's simple.

257
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,368
Nothing in our business is simple.

258
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,041
You come to ask for my help again,
Mr. Lance?

259
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,362
Eric Messner.

260
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,611
Who?

261
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,922
He's a zoning commissioner
for Starling City.

262
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,441
A notoriously corrupt one at that.

263
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,563
The missing 10 grand...

264
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,564
...you paid him to skip the inspection
of your nightclub.

265
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,564
Why'd you do that?
What didn't you want him to find?

266
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,089
- We've got nothing to hide here.
- Great. Then let's just take a look around.

267
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,605
- Absolutely.
- Yep.

268
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,411
When you come back with a search warrant.

269
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,808
You sure this is how you want to play this?

270
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,525
Apparently.

271
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,522
Doesn't my daughter know
how to pick them?

272
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,809
Stop laughing at me!

273
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,486
Shut up! Just shut up!

274
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,322
Stop! I don't wanna hurt you!

275
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,162
Hey, easy. I'm here to help you.

276
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,045
My mom does yoga.

277
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,081
Hey, remember when Slade and I
rescued you?

278
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,526
You rescued me?

279
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,529
Fine.
When we all rescued each other.

280
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,924
You said you knew
why Fyers wanted Yao Fei...

281
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,048
...and how he was forcing him to help him.

282
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,051
Feel like sharing?

283
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,724
I'm almost out of slapping water.

284
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,364
My father was a Shang Jiang
in the People's Liberation Army.

285
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,567
A general.

286
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,647
I didn't hear the details of Fyers' plans
but he wants my father to be the face of it.

287
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,290
A scapegoat.

288
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,125
To take the blame
and conceal their own involvement.

289
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,881
Why was Yao Fei on the Island
in the first place?

290
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,970
Fyers says he murdered people.

291
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,605
No, he didn't.

292
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,923
The Chinese military committed
a massacre.

293
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,731
Someone had to take the blame.

294
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,442
They chose him.
Sent him to this island, for life.

295
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,608
I spent years looking for him.

296
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,481
A few months ago,
a man came to my apartment...

297
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,610
...said he had information
about my father's whereabouts.

298
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,127
I had given up hope.

299
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,605
I let my guard down,
didn't see the Taser until...

300
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,450
When I woke up, I was here.

301
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,325
I'm worried. This island--

302
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,280
What he must have had to do to survive.

303
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,967
That it changed him.

304
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,489
He saved my life.

305
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,649
He's still a good man, Shado.

306
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,363
Again.

307
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,851
So there I am sitting at our favorite
sushi restaurant...

308
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,211
...a bottle of sake, and the only thing
that's missing is my boyfriend.

309
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,123
Oh, God, I'm so sorry, baby.
I just have a lot going on here.

310
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,807
Tommy, whatever's going on with you,
I want you to know I believe you.

311
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,002
I'm here for you.

312
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,924
- Sorry.
- Ollie.

313
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,128
- What's wrong?
- Bad night.

314
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,566
It's about to get worse.

315
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,685
Mr. Merlyn, as requested,
a warrant to search these premises.

316
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,962
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- Believe it.

317
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,009
Detective, I'm not an attorney...

318
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,527
...but on what grounds
are you searching my club?

319
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,808
Your manager
bribed a government official...

320
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,281
...to keep him from inspecting
your building.

321
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,489
- What?
- He's selling Vertigo out of the club.

322
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,484
- Ollie, it's valid.
- Thank you.

323
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,844
A sublevel is not listed
on the inspection's floor plans.

324
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,486
However, I pulled the county records.

325
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,324
There's something down there.

326
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,165
I wanna see for myself what it is.

327
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,482
Oh, look at that.

328
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,007
Open the door.

329
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,565
- You're making a mistake.
- No, you are if you don't open that door.

330
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,850
I said, open the door.

331
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,961
Thank you.

332
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,363
The place is a kind of a mess. I've
been using it to store the bulk of our inventory.

333
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,926
- What's in the boxes?
- Why don't you have a look?

334
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,089
If Prohibition were still in effect, you might
have the basis of a criminal complaint.

335
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,049
Would you like to open the crates?

336
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,244
So if you don't have anything to hide...

337
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,764
...why didn't you want
the inspector down here?

338
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,041
Well, the ventilation system in this place
hasn't been updated since the '60s.

339
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,043
I mean, we shouldn't even be open.

340
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,089
Yeah.

341
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,851
I'm sorry. I thought he was okay
with us being together.

342
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,610
He wasn't wrong. I bribed a guy.

343
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,967
That's not why
he brought out his jackboots.

344
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,283
It's all gonna be fine. I'll see you at home.

345
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,849
- Good night.
- Good night.

346
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,806
- Is there something you want to say?
- Thank you.

347
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,883
No, the thing that you were thinking...

348
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,725
...when Lance accused me of dealing
out of the club.

349
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,770
I don't understand
why you wouldn't tell me about the bribe.

350
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,288
I run the club, Oliver.
I don't tell you a lot of things.

351
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,801
So let me ask you a question, pal...

352
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,964
...what have I done in the six months
since you've been home...

353
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,646
...that would lead you to believe
I would sell drugs?

354
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,644
In the last six months, nothing.

355
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,888
- Yeah.
- But before I left, you played hard.

356
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,969
You played with bad people
who were in--

357
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,640
And so did you, Oliver.

358
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,122
But I changed. Just like you did.

359
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,842
Now you put arrows in people
who do illegal things.

360
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,163
Last time I checked,
bribing a city inspector was not legal.

361
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,445
Do you actually think
that I could hurt you?

362
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,644
Truthfully, I have no idea
what the hell you would do.

363
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,450
You are a complete mystery to me.

364
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,531
I've got no idea
how you find it so easy to kill people.

365
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,922
The next time you decide to think the worst
of rne imagine what I now think of you.

366
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,489
- What's his problem?
- What's yours?

367
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,203
- Excuse me?
- I asked Felicity to get in touch with you.

368
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,370
There was a hostage situation
at the aquarium.

369
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,364
- Sorry, I didn't get message till it was over.
- Why?

370
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,284
I was busy doing something else.

371
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,284
Lawton.

372
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,730
- You didn't end up needing me.
- You couldn't have known that.

373
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,009
In other words, "Find your brother's killer
on your own time."

374
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,484
Vertigo is tearing this city apart, Diggle,
so yeah, maybe now is not the best time...

375
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,210
...to indulge a personal vendetta.

376
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,805
You're telling me...

377
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,691
...that you going after the Count
is not personal?

378
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,562
Oliver, I cannot read a book to my nephew
without knowing Lawton killed his father.

379
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,564
I can't move on with Carly,
I can't move on with my life...

380
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,087
...knowing that he's still out there.

381
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,047
I thought if anybody got that, it'd be you.

382
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,925
- What happened here?
- The Ethernet cable still works.

383
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,765
- Would you plug in your tablet?
- You decide to remodel?

384
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,763
- Long story.
- Where's Dig?

385
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,082
- Long story.
- Okay.

386
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,084
The hostage-taking junkie
is our only lead to the Count.

387
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,442
What type of information
are you looking for?

388
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,444
Anything that would give us a line on
the Count's location.

389
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,602
Has the ME performed the autopsy yet?

390
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,524
Yeah. Just pulling it up now.

391
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,048
Check the toxicology to see
if there's something related to Vertigo.

392
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,761
- He didn't die from a Vertigo overdose.
- I saw it, Felicity.

393
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,809
According to the coroner,
cause of death was severe anaphylaxis.

394
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,765
He died of an allergic reaction to
chlorpromazine.

395
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,285
That's an anti-psychotic.

396
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,203
Pull up the Veronica Sparks autopsy.

397
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,250
Did she have chlorpromazine
in her system?

398
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,126
Yes. How'd you know?

399
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,648
The Count must've added it
in this latest iteration of Vertigo.

400
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,610
Wouldn't the amount he'd need...

401
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,081
...to manufacture enough for circulation
be huge?

402
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,727
- Where would he get that much?
- A mental institution.

403
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,007
- What if we're looking at this wrong?
- How so?

404
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,447
Everybody is looking for him
outside the asylum.

405
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,125
But what if he never left?

406
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:04,644
What if he faked his escape,
the same way he faked being insane?

407
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,083
Never forgets.

408
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,045
Always back for more.

409
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,211
I should've killed you when I had the chance.

410
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,366
Turn around.

411
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,451
I said, turn around.

412
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,410
Oliver Queen.

413
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,570
All those years on that island.

414
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,768
Guess you really did go crazy.

415
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,931
So the Count
didn't fake losing his mind, did he?

416
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,285
This was you the whole time.

417
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,411
How did you get him to give you
the formula for Vertigo, huh?

418
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,485
Chemistry doesn't seem like
his best subject right now.

419
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,086
He couldn't tell me if he wanted to.

420
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,481
I ordered a biopsy on his kidneys.

421
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,769
The tissue was suffused
with the narcotic after his OD.

422
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,524
When I got the results...

423
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,167
...I realized I could reverse-engineer
the chemical compound of the drug.

424
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,041
Produce a synthesized version myself
using the facilities here.

425
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,044
And made a few improvements
like adding chlorpromazine.

426
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,046
That's how you found us.

427
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,766
Cops came around
and started asking questions...

428
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,010
...you faked the Count's disappearance
to draw attention away from yourself.

429
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,003
It's clever.

430
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,205
I wasn't trying to be a criminal mastermind.

431
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,169
I just needed the money.

432
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,041
Something I'm sure
a billionaire wouldn't understand.

433
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,004
Believe me.

434
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,808
I understand you perfectly.

435
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,086
Open his mouth.

436
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,205
From what I've read in the tabloids...

437
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,001
...no one will be surprised to hear
Oliver Queen died of a drug overdose.

438
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,050
Dig!

439
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,048
Argh!

440
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,370
Unh! Unh!

441
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,809
Clear.

442
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,123
Freeze!

443
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,044
You don't look so good.

444
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,082
I doubt you could aim a single arrow.

445
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,320
COUNT
Looks like I'm the last one standing.

446
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,162
Sitting.

447
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,569
Spinning.

448
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,371
Something to do.

449
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,641
What was I going to do?
Memory not what it once was.

450
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,884
Nothing what it once was.

451
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,480
Is there a name on the gravestone?

452
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,369
No.

453
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,207
It's new...

454
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,602
...and clean...

455
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,088
...and waiting.

456
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,166
We're finished here.

457
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,166
- Hey. How we doing?
- In the black.

458
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,165
Did the Hood get his man?

459
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,051
Well, we won't be having any problems
with Vertigo anymore.

460
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,049
- Look, Tommy, I'm sorry--
- I've caught up the bookkeeping...

461
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,726
...and all my notes on the inventory
are in there...

462
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,965
- ...along with the list of suppliers we use.
- Okay.

463
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,927
- I don't see why you're telling me that.
- This club is important to me.

464
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,082
But for you it's just a front.

465
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,762
You want me to keep your secret,
help you be this thing you've become...

466
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,366
...but you refuse to see me
for what I've become.

467
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,683
I've got just a bit too much
self-respect for that.

468
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,405
I quit.

469
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,123
Dinner.

470
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,805
You're still doing that?

471
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,561
Fyers better be careful
with his bowls of water.

472
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,491
When are we gonna do actual training?

473
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,484
There once was a young boy
whose father dropped him off...

474
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,043
- ...at a Shaolin monastery to study kung fu.
- Good. A story.

475
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,249
After a year,
the boy came to visit his family.

476
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,769
When asked what he'd learned,
the boy hung his head in shame.

477
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,402
All the monks had him do was slap water
in a barrel for a year.

478
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,810
We don't have a year, so I hope
your training regimen is a bit faster.

479
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,326
The family didn't believe him,
so he showed them.

480
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,445
He raised his hand
and hit the table they were eating on.

481
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,484
- It broke in half.
- I'm going to be able to break a table?

482
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,170
Better.

483
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,524
Okay.

484
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,286
Draw the bow.

485
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,326
I'll be damned.

486
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,891
What's next?

487
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,168
We teach you to shoot.

488
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,163
- Drinking alone?
- Oh. Well, not anymore.

489
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,163
Just soda'?

490
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,088
Bartender forget the Scotch?

491
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,846
I didn't really feel the need for it.

492
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,363
So, um...

493
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,761
The girl who died...

494
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,003
...turns out that she got her Vertigo
from a co-worker.

495
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,607
- Guess I owe your boyfriend an apology.
- He has a name, you know.

496
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,764
I just can't seem to bring myself
to use it. Baby steps.

497
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,045
Did I screw things up between us again?

498
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,850
No.

499
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,967
I really wasn't looking to jam up Merlyn.

500
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,930
I knew by pursuing him
that I could throw a wrench in us--

501
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,129
- Then Why'd you do it?
- There was evidence, Laurel.

502
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,089
And I had to follow it, I had to.

503
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,204
Your mom was right. You were right.

504
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,887
Like you said about me and the Vigilante,
I can't let things go.

505
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,402
And I close cases. It's what I do.
Everyone else be damned.

506
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,884
Maybe the fact that there's no Scotch
in there means you're ready to work on that.

507
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,643
People can change.

508
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,888
- Hey.
- Hey.

509
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,448
You had my back.

510
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,123
You needed me.

511
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,845
- Felicity told me where you were headed.
- You okay.

512
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,841
I'm the killer, remember?

513
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,163
I've killed before, Oliver.
It's just been a while.

514
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,242
If you're the killer,
why isn't the Count down too?

515
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,091
Sure it must have been tempting,
take him off the board for good.

516
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,090
- People change.
- People like the Count?

517
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,765
No, I meant me.

518
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,841
Not so long ago,
I would've put that guy down for good...

519
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,728
...but looking at him today,
all vacant...

520
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,650
...there didn't seem to be a point.

521
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,488
But not everybody deserves mercy.

522
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,727
For example.

523
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,962
- I thought he wasn't a priority to you.
- He's a priority to you.

524
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,485
And you two have unfinished business.

525
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,166
Where do we start?

526
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,247
I'd prefer we skip the I-told-you-so's,
but the nightclub...

527
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,006
...wasn't really working out.

528
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,040
I guess I need something more boring.

529
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,804
Stable.

530
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,289
Nine to 5, go home, kiss Laurel,
that sort of thing.

531
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,806
I guess what I'm saying is...

532
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,524
...I want a job.
