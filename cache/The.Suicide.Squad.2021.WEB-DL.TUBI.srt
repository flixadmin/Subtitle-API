00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,871
Because my court date is coming up,

334
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,308
and Miss Waller said maybe you could help me out.

335
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,677
To get me to lead your shite fucking mission,

336
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,879
you're gonna send my 14-year-old daughter to prison?

337
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,147
No.

338
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,584
Your daughter is 16, DuBois.

339
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,286
You're a real father of the year.

340
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,787
Fine. You know what, Tyla needs to grow up anyway

341
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,389
'cause she's a little ditzy like her fucking mother.

342
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,724
So, a year in juvie, no fucking problem.

343
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,828
Not juvie. Being 16 in the state of Louisiana

344
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,530
means that under the right circumstances,

345
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,232
she could be tried as an adult.

346
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,633
And, if convicted,

347
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,704
could be sent right here to old Belle Reve.

348
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,140
And in here, well, you never know what might happen

349
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,209
to a frail young thing like that.

350
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,644
Shames me to say

351
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,646
that we have the highest mortality rate

352
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,349
in the entire U.S. prison system.

353
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,487
[guard] Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

354
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,088
You're threatening my fucking daughter!

355
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,756
I'm protecting this country.

356
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,925
-Everyone stand down. -Miss Waller, I...

357
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,927
Stand down!

358
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,263
[Bloodsport breathing heavily]

359
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,534
I wouldn't take such extreme measures...

360
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,436
Oh, extreme? Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

361
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,338
...if this mission weren't more important

362
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,973
than you could possibly imagine.

363
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,407
Fuck your mission.

364
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,976
You have the military experience necessary,

365
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,612
and everything in your psychological profile tells me

366
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,213
you have what it takes to be a leader.

367
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,082
No, I'm no fucking leader!

368
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,084
Then I'll make you one.

369
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,486
[dramatic music playing]

370
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,624
Are you in or out?

371
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,564
Good. Let's meet your team.

372
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,901
-Come on. -Fuck me, man.

373
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,637
[guard] Let's go.

374
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,272
She was gonna kill his kid?

375
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,510
[Waller] Each member of the team is chosen

376
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,047
for his or her own completely unique set of abilities.

377
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:46,285
This is Christopher Smith, known as Peacemaker.

378
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,820
In his hands, anything is a deadly weapon.

379
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,923
His father was a soldier who trained his son

380
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,125
how to kill from the moment he was born.

381
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,927
-Are you having a laugh? -What?

382
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,795
You just said each member of the team is chosen

383
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,665
for their unique abilities. He does exactly what I do.

384
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,766
But better.

385
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,100
I always hit my targets dead center.

386
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,535
I hit them more in the center.

387
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,736
Well, you can't hit something more in a center.

388
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,238
-I use smaller bullets. -What?

389
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,472
They go inside your bullet holes

390
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,840
without even touching the side.

391
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,310
Next up is King Shark.

392
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,311
[Peacemaker] Holy shit.

393
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,580
What the fuck?

394
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,081
[Waller] Some people claim

395
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,951
that Nanaue is a descendant of an ancient shark god.

396
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,353
Whatever the case, he's strong and deadly.

397
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,888
Does it talk?

398
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,190
-[King Shark] Book read. -[Bloodsport] Wow. [chuckles]

399
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,525
[Peacemaker] Book's upside-down.

400
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,826
See that? It's pretending to read a book.

401
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,464
So smart, me. Enjoy book so much.

402
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,799
Be a mite careful,

403
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,801
as he's developed a taste for human meat.

404
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:36,568
Huh?

405
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,171
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

406
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,540
-Ratcatcher 2. -[inmate whistles]

407
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,208
-[inmates cheering] -Settle down!

408
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,476
Ooh.

409
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,178
What, we couldn't afford Ratcatcher 1?

410
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,713
He's dead. This is his daughter.

411
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,580
[knocks]

412
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,282
Cazo, will you be joining us?

413
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,351
[groans] I just woke up.

414
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,586
I don't function well early in the morning.

415
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,256
My deepest apologies for disturbing you.

416
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,423
Hmm, it's all right.

417
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,559
-Get your ass out here! -[gasps]

418
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,629
[sighs, moaning]

419
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,001
Millennials.

420
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,837
[continues moaning]

421
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,606
Oh, no way.

422
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,009
-That's not coming with us. -She controls rats.

423
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,311
I know, I caught that. It's a disgusting superpower.

424
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,514
This is Sebastian. Say hello, Sebastian.

425
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,852
I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

426
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:27,886
[Sebastian whines]

427
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,822
And finally, we have Abner Krill.

428
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,025
What's that 'round his neck?

429
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,293
A power dampener.

430
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,094
They call him the Polka Dot Man.

431
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,030
[scoffs] Polka Dot Man.

432
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,432
What's he do, throw polka dots at people?

433
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,469
He does.

434
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,238
He throws polka dots at people.

435
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,739
Hey, Polka Dot Man,

436
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,941
I was hoping you'd entertain my kid's birthday party.

437
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,779
You fucking pussy! [laughing hysterically]

438
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,981
-[chuckles] -These are soldiers?

439
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,683
We need to debrief.

440
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,919
[glass squeaking]

441
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,826
[groans] Fuck.

442
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,928
Corto Maltese

443
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,465
is a small island nation off the coast of South America.

444
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,033
Over the past 100 years,

445
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,036
the country has been ruled with an iron fist

446
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,272
by the Herrera family.

447
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,875
But, a week ago, this guy,

448
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,546
General Silvio Luna, along with his right-hand man,

449
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,482
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

450
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,118
took control of the Corto Maltese government

451
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,354
in a violent military coup.

452
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,525
The entire Herrera family were hanged in a public execution.

453
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,627
Although the United States did not condone

454
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,996
the excesses of the Herrera regime,

455
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:48,066
they were non-antagonistic toward the U.S.

456
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:52,404
Luna, however, is virulently anti-American.

457
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,005
So, you want us to kill Luna?

458
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,173
No.

459
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,743
This is Jotunheim.

460
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,078
A scientific experimentation facility

461
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:04,649
containing something known only as Project Starfish.

462
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,685
Our intelligence sources tell us

463
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,988
that Starfish is extraterrestrial in origin.

464
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,391
In the hands of the Luna regime,

465
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,928
it is potentially cataclysmic for Americans and the world.

466
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:21,233
Your mission is to infiltrate Jotunheim

467
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:25,203
and destroy every trace of Project Starfish.

468
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,505
How are we supposed to get in?

469
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,640
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

470
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,710
is a geneticist in charge of Project Starfish.

471
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,746
After hours, he hangs out at a gentlemen's club

472
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,716
known as La Gatita Amable.

473
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,619
Get Grieves to help you by whatever means necessary

474
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,988
and he can get you into Jotunheim.

475
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,190
Any questions?

476
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,127
What is that?

477
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,563
[Waller] That is an overhead projector.

478
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,198
Do you ever use it anymore?

479
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,599
No, not really.

480
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,568
So, why don't you just throw it away?

481
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,503
[Waller] Peacemaker?

482
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,373
Starfish is a slang term for a butthole.

483
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,607
Think there's any connection?

484
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,077
No.

485
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,413
No...

486
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,448
Nanaue.

487
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:10,949
[Peacemaker] ...connection.

488
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,150
Hand.

489
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,754
Yes, that is your hand, Nanaue, very good.

490
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,158
We're all gonna die.

491
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,093
I hope so.

492
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,430
Oh, for fuck's sake.

493
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,699
[dramatic music playing]

494
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,750
[explosion]

495
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,256
Control, we have a disturbance south of here.

496
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,158
[Waller on radio] It's just a diversion, Bloodsport.

497
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,228

1489

political rivals,

1490
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,772
and their loved ones.

1491
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:41,476
Oh, please,

1492
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:45,080
unclutch your fucking pearls, Flag.

1493
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:47,549
We serve the same master.

1494
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:49,484
We were sent here to stop you.

1495
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,453
Child,

1496
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,354
your government didn't send you here

1497
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:56,224
to protect the world from alien technology.

1498
01:24:56,291 --> 01:25:00,261
Your government sent you here to cover up their part in it.

1499
01:25:00,328 --> 01:25:02,597
You're a goddamn liar.

1500
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:06,968
American goddamn astronauts found Starro.

1501
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:09,637
Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.

1502
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:11,339
Although the Cold War was ended,

1503
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:13,508
your government saw the potential

1504
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,977
in weaponizing such a powerful beast,

1505
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,545
but banish the thought

1506
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:21,416
of any such experiments being held on American soil.

1507
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:24,052
Your people have always been squeamish

1508
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,554
about the sacrifices necessary

1509
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,023
for scientific advancement.

1510
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,258
So,

1511
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,128
the United States made a secret deal

1512
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:34,729
with the Corto Maltese government

1513
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,365
to conduct their illegal experiments here

1514
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:38,766
in Jotunheim.

1515
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:41,102
And they hired me to oversee them.

1516
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:42,637
And now, because of

1517
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,906
a run-of-the-mill fucking military coup,

1518
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,342
they're gonna destroy 30 years' worth of efforts.

1519
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:48,576
[Peacemaker] Yeah!

1520
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,578
You're the real victim here.

1521
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,615
The hell you doing here? You're supposed to be upstairs plantin' explosives.

1522
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:56,217
I told you I didn't trust him.

1523
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:58,353
Your records are located in those computers?

1524
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:04,225
Colonel, what are you doing?

1525
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,861
I joined the military to serve my country,

1526
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:08,263
not to be its puppet.

1527
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:11,199
What are you doing?

1528
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:15,570
Who are you going to show that to?

1529
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:18,773
The press. Goddamn people deserve to know.

1530
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,775
I'm tired of coverin' up their dirty little secrets.

1531
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:22,877
This time these sons of bitches are gonna be held account...

I can't let you do that, Colonel.

-Excuse me? -I'm truly sorry.

1535

Miss Waller charged me with makin' sure

1536
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,218
those records don't leave this building.

1537
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:31,920
Of course, I shoulda known.

1538
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:34,355
Waller's always got a backup.

1539
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:36,057
Come on, man, this isn't personal.

1540
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:38,993
Holdin' a gun on me is pretty fucking personal.

1543
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,498
I'm gonna need that drive, Colonel.

-[muffled rumbling] -[alarm sounding]

1546
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:48,803

-Let's go, come on! -[PA announcement in Spanish]

No one is sayin' what they did was right.

1550

They experimented on children!

1551
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,246
That information gets out,

1552
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,181
it causes an international incident!

1553
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,450
Keepin' the peace is worth any price,
