Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

799

perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

800

For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

And I can't believe it,

It's the Sword of Alexander.

808

The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

809
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:03,281
And now it hangs...

Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.
