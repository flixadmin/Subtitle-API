00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,023
The truth is, with Walter being gone,
I'm...

625
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,528
I'm lonely.

626
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,491
You know, you and I used to talk.
I used to know what you were thinking.

627
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,787
But now, even when you're home,
you're somewhere else.

628
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,917
I guess I just miss my son.

629
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,755
I miss you too.

630
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,010
And I wish that...

631
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,268
Are you hungry?

632
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,314
OLIVER:
Thank you.

All right.

Mm, Mom, heh.

637

It's okay to get your hands dirty
every once in a while. For me, please.

638
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,418
All right.

-Mm.
-Yeah.

That is a great burger.

I'll bet Carter doesn't know where to find
the best burger joint in Starling City.

So I have one thing on him?

No.

You have everything on him, Oliver.
