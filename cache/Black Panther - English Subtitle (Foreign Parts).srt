1
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,744
Who are you?

2
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:36,467
Prove to me you are one of us.

3
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:44,767
My King.

4
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,568
Come, baby brother.

5
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:31,948
Baby brother.

6
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,188
Tell him who you are.

7
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,882
Onward!

8
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,300
Onward!

9
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,410
Praise the ancestors.

10
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:51,512
Praise the ancestors.

11
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,415
Onward.

12
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:35,892
Praise the ancestors.

13
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,199


14
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,701
My son.

15
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,658
What is wrong my son?

16
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,311
I am not ready.

17
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,981
Have you not prepared...

18
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:50,160
...to be king your whole life?

19
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,272
Have you not trained and studied,

20
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:56,875
been by my side?

21
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,495
Sophia, hello. 

22
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:37,997
Good to see you.

23
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,375
Who are these two?

24
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:46,630
My friends from Kenya.
Very deep pockets. They're good.

25
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,008
Good for trouble...

26
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,259
...like you?

27
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:01,261
Thank you.

28
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:12,850
Over here.

29
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:15,836
One whiskey, please.

30
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,030
Stand down.

31
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,052
I've been made.

32
00:48:07,894 --> 00:48:08,737
Murderer!

33
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,162
King!

34
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:36,464
The world watches.

35
00:54:21,184 --> 00:54:24,479
We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.

36
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,024
Better to let him talk to Klaue 
alone for 5 minutes...

36
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:33,530
...than to make a scene here.

37
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:52,748
If he touches you again,

38
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:55,468
I'm going to impale him to this desk.

39
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,322
Where is that?

40
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,475
Back there.

41
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:38,849
Something is happening out back.

42
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:24,262
My King!

43
00:59:27,957 --> 00:59:28,624
My King.

44
01:08:29,965 --> 01:08:31,117
Who are you?

45
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:25,361
Tell us what is going on.

46
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:46,640
Speak.

47
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,165
My goodness.

48
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:40,712
Who are you?

49
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:45,375
I am N'Jadaka, son of Prince N'Jobu.

50
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:47,544
Son of N'Jobu?

51
01:15:51,932 --> 01:15:53,058
You're lying!

52
01:16:00,348 --> 01:16:02,600
The descendent of N'Jobu.

53
01:22:40,048 --> 01:22:41,324
Thank you.

54
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:45,912
I cannot.

55
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:13,193
Praise the ancestors.

56
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,561
Praise the ancestors.

57
01:36:15,487 --> 01:36:17,397
Praise the ancestors.

58
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,408
Praise the ancestors.

59
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:28,233
My son.

60
01:36:51,390 --> 01:36:52,508
Why?

61
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:15,417
Shields!

62
01:47:19,976 --> 01:47:20,727
Lock!

63
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:22,721
Get him down!

64
01:47:23,813 --> 01:47:24,698
Get the necklace!

65
01:47:25,857 --> 01:47:26,942
Get the necklace!

66
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:13,523
Charge!

67
02:13:49,647 --> 02:13:51,441
White Wolf!

68
02:13:52,734 --> 02:13:54,360
White Wolf!
