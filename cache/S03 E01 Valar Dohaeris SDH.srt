1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,009
(Roaring)

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,344
(Swords clanging)

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,970
(War cries)

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,973
Man: Fall back!

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,939
(Wind howling)

6
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,818
(Panting)

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,814
Brother?

8
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,810
(Breathing heavily)

9
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,945
(Samwell screams)

10
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,242
(Ghost growling)

11
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,327
(Whimpering)

12
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,891
(Panting)

13
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,981
Did you send the ravens?

14
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,695
Tarly, look at me.

15
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,242
Did you send the ravens?

16
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,623
That was your job.

17
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,417
Your only job.

18
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,095
We need to get back to the wall.

19
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,348
It's a long march.

20
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,517
We know what's out there,

21
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,396
but we have to make it, have to warn them

22
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,273
or before winter's done,

23
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,778
everyone you've ever known will be dead.

24
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,600
(Wind howling)

25
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,369
(Indistinct chattering)

26
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,912
First time you've seen a giant, Jon snow?

27
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,789
(Exhales)

28
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,293
Well, don't stare too long. They're shy.

29
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,882
When they stop being shy, they get angry.

30
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,217
And when they're angry,

31
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,137
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

32
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,222
like a hammer on a nail.

33
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,605
(Growls softly)

34
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,693
- Man 1: Crow!
- Boy 1: Crow!

35
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,153
Girl 1: Look over there!

36
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,654
Man 2: Crow!

37
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,324
Girl 2: Crow! Look over here! Look!

38
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,577
Woman: Look, crow coming!

39
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,162
Boy 2: Crow!

40
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,750
Ygritte: You're wearing the wrong color.

41
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,169
Mance was a ranger.

42
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,629
(Grunts)

43
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,840
In your hearts, all you
crows want to fly free.

44
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,343
Jon: When I'm free, will I be free to go?

45
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,427
- Crow!
- Crow!

46
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,678
Sure, you will.

47
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,139
- (Groans)
- (All laughing)

48
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,684
And I'll be free to kill you.

49
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,355
Got no respect, this lot.

50
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,983
Got no fathers to slap
them when they're foul.

51
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,194
What happened to their fathers?

52
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,198
Some of them were killed by crows like you.

53
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,827
Don't look so grim, Jon snow.

54
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,914
If mance rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

55
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,375
And if he don't...

56
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,108
Tormund: I smell a crow.

57
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,903
We killed his friends.
Thought you'd want to question this one.

58
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,198
What do we want with a baby crow?

59
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,159
This baby killed qhorin halfhand.

60
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,954
He wants to be one of us.

61
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,046
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

62
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,424
Friends twice your size.

63
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,345
My father told me
big men fall just as quick as little ones

64
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,598
if you put a sword through their hearts.

65
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:42,647
Plenty of little men
tried to put their swords through my heart.

66
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,566
And there's plenty of little skeletons

67
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,152
buried in the woods.

68
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,113
What's your name, boy?

69
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,406
Jon snow.

70
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,664
Your grace.

71
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,459
(Laughing)

72
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,627
- Your grace?
- (All laughing)

73
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,047
Did you hear that?

74
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,799
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

75
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,426
(Chuckung)

76
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,094
Stand, boy.

77
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,308
We don't kneel for anyone beyond the wall.

78
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:25,231
So, you're ned stark's bastard.

79
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,652
Thank you for the gift,
lord of bones. You can leave us.

80
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,331
The girl likes you.

81
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,917
You like her back, snow?

82
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,086
That why you want to join us?

83
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,921
Tormund: Don't panic, boy.

84
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,256
This isn't the damned night's watch

85
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,675
where we make you swear off girls.

86
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,012
This chicken eater you thought was
king is tormund giantsbane.

87
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:00,308
Can't believe this pup killed the halfhand.

88
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,268
Mance: He was our enemy

89
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,814
and I'm glad he's dead.

90
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,659
He was my brother once.

91
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,538
Back when he had a whole hand.

92
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,041
What were you doing with him?

93
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,919
The lord commander
sent me to the halfhand for seasoning.

94
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,714
He wants me to lead one day.

95
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,051
But here you are, a traitor,

96
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,762
kneeling before the king-beyond-the-wall.

97
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,057
If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.

98
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,733
Why do you want to join us, Jon snow?

99
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,826
I want to be free.

100
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,954
No, I don't think so.

101
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,293
I think what you
want most of all is to be a hero.

102
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,505
I'll ask you one last time,

103
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,258
why do you want to join us?

104
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,474
We stopped at craster's keep
on the way north.

105
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,436
I saw...

106
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,230
You saw what?

107
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,236
I saw craster take his own baby
boy and leave it in the woods.

108
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,239
I saw what took it.

109
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:46,206
You're telling me you saw one of them?

110
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,461
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

111
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,714
Because when I told the lord commander,

112
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,674
he already knew.

113
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:04,057
Thousands of years ago,
the first men defeated the white walkers.

114
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,769
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

115
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,816
Did I come to the right place?

116
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,407
We'll need to find you a new cloak.

117
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,333
(Children chattering indistinctly)

118
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,181
What if you took off that bit there?

119
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,478
(Chuckles) Don't you
want to leave something to the imagination?

120
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,315
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

121
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,320
I want you to take it off.

122
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,283
(Clicks tongue)

123
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,453
Mouth.

124
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,333
(Door opening)

125
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,546
Podrick: Ser bronn. Ser bronn.

126
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,258
Bronn: I didn't hear that.

127
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,385
- Apologies, ser.
- Bronn: Back away.

128
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,221
Keep backing away
till you're outside this establishment.

129
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,056
Then back away some more.

130
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,933
Lord Tyrion sent me.

131
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,060
I will murder you, boy.

132
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,814
He said it was a matter of life and death.

133
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,065
(Sighs)

134
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,289
(Knocking on door)

135
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,417
Cersei: It's your sister.

136
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,712
The queen.

137
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,352
Tyrion: What are they doing here?

138
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,229
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

139
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,399
No, I don't think so.

140
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:22,445
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?

141
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,203
They stay outside.

142
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,288
I'm not afraid of you, little brother.

143
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,465
(Creaking)

144
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,263
Why are you here?

145
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,015
I wanted to see your face.

146
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,142
They said you'd lost your nose,

147
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,311
but it's not as gruesome as all that.

148
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,897
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.

149
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,191
I should hope so.

150
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,569
The rebels came
for Joffrey's head, they lost their own.

151
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,946
Thanks to father.

152
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,824
Thanks to father.

153
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,911
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

154
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,497
No? Curious.

155
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,292
Bit of a comedown from chamber of the hand.

156
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,753
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

157
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,423
Grand maester pycelle made the same joke.

158
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,968
You must be proud to be as funny as a
man whose balls brush his knees.

159
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,719
You're meeting father today?

160
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,930
How do you know that?

161
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,516
Because I have
hundreds of spies in my employ.

162
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,645
The master of whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

163
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,858
Father told me. What do you want from him?

164
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,776
What do I want from him? He's my father.

165
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,154
Do I need to want something?

166
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:53,369
I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any
father loves his child, his baby boy.

167
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,081
Yet he hasn't come to visit once...

168
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,958
- Hmm.
- Since arriving in king's landing.

169
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,003
I lay here, my face split in half,

170
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,422
but father never came.

171
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,138
You're going to make me cry.

172
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,640
Why do you care what I want from him?

173
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,186
Because
you've slandered me to father before.

174
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,438
Slandered? When?

175
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,358
You told him I had my guards
beat that servant girl at casterly rock.

176
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,695
You did have your
guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.

177
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,572
I was nine, too.

178
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,491
She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.

179
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,284
If I remember correctly,

180
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,119
she never stole a necklace again. (Laughs)

181
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,832
It's not slander if it's true.

182
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,668
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

183
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,506
Why are you so nervous
about what I'm going to say to father?

184
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,799
Because you're a liar.

185
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,053
I expect you'll
tell lies about me, about Joffrey.

186
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,555
Any lies in particular?

187
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,809
(Sighs) You're a clever man,

188
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,895
but not as clever as you think you are.

189
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,814
Mmm. Still makes me more clever than you.

190
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,358
(Door opens)

191
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,738
Look at these two shining warriors.

192
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:15,451
Ser Taryn mant and ser whosit of whocares.

193
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,328
Ser meryn trant.

194
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,872
Ser bronn of the Blackwater.

195
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,707
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

196
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,045
Ser bronn of the Blackwater
was anointed by the king himself.

197
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:30,216
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat, nothing more.

198
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,301
That's exactly who I am.

199
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,262
And you're a grub in fancy armor

200
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,598
who's better at
beating little girls than fighting men.

201
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,351
Now, I have an
appointment with lord Tyrion.

202
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,062
You put your hand on that door,

203
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,480
you lose the hand.

204
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,250
As much as I appreciate
a walk in the sunshine,

205
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,294
I am wondering why you sent for me.

206
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,922
Many people in this city want to
kill me. You're here to protect me.

207
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,258
I've been doing that for a while now.

208
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,621
Do you grow bored protecting me?

209
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,011
I grow poor protecting you.

210
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,597
Poor? Poor?

211
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,432
Under my patronage you've become a knight,

212
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,475
you've served as commander
of the city watch.

213
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,852
Briefly.

214
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,339
I'm sure you filled your pockets.

215
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,439
And now my pockets are empty.

216
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,774
You've given me a
taste for the finer things.

217
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,320
And if you want me
protecting you, you'll need to pay more.

218
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,487
I thought we were friends.

219
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,697
We are.

220
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,991
But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.

221
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,285
I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.

222
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,745
- How much?
- Double.

223
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,829
Double?

224
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,955
I'm a knight now.

225
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,457
Knights are worth double.

226
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,917
I don't even know
how much I'm paying you now.

227
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,045
Which means you can afford it.

228
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,300
(Soft groans)

229
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,150
(Grunts)

230
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,323
(Gasps)

231
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,460
Here. Here!

232
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,137
Help me!

233
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,896
(Exhales)

234
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,773
(Ship horn blowing)

235
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,317
(Panting)

236
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,161
Who are you?

237
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,918
I was in the battle at Blackwater.

238
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,965
I was a captain and a knight.

239
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,968
Aye, ser, and serving which king?

240
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,101
The one true king of Westeros,

241
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,149
Stannis Baratheon.

242
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,285
I thought you were dead.

243
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,829
Everyone thought you were dead.

244
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,334
And your son?

245
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,718
He may have swam ashore as you did.

246
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,846
No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.

247
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,275
I'm so sorry, my friend.

248
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,905
I, too, have lost a son.
There is nothing worse in this world.

249
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,410
But, davos, you were a good father.

250
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,372
If I was a good father, he'd still be here.

251
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,585
Stannis lives?

252
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,068
He licks his wounds at dragonstone.

253
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,588
Will you take me there?

254
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,841
There is nothing for me at dragonstone.

255
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,426
This war is not over.

256
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,680
Not for you, maybe.
But for salladhor saan, the war is over.

257
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,599
We're both sworn to king Stannis.

258
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,976
I am sworn to no man.

259
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,897
I promised you 30 ships
and you promised me riches and glory.

260
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,398
I delivered the ships.

261
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,651
Stannis never gives up. Never.

262
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,860
Now he will regroup...

263
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,153
He's a broken man.

264
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,697
His fleet lies at the
bottom of Blackwater bay.

265
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,076
They say he sees no one,
not his generals, not even his wife.

266
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:13,582
Only the red woman whispering in his ear,
telling him what she sees in the flames

267
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,502
and burning men alive.

268
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,795
What?

269
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,549
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

270
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:26,929
All those who spoke against her
she called servants of darkness.

271
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,934
They say she sang to them as they burned.

272
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,940
I'm a pirate.

273
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,111
You're a smuggler. Servants of darkness.

274
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,281
I'm thinking dragonstone
is a good place for us to avoid.

275
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,866
Take me back there, please.

276
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,660
(Scoffs) You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

277
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,912
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.

278
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,122
You could try.

279
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,417
If you fail, they will burn you.

280
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,211
If you succeed, they'll burn you.

281
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,422
And you've only just come back to life.

282
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,716
(Chuckles) Stay alive
a little longer, my friend.

283
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,468
You call me friend.
You drank with me on my wedding day.

284
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,554
And you drank with me on four of mine,

285
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,723
but I don't ask you for favors.

286
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,977
I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.

287
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,733
When you are dead,

288
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,235
I will gather your bones in a little sack

289
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,196
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

290
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,421
We should set
the siege lines 1,000 yards from harrenhal.

291
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,257
There won't be a siege.
The mountain can't defend a ruin.

292
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,677
The mountain will defend
whatever tywin Lannister tells him.

293
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,138
The lannisters
have been running from us since oxcross.

294
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,891
I'd love a fight. The
men would love a fight.

295
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,435
I don't think we're going to get one.

296
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,531
(Blood dripping)

297
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,034
(Fly buzzing)

298
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,904
Rickard: Two hundred northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

299
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,991
The debt will be repaid, my friend.

300
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,910
For them and for your sons.

301
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,079
Will it?

302
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,834
They rot in the ground
while their killer runs free.

303
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,670
The kingslayer won't remain free for long.

304
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,297
My best hunters are after him.

305
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,110
Robb: A mallister?

306
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,945
Catelyn: Ser Jeremy.

307
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,656
My father's bannerman.

308
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,954
(Sighs)

309
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,597
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

310
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,818
Talisa: She's your mother.

311
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,571
Robb: She freed Jaime Lannister.

312
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,615
The lannisters robbed them of their sons

313
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,742
and she robbed them of theirjustice.

314
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,077
(Coughing)

315
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,745
Qyburn: Water.

316
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,582
(Whispers) Water.

317
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,168
This needs to be cleaned and closed.

318
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,799
What's your name, friend?

319
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,426
Beurn.

320
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,844
You're lucky to be alive.

321
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,682
Lucky?

322
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,545
The badge looks good on you.

323
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,133
Almost as good as it looked on me.

324
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,388
Are you enjoying your new position?

325
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,641
Am I enjoying it?

326
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,993
I was very happy as hand of the king.

327
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,185
(Tywin chuckles)

328
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,106
Yes. I heard how happy you were.

329
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,566
(Blows)

330
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,652
You brought a whore into my bed.

331
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,030
It wasn't your bed at the time.

332
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,702
I sent you here to advise the king.

333
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,873
I gave you real power and authority.

334
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,167
You chose to spend your days

335
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,460
as you always have,

336
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:55,090
bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.

337
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,970
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.

338
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,306
What do you want, Tyrion?

339
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,392
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

340
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,270
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

341
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,024
My beloved father who

342
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,318
somehow forgot to visit his wounded son

343
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,695
after he fell on the battlefield.

344
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,115
Maester pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

345
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,702
I organized the defense of this city

346
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,622
while you held court in
the ruins of harrenhal.

347
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,166
I led the foray
when the enemies were at the gate

348
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:34,254
while your grandson, the king,
quivered in fear behind the walls.

349
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,342
I bled in the mud for our family.

350
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,138
And as my reward, I was
trundled off to some dark little cell.

351
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,974
But what do I want?

352
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,394
A little bloody gratitude would be a start.

353
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,606
Jugglers and singers require applause.

354
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,150
You are a Lannister.

355
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,237
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses

356
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,739
every time I suffered a
wound on a battlefield?

357
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,577
Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after

358
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,413
and three of them are in open rebellion.

359
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:13,835
So tell me what you want.

360
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,509
I want what is mine by right.

361
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,847
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

362
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:30,018
But he is a kingsguard,
forbidden from marriage or inheritance.

363
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,354
The day Jaime put on the white cloak,

364
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,731
he gave up his claim to casterly rock.

365
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,069
I am your son and lawful heir.

366
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,490
You want casterly rock?

367
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,492
It is mine by right.

368
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,079
(Sighs)

369
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,750
We'll find you accommodations
more suited to your name

370
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,087
and as a reward for your accomplishments

371
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,923
during the battle of Blackwater bay.

372
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:05,095
And when the time is right, you will
be given a position fit for your talents

373
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:09,016
so that you can
serve your family and protect our legacy.

374
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,854
And if you serve faithfully,
you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.

375
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,357
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

376
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:22,029
before mocking the family
name and making you heir to casterly rock.

377
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,618
You ask that?

378
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,830
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

379
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:36,084
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

380
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,171
full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

381
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:44,217
Men's laws give you the right to bear my
name and display my colors

382
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,262
since I cannot prove that you are not mine.

383
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,391
And to teach me humility,
the gods have condemned me

384
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:54,936
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

385
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,774
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

386
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,692
But neither gods nor men

387
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,653
will ever compel me to
let you turn casterly rock

388
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,530
into your whorehouse.

389
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,326
Go, now.

390
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,291
Speak no more of
your rights to casterly rock.

391
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,472
One more thing.

392
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,479
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

393
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:48,073
Sansa: Dorne. It's going to dorne.

394
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,449
Shae: Why dorne?

395
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,867
It's carrying silk

396
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:54,454
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

397
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,919
But it's not coming back.

398
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,380
The captain's tired of risking his life

399
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,549
so king's landing lords and ladies

400
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,844
can get drunk
on better wine than they deserve.

401
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,222
He's going to stay in dorne.

402
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,767
Wait out the winter
where it's beautiful and warm.

403
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,479
I met some people in dorne
who weren't so beautiful and warm.

404
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,898
Don't ruin the game.

405
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:24,568
I told you, I don't want to play.

406
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,446
What about that one there?

407
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,949
Shae: That one? It's going to volantis.

408
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:36,872
Because when I got on a ship
in volantis, it looked like that one.

409
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,457
That's not how the game works.

410
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,127
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

411
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,089
You've got to invent a story about
where the ship is going and why.

412
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,260
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

413
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,806
Because the truth
is always either terrible or boring.

414
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,558
Lovely day for it.

415
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,561
Watching the ships.

416
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,271
Lord baelish.

417
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,152
Might I speak
with lady sansa alone for a moment?

418
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,666
I saw your mother not long ago.

419
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,378
She's very eager to see you.

420
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,965
And your sister.

421
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,718
Arya's alive?

422
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,183
You said you'd take me home.

423
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,937
You said king's landing was your home.

424
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,690
You are the property of the crown.
Stealing you would be treason.

425
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,359
If you were to tell just one person...

426
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,568
I won't tell anyone.

427
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,819
How do I know?

428
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,863
Because I'm a terrible liar.

429
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,241
You said so yourself.

430
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,286
Please, lord baelish.
Tell me what to do. Tell me when.

431
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:05,794
I'm waiting for word on an assignment that
will take me far away from the capital.

432
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:10,298
When I set sail,
I might be able to take you with me.

433
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,593
But you'll need to
be ready to leave on a moment's notice.

434
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,806
You're her handmaiden?

435
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,852
Yes. And you're his...

436
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,980
I help manage his affairs.

437
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,524
He's an important person.

438
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,942
So is she.

439
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,445
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

440
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:36,825
The day she was born, they rang
the bells from sunrise till sunset.

441
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,788
We've both done rather well, you and I.

442
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,084
Yes.

443
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,044
Given where we started.

444
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,006
And where is that?

445
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,178
It's not easy
for girls like us to dig our way out.

446
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,686
Watch out for her.

447
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,730
I always do.

448
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,150
Watch out for her with him.

449
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,374
(Dragon screeching)

450
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,016
(All screeching)

451
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,828
They're growing fast.

452
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,914
(Purrs)

453
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,250
Not fast enough.

454
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,754
I can't wait that long.

455
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,592
I need an army.

456
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,388
We'll be in astapor by nightfall.

457
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,600
Some say the unsullied
are the greatest soldiers in the world.

458
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,395
The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.

459
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,689
The distinction
means a good deal to some people.

460
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,191
Do those people have any better ideas

461
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,777
about how to put you on the iron throne?

462
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,923
It's too beautiful a day to argue.

463
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,115
(Man vomiting)

464
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,744
- You're right.
- (Man coughing)

465
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,874
Another lovely day on the high seas.

466
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,835
Daenerys: Don't mock them.

467
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,129
They're the first Dothraki on a ship.

468
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,506
They followed me across the poison water.

469
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,384
If they'll do it,
others will. And with a true khalasar...

470
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,555
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

471
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,559
You'll have a true
khalasar when you prove yourself strong.

472
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,686
And not before.

473
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,339
Davos: Your grace.

474
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,020
I heard you were dead.

475
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,855
Not yet.

476
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,110
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, your grace.

477
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,030
We are alone.

478
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,209
Your grace, you are the rightful king.

479
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,504
Not only by blood.

480
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,215
You're an honorable man, a just man.

481
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,425
And there is still a war to fight.

482
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,678
I am fighting.

483
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,848
By burning prisoners alive?

484
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,819
How would you punish
the infidels, ser davos?

485
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,522
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

486
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,899
If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea

487
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,318
before you ever set foot on dragonstone.

488
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,611
I'm not your enemy.

489
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,029
You are my enemy.

490
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,285
Was it me you fought on Blackwater bay?

491
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,164
Did I set your ships ablaze?

492
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,795
I wasn't there when the wildfire

493
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,964
killed our men by the thousands.

494
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,759
I could have saved those men.

495
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:09,138
You would have taken the city,
Stannis would sit upon his rightful throne,

496
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,723
and you would stand beside him.

497
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,476
But I wasn't there

498
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,938
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

499
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,157
Do you hear them screaming?

500
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:33,621
All those burning men
in the water crying for their mothers,

501
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,125
for their gods for help?

502
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,295
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

503
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,554
Don't despair, ser davos.

504
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,639
What I told your son is true.

505
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,810
Death by fire is the purest death.

506
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,312
(Grunts)

507
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,957
- This woman is evil!
- (Knife clattering)

508
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,691
She's the mother of demons.

509
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,068
Take him and lock him in a cell.

510
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,570
- Your grace!
- Come on.

511
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,173
You've chosen the darkness, ser davos.

512
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,615
She will destroy us all!

513
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,116
Melisandre: I will pray for you.

514
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,327
Davos: Your grace!

515
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,703
(Door closes)

516
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,748
(Indistinct chattering)

517
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,315
Man 1: Halt. Down.

518
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,318
Man 2: Halt. Down.

519
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,694
(Thudding)

520
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,868
Why have we stopped?

521
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,244
It's lady margaery, your grace.

522
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,124
Joffrey: What is she doing?
Who gave her permission?

523
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,506
Female servant: My lady.
We should have guards, my lady.

524
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,674
Margaery: Why?

525
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,721
Pardon me.

526
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:24,649
Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress.

527
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,067
I have others.

528
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,115
(Baby crying)

529
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,200
Would you like to speak
with her, your grace?

530
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,286
(All murmuring)

531
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,374
He was a soldier.

532
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:45,253
He went to fight on the walls when the
ships came into Blackwater bay.

533
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,089
He never came back.

534
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,008
And your mother?

535
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,260
She died when she had me.

536
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,599
Bad men wanted to
come into this city and do terrible things,

537
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,769
but your father stopped them.

538
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,444
Whenever you look at this knight,

539
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,863
I want you to remember your father.

540
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:18,202
He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.

541
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,872
And what do knights swear to do?

542
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,208
Protect the weak and uphold the good.

543
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,961
Your father did that. Be proud of him.

544
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,801
Was your father a soldier, too?

545
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,971
You should be proud, too.

546
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:44,479
Under king Joffrey's
leadership, your fathers saved the city.

547
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,856
They saved us all.

548
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,068
From now on, we're
going to take care of you.

549
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,655
All of you.

550
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,583
- (Children chattering excitedly)
- {Chuckung)

551
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:05,500
Come to me for what you need to feed
them, clothe them, or house them.

552
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,170
Directly to me.

553
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,052
(Margaery chuckling)

554
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,058
(Door opens)

555
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,395
- Your grace.
- Your grace.

556
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,147
Please, sit. Sit.

557
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,691
I do apologize, my lady.

558
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,111
Small council meetings.

559
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,405
At what point does
it become treason to waste the king's time?

560
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,532
(Chuckles)

561
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,412
That's a lovely gown, my lady.

562
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,581
Yes, it suits you perfectly.

563
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,959
I imagine you might be rather cold.

564
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,669
The climate is a bit more forgiving

565
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,379
back in highgarden, your grace.

566
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,632
Joffrey: Shall I have them
bring you a shawl, my lady?

567
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,135
I am touched by your concern, your grace.

568
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,471
Luckily for us tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

569
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,597
Doesn't it, loras?

570
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,765
Yes.

571
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,101
Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?

572
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,187
The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.

573
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,481
I've never seen anything like it.

574
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,817
You might find a bit of armor quite useful

575
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,236
once you become queen. Perhaps before.

576
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,739
Joffrey tells me you
stopped your carriage at flea bottom

577
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,908
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

578
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:25,997
Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage
the high septon told me about.

579
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,058
Margaery does a great deal of work

580
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,402
with the poor back in highgarden.

581
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:32,563
Margaery: The lowest
among us are no different from the highest

582
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:33,838
if you give them a chance

583
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,923
and approach them with an open heart.

584
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,884
Cersei: An open heart is what you'll get

585
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,886
if you're not careful, my dear.

586
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:43,639
Not long ago,
we were attacked by a mob there.

587
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,475
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

588
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,395
The king barely escaped with his life.

589
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:53,357
My mother's always
had a penchant for drama.

590
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:57,653
Facts become less and
less important to her as she grows older.

591
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,615
Our lives were never truly in danger.

592
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,743
You're right, of course.

593
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,038
But you are your father's son.

594
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,624
We can't all have a king's bravery.

595
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,877
(Sighs)

596
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,675
Hunger turns men into beasts.

597
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,512
I'm glad house Tyrell
has been able to help in this regard.

598
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:27,058
They tell me 100
wagons arrive daily now from the reach.

599
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,686
Wheat, barley, apples.
We've had a blessed harvest.

600
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:35,524
And it's our duty
to assist the capital in time of need.

601
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,235
Well, as ser loras said,

602
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,070
lady margaery has done this sort

603
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,240
of, uh, charitable work before.

604
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,993
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.

605
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,996
I'm sure she does.

606
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,416
(Dragons screeching)

607
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,639
(Speaks valyrian)

608
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:22,405
Missandei: The unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night with no food or water.

609
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,782
(Kraznys continues
speaking valyrian)

610
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,371
Missandei: They will stand until they drop.

611
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,206
(Kraznys continues
speaking valyrian)

612
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,709
Such is their obedience.

613
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,381
They may suit my needs.
Tell me of their training.

614
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,507
(Both speaking valyrian)

615
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,843
The westerosi woman is pleased with them,

616
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:48,139
but speaks no praise
to keep the price down.

617
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,517
She wishes to know how they are trained.

618
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:58,482
Tell her what
she would know and be quick about it.

619
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,068
The day is hot.

620
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,654
Missandei: They begin their training at 5.

621
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,614
Every day they drill from dawn to dusk

622
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,616
until they have mastered the shortsword,

623
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,661
the shield, and the three Spears.

624
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,998
Only one boy in four
survives this rigorous training.

625
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,334
(Speaks valyrian)

626
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:20,046
Missandei: Their discipline
and loyalty are absolute.

627
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,048
They fear nothing.

628
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,508
Even the bravest men fear death.

629
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:25,760
(In valyrian)

630
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,430
The knight says even brave men fear death.

631
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,683
Tell the old man he smells of piss.

632
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,270
Truly, master?

633
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,355
No, not truly.

634
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,983
Are you a girl or a goat
to ask such a thing?

635
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:50,451
Missandei: My master says the unsullied
are not men. Death means nothing to them.

636
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,869
(In valyrian)

637
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:56,248
Tell this ignorant whore of a westerner

638
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,292
to open her eyes and watch.

639
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,381
He begs you attend
to this carefully, your grace.

640
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,593
(Speaks valyrian)

641
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,730
Tell the good master there is no need.

642
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:23,651
She's worried about their nipples?

643
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,571
Does the dumb bitch know
we've cut off their balls?

644
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,324
Missandei: My master
points out that men don't need nipples.

645
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,662
(In valyrian)

646
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,788
Here, I'm done with you.

647
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,457
This one is pleased to have served you.

648
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,505
(Kraznys continues
speaking valyrian)

649
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,426
To win his shield,

650
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:52,304
an unsullied must go
to the slave marts with a silver Mark,

651
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,892
find a newborn
and kill it before its mother's eyes.

652
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,772
This way, my master says, we make certain

653
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,941
there is no weakness left in them.

654
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,237
You take a babe from its mother's arms,

655
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,949
kill it as she watches,
and pay for her pain with a silver coin?

656
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,200
(In valyrian)

657
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,452
She is offended.

658
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:17,705
She asks
if you pay a silver coin to the mother,

659
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:18,873
for her dead baby.

660
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,043
What a soft mewling fool this one is.

661
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,008
My master would
like you to know that the silver is paid

662
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,552
to the baby's owner, not the mother.

663
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,311
How many do you have to sell?

664
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,896
(Missandei repeats in valyrian)

665
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,358
Eight thousand.

666
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,485
(In valyrian)

667
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:51,572
Tell the westerosi whore
she has until tomorrow.

668
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,325
Missandei: Master kraznys
asks that you please hurry.

669
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,161
Many other buyers are interested.

670
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,632
Daenerys: Eight thousand dead babies.

671
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,385
The unsullied are a means to an end.

672
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,387
Once I own them, these men...

673
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:18,349
They're not men. Not anymore.

674
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,519
Once I own an army
of slaves, what will I be?

675
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,188
You think these slaves
will have better lives

676
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,941
serving men like kraznys or serving you?

677
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,151
(Indistinct chattering)

678
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:45,125
You'll be fair to them.
You won't mutilate them to make a point.

679
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,299
You won't order them to murder babies.

680
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,802
You'll see they're
properly fed and sheltered.

681
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,471
A great injustice has been done to them.

682
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,183
Closing your eyes will not undo it.

683
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,402
(Chuckles)

684
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,072
(Daenerys groans)

685
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,240
(Grunts)

686
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,500
(Hisses)

687
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:37,678
(Hisses)

688
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,034
The warlocks.

689
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,415
I owe you my life, ser.

690
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:10,336
The honor is mine, my queen.

691
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,008
You know this man?

692
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,010
I know him

693
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,137
as one of the greatest fighters

694
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,306
the seven kingdoms has ever seen

695
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:26,727
and as the lord commander
of Robert Baratheon's kingsguard.

696
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,230
King Robert is dead.

697
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:34,693
I have been searching for you, Daenerys
stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.

698
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,572
I was sworn to protect your family.

699
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,409
I failed them.

700
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:52,419
I am barristan selmy,
kingsguard to your father.

701
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:57,633
Allow me to join your queensguard
and I will not fail you again.
