1
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:33,792
Why are you back so early?

2
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:37,096
Aren't you supposed to be
recording a show?

3
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,140
Change of plans.

4
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:43,241
Me, too.

5
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:50,709
Drink this.

6
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,050
Didn't you eat?

7
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:03,455
I did, but I'm still starving.

8
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:12,669
Why are you eating noodles
instead of rice?

9
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:16,899
Just wanted something simple.

10
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:19,441
It's good, huh?

11
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:25,847
If you could stop time,
what would you do first?

12
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,915
If everyone else is frozen
and only you can move?

13
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:37,393
If time stopped,
you wouldn't die.

14
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:42,231
Don't you want to live?

15
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,370
Not talking to me?

16
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,938
Too sorry to die and
leave the girl you love alone.

17
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:59,949
Okay, I can understand that much.

18
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,148
But still...

19
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:08,519
How can you marry her off
to someone else?

20
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:12,824
Isn't that going overboard?

21
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:18,803
You're not dead, yet.

22
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:24,000
- How can you watch that?
- Ah, Jenna?

23
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,909
Let's just stick to our jobs.

24
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:31,648
What's love?

25
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:40,960
Like brushing your teeth.

26
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:43,126
Brushing your teeth?

27
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,554
But you do that alone.

28
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:48,865
Do you brush to show someone?

29
00:02:52,494 --> 00:02:55,065
Why didn't you come yesterday?

30
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:00,869
Pardon?

31
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:13,349
I said, did you wait for me?

32
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:20,691
Well, just wondering
why you didn't come.

33
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:23,895
You fell in love with me,
didn't you?

34
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:25,364
What?

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,275
Love makes you wonder
and wait for that person.

36
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:35,770
It's not that.
If a patient doesn't come, I wait.

37
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,377
Do you wonder about
every patient?

38
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,576
Well...

39
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,724
You're blushing.
It's love all right.

40
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:49,195
<i>Hey, KANG ChuHwu'.!</i>

41
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:50,854
Yes, boss.

42
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:53,999
How much did you get
from KIM Gap-sik?

43
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,058
Should've been more discreet!

44
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:00,630
Cat Girl's on your show
10 times a week!

45
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:03,710
Think people will stay still?

46
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:09,912
Someone wrote in
to audit your show!

47
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:13,678
What's got into you
all of a sudden?

48
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:17,780
You of all people!

49
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:24,222
When are you going to
break it off?

50
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:26,789
In a rush?

51
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:29,825
You saw my medical records.

52
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:34,839
I want to keep playing.

53
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:40,870
But I guess you don't
have that luxury.

54
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,044
Under one condition.

55
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,595
Now, what.

56
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,695
I'll tell you
after I break it off.

57
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:02,395
A promise is a promise.

58
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:21,113
Since when was it
no smoking in here.

59
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,088
No idea.

60
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:39,162
Our parents will be shocked.

61
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:54,704
I should be really angry
at a time like this, right?

62
00:05:56,144 --> 00:06:00,490
Yell at you or something?

63
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:11,566
Funny, somehow I feel
a little grateful.

64
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,900
I'm going out for a smoke.

65
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,644
So uncomfortable.

66
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:26,448
My engagement is off.

67
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,462
I don't have parents.

68
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:43,926
I was studying late at high school
in my senior year.

69
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:48,539
My homeroom teacher came in
and stared right at me.

70
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:57,512
Like someone who came
to take me on death row.

71
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,580
Like in the movies, you know?

72
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:06,721
Anyway, he told me

73
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:11,328
to go to the hospital right away.

74
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,634
When I asked why...

75
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:17,925
if he said my parents and

76
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:21,373
sister died
in a car accident...

77
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:27,175
then I wouldn't have gone
and seen them like that.

78
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,415
I see...

79
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:35,649
K's been with me ever since.

80
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,090
K?

81
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:44,422
You saw him,
Producer KANG Chul-kyu?

82
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:49,099
His name sounds too corny
so I just call him K.

83
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:57,105
At home, he's my Mom
At work, he's my Dad.

84
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:59,539
When I'm sad, he's my brother.

85
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:04,272
Sometimes he's like a lover.
Though he always chickens out.

86
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:09,048
Can I kiss you?

87
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:13,248
You wanna kiss me?

88
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,233
Stupid.

89
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,938
Let me see.

90
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:30,467
Oh, no.

91
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,602
That's right, I'm stupid!

92
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:44,514
Open the door.
Are you okay?

93
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,698
<i>Don't look!
Stupid!</i>

94
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,976
<i>Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid!</i>

95
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,436
<i>I was born to love you.</i>

96
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:46,510
<i>Heaven sent me to love you.</i>

97
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:50,844
<i>Cat Girl's
'If I could live again'</i>

98
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,182
- You wrote this song, Cream?
- Yes.

99
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:57,754
Let's hear,
'If I could live again'.

100
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:08,632
(Did You eat?)

101
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:12,734
(I'm almost done!)

102
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,818
Yes, boss.

103
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:34,588
<i>Come to my office, now.</i>

104
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:35,897
Okay.

105
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:47,277
Producer KANG!

106
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,108
KANG!

107
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:55,405
I heard everything. I'm going
to speak with the boss, right now!

108
00:10:55,944 --> 00:11:00,950
How can he fire a genius
like you!

109
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:03,016
I'm not getting fired.

110
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,819
Same difference.

111
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,528
- You can't go like this!
- I'm taking a break.

112
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,590
Really?
That's not what I heard.

113
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:17,870
I'm going to the States
to study for a while.

114
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:25,145
Really? Guess there's no use
going to the boss.

115
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:29,810
Thank you for everything,
Mr. KIM.

116
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:33,258
<i>- Anytime.
- You too, Min-chm.</i>

117
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:36,758
Give him the demo tape,
Min-chul.

118
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:41,900
Producer CHOI! Hold on!
Wait!

119
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:51,536
Min-chul...

120
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:18,866
It's a ballad.

121
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,805
Write up a good song.

122
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,211
What's marriage?

123
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:35,010
Marriage?

124
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:36,820
Marriage.

125
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,821
- Marriage...
- Wait!

126
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,335
A toothbrush holder.

127
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,175
What?

128
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:06,385
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

129
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:10,755
What's that got to do
with marriage?

130
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:17,987
Being together as one
like toothbrushes in a holder.

131
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:24,036
Then I must be married,
already.

132
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,864
Stupid! You can't be married
without a wedding.

133
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:33,045
Really?

134
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,838
<i>L</i> I gotta pee.

135
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,945
<i>No one else but Thee.</i>

136
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:16,581
'Thee' is a lucky person.

137
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:22,225
Wanna hear it?

138
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,925
EUN Won and I living together
probably got to you.

139
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,524
But there's nothing to
worry about.

140
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:06,198
I'm okay with that.

141
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:12,641
I'm thankful for
everything you did for her.

142
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,507
Let's get together often.

143
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:19,148
Go on trips together
and stuff.

144
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,286
Sounds good.

145
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:27,924
She says she wants to pick out
her wedding dress with you.

146
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,923
Gotta love her wild ideas.

147
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:32,054
Why me?

148
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,063
I want what she wants.

149
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,531
Please do it for her.

150
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:52,414
And I hope it's the last thing
you ever do for her.

151
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:58,250
Sure.
Please take good care of her.

152
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:02,486
Of course.
She's my woman, now.

153
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:04,160
Let's drink.

154
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,404
What do you think?

155
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,044
Very pretty-

156
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,824
It's time for the groom-to-be
to try on his suit.

157
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:40,120
I'm not the groom.

158
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:41,725
Try it on.

159
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:51,672
Come up here.

160
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:58,941
Come here.
Can you take a picture of us?

161
00:16:59,073 --> 00:17:02,611
On three.
One, two, three!

162
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:14,196
Wait out there.
I'll try on something else.

163
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,481
Why are all the clocks stopped?

164
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,188
No reason.

165
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:00,063
Can I turn one on?

166
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:05,603
Why?

167
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,668
No reason.

168
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:11,167
No reason?

169
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:13,740
Sure.

170
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:44,403
Jenna?
I have a big favor to ask.

171
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:46,945
What is it?

172
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:54,751
I need to send flowers
on her anniversary for a few years.

173
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:01,826
She'll get suspicious,
if I lose touch altogether.

174
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:08,229
I had one more condition.
Remember?

175
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:13,034
What is it?

176
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,055
Please die at my side.

177
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:48,770
You booked the tickets?

178
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:54,606
I'm running low on battery.

179
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:57,443
Hey.

180
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:01,182
What are you making?

181
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:08,950
My phone battery ran out.

182
00:22:09,617 --> 00:22:15,898
I'll charge it
and call you back later.

183
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:17,457
Bye.

184
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,766
Hi.

185
00:22:23,264 --> 00:22:26,905
Why'd you leave me there
like that?

186
00:22:28,035 --> 00:22:29,514
It's for you.

187
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:41,922
Who do you think you are!

188
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:44,257
What's with you?

189
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:47,262
Who says you can
touch my phone!

190
00:22:49,523 --> 00:22:51,366
The hell you...

191
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:57,234
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

192
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:32,273
Can I help you?

193
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:34,004
Is K home?

194
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:37,207
K?

195
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:02,603
Someone's here.

196
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:25,921
She's pretty.
I can see why you love her.

197
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:32,327
You think she's happy?

198
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,305
What are you saying?

199
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:38,134
She didn't seem happy.

200
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,579
Can you send this
for the next 3 years?

201
00:24:45,406 --> 00:24:46,851
It's pretty-

202
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,085
Maybe too pretty.

203
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:56,487
It looks fake.
Like your love.

204
00:24:57,551 --> 00:24:59,497
Then what's real?

205
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:05,002
Real?

206
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:11,466
If you're hungry, you eat.
If you're hurting, you cry.

207
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:16,838
If you're having fun, you laugh.
Not hold it in like you.

208
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:20,912
You really wanna die like this?

209
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:25,146
No!

210
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:29,224
I don't want to die like this.

211
00:25:30,617 --> 00:25:32,824
I want to live a happy life.

212
00:25:35,456 --> 00:25:37,732
I want to be the one
marrying EUN Won...

213
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:40,896
...instead of him, tomorrow.

214
00:25:45,232 --> 00:25:46,711
But...

215
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,641
That's just a dream.

216
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:52,011
A sad dream.

217
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:58,583
I'm done with dreaming.

218
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:56,472
<i>Sleep tight and sweet dreams.</i>

219
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,862
<i>Did you eat?
- Cream</i>

220
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:25,274
Thanks.

221
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:46,555
<i>I'm not talking to you.</i>

222
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:56,531
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

223
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,015
<i>For what?</i>

224
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,445
<i>For everything.</i>

225
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:17,992
<i>I'm sorry, too.</i>

226
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:20,027
<i>For what?</i>

227
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,429
<i>For everything.</i>

228
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:28,798
<i>I love you...</i>

229
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,345
<i>I like you.</i>

230
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:37,012
Me, too.

231
00:30:58,545 --> 00:31:00,422
That's some story.

232
00:31:02,682 --> 00:31:06,027
KANG...amazing guy.
I had no idea.

233
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:14,094
Is there anyway to reach them?
What about the dentist?

234
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:23,778
Wonder what happened to her.

235
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:34,355
Let's record it.

236
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:38,891
Really?
I'll call right now.

237
00:31:39,052 --> 00:31:42,261
No, the other song.

238
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,127
Oh, that song.

239
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:13,345
I gotta go, I'm late.

240
00:33:13,346 --> 00:33:16,725
Get up and eat.
I made breakfast.

241
00:34:14,307 --> 00:34:15,684
<i>What's this?</i>

242
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:21,290
<i>Ah, Vitamin ABC.
It helps me get smarter.</i>

243
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:11,501
Where'd you get these pills?

244
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,172
They're my friends' pills.

245
00:35:14,868 --> 00:35:19,339
Since when did your friend
start taking this?

246
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,776
Why?

247
00:35:22,442 --> 00:35:26,754
The pain must've been severe
to take these pills.

248
00:35:28,214 --> 00:35:29,318
What?

249
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:35,390
They're painkillers for patients
with cancer or leukemia.

250
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:37,760
<i>Terminal patients.</i>

251
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:42,802
<i>Have you heard of
the hospice ward?</i>

252
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,542
<i>It's where dying patients stay...</i>

253
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:52,040
<i>with consent from their families.</i>

254
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,294
Mom!

255
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:11,023
Watch the house while we're out.

256
00:36:11,024 --> 00:36:13,436
See you later, sis!

257
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,044
No!

258
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:48,831
<i>When I found out
what Vitamin ABC really was...</i>

259
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:52,942
<i>When I finally realized
what they were...</i>

260
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:57,740
<i>my whole world
turned pitch dark before me...</i>

261
00:36:58,171 --> 00:36:59,650
What's wrong?

262
00:36:59,873 --> 00:37:02,581
<i>I died before K.</i>

263
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:13,226
<i>I met K a year after
my whole family passed away.</i>

264
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:18,959
<i>Though almost 3 hours passed...</i>

265
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:23,399
<i>he stood there frozen like stone.</i>

266
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,232
<i>Crying and looking in the direction
his mother went.</i>

267
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:32,046
<i>This will be enough to support you
till you're an adult, Chul-kyu.</i>

268
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:39,216
<i>He looked sadder
and more hurt than me.</i>

269
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:43,457
<i>He needed a hug
more than me.</i>

270
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:46,727
ls there anything
you want to tell me?

271
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,023
Like what?

272
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:55,901
A deep, dark secret?

273
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:02,138
Say anything.
I'm ready to listen.

274
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:05,181
I like you.

275
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:08,112
<i>Stupid idiot.</i>

276
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,517
Do you have a wish?

277
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,177
What's with you?

278
00:38:12,178 --> 00:38:15,318
Just curious all of a sudden.

279
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,827
If you could do
anything you want in the world.

280
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:23,423
<i>K is dying-</i>

281
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:26,236
Meet a great guy
and get married.

282
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:28,260
Can't I marry you?

283
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:30,468
I'm not a great guy.

284
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,931
Then who is?

285
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:36,846
Someone who is healthy
and nice.

286
00:38:37,403 --> 00:38:39,906
Who knows how to
take care of his family.

287
00:38:41,107 --> 00:38:44,316
<i>I already met a great guy.</i>

288
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:48,819
<i>But K told me
to meet someone else.</i>

289
00:38:49,282 --> 00:38:52,786
<i>He said that was his wish.</i>

290
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:58,302
<i>KANG Chul-kyu</i>

291
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:05,067
<i>When I heard K fainted...</i>

292
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:09,342
<i>I rushed over,
afraid I'll go crazy.</i>

293
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:12,813
<i>But I...</i>

294
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,340
<i>...couldn't even go crazy.</i>

295
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:17,342
No, doc.

296
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:20,017
But she should know.

297
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,483
What are you going to do?

298
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:26,254
I don't know.

299
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:33,570
It feels like a needle
stuck in my throat.

300
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,637
Right here.

301
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,539
It gets stuck right here.

302
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:46,643
I can't say it.

303
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:55,156
She'll live on.
Think of yourself.

304
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:58,361
She's different.

305
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:01,791
She needs someone beside her.

306
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:19,606
- Hello.
- There goes Mr. Perfect.

307
00:40:20,907 --> 00:40:23,319
Glowing from head to toe!

308
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:30,423
<i>I picked a man.</i>

309
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:42,366
Which side did you drink from?

310
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:46,698
Pardon?

311
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:49,111
I'm engaged.

312
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:57,020
<i>Stupid. You think I care
whether you're engaged or not?</i>

313
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:01,918
<i>Just play along and meet me.
For K.</i>

314
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:05,019
<i>Am I a bitch?</i>

315
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:08,220
<i>I don't have time
to worry about that!</i>

316
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:10,599
<i>The man I love is dying!</i>

317
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:27,281
<i>If I could be born again...
A ring? A pair of glasses?</i>

318
00:41:28,975 --> 00:41:33,082
<i>A bed? A diary?</i>

319
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:37,255
<i>Born again as things like that?
What fun is that?</i>

320
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:42,159
<i>You can buy me.
It'll always be right at your side.</i>

321
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:01,983
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

322
00:42:04,077 --> 00:42:05,351
Let me see your hand.

323
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,221
Where are you going?

324
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,920
<i>I made a deal with myself.</i>

325
00:42:36,642 --> 00:42:39,122
<i>If he turns around,
I'd tell him everything.</i>

326
00:42:40,646 --> 00:42:45,026
<i>If he turns around,
I'd hug him and stop everything.</i>

327
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:49,757
<i>But K didn't look back.</i>

328
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,560
<i>And there was nothing
I could do.</i>

329
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:02,713
Why are you eating noodles
instead of rice?

330
00:43:03,669 --> 00:43:05,876
Just wanted something simple.

331
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,981
- It's good, huh?
- Yeah.

332
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:19,154
<i>As I sat eating the noodles
with him...</i>

333
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,721
<i>I'd think,
'Don't die you bastard'</i>

334
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:25,601
<i>and drank some water instead.</i>

335
00:43:26,092 --> 00:43:30,871
<i>'Tell me. Let me hold you!
I'll die with you!'</i>

336
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:35,668
<i>'I'll follow you and pay you back
for everything you did for me!'</i>

337
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:39,678
<i>Instead, I just drank the water.</i>

338
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:43,346
<i>And finished the noodles.</i>

339
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:53,156
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

340
00:43:54,754 --> 00:43:57,564
What's that got to do
with marriage?

341
00:43:58,424 --> 00:44:05,000
Being together as one
like toothbrushes in a holder.

342
00:44:08,768 --> 00:44:11,078
Then I must be married, already.

343
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:16,418
Stupid! You can't be married
without a wedding.

344
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:19,913
Really?

345
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:52,521
Can we get married, soon?

346
00:45:17,937 --> 00:45:20,679
Wait out there.
I'll try on something else.

347
00:45:57,143 --> 00:45:59,248
The hell you...

348
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:05,058
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

349
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:16,998
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

350
00:46:23,636 --> 00:46:26,674
<i>I want to tell him I love him.</i>

351
00:46:27,073 --> 00:46:31,453
<i>I want to open my mouth
and say I love him.</i>

352
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:36,792
<i>But I knew tears will fall
before I could say it.</i>

353
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:40,529
<i>So I kept silent, again.</i>

354
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:56,106
When are you going to talk to me?

355
00:46:57,603 --> 00:47:02,109
Didn't you hear me
screaming at you all this time?

356
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,153
What?

357
00:47:05,644 --> 00:47:07,317
Stupid.

358
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:09,993
I didn't hear anything.

359
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:13,327
Then how can mutes love?

360
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:27,373
I love you.

361
00:47:32,304 --> 00:47:33,783
Me, too.

362
00:47:58,497 --> 00:48:01,103
<i>We became a real couple.</i>

363
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,472
<i>Because we made it down the aisle.</i>

364
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:37,935
<i>Heaven's Gate Resting Place</i>

365
00:49:56,882 --> 00:49:58,020
Wait!

366
00:49:58,083 --> 00:49:59,460
You never learn!

367
00:50:00,553 --> 00:50:02,430
How can you write
with a brain like that?

368
00:50:11,664 --> 00:50:14,076
This isn't kissing, is it?

369
00:50:26,245 --> 00:50:27,815
Can you take a picture of us?

370
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:30,493
On three.
One, two, three!

371
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:40,462
<i>I was born to love you.
Heaven send me to love you.</i>

372
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:42,833
<i>- EUN Won -</i>

373
00:51:42,988 --> 00:51:44,555
<i>I'm making noodles.
Want some?</i>

374
00:51:44,556 --> 00:51:46,624
<i>No, I gotta work.</i>

375
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:47,992
<i>You sure?</i>

376
00:51:47,993 --> 00:51:49,768
<i>Yes, I'm working!</i>

377
00:51:49,862 --> 00:51:53,867
<i>- Then I'm just making one!
- Okay.</i>

378
00:51:54,733 --> 00:51:56,576
<i>Don't come beggin' later.</i>

379
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:58,703
<i>- Hey!
- What?</i>

380
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:01,878
<i>No eggs! Give me that.</i>

381
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,847
<i>Wonder who invented noodles.</i>

382
00:52:07,046 --> 00:52:09,547
<i>You said you didn't want any.</i>

383
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:11,152
<i>Changed my mind.</i>

384
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:13,587
<i>ls there any rice?</i>

385
00:52:15,387 --> 00:52:18,630
<i>Hold on.
There's some in the fridge.</i>

386
00:52:19,825 --> 00:52:24,899
<i>Chul-kyu...
I'm coming to you.</i>

387
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:28,711
<i>Don't worry.</i>

388
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:34,148
<i>I trust you.
You were always my compass.</i>

389
00:52:35,874 --> 00:52:40,874
<i>Remember when I said
I can see you</i>

390
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:44,188
<i>even when you're not with me?</i>

391
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,295
<i>Go wherever you want.</i>

392
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:52,098
<i>I'll find you, soon.</i>

393
00:52:53,992 --> 00:52:57,872
<i>Don't get mad when you see me.</i>

394
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:06,943
<i>Don't ask me why I followed you
or get angry at me.</i>

395
00:53:08,307 --> 00:53:15,350
<i>After everything to come to you,
if you get mad I'll cry.</i>

396
00:53:16,682 --> 00:53:21,722
<i>When we meet again on the other side,
let's not cry again.</i>

397
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:24,891
<i>Wait for me.
I'll be right there.</i>
