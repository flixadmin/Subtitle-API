1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,241
<i>Ever since you began
to build your empire,</i>

2
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:06,361
you've had a crutch to lean on.

3
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:09,401
<i>Mum, I swear
in the name of Almighty God,</i>

4
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:10,897
<i>I will take revenge
on Tommy Shelby.</i>

5
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:14,441
That, my friend, is the finest
opium in the world.

6
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:16,081
Perhaps we can meet
after you've spoken

7
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:17,921
<i>to your wife's uncle,
Jack Nelson.</i>

8
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,321
Tommy Shelby wants to do
business with Jack Nelson?

9
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,801
So speak to your uncle
and get me out of here.

10
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:24,281
If he doesn't want to buy
my opium,

11
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:26,241
I will sell
to the East Boston Jews.

12
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,001
It's Ruby. She's not well.

13
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:29,201
I'm coming home.

14
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,001
<i>There will be a war
in this family,</i>

15
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,921
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

16
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:42,321
<i>You've been too busy</i>

17
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:44,361
<i>to punish the people
who killed her.</i>

18
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,161
<i>How is the family?</i>

19
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:58,641
Daddy!

20
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:04,401
Hello, Ruby.

21
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:06,881
Come here.

22
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,241
Let me see you.

23
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,681
I missed you.

24
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,001
I missed you.

25
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:14,841
There's the Black Madonna.

26
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:16,281
What presents did you get us,
Dad?

27
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:17,601
Son.

28
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:19,641
She's all better, Tommy.

29
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,601
You came back for nothing.

30
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:26,841
But I'm glad you're back.

31
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,801
Right,
before we do anything else,

32
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:33,281
we're going to go for a drive,
OK?

33
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:34,801
- Let's go.
- What about me?

34
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:36,321
Yeah, you can come too,
come on.

35
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:38,201
A drive where?

36
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,841
I've asked the driver
to take us to see Dr Robert.

37
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:42,681
I want him to have
a look at Ruby.

38
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:43,801
Why, love?

39
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,161
The appointment is in one hour.

40
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:46,601
You can stay here
or you can come.

41
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,681
Right.

42
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,401
Right, let's go.

43
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:43,361
Tommy?

44
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:44,921
Yeah?

45
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,681
It was all good.
Everything was clear.

46
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,281
That is a relief.

47
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:54,201
That's a relief.

48
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:55,321
Yeah.

49
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:57,121
Driver's bringing the car
round.

50
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,401
Daddy.

51
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:01,641
Hiya.

52
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,041
Come here.

53
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,081
When did you last sleep?

54
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,401
Not much since we last spoke
on the phone.

55
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:22,441
Well, now you know Ruby's
all clear, you can sleep.

56
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:23,801
Yeah.

57
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:29,561
Lizzie, I am very happy
that Ruby's results are clear.

58
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,321
But still you won't sleep.

59
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:36,041
I will speak to Johnny
and I will speak to Esmeralda.

60
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,481
We could be on holiday.

61
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:46,961
We could be up a mountain
in America.

62
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,441
That wouldn't have been
possible.

63
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,921
The man I'm dealing with
is coming to London.

64
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,201
I need to be there.

65
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,161
No escape.

66
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,761
We will escape, Lizzie.

67
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:01,681
One last deal to be done.

68
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:03,241
It'll be difficult.

69
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:04,761
Difficulties are to be
expected.

70
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:08,081
This is why I must move
from item to item.

71
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:14,441
Do you feel that?

72
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,921
Do you feel anything?

73
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,401
You know, you talk as if
you're watching everything

74
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:21,681
on a screen.

75
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,601
When we go home...
When we go home,

76
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:29,121
we'll give the kids to Frances,

77
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:31,281
and then you and me
will go to bed.

78
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,721
And I will be the next item.

79
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,761
That's how it feels now, Tommy.

80
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,921
Yeah.

81
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,561
Everything on a list.

82
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,881
- Hey, baby.
- When are we going home?

83
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,201
Soon.

84
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,761
Tommy? Tommy!

85
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:25,521
Tommy? Tommy,
tell me what's happening!

86
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,681
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

87
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:31,121
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

88
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,721
Tommy, come here. Come here.

89
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:35,801
What's happening?

90
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,041
<i>Tommy!</i>

91
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,601
It is four years...

92
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:07,481
...one month and six days
since I had a drink.

93
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,801
My head is clear.

94
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:13,881
I am myself.

95
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:18,161
Is this the first time?

96
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:22,601
Once on the ship back.
Not as bad.

97
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:26,361
Tommy...

98
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,841
...you need to see a doctor.

99
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,201
I've work to do.

100
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:37,561
It's the work that's to blame.

101
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:40,361
The people you meet,
the lies that you tell.

102
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:45,641
We're going to keep going until
the Boston business is done.

103
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:48,201
Then we rest.

104
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,121
Then we Peaky Blinders
fucking rest.

105
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:59,841
<i>Comrades, before we end
this planning meeting</i>

106
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,321
and send you out
into the rain...

107
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:04,041
...we have a surprise.

108
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:08,201
He just arrived back from
a trade mission to America.

109
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:10,881
He came back early
and he has insisted

110
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:13,201
on addressing you volunteers
in person.

111
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:15,001
Comrades,

112
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:17,521
your Labour representative
for South Birmingham,

113
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:20,961
Mr Thomas Shelby MP, OBE.

114
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:38,441
Silence, please!

115
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:46,561
I bring with me...

116
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,521
...on the train from London...

117
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,201
...a message from Westminster.

118
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,281
No. No, no, no, not a message.

119
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:58,921
Not a message.

120
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:02,521
An instruction, in fact.

121
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,921
You must be silent.

122
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:13,361
You must say nothing.

123
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,041
Say nothing

124
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,401
about the present situation
in this city.

125
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:21,921
Say nothing about hunger.

126
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,001
Say nothing about jobs.

127
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,521
Say nothing about pay.

128
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,401
But those in greener pastures,

129
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:32,321
they may speak.

130
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:35,521
They may raise their voices.

131
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,641
But here in the smoke,
you men and women,

132
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,801
Irish and Italian

133
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:43,641
and English, who support
the socialist cause...

134
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:46,321
And your socialist cats
and dogs and canaries.

135
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,521
...you must hush,

136
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:54,321
because the King
and all the King's horses

137
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,321
and all the King's men...

138
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:57,761
...want you to be silent.

139
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:02,001
But it is you, my friends,
who must suffer

140
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:06,161
the cuts in wages
and in welfare and in dignity!

141
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:07,641
And you must not complain,

142
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:10,321
because that would be
unpatriotic.

143
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:13,281
You soldiers
who have fought in France,

144
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,641
you are traitors
if you speak up.

145
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:17,721
You veterans of their wars

146
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:20,121
and their booms
and their busts,

147
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:22,441
it is you
who must take the blows,

148
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,161
and carry the burdens
for the sake of

149
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:28,081
those in greener pastures
who bellow at you...

150
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,441
..."Silence!"

151
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:34,841
Well, watch this, comrades.

152
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:36,841
I will not be silent.

153
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,041
Never!

154
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,481
Not this Englishman.

155
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,241
No silence from me.

156
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:50,961
No silence from me,

157
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,041
because I have heard
your voices

158
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:54,641
when you come to me

159
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,081
and tell me about the cries
of your hungry children,

160
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:02,041
and I will gather up
every single one of those cries

161
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,441
and I will take 'em with me
on the train

162
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,041
back to Westminster...

163
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,057
...and I will let them
out of the bag

164
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:10,441
in the House of Commons,

165
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,721
and let them
try to silence that, eh?

166
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:32,481
Shouldn't that involve
some sharing of the burden?

167
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,241
All of us taking a smaller
slice of the cake, eh?

168
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:40,081
After all, it's bloody us
who bakes the cake

169
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:42,601
and makes the cars
and melts the metal.

170
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:46,721
And the King, remember him?

171
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:49,441
The man who ordered
all of this.

172
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:51,601
Shouldn't he be taking
some of the cuts?

173
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:54,441
Eh? Some of the blows?

174
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:57,561
Some of the pain? No or yes?

175
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,161
Yes!

176
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,521
Sh.

177
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,881
Hush, you working men
and women.

178
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:15,481
Silence.

179
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,681
Good.

180
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:21,721
Save your voices.

181
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,281
You're going to need 'em

182
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:26,681
on Saturday
when we rally together

183
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,761
at the Bull Ring Market...

184
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,361
...and together,

185
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,521
we'll raise the roof,

186
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:34,721
we'll break
the damned silence...

187
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:39,801
...and bring down
this broken government.

188
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,761
Tommy! Tommy!
Tommy! Tommy!

189
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,081
Thank you.

190
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,241
Laura McKee.

191
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,361
Battalion Commander,
Fermanagh IRA.

192
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:07,321
You missed the first
and second act.

193
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,001
Thank you for coming,
Mr Shelby.

194
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,281
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:11,721
The third act was enough.

196
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:16,841
You both have reasons
to hate me

197
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,841
and to want to seek revenge
for the killing...

198
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:20,441
Sh!

199
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,801
Gypsy tradition.

200
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:29,641
We do not mention the name
of the dead in company.

201
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,361
Laura McKee,

202
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,961
in the Shelby family,

203
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:41,441
business comes
before issues of vengeance.

204
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:45,361
Our beloved departed
would understand and approve.

205
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:48,001
Let's go, boys.

206
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:50,241
Our agreement was we meet
in a crowded place.

207
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,601
No need for crowds.

208
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,641
We need you alive.

209
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:57,761
After you.

210
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:22,961
You know, Mr Shelby,

211
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,561
even though we've been doing
business for a while,

212
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,241
we've never met in person.

213
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:30,361
You spoke with passion...

214
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:32,641
...and compassion.

215
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:37,161
You understand forgiveness

216
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:39,361
and you drink water.

217
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,001
Yet I heard
from many reliable sources

218
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:48,281
that you have a reputation
for moral turpitude.

219
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:53,001
Moral turpitude...

220
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:56,641
It's a good name
for a racehorse.

221
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,881
You don't know what it means?

222
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,201
I know what it means.

223
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:02,361
It means you fuck people.

224
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,321
Fuck people over.
Don't give a fuck.

225
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:07,921
It means you covet and steal

226
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,041
and burn all principles
for the sake of self-interest.

227
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,161
Well, I'm changing,
Laura McKee,

228
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:18,361
and my organisation
is also changing.

229
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,961
So, what happened in Boston?

230
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:28,241
Jack Nelson said no.

231
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:31,201
Are we accepting no
as an answer?

232
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:35,481
These are letters...

233
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:37,761
...written to and by
Jack Nelson

234
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:39,441
over the last three months.

235
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,721
This...

236
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:55,961
This is a private letter

237
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:58,241
from the President
of the United States.

238
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:01,881
Where the fuck
did you get this?

239
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,121
My racehorse, Moral Turpitude,

240
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:06,761
is just one of many
in my stables.

241
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:10,281
Sometimes, even now,
I'll take her out for a run

242
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:13,961
if there is a good cause
that requires her services.

243
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:20,441
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

244
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:24,681
Officially, he's coming
to buy liquor import licences.

245
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:27,561
Unofficially, he's on
a fact-finding mission.

246
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,041
He's come to measure

247
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:32,481
the strength of support
for fascism in Britain.

248
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,041
He'll report back
to the President.

249
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:38,561
And how does that help us?

250
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,441
In this letter to his son,

251
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:47,961
Jack Nelson expresses
strong support for fascism.

252
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,521
In this letter
to a friend in Berlin,

253
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:55,961
he says some, erm,
interesting things about Jews.

254
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:00,561
He's not coming to Europe
to find facts.

255
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:03,321
He's coming to find proof
that fascism will prevail.

256
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:05,801
And you and I...

257
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:09,241
...are going
to help him in that task.

258
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:16,241
I thought you were a socialist.

259
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:20,041
Well...

260
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,561
...since I've entered politics,

261
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,761
I've learned that
the line doesn't go out

262
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:26,161
from the middle to the left
and the right.

263
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:28,281
It goes in a circle.

264
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,801
I'll show you.

265
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,801
You go far enough left,

266
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:39,161
eventually you'll meet someone
who has gone far enough right

267
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:40,881
to get to the same place.

268
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:45,401
Working-class socialists
like me,

269
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,641
working-class nationalists
like you.

270
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:48,961
The result?

271
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:50,641
National Socialism.

272
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:54,281
And that's me...

273
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,121
...in the middle.

274
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:01,001
Just a man trying to make
an honest living

275
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,441
in a very dark world.

276
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,401
You have friends in Dublin,
Laura McKee,

277
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:13,401
who are actively fighting
for a fascist Ireland,

278
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:16,801
and you are acting
on their behalf, ain't you?

279
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:21,121
When Jack Nelson
comes to London,

280
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:25,081
I can give him access
to Oswald Mosley

281
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,921
and to fascist sympathisers

282
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,681
in the House of Commons
and the House of Lords,

283
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:31,841
on both sides of the divide.

284
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:34,161
Fascism is quite the thing...

285
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:37,921
...among the very best people.

286
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:43,041
And with your help,
I can also offer him Dublin.

287
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,841
And you think this will allow
us to ship our merchandise

288
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,561
to Boston?

289
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:53,361
Perhaps.

290
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:56,321
There may be other benefits
for your cause.

291
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:01,801
All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

292
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,961
and talk to him about
a new golden age,

293
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:07,681
and let him put a pin
in the map of Ireland

294
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,121
for the President
of the United States.

295
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:22,961
I came to collect Arthur
and put him to bed.

296
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:27,041
I found him in Garrison Lane
with a syringe in his hand.

297
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,721
A friend loves at all time.

298
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,881
A brother is born
for adversity.

299
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,281
Proverbs 17:17.

300
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,081
I have two brothers in need,

301
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,881
but yours is the more urgent,
Tommy.

302
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,641
Will you come with me?

303
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,601
So, Laura McKee...

304
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,001
...are you going to help me
change the world?

305
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:03,201
Mr Shelby, this meeting
is not what I expected.

306
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:04,561
Never is.

307
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:06,681
Is that a yes or a no?

308
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:11,441
My answer's yes.

309
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:14,441
The answer's always yes.

310
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,681
The back door is unlocked.
You can let yourself out.

311
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,881
And tell your friends
back home -

312
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:24,761
Tommy Shelby has changed.

313
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:32,721
Where is he?

314
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,601
When I found him,
the syringe was empty.

315
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:36,561
He's sleeping it off
on the cobbles.

316
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:39,041
Shit, Tommy. Shit.

317
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:40,481
It's all under control, Ada.

318
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,881
Well, <i>I'm</i> not under
fucking control!

319
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:47,201
I'm not you, Tommy,
and I'm not Polly either.

320
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:49,161
Even though I'm trying to be.

321
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:50,521
She would have stopped this.

322
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:52,281
We will pull Arthur
through this.

323
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,761
I'm not talking about Arthur,
I'm talking about you!

324
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:57,681
I heard everything
you were saying in there.

325
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:00,321
Ada, this will be the end
of it, do you hear me?

326
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:01,881
This is the way out
for all of us,

327
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,561
and along the way,
I will be doing good.

328
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:04,641
No, along the way,

329
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:06,457
you're going to make yourself
a lot of fucking money.

330
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,001
All right, fair enough.

331
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:11,121
Any incidental rewards for
my good work will be welcome.

332
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:12,737
But you will get
your fair share, sister.

333
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:14,857
And by being
among the fascists,

334
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,361
by being among 'em,
I can undermine them.

335
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,841
Polly would approve.

336
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,721
Beneath all the gold
and diamonds

337
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,961
and fucking... fucking mink
and lace,

338
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:26,841
she was a solid socialist.

339
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,721
Look, I know it's too late
for this, Tom, but...

340
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,561
This doorway.

341
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:40,441
This same fucking doorway.

342
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,601
We used to come here
for Dad's beer.

343
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:48,161
And we were so little, it took
two of us carry one bucket.

344
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,241
Yeah, I remember.

345
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:58,001
Look at us now, eh?

346
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:01,121
Yeah. Fucking look at us.

347
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:02,721
Take a good look, Tom,

348
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,601
cos one of us isn't going
to be here for long.

349
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:08,481
Fuck! Opium and presidents!

350
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:19,321
Ada, if you don't want
to help me carry the bucket...

351
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,321
...then I wouldn't blame you.

352
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:27,801
But this is my mission.

353
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:30,401
And I will have no limitations.

354
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,561
Where are you, Tom?

355
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,201
Hmm?

356
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:39,841
My big brother?

357
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,761
You know, you used to stop
sometimes and laugh.

358
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:48,441
Do you even remember
this place?

359
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,081
You walk into The Garrison
like a stranger

360
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:54,201
and you sip fucking water.

361
00:21:58,641 --> 00:21:59,961
But I'm alive, Ada.

362
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:04,481
Yeah.

363
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:07,601
And you're still looking for
trouble big enough to kill you.

364
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,281
Well...

365
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,361
...I think
you might have found it.

366
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,881
I have children, Tommy.

367
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,721
You have to carry
this bucket on your own.

368
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:30,401
One brother half-dead in
the rain in Garrison alley,

369
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,801
and the other
has no limitations.

370
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:07,121
I'm expected.

371
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:29,281
Oh, and Mr Solomons
no longer tolerates

372
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:31,721
the smoking of tobacco
in his presence.

373
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:18,161
I always thought that opera

374
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:20,681
was just fat people
fucking shouting.

375
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:23,401
Yeah? What do you think now?

376
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:29,841
I think the sound of a tenor
in full passion

377
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:33,361
reminds me of the crying out
of Italian soldiers

378
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:35,441
when they had my bayonet
inside them.

379
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:38,761
Ever since my own death,

380
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:42,121
I have been somewhat
haunted by it.

381
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,001
Dear me.

382
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,681
But instead of fighting
these voices,

383
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:51,841
I decided to write
their songs down,

384
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:54,121
you know, and turn them
into an opera of my own.

385
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,441
Do not light that.

386
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:59,401
No. No. Were you not told?
I have a condition.

387
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:01,841
What I was told, Alfie...

388
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:08,641
...is that you have withdrawn

389
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:11,241
and that you spend your days
alone...

390
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,481
...obsessing
about opera singers.

391
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:18,361
Opera's not fucking singing,
is it?

392
00:25:20,441 --> 00:25:21,801
It's not singing.

393
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:23,801
It is the sound
that people make...

394
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:26,561
...before words.

395
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:28,561
And I do not allow smoking

396
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:31,481
because I do need to see
fucking clearly,

397
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:32,801
all right?

398
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:42,081
What, do you sense weakness
in the Israelite?

399
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:43,881
Not a sense of weakness,
no, Alfie.

400
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,361
- Huh?
- A certain knowledge of it.

401
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:51,401
Since you've been sat here,
writing your opera...

402
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:57,481
...a member of your family
has died.

403
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:01,201
Charles Solomons. Your uncle.

404
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:03,761
He ran all the narcotics,
bootlegging,

405
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:05,561
prostitution,
gambling syndicates

406
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,081
out of East Boston.

407
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:10,521
But last January,
poor old Charlie, well...

408
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:14,881
...he was shot
in the Cotton Club,

409
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,321
in the lavatory,

410
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,961
by men that you know,

411
00:26:19,081 --> 00:26:20,641
and yet you did nothing, Alfie.

412
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:30,121
Now, my opera is called
<i>America.</i>

413
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:33,521
<i>America</i> is my fucking
masterpiece!

414
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:37,521
The truth is,
your uncle is dead...

415
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:39,961
...Boston is gone...

416
00:26:41,321 --> 00:26:42,561
...and you,

417
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:45,281
once the big man
who ran Camden Town...

418
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:51,641
...now can't even extinguish
another man's cigarette...

419
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,801
...let alone his fucking life.

420
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:57,401
You need favours,

421
00:26:57,521 --> 00:26:59,121
- Alfie.
- I need

422
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:00,961
a fucking final act, right?

423
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:04,801
Just a final fucking act
for my opera.

424
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:06,161
Yeah?

425
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:09,001
Alfie...

426
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,441
I think I may have
written your final act.

427
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:18,121
Why don't you sit down
and have a listen, eh?

428
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:47,761
I have five tons of pure,
refined opium

429
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:51,041
sitting in one of my warehouses
in Liverpool.

430
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:56,401
I have safe storage
off the coast of Canada.

431
00:27:56,521 --> 00:28:02,081
I have men willing
to distribute it in Toronto,

432
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:05,041
Quebec, New York and Boston.

433
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,921
The income would be immediate

434
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:10,281
and would shift the balance
of power in Boston

435
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:12,841
back in the favour
of the Solomons family.

436
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:24,001
In the final act
that I am giving you, Alfie,

437
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,681
it is you
who takes the revenge.

438
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:30,601
Why would you sell?

439
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:34,041
The Irish are being difficult.

440
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:35,481
The Italians are not an option.

441
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:38,521
Also, Alfie, you are my friend.

442
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:40,161
Pay you with credit?

443
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:42,281
- No.
- Oh...

444
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:43,841
I will take property.

445
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:46,921
You own half the warehouses
in Camden.

446
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,201
I'll take 'em
and knock 'em down,

447
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:52,161
build houses for the needy
and the deserving.

448
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:53,601
Oh.

449
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:01,601
Yeah, well, the, erm...

450
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:04,601
The Irish have always been
difficult, Tommy, ain't they?

451
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:07,321
For about fucking 700 years.

452
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:11,921
You know that I once saw
an Irishman

453
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,601
arguing with the statue
of Oliver Cromwell

454
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,161
in Parliament Square.

455
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:19,201
The argument went on
for quite a while, actually.

456
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:20,321
It went into the night,

457
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:22,401
as his little voice echoed
all around

458
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:24,001
the Houses of Parliament

459
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:26,561
as he got more and more angered

460
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,201
Oliver Cromwell
was reluctant somewhat

461
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:31,881
to answer
his legitimate questions,

462
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:35,881
so angered, in fact,
that eventually he punched

463
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,201
the statue on the nose

464
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:41,681
and broke his fucking hand.

465
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:46,201
And there it is, you know,
the Irish question, innit?

466
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:50,161
How come
you can remember so much

467
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:52,561
about what happened
200 years ago,

468
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:54,081
but you just can't remember

469
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,001
what fucking happened
last night?

470
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,121
How much is a ton?

471
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:08,041
Johnny.

472
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:13,001
Only me today.

473
00:30:15,961 --> 00:30:18,441
Jack says a few more weeks...

474
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:23,481
...then you'll be free.

475
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:25,401
When do you travel to London?

476
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,201
Tomorrow.

477
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:36,761
I came to say goodbye.

478
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:53,761
When you go to London,
stay away from the devil.

479
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:56,361
Block your fucking ears,
if you have to.

480
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,161
I'll be with you, Michael.

481
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:02,401
I've been thinking about you.

482
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:07,761
Only you.

483
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:14,481
And don't worry
about Tommy Shelby.

484
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:19,641
I have no interest
in a dead man.

485
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:25,361
Jack says he has to die.

486
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:27,081
Well, you tell Jack to wait.

487
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:29,961
If anyone's going to kill
Tommy Shelby...

488
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:31,401
It will be you.

489
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:33,521
I know.

490
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:35,561
I told Jack.

491
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:39,281
And Jack said, "OK.

492
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:41,361
"Let the kid do it."

493
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:47,281
And in return, he can collect
the cash that Tommy won't.

494
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:52,641
$5 million.

495
00:31:53,721 --> 00:31:56,161
The devil will be dead.

496
00:31:57,801 --> 00:31:59,441
The future belongs to us.

497
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:03,361
Oh, and, uh, Michael...

498
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:07,601
Every night...

499
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,561
..midnight in Boston,
5am in London...

500
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:16,841
...I'll be wide awake
in my big, wide bed,

501
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:19,881
and you'll be wide awake
in this prison cell.

502
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:24,481
And our souls
will come together...

503
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:26,121
...and we'll fuck.

504
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:29,961
I won't need an alarm clock.

505
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:34,321
And you won't sleep
until I'm done.

506
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:37,161
Midnight fucks 5am.

507
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:44,161
Every day.

508
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,921
Because we trust each other.

509
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:51,641
Hmm?

510
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:30,881
You're a fucking traitor,
Shelby! You're a fucking...

511
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:47,281
Darker.

512
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:49,921
Bluer.

513
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:52,761
Sharper.

514
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:55,241
I want to see it from below.

515
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,601
Darling, how's that?

516
00:33:58,721 --> 00:34:02,681
You look absolutely terrifying,
my love.

517
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,241
Fuck lipstick.

518
00:34:17,761 --> 00:34:19,321
Fun.

519
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:24,601
To launch the ship.

520
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:36,321
A long and terrible journey,
Diana.

521
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:40,761
Don't fucking let me down.

522
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:48,761
Mr Shelby!

523
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:49,881
Mr Shelby!

524
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,361
<i>Daily Mirror.</i>

525
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:52,801
- Mr Shelby!
- Off!

526
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:54,441
May I ask why a socialist MP

527
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:56,721
would attend a fascist rally,
sir?

528
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:59,281
Let him in,
let me answer the question.

529
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,841
Mr Mosley's constituency
borders my own.

530
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:03,841
We have worked together
in the past.

531
00:35:03,961 --> 00:35:05,521
He was once a socialist
himself.

532
00:35:05,641 --> 00:35:07,321
My role here tonight

533
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:10,081
is to... to act as a bridge

534
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:11,961
between ideologies.

535
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:13,241
I'm in the middle.

536
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:17,561
Mr Shelby, you once shared
a platform with Mr Mosley.

537
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:20,081
Will you be sharing the stage
with him tonight?

538
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,321
No. I am simply here
to remind my friend, Mr Mosley,

539
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:25,361
that the way of the British
people is compromise.

540
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:28,201
And you can print that, pal.

541
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:31,001
Fucking rag.

542
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:40,121
Lizzie, you should know

543
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:42,601
that Mosley's wife died
six months ago.

544
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:45,201
So give him your condolences,
will you?

545
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:48,121
Tonight,
he will be with his mistress,

546
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:51,041
who is apparently
a lady of some standing...

547
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:55,761
...and has given him great
comfort in his time of grief.

548
00:35:56,961 --> 00:36:00,161
Fuck off, you dozy bastard!

549
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:02,281
Move out my fucking way.

550
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:04,081
What is Arthur doing here?

551
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:06,281
Mosley invited him. I agreed.

552
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:08,121
Arthur made me a promise,

553
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:10,561
which he appears
to have broken.

554
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:14,841
Move! I said fucking move.

555
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:20,161
I tried my best.
He's hid some junk in his sock.

556
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:22,081
- OK.
- Move along.

557
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:24,761
Oi!

558
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:26,321
- Oi, Tommy!
- Come on!

559
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:28,481
- Tommy!
- You're in! You're in.

560
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,201
- Come on, you're in.
- My brother.

561
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,481
- Tommy!
- Yeah.

562
00:36:31,601 --> 00:36:33,161
Johnny Dogs.

563
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:34,681
Mosley invited me.

564
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:37,041
He said,
"Wear a black fucking shirt."

565
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,201
Here you are.

566
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,401
I said, "I'd look like
every other bastard."

567
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:41,721
Lizzie!

568
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:43,161
- Come on.
- For fuck's sake.

569
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:46,761
You're an angel. I know
I've fucking let you down.

570
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:48,961
I've fucking let you down,
I know I have. All right?

571
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,361
I've fucking said sorry
a million times

572
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:53,097
and I'll say it again.
I'm sorry, all right?

573
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:54,881
- Yeah.
- I'm fucking sorry.

574
00:36:55,001 --> 00:36:56,201
Look at Johnny Dogs.

575
00:36:56,321 --> 00:36:58,481
Fucking look
at the state of him.

576
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:00,881
He looks like a fucking waiter.

577
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:03,241
- Oh, shut up.
- Get me a fucking drink.

578
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:05,881
Johnny, take your shirt off
and give it to me.

579
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:07,321
For fuck's sake, Tommy.

580
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:09,681
Take your fucking shirt off
and give it me now.

581
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:11,081
Get it off!

582
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:13,761
Arthur, this is my fault.

583
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:16,561
- This is my fault.
- Yeah.

584
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:20,121
Remember, we voted on getting
involved in the opium trade?

585
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:22,001
- You voted no.
- I said no.

586
00:37:22,121 --> 00:37:24,121
Remember? I overruled you.

587
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,481
I've not been here,
I've been away.

588
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:27,601
Where you been, Tom?

589
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:29,337
And Ada tells me you've been
hanging out with Mosley.

590
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:30,761
- Yeah, he's...
- Yeah?

591
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,121
In his big, beautiful
fucking house.

592
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:35,401
And they have parties there,
in Belgravia.

593
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:38,041
And they give me
fucking respect.

594
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:39,441
Yeah?
And what do you give them?

595
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:40,801
Snow and junk from the company.

596
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:41,921
Hang on.

597
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,201
Look at you, brother.

598
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:45,761
Half of you's gone.
Half of you's gone.

599
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:49,401
- What the fuck?
- Rag and bone.

600
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:53,161
You fucking slapped me.

601
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,681
You slapped me.

602
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:59,881
I have to remain unresolved.
Do you understand?

603
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:03,161
Unresolved.
Unresolved in everything.

604
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,641
I have to move between left
and right, light and shade,

605
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:07,681
and maintain the trust of both.

606
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:10,361
And I cannot have my brother
wearing a fucking black shirt

607
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:12,081
on the cover
of the <i>Daily Mirror.</i>

608
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:14,081
If anyone takes my picture
in this,

609
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:17,321
they'll find their fucking
camera under my heel, Tom.

610
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:19,321
They are throwing petrol bombs
out there, Tommy.

611
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,241
I thought Ada was
taking care of you.

612
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:23,921
Ada's got decisions to make
about working with us.

613
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,961
She doesn't know
what she wants.

614
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:27,801
I'll speak to Ada.

615
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:29,721
Listen, I'm going home,
all right?

616
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,161
No, you stay there.

617
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:33,081
I have something for you.

618
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:34,521
Lizzie, you can go in
with Johnny.

619
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:36,041
Johnny, take Lizzie
to her seat.

620
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:37,721
But I don't have an invitation,
Tom.

621
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,457
Johnny, you're wearing
a fucking black shirt,

622
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:41,801
you can do what you like.
Go on. I'll follow you. Go on.

623
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:45,401
Go on, Dogs.

624
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,841
And get me a fucking drink
while you're there.

625
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:54,241
I know, Tom. Look at me.

626
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:57,761
Arthur, before I went
to America,

627
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,281
I wrote a letter.

628
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:00,921
Yeah? Who to?

629
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,521
To Linda.

630
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:07,281
And in that letter, I wrote,

631
00:39:07,401 --> 00:39:11,041
"Linda, as a Christian woman,

632
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:13,241
"do you believe
in forgiveness?"

633
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:18,241
And this is what I got back.

634
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:20,481
Two days ago. Have a look.

635
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,001
"As a Christian woman,

636
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,841
"I do believe in forgiveness."

637
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:37,521
Yeah, and the word <i>do</i>
is underlined.

638
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:42,841
Arthur, I'm no Christian.

639
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,161
But I also believe
in forgiveness.

640
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:50,401
So, get yourself clean,

641
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,961
stay clean for two weeks,

642
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:54,121
I'll write Linda
another letter.

643
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,161
Cos I know where she is.

644
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,521
First, I need you back.

645
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:07,281
I need my brother.

646
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:10,441
I have a lot to do.

647
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:12,721
Need someone
to do the real work.

648
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:14,441
Yeah.

649
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:16,441
Yeah. Look at your smile, Tom.

650
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:18,441
Look at your smile, brother.

651
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:19,721
It's been so long.

652
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:22,761
Come on. Let's see what this
bastard has to say. Come on.

653
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,481
- All right. All right.
- Come on.

654
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:26,921
Yeah, I'm coming.

655
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,321
He is a bastard an' all, Tommy.

656
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:33,041
Black shirts and Jews.
Here we go. Here we fucking go.

657
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:37,681
Stay in the middle
and do nothing, Tommy.

658
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:39,681
But not fucking me.

659
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:42,361
Come here, you,
you Nazi bastard!

660
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:00,841
Come here, man,
I'll take your fucking eye.

661
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,441
Not here! <i>Not</i> here!

662
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:08,601
Come here. You've had your fun,
now let's go home.

663
00:41:08,721 --> 00:41:10,921
We have business.

664
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:15,721
Johnny, you get him home.

665
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:18,241
This time,
check his fucking socks.

666
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:25,121
For fuck's sake!

667
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:32,881
Tommy, we should get out now.

668
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:35,961
Forget this American business.
We've got enough.

669
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:38,401
Not near enough.
Here she comes.

670
00:41:38,521 --> 00:41:40,481
Remember to smile. Come on.

671
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:41,921
Shit.

672
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:53,521
Ladies and gentlemen,

673
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:56,441
tonight, he has truly earned
your adulation.

674
00:41:56,561 --> 00:42:00,001
The future Prime Minister
of this great country,

675
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,401
Sir Oswald Mosley!

676
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,521
Fuck you, Mosley!

677
00:42:38,441 --> 00:42:40,161
Fuck. I look terrible.

678
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:43,041
You look beautiful, Lizzie.
I need to impress this woman,

679
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,481
so I will act
as if she is beautiful as well.

680
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:47,241
Mosley.

681
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:51,241
Diana,

682
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:55,961
this is Tommy Shelby MP, OBE.

683
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:58,121
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

684
00:42:58,241 --> 00:43:01,041
Oswald's most recent
and last-ever mistress.

685
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,281
This is my wife, Lizzie Shelby.

686
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:04,441
Beautiful earrings.

687
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:06,081
Oh, I stole them
from Tiffany's.

688
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:08,641
Actually, he bought
the earrings in Paris.

689
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:10,481
We were in Paris
on our honeymoon.

690
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:12,041
- God, I hate Paris.
- Hmm.

691
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:13,321
I hear you prefer Berlin.

692
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:16,161
Oswald and I are going to marry
there, aren't we, Oswald?

693
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:17,441
Hmm.

694
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,241
Mosley, I have business
to discuss.

695
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:23,801
Perhaps you and I could find
somewhere a bit quieter, eh?

696
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:27,681
Darling, Mr Shelby just made
the astonishing suggestion

697
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:30,001
that we men go off
and discuss business

698
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:32,361
while you women wait around
looking glamorous.

699
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:34,241
Goodness.

700
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,481
What year do you think this is,
Mr Shelby? 1807?

701
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:41,401
In Birmingham, the centuries
grind by quite slowly.

702
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:43,681
But, Mr Shelby,
if it's business,

703
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:46,161
Diana is the engine
of my enterprise.

704
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:48,201
It's the modern way, Mr Shelby.

705
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:51,401
Yes, we know.
I am company director.

706
00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:52,921
I will join the meeting
as well.

707
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,281
But of course, you <i>must</i> come
as well, Elizabeth.

708
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:57,441
By the way,
I really don't like "Lizzie".

709
00:43:57,561 --> 00:43:59,721
I prefer liberated "Elizabeth".

710
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:01,401
She must be part of this.

711
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:03,001
She's been
all the way to Paris,

712
00:44:03,121 --> 00:44:04,761
so she is a woman of the world.
Bravo.

713
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:08,121
Do you know, Oswald has told me
everything about you...

714
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:21,761
Only three...

715
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:25,681
...because I know
these days Mr Shelby doesn't.

716
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:27,561
Our friend in Berlin
doesn't either.

717
00:44:27,681 --> 00:44:29,401
Well, they have <i>that</i> in common,
at least.

718
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:31,841
Oh, I imagine
they have lots in common.

719
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,121
Hmm.

720
00:44:34,761 --> 00:44:36,321
Report to me, Shelby.

721
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,561
Officially,
Jack Nelson is in London

722
00:44:39,681 --> 00:44:41,121
to buy import licences.

723
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:47,121
And unofficially,
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

724
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:50,361
Well, as you can see
from this private letter...

725
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:54,601
...he is far
from a neutral point of view.

726
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:00,321
Look at the bottom
of the second paragraph.

727
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:04,161
"Individually Jews are fine,
but as a race they stink."

728
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:05,721
Hmm.

729
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:09,481
Elizabeth, do you even know
why the bridge

730
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:11,961
to President Roosevelt
is so important?

731
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:16,561
Actually, no.

732
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,841
I don't really know much
about this business at all.

733
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:26,721
But I have fucked
your future husband,

734
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:29,121
so I know lots of things
about him.

735
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:33,201
Tommy, I'll be outside.

736
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:36,521
Well done, Elizabeth.

737
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:42,481
Do you people want
to meet Nelson or no?

738
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:47,521
Mr Shelby, from now on,
can I call you Thomas?

739
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:49,081
If you like.

740
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,561
Of course we would.

741
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,401
And we are very grateful
for your efforts.

742
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:55,321
But, Mr Shelby,

743
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:58,201
before this <i>enterprise</i>
goes any further,

744
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:01,281
you really must do
something about your wife.

745
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:30,241
Mr Shelby.

746
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:31,641
Yes.

747
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:34,041
Mr Nelson.

748
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,521
I came early.

749
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:38,121
I wanted to come
and take a look

750
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:40,281
around this beautiful church.

751
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:44,001
You're Catholic, Mr Shelby.

752
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:47,721
I hoped that by suggesting
we meet in church,

753
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:51,081
it might make us both
more... cautious

754
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:52,961
with lies and truth.

755
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:55,401
Well, your hope
would be forlorn.

756
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:59,121
There ain't no-one listening
here.

757
00:46:59,241 --> 00:47:00,921
You don't believe in God?

758
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:02,201
No.

759
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:07,641
It was the way Catholics
were treated in my country

760
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:09,561
that made me angry.

761
00:47:10,881 --> 00:47:12,521
Made me what I became.

762
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,281
What made you angry?

763
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:24,121
Slowness... in anything.

764
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:28,801
I wanted to have everything
already.

765
00:47:31,561 --> 00:47:34,841
Two working-class
Catholic boys.

766
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,041
Did they mess with you
when you were small?

767
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,241
Some man in the shadows.

768
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:47,121
I carried a screwdriver
and a blade,

769
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:50,841
and everyone believed
I had the power to lay curses.

770
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:52,521
And do you?

771
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:54,441
Yes, I do.

772
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:59,601
First man I killed
was a priest.

773
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:02,761
You?

774
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:05,921
A Prussian boy with green eyes.

775
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,001
He was already underground.

776
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:10,681
When did you last kill a man,
Mr Shelby?

777
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:16,641
Four years ago.

778
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:20,961
His name was Thomas Shelby.

779
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:23,881
He drank whiskey.

780
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:30,641
You want me to allow you
to enter my city

781
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:33,321
and deal narcotics
that'll kill people?

782
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,041
You deal in whiskey, Mr Nelson.

783
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:44,561
I recently read a report
by the Vatican, actually,

784
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:47,241
which said that whiskey
disproportionately kills

785
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:50,041
more of our Catholic brothers
and sisters,

786
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:53,401
whereas opium is the sedative

787
00:48:53,521 --> 00:48:57,401
more often chosen
by Protestants and atheists.

788
00:49:00,081 --> 00:49:02,241
In return,
there are people in England

789
00:49:02,361 --> 00:49:03,561
who you think I should meet?

790
00:49:03,681 --> 00:49:05,161
Yes.

791
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:06,601
Yes, like minds.

792
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:13,561
I'm here to buy import licences
for booze.

793
00:49:14,841 --> 00:49:17,001
The booze
of the blue blood elite.

794
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:23,201
In America, we... we like
labels and aspiration.

795
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:27,681
Well, I have a brand of my own
vodka and gin.

796
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:29,761
You can add that
to your portfolio.

797
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:34,161
I hear Shelby labels are
favoured by the working class.

798
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:37,201
Indeed.
A fact of which I'm very proud.

799
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:40,681
They say you are a poet, too.

800
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:43,761
No, I only read it.

801
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:49,001
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

802
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:53,721
Fascists.

803
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:56,401
Not the ones in boots
and black shirts.

804
00:49:56,521 --> 00:49:58,481
The ones in tuxedos.

805
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:02,001
I know men who are friends
of the cause.

806
00:50:02,121 --> 00:50:05,681
I also know men who are enemies
of the cause.

807
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:07,721
For many years now,

808
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:09,817
I have been working closely
with Winston Churchill,

809
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,601
in many different capacities.

810
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:13,921
I have his trust.

811
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:16,321
He's opposed
to the rise of fascism.

812
00:50:16,441 --> 00:50:19,561
You, I believe,
see it as inevitable.

813
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,241
Well, I can give you
men of influence

814
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:25,161
who support your cause.

815
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:27,481
I can also offer you
a full report

816
00:50:27,601 --> 00:50:29,841
on Churchill's strategies.

817
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:36,241
All this in return for access
to South Boston?

818
00:50:36,361 --> 00:50:37,881
Alternatively,

819
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:41,081
you can take on Churchill
on your own,

820
00:50:41,201 --> 00:50:42,881
without my intelligence,

821
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,521
and I can sell my opium
to the Jews.

822
00:50:50,321 --> 00:50:52,921
You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.

823
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:57,321
A war hero, I hear.

824
00:50:57,441 --> 00:50:59,681
Every war hero I ever met,

825
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:02,361
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

826
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:09,281
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

827
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:15,961
I'll think a great deal
about what you've said.

828
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:32,921
Ruby, have you finished
your spelling, love?

829
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:48,681
Ruby?

830
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:51,521
Ruby?

831
00:51:56,921 --> 00:51:58,801
Ruby?

832
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:04,161
Ruby?

833
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:07,601
What are you doing, love?

834
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:09,601
I can hear voices...

835
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:12,681
...coming from up the chimney.

836
00:52:16,161 --> 00:52:17,161
What voices?

837
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,721
The grey man.

838
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:24,361
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

839
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:26,441
Mr Thomas Shelby.

840
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:28,561
Birmingham South.

841
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,761
Mr Speaker.
I was raised in a family

842
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:36,681
that endured living conditions
that would test

843
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:39,721
the morality of
even the most virtuous.

844
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:41,001
Indeed...

845
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:44,561
Indeed, even the best of us
would have our virtues trounced

846
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:47,041
and thwarted by life
in the meanness

847
00:52:47,161 --> 00:52:50,121
and the bitterness of
an overcrowded British slum.

848
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:52,841
What would you know
about virtue?

849
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:00,361
Quickly, please.

850
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:06,081
Therefore, Mr Speaker, I intend
to put before this House

851
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:08,841
a bill which will offer
radical reform

852
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:11,681
in housing policy
in this country,

853
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:13,721
in which slums are cleared,

854
00:53:13,841 --> 00:53:15,921
new houses are built

855
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:19,361
with new standards
in health and hygiene.

856
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:26,481
Westminster 245.
House of Commons.

857
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:34,841
The time has come for change,
the people have had enough.

858
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,721
Let's open the windows,
let in new light,

859
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,801
build a new Jerusalem

860
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:42,761
brick by
Government-owned brick.

861
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,201
Into there.

862
00:53:53,921 --> 00:53:55,361
Good.

863
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:01,281
Doctor?

864
00:54:04,361 --> 00:54:06,641
Yeah, Westminster 245.

865
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,801
Mr Shelby.

866
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:34,601
<i>"Tickner maura, o beng,
o beng" over and over again.</i>

867
00:54:34,721 --> 00:54:35,801
<i>How is the family?</i>

868
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:37,441
<i>And one of you will die.</i>

869
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:38,841
<i>He's staring at me, Daddy.</i>

870
00:54:38,961 --> 00:54:40,721
<i>A man with green eyes.</i>

871
00:54:40,841 --> 00:54:43,001
Can you stop the voices?

872
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,281
There are no voices, my love.

873
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:49,841
It's the grey man.

874
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:51,841
He says he's coming for me...

875
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:56,041
...and he's coming
for Daddy as well.

876
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:05,041
Sh...

877
00:56:09,921 --> 00:56:11,561
Mr Shelby?

878
00:56:11,681 --> 00:56:13,561
Is everything all right
in there?

879
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:18,441
Mr Shelby?

880
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:20,001
Everything's fine.

881
00:56:21,281 --> 00:56:22,681
Everything's fine.

882
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:36,761
- Hello?
<i>- Tommy.</i>

883
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:39,761
Tommy, she has a temperature
of 101 and nothing is working.

884
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:41,641
- Just get here now.
<i>- Lizzie?</i>

885
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:43,881
- Please.
- Lizzie?

886
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:08,361
Where is she?

887
00:57:08,481 --> 00:57:10,321
She's with the doctor upstairs.

888
00:57:12,361 --> 00:57:14,281
Listen, Tommy.

889
00:57:14,401 --> 00:57:16,761
He said we shouldn't come close
to her, in case...

890
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:18,521
In case of what?

891
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:20,761
When she coughs, there's blood.

892
00:57:38,841 --> 00:57:40,641
Madonna,

893
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:45,401
put me through to the number
I gave you for Esme Shelby Lee.
