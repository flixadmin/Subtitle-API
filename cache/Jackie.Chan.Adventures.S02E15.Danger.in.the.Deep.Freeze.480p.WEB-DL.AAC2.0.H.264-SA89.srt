1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,204
Jackie: And 3 days ago,

2
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:07,172
Paul connell
notified the museum

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,408
that he had made
a major discovery.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,077
Yeah, well, I made
a major discovery, too.

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,680
You can get frostbite
on your butt.

6
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,715
Mr. connell
described his find as

7
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,518
a prehistoric humanoid
frozen in the ice.

8
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,920
Whoa! A caveman!

9
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,989
That was the last
the museum heard
from him.

10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:27,292
I suspect
- that connell and his
inuit laborers got--

11
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:28,927
eaten?

12
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,496
Frightened.

13
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:32,431
That would explain
why there was nobody

14
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,767
at the research lab
when we arrived there.

15
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,169
This place could
creep anyone out.

16
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,304
We must enter
the cave with--

17
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,773
flashlights!

18
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,275
Respect.

19
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,382
Jade: Whoa.

20
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,483
(Gasps)

21
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,885
Yes, whoa.

22
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,888
We must
bring it back

23
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,723
to the lab
for study.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,908
Look at his expression.

25
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,477
I wonder
what was going
through his mind.

26
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,812
(Gasps)

27
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,146
Look out behind you.

28
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,748
Yes, perhaps.

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,117
No. I mean,
look out behind you.

30
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,653
(All grunting)

31
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,576
(All grunting)

32
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,912
Please, we mean you
no harm.

33
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,481
I am an archeologist.

34
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,985
This creature
is an important
scientific discovery.

35
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,987
I'm only
taking him to our lab

36
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,922
for further study, ok?

37
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,093
(Man grunts)

38
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:44,263
You have disturbed
that which should
not be disturbed.

39
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,198
Jade, get on the sled.

40
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,071
Ahh. Are those boots
elk skin?

41
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,009
Moose.

42
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,845
(Grunts)

43
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,613
Oh.

44
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,884
Sorry.

45
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,895
Jade: Jackie!

46
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,300
Good dogs! Mush!

47
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,203
(Grunts)

48
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,473
Whoa!

49
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,075
Pretty good save, huh?

50
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,610
Yes, but Jade,

51
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,811
could you--

52
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,079
just wait till
tohru and uncle

53
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,280
get a load
of ice guy.

54
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,115
They're gonna freak!

55
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,652
Jade!

56
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,287
What did you say?

57
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,522
Uh-oh.

58
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,791
Aah!

59
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,360
Aah!

60
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,562
Aah!

61
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,765
Bad day, bad day!

62
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,002
Oh...

63
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,413
Save number 2.
I rule.

64
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,783
Yes.
- And from now on,

65
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,352
I drive.

66
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,759
Oh. Jackie, why you turn
temperature down?

67
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,128
You want us
to wind up like him?

68
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,199
It is important to keep
the specimen frozen

69
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,234
for preservation
purposes.

70
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,335
Sorry, old timer.

71
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,137
Guess it's another
cold night for you.

72
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,705
I found something!

73
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,908
It is some sort
of tribal artifact.

74
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,111
There are markings.

75
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,346
That your I.D. Bracelet,
big fella?

76
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,848
Hmm...

77
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,417
Ancient inuit
hieroglyphics.

78
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,452
What does it
mean, uncle? Ow!

79
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,321
It means quiet!

80
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,856
I must study.

81
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,692
(Snoring)

82
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,265
I believe little man
symbol represents day.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,868
Bird represents life.

84
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,102
Huh...

85
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,272
Translation difficult
under these conditions.

86
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,141
(Yawns)
Without sleep.

87
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,076
Without tea!

88
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,679
And this is a tree.

89
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,347
They had those back
in your day, too.

90
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,515
Just not locally.

91
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,450
And these
are snow tires.

92
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,618
(Yawns)

93
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,220
Jade, why are you
still awake?

94
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,323
Because I'm
not sleeping?

95
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,457
(Yawns)

96
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,726
Finish translations
in morning.

97
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,394
Good idea. Jade?

98
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,030
Soon.

99
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,167
Gonna show him some ads
for snowboarding equipment

100
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,309
so what is this,
ice guy?

101
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,611
Your grocery list
or something?

102
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,885
Hmm...

103
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,461
Ok, so here's
what I got.

104
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,863
"When cold turns to heat,

105
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,465
"uh, something will arise.

106
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,933
"When night turns to day,

107
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,102
blah, blah, will run free."

108
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,404
(Sighs)

109
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,673
Ok, I give up.
What's it mean?

110
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,042
(Gasps)

111
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,643
Did you just...

112
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,513
Are you...

113
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,690
(Snoring)

114
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,261
Oh...

115
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,996
Huh?

116
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,204
90 degrees?

117
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,372
Uncle!

118
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,707
Aah! Huh.

119
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,978
Feels like we are
back in San Francisco.

120
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,880
Why did you adjust
the thermostat?

121
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,782
I did no such thing.

122
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,050
Tohru, did you
turn up the heat?

123
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,253
Heat? What heat?

124
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,754
(Gasps)

125
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,289
The specimen!

126
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,328
Ice man has risen!

127
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,297
Bad omen.

128
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,801
Frozen prehistoric
creatures do not
just walk away.

129
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,803
I suspect someone
broke in and--

130
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:18,937
(loud grunt)

131
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,505
Aye-yah!

132
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,673
Jade!

133
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,809
(Gasps)

134
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,644
I do not believe it.

135
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,313
Me neither.

136
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,715
Jade,
you found cereal.

137
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,517
Sorry, all gone.

138
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,553
Guess a couple
of thousand years
in the deep freeze

139
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,121
will give a guy
an appetite.

140
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,222
(Burps)

141
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,224
Jade, what
have you done?

142
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,592
Defrosted him.

143
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,260
Didn't I, Duane?

144
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,695
Duane?

145
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,197
Named him after
a friend's dad.

146
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,965
He's got this real
hairy back, and--

147
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,467
Jade,

148
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,702
this is not a cute,
furry animal.

149
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,637
This prehistoric
pre-humanoid

150
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,607
could be
very dangerous.

151
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,909
Come on, Jackie.

152
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,945
Duane is totally mellow.

153
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,447
(Burps)

154
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,383
Ok, so he could use
come table manners,

155
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,651
but that's
where I come in.

156
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,487
I can teach him
all kinds of stuff.

157
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,255
Wait till
I show you TV, Duane.

158
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,792
Cable toon channel's
gonna blow your mind!

159
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,594
You will not
show him anything.

160
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,295
He does not
belong here.

161
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,363
He should be...

162
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,631
On ice!

163
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,937
(Grunts)

164
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,039
(Screaming)

165
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,983
(Growls)

166
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,952
Nice going,
uncle Jackie.

167
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,821
You hurt
his feelings.

168
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,961
We gotta find Duane.

169
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,096
He's been out
of circulation

170
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,497
for a couple
thousand years.

171
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,699
He could get lost
or hurt.

172
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,568
Or hurt someone else.

173
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,503
There he is!

174
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,551
Strange.

175
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,687
The inuit is using fish
to lure the ice man.

176
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,455
Duane likes fish,
remember?

177
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,257
It's tohru
who hates fish.

178
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,726
But the inuits
seem terrified
of the creature.

179
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,861
Why would they--

180
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,529
(engine roaring)

181
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,766
(Gasps)

182
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,735
Both: Avalanche!

183
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,870
Aah!

184
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,210
Both: Aah!

185
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,447
(Grunts)

186
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,457
(Gasps)

187
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,162
(Whistles)

188
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,132
(Both grunting)

189
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,369
Good dogs! Mush!

190
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,711
(Craaaash)

191
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,312
(Avalanche stops)

192
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,014
Both: Whew!

193
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,485
Ahh...

194
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,088
You really are
man's best friend.

195
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,889
That was...
Kind of cool,

196
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,157
except for,
you know,

197
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,959
the part about
almost getting crushed.

198
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,129
I suspect the avalanche
was no accident.

199
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,632
There was a snowmobile
atop the glacier.

200
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,701
(Gasps)
Someone is coming!

201
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,039
Uncle?

202
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,974
What are you
doing here?

203
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,442
Ice fishing.

204
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,345
Uncle finish
translation.

205
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,980
Tell story
of ice man.

206
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,582
One more thing--

207
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,384
he's not dangerous.

208
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,685
Told you.

209
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,254
Maybe the ice creature
is not dangerous,

210
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,957
but whoever
kidnapped him is.

211
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,226
Come, uncle.
I may need you.

212
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,560
Oh...

213
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,929
Uncle never gets
to do what he wants.

214
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,100
(Indistinct murmuring)

215
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,504
No sign
of our caveman.

216
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,376
Hey, there's the guy who
tried to shishkabob us.

217
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,381
Bet you he's got Duane
locked up in his tent.

218
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,650
I will sneak
around the back.

219
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,318
You 2 wait here.

220
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,656
(Scoffs)

221
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,291
Jackie gets to go
to a nice, warm tent.

222
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,026
Leaves us here
to freeze.

223
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,128
Always thinking
of himself.

224
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,464
Come.

225
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,974
Need to work on
your sneaking around.

226
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,177
Inuits can hear
footsteps in snow

227
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,411
a mile away.

228
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,612
That so?

229
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,147
Uncle, Jade!

230
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,282
I told you to--

231
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,784
we are not armed...

232
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,119
But that
doesn't mean

233
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,620
we won't go polar
on your butt

234
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,155
if you don't
hand over Duane.

235
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,957
Jade, please.

236
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,094
She means
the prehistoric
cave creature.

237
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,629
No such creature here.

238
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,232
Oh, so maybe
your sister
has big feet?

239
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,337
My sister
has tiny feet.

240
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,506
She is delicate
like a bird.

241
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,044
Come inside.

242
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,682
Ancient legend tells
of an evil snow spirit

243
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:34,519
who many moons past
rained ice upon the world.

244
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,488
Would have frozen
the whole planet

245
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,791
if inuit ancestors
had not defeated him.

246
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:43,027
And that's what you
think the creature
we excavated is?

247
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,562
A "snow spirit?"

248
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,730
Mmm...

249
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,799
Must be returned
to the ice cave

250
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,068
before he destroys
the world.

251
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,170
But Duane isn't
an evil spirit.

252
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,606
He's sweet.
He eats cereal.

253
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,007
Child speaks truth.

254
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,408
Ice man not evil.

255
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,743
Not even a spirit.

256
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,812
I am not familiar
with this legend.

257
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,347
Where did you
hear of it?

258
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,115
From the great shaman.

259
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,718
Only last week,
he foretold

260
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,887
the evil spirit's
return.

261
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,755
Bah...Shaman.

262
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,924
You are
superstitious old fool.

263
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,592
Takes one
to know one.

264
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,128
Everything you say
like glue--

265
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,997
sticks back to you.

266
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,932
That does not
even make sense.

267
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,835
Both of you,
please stop fighting.

268
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,470
Bah...

269
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,808
Artifact tells of how
ice man was trapped
and frozen in cave.

270
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,843
Ancient inuits
tried to free him.

271
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,812
Could not,
but foretold the day

272
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:37,282
he would once again
run free across tundra.

273
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,751
There you go.
If he was an evil spirit,

274
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,686
why would they try
to set him free?

275
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,754
Hmm...

276
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,422
You make
a good point.

277
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,425
But the great shaman
says different.

278
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,394
Says it is
an evil spirit,

279
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,129
and must
be destroyed.

280
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,964
Where is
this shaman?

281
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,535
Duane!

282
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,204
He's no shaman.

283
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,872
That is Peter Bailey,

284
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,473
a black marketeer.

285
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:06,010
He steal artifacts
and sells them to
the highest bidder.

286
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,346
But the shaman
has great powers.

287
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,315
He can speak
to other shamans

288
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:13,384
across the sea through
a magical black box.

289
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,153
You mean
like this?

290
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,388
It's called
a cell phone. Hello?

291
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,058
Everybody's got one
back where we come from...

292
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,626
Except for me.

293
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,629
(Ringing)

294
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:28,299
Uncle: Uncle's antique.
Not here. Call back.

295
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,434
Hey!

296
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,003
Stop!

297
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,805
Many moons
have passed.

298
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,574
Must return evil
spirit creature to ice.

299
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,643
You lie.

300
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,778
The ice man
is harmless.

301
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,146
You believe them?

302
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:45,817
These are evil ones
who set evil spirit free.

303
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,820
That's just
some phony baloney
legend you made up.

304
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,222
Maybe you want
to show me the trick

305
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,291
with the cell phone
again.

306
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,262
He's got your number,
Bailey. Face!

307
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,197
You want to talk
numbers, girly?

308
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,532
That hairy missing link's
worth 10 times

309
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,035
more than that junk
I came here for.

310
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,338
He's a living creature,
not some...Beanie.

311
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,673
You can't sell Duane.

312
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,775
Ha! Try
and stop me, mates.

313
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,314
Uncle, watch Jade!

314
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,482
Jade?

315
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,153
Mush!

316
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,793
You fish?

317
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,128
What do you think?

318
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,597
I go to a drive-thru
burger place?

319
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,669
Ha ha! 6 dogs versus
a hundred horsepower?

320
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,604
Don't think so, pally.

321
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,606
Baah!

322
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,585
(Sighs)

323
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,287
Need less weight.

324
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,856
(Grunting)

325
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,160
Uh, hi.

326
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,128
What are you
doing here?

327
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,430
Duane's my friend.

328
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:06,965
I thawed him out
and fed him and--

329
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,267
too dangerous.
Stay with tohru.

330
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,973
I found moose jerky.

331
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,045
Go! Go!

332
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,887
(Laughing)

333
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,022
Aah!

334
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,995
Go! Go!

335
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,930
Get along,
little doggies!

336
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,064
Ahh.

337
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,468
(Grunts)

338
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,173
(Grunts)

339
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,575
Whoa! Oof.

340
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,716
Everyone ok?

341
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,851
Aah!

342
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,854
Aah!

343
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,988
Oof!

344
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,533
You're
about to join

345
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,568
the polar Bear club,
pally, but hey,

346
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,936
look at
the bright side.

347
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,371
Maybe someone
will dig <i> you</i> up

348
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,607
in about
a thousand years.

349
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,375
(Roaring)

350
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,911
Get back,
you hairy beast!

351
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,579
I'm warning you!

352
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,284
(Growls)

353
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,722
Whaah!

354
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,726
No, please, help me!

355
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,228
I hear ice fishing
is very good

356
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,963
this time of year.

357
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,802
Don't worry,
you're drifting east.

358
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,604
Should reach
solid ground in 2 days.

359
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,872
Hold tight, Jackie,

360
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,707
'cause it's Jade
of the north coming in

361
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,443
for one more save.

362
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,945
Too late.

363
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,147
I was already
assisted by...

364
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,482
A friend.

365
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,322
Let's get
this gentleman
onto the sled.

366
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,757
Then we'll head
to the airport.

367
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,259
You want to take Duane
home with us?

368
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,862
He will be safe
at section 13--

369
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,997
placed under
observation, studied,

370
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,332
fed cereal.

371
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,500
Hello.

372
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:24,635
King Kong?
Mighty Joe young?

373
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,071
We can't take Duane
back to civilization.

374
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,574
But I thought
he was your friend.

375
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,543
He is, and that's why
we got to leave him...

376
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,711
Here.

377
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,115
Ahh...

378
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,950
The Aurora borealis.

379
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,618
Northern lights.

380
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,987
The inscription!

381
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,489
"When night
turns to day,

382
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:47,258
something--something
will run free."

383
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,494
I expect you
are correct, Jade.

384
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,663
And also correct
about Duane staying here

385
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,732
in his natural habitat.

386
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,567
Go ahead, big guy.

387
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,102
Run. Be free.

388
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,146
Where is sensei?

389
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,247
(Gasps)

390
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,348
Uncle!

391
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,716
By now,
probably at war

392
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,584
with the inuit elder.

393
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,090
Huh...My secret.

394
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,092
Anchovy, eh?

395
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:23,861
Baah! Catch nothing
but minnows.

396
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,464
What do you
fish with, worms?

397
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,866
Mung beans wrapped
in tea leaves.

398
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,436
Fish take a number
to get on hook.

399
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,372
Ahh...

400
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,641
Big talk, no action.

401
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,316
Ahh, see?

402
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,185
I got something.

403
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,786
(Grunting)

404
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,288
(Grunting)

405
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,889
So does uncle.

406
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,457
Big something!

407
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,363
Ha! See?

408
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,066
My bait gone.
Yours still on hook.

409
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,434
So what?

410
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,337
So, fish we lost
was mine!

411
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,406
No, that was my fish.

412
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,473
My fish!

413
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,808
You're a liar!

414
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,009
My fish!

415
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,477
You cheated.

416
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,552
Hey, Jackie?

417
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,820
Do you miss
your family

418
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,422
when you're off
making movies?

419
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:28,259
My business is, uh,
very, very difficult,

420
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,794
because I'm so busy.

421
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:33,064
A location scout,
training, rehearsal.

422
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,198
The camera rolling.

423
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,034
The only things I know
is comedy, action.

424
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,003
Great stunts,
great action.

425
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,706
Sometimes when
I'm off camera,

426
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,974
take a break...

427
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,409
Then I do miss
my family.

428
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,645
But what can I do?
Travel, travel,
travel, travel.
