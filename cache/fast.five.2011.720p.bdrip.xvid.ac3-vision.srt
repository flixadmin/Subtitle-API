1
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:35,828
<i>Dominic Toretto.</i>

2
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:40,708
You are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life

3
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,712
at the Lompoc Maximum Security
Prison system

4
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:47,798
<i>without the possibility</i>
<i>of early parole.</i>

5
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:03,457
<i>Here's what we know so far.</i>

6
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:07,044
<i>This is all the aftermath of a daring,</i>
<i>daylight breakout.</i>

7
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,213
<i>There were 26 high-risk</i>
<i>inmates being transferred...</i>

8
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:11,882
<i>A daring midday breakout where</i>
<i>everyone onboard has been accounted for,</i>

9
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,676
<i>except for one,</i>
<i>Dominic Toretto.</i>

10
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
<i>Police have</i>
<i>just released the identity</i>

11
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:17,305
<i>of the man they believe to have</i>
<i>orchestrated the shocking escape</i>

12
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:20,057
<i>that amazingly resulted</i>
<i>in no fatalities this afternoon.</i>

13
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:23,019
<i>He is former federal agent,</i>
<i>Brian O'Conner.</i>

14
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:26,063
<i>A fierce manhunt is underway</i>
<i>for three fugitives tonight.</i>

15
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:28,983
<i>Multiple federal</i>
<i>and local agencies have joined forces</i>

16
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,651
<i>in the search</i>
<i>for Dominic Toretto</i>

17
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:33,988
<i>and his accomplices</i>
<i>Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto.</i>

18
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:36,741
<i>But despite every eye</i>
<i>in the country looking for them</i>

19
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:40,453
<i>where Toretto</i>
<i>and O'Conner are now is anyone's guess.</i>

20
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,572
It's got to be it, right?

21
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:23,931
- Let's get out of here.
- Whoa, whoa!

22
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,183
Easy, friends.

23
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:27,518
She's with me.

24
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:31,105
Mia.

25
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:33,691
Vince.

26
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:39,363
Buster.

27
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:42,867
Come on.

28
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:45,786
Dom here yet?

29
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:47,121
No.

30
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:48,873
When was the last time
you heard from him?

31
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:52,042
A couple of weeks ago.
Up in Ecuador somewhere.

32
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:56,630
- How does it feel?
- What's that?

33
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,551
To be on the other side
of a wanted poster?

34
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:03,804
He'll show up.

35
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,097
Yeah.

36
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:12,313
Dom's?

37
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,107
Yeah.

38
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:19,695
Time for bed little one.

39
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,322
Can I bring him?

40
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:23,365
Of course.

41
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,450
Aw.

42
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:27,745
Good night.

43
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:47,431
Excuse me, sorry.

44
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,189
Why Rio, Vince?

45
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:01,612
You mean after you
screwed everything up in LA?

46
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:06,867
Ended up free-falling through
South America, you know,

47
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:10,079
hitting every hellhole
on the way down.

48
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:13,624
Would have kept
on going if not for Rosa.

49
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,309
Does he know?

50
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:45,948
So, listen.

51
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,243
There is a job coming up.

52
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,245
I was hoping Dom
was going to be here by now

53
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,832
but this one is clean enough
we can do it without him.

54
00:06:55,625 --> 00:07:00,129
It's a good gig. Couple of
high-end cars, easy targets.

55
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,174
Guy I know is putting
together a team to swipe them.

56
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,552
Just need a few more
willing bodies.

57
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,429
I don't know.

58
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:11,181
Look, the way the car
scene is down here

59
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:14,226
we can unload them quick
and get top dollar.

60
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:16,353
It's easy money.

61
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:18,689
And from where I'm sitting,

62
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,943
it looks like you both
could use the payday.

63
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:03,651
What are you reading?

64
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:05,611
Travel guide.

65
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:07,237
Yeah?

66
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,618
Tokyo.

67
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:15,454
Moscow.

68
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Goa.

69
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:21,752
You want to know what all of
these places have in common?

70
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,087
Huh?

71
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,422
No extradition.

72
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,897
Here we go.

73
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,165
Excuse me, buddy.

74
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:16,056
Okay.

75
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:40,998
Hey, we've found them.

76
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,833
Yeah, second-to-the-last
freighter.

77
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:54,845
What is it?

78
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,557
DEA tags. These cars
have been seized.

79
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:41,517
Look who showed up.

80
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:45,103
God, I'm so happy you're okay.

81
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,608
I thought I told you
to lay low.

82
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,236
Been running on fumes.
Had to make a call.

83
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:55,614
Hey! Quit talking. We only
got the two-minute window.

84
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,075
Let's go, Vince.

85
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,662
I'm taking the GT40.

86
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:39,783
Ladies first.

87
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:46,957
Hey!

88
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:49,543
Hey!

89
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:51,753
This car suits me better.

90
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,096
See you, baby.

91
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:09,229
It's okay... we're all
going to the same place.

92
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:11,064
We'll get the car there.

93
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,406
Change of plans.
Wait for my call.

94
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:23,911
Let's go!

95
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:42,387
Where is she going?

96
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,849
- Where is she going?
- Hey!

97
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:48,435
Hey!

98
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:56,485
We're being robbed! Whatever
happens, don't stop the train!

99
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:58,779
Go after the girl!

100
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:00,489
Hurry up!

101
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,105
Access card!
Get the access card!

102
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:46,970
Shit.

103
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,955
Bridge! There is a bridge!

104
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,639
Luggage car is clear.

105
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:38,688
Freeze!

106
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,083
Oh, shit!

107
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,616
You had to make a call, huh?

108
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:15,410
Shitty call, O'Conner.

109
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,537
Shitty call.

110
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:40,185
You two stirred up
quite a bit of trouble today.

111
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,396
Three of my men dead.

112
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,857
Three DEA agents
along with them.

113
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,443
Of course,
this is business

114
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,071
and sometimes
things go astray.

115
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,532
All I care about is the car.

116
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,868
Tell me where it is,
and I'll let you go.

117
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:02,749
This roofing plastic says
you're full of shit.

118
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:07,295
I don't know how you guys do
business in your part of the world,

119
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,421
but here in Rio,

120
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:12,133
I like it when all parties
know what they're up against.

121
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:13,677
That's funny.

122
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:16,304
Because it goes both ways.

123
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
You know,

124
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:24,813
I hear your sister
is very beautiful.

125
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,692
Wherever she hides

126
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:31,361
I will find her.

127
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:22,162
<i>The American fugitives killed three</i>
<i>DEA agents during a train robbery...</i>

128
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,165
<i>...Police warn they are armed and</i>
<i>extremely dangerous.</i>

129
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:28,668
<i>Anyone with information should contact law</i>
<i>enforcement immediately...</i>

130
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,014
Mia?

131
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:42,932
Hey.

132
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:47,020
You okay?

133
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,022
Yeah, you all right?

134
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:52,609
Hey.

135
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:00,241
Hey, yeah.

136
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:02,786
Just like a Toretto.

137
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,830
Where's Vince?

138
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:07,749
That's a good question.

139
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,794
He'll be here.

140
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,003
Guys, we're all over
the news.

141
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:15,465
They're blaming us for the killing
of those DEA agents on the train.

142
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,593
Which means we just jumped
to the top of the wanted list.

143
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,221
The feds have got to show everyone
their agents are off limits

144
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:24,099
and they're going to send their
best guys. We got to get out of here.

145
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,435
One thing we know for sure

146
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,522
is that they wanted this car.

147
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,441
Because something is in it.

148
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:37,195
If we find out what it is,
we'll know what we're up against.

149
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:57,340
All right, listen up! The men
we're after are professional runners.

150
00:20:57,425 --> 00:21:00,260
They like speed and are guaranteed
to go down the hardest possible way

151
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:01,719
so make sure you got
your funderwear on.

152
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:04,681
We find them, we take them as
a team, and we bring them back.

153
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:09,269
And above all else, we don't
ever, ever let them get into cars.

154
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,938
Crime scene is 10 hours old and
counting, men. Let's go hunting.

155
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:18,194
Agente Hobbs! Chief of
Police, João Alemeida.

156
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,446
Luke.

157
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,740
Sorry to hear about
the loss of your men.

158
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,868
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

159
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,494
Let me tell you something
about these two men.

160
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:29,080
One is a former federal officer,
been in deep cover for five years.

161
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:30,999
He knows every way you're
going to come for him.

162
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,169
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,

163
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:36,796
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.

164
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:39,716
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...

165
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,843
Two things.
One, I need a translator.

166
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,428
We have plenty in the
public relations department.

167
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,305
Elena Neves.

168
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:48,266
- A patrol officer?
- You heard me.

169
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,227
But why? We have many
more experienced people.

170
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:53,313
I like her smile.

171
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,315
What's the second thing?

172
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,277
Stay the fuck out of my way.

173
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:11,164
- Brian.
- Hm?

174
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,042
I have something
I have to tell you.

175
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,793
God damn.

176
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:17,670
What a mess!

177
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:21,132
Where you been, man?

178
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,762
You better check that tone.

179
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,680
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.

180
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:29,265
Stop it!
Both of you.

181
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,728
Where were you, Vince?

182
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,941
Guys all over the
favelas asking about you.

183
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:40,652
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

184
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:41,819
Had to wait them out.

185
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:43,613
That is such horseshit.

186
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,782
- That was your job, and those were your guys!
- Hey!

187
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,450
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

188
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:49,327
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it.

189
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,495
Go walk it off.

190
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:09,180
Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

191
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:13,268
but, quite frankly, your
business methods are too violent.

192
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:16,604
Let me tell you a true story.

193
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:21,109
Five hundred years ago, the
Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

194
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:24,654
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

195
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:31,369
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

196
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:37,000
The natives killed
every single Spaniard.

197
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,839
Personally, I prefer
the methods of the Portuguese.

198
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,092
They came bearing gifts.

199
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,469
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

200
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:53,016
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

201
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,352
but to continue receiving them,
they had to work for the Portuguese.

202
00:23:57,521 --> 00:24:00,898
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

203
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:05,445
Now, if you dominate
the people with violence,

204
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:09,782
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.

205
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,493
And that's the key.

206
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:16,372
I go into the favelas and
give them something to lose.

207
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,208
Electricity, running water,

208
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,419
school rooms for their kids.

209
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,882
And for that taste
of a better life,

210
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:29,385
I own them.

211
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:31,596
Gentlemen.

212
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:37,435
I apologize for
the interruption.

213
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,521
Señor Reyes,
may I speak with you?

214
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:43,107
We've found them.

215
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,778
Pardon me, gentlemen.

216
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:03,920
Almost wish
I didn't see that.

217
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,175
Almost.

218
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,302
Wait, Dom.

219
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:13,554
Mia was on that train.

220
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,264
My sister!

221
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,518
I didn't know. I wouldn't
do anything to hurt her.

222
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,937
You set up the deal!

223
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:23,648
I thought the job
was for the cars.

224
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:25,858
I didn't know.

225
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,402
All they want is the chip.

226
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:31,114
Damn!

227
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,408
You should've come clean.

228
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,076
What's going on out here?

229
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:37,161
Nothing.

230
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:40,707
Please, Dom, just let me have
the chip. I can take this to them.

231
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,959
They'll give it to Reyes
and set things right.

232
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,044
Get out.

233
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,924
What?

234
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,050
Get out!

235
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,227
You never listen to me.

236
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:04,981
Not when I told you
he was a cop, and not now.

237
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:09,777
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.

238
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,155
Look at our family now.

239
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:17,285
I can't go home! Your
sister is stuck in this life!

240
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:19,328
Where's Letty, Dom?

241
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:22,832
Where's Letty?

242
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:48,775
Plasma cutter.

243
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:52,111
Wilkes, I want a list
of every place within 50 miles

244
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,946
that distributes
compressed gas tanks.

245
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,157
Pass me that manifest.

246
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,832
Officer Neves.
Been waiting for you.

247
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,293
- You asked for me?
- I did.

248
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,045
May I ask why?

249
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,547
My smile
is not that great.

250
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,678
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.

251
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,639
Six months later, you
upped and joined the force.

252
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:20,973
You're motivated.

253
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,811
Plus, I figure you're the only
one in Rio who can't be bought.

254
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,312
Am I right?

255
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,732
- Yes.
- Of course I am.

256
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:30,983
Good news, bad news.

257
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,735
You know I like
my dessert first.

258
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,779
Back-checked
the rail line like you asked.

259
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,864
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

260
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,658
One set of tracks
headed west

261
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,410
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

262
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:42,787
But another set
of tracks headed east.

263
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,248
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

264
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,917
The GT40 that was missing
from the manifest.

265
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,585
Followed the trail
a couple of miles.

266
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,878
Pretty easy in this scrub.

267
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,713
Can't move without
leaving a sign.

268
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:54,257
Give me the damn veggies.

269
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:57,635
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

270
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,471
Not necessarily.

271
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:03,975
That road heads up through
the hills into the favelas.

272
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,394
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

273
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,855
It's all dirt a mile
from where you were.

274
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:12,108
If they headed that way, we'll
pick up their tracks there.

275
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:14,443
You come prepared.

276
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:15,987
I'm motivated.

277
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:17,738
All right, then.

278
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,533
Let's find ourselves a car.

279
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:52,189
What do you think?

280
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,692
Well, it's definitely
a custom chip.

281
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:58,404
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

282
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,323
Let's check this one.

283
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,454
Look at that.

284
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,956
Same building,
same order every week.

285
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,875
It's a delivery schedule.

286
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:33,022
What's this?

287
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,441
Drugs?

288
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:38,444
No. That's a dealer pack.

289
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,446
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

290
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,406
so they don't have
to constantly count it.

291
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:43,824
Right there,
that's 49 kilos.

292
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,868
49 kilos is a million
in twenties.

293
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:49,038
You're saying each one of these
shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

294
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,164
Yeah.

295
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,064
I thought so.

296
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,110
So what is that?

297
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,821
A 100-million plus
in cash houses?

298
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,781
That's how he keeps it
off the grid.

299
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,911
I think it's safe to say that
Reyes is smart to want this back.

300
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,747
It's his whole network right
there, just laid out on a chip.

301
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:56,605
Wilkes, Fusco,
up the middle.

302
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,357
Mac, Chato,
flank north.

303
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,109
What about me?

304
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:01,193
Stay here.

305
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,496
Go that way!

306
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,956
The other two
went over the wall!

307
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,417
Come on, go! Go!

308
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:58,352
Get on the ground.

309
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:01,438
I got Toretto.
Four blocks north of your...

310
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:08,737
They already know
who you are.

311
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:42,146
Let's go.

312
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,026
You okay here?

313
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,780
Yeah. I'm good.
Thank you.

314
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,317
They're going to be looking for
the three of us together now.

315
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,112
We need to split up.

316
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:16,031
You and Mia head south,
I'll lead them away.

317
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,116
No.

318
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,493
Dom is right.

319
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:21,287
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?

320
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:22,413
We have no choice
but to split up.

321
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,747
I'm pregnant.

322
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,087
I already lost
my family once.

323
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,717
I'm not going through
that again.

324
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,386
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

325
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:45,269
I'm not going
anywhere. Okay?

326
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:48,731
Dom?

327
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:51,775
Promise me
we stick together.

328
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:01,410
I promise.

329
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,459
Our family
just got bigger.

330
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,312
Something
doesn't add up.

331
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,272
Toretto and O'Conner.

332
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:35,361
They stay when they're supposed to
run, they steal gas then give it away?

333
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:37,071
Now they're killing
federal agents?

334
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:39,865
It doesn't make any sense.

335
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:41,742
Here's what makes sense.

336
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:47,998
All these guys are
is names on a list.

337
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,500
They come up,
we take them down.

338
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:52,086
Not a phone call more,
not a bullet less.

339
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,879
Wilkes, we get anything?

340
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,631
Standard forensics.

341
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,508
Shoe prints.
Hair and fiber.

342
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:58,717
Prints are all over the car.

343
00:36:58,802 --> 00:36:59,885
Anything else?

344
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,262
Yeah, we tracked the owner
off the vehicle ID.

345
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:03,806
There are a couple of
shell companies in between,

346
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,350
but we finally traced
it back to a corporation

347
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:09,103
owned by an investor down
here named Hernan Reyes.

348
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:10,187
Investor?

349
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,650
If there's anything illegal
happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

350
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,360
Okay, then so are we.

351
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,654
If he could get us any closer to
our guys, I want everything on him.

352
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,072
Chato, you're
on the roof.

353
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,449
I want you on overwatch in case
somebody comes back for something.

354
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,910
Mac, give me a cross-check
on Reyes, full specs.

355
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:27,204
If he goes to the john, I want to
know how many times he shakes it.

356
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,665
- You got it, boss.
- Wilkes, Fusco!

357
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,251
Let's put all this
mess back together.

358
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:36,296
That's going to take a while.

359
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:37,631
Then you better get started.

360
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,633
They were taking
this car apart for a reason.

361
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:41,510
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.

362
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:12,541
Hey, Dom, what do you
remember about your father?

363
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,712
My father.

364
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,135
He used to...

365
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:27,181
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

366
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:30,225
For anybody
in the neighborhood.

367
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,520
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

368
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:39,151
Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,

369
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:44,239
he was at the kitchen table with
Mia, helping her with her homework.

370
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:48,285
Even after she went to sleep,

371
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:51,413
he'd stay up
for a few more hours

372
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:55,459
so he could learn the next
chapter and help her the next day.

373
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,420
I remember everything
about my father.

374
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,298
Everything.

375
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,759
That's just it.

376
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:05,636
I don't remember shit
about my dad.

377
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,807
I don't remember
him yelling.

378
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:12,351
I don't remember
him smiling.

379
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:16,939
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.

380
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:21,235
I don't remember.
He just...

381
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:24,446
He was just never there.

382
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:28,784
You ain't going
to be like that, Brian.

383
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:47,553
We can't keep
running, Dom.

384
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:50,847
We got to get out.

385
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:52,849
We got to get out now.

386
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,394
You're right.

387
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,657
Here's how we're
going to do it.

388
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,079
We're going to use this.

389
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:17,082
We're going do one last job.

390
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,876
We're going to take
all of Reyes' money.

391
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,753
Every dime of it,

392
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:24,339
and disappear.

393
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:28,969
Forever.

394
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:31,680
New passports.

395
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,182
New lives with no more
looking over our shoulder.

396
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:35,934
And we're just going
to buy our freedom.

397
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,060
That's right.

398
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,729
You realize we're talking
about going up against

399
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:40,147
the most powerful guy
in all of Rio?

400
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,898
Yes, we are.

401
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,235
Then we're going
to need a team.

402
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:54,202
Let's run through the bases
real quick. Who do we got?

403
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:55,662
First we're going
to need a chameleon.

404
00:40:57,165 --> 00:41:01,043
<i>Someone who can</i>
<i>blend in anywhere.</i>

405
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:03,086
What else?

406
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,212
A fast talker.

407
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:07,633
<i>Someone who can</i>
<i>bullshit their way out of anything.</i>

408
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:09,051
I got that.

409
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,471
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.

410
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,264
We're going to need someone
who's good with circuits.

411
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:19,061
<i>And with those circuits,</i>
<i>Reyes is going to have walls.</i>

412
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:21,438
We're going to need guys
to punch through those walls.

413
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,441
What else?

414
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:26,735
Utilities and weapons.

415
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:29,571
<i>Someone who ain't</i>
<i>afraid to throw down.</i>

416
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,491
<i>Someone to back up</i>
<i>every position.</i>

417
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:34,117
<i>Yeah, what else</i>
<i>do we need?</i>

418
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:35,827
<i>Most importantly,</i>

419
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:39,122
we're going to need
two precision drivers.

420
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:41,833
Guys that don't crack
under pressure.

421
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:43,377
Guys that never lose.

422
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:45,962
You know we got that.

423
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:15,867
Aw, hell, no!

424
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:19,538
I see they really scraped
the bottom of the barrel, huh?

425
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,915
I guess they did,
since your ass is here.

426
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:26,712
When are you going to give
Martin Luther King his car back?

427
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:29,548
As soon as you give
Rick James his jacket back.

428
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:34,928
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

429
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,190
Hmm.

430
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:50,110
Sexy legs,
baby girl.

431
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:51,403
What time do they open?

432
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,074
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.

433
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:58,076
Want me to open them?

434
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:04,332
I told you the skinny
chick had balls.

435
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,960
Looks like she started
the party without us.

436
00:43:07,545 --> 00:43:10,172
Hey, anybody can talk shit
in Spanish, homie.

437
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,091
What's this guy saying?

438
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:15,719
Ugly is still ugly in
Spanish or in English.

439
00:43:19,015 --> 00:43:21,099
- Who are these clowns, man?
- Circus clowns.

440
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:26,229
I thought cockfights
were illegal in Brazil.

441
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:28,398
I see you all have met.

442
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:32,194
You know when you called me
to come to Rio

443
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:35,113
I assumed it would be for
something more exciting than this.

444
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:36,198
Look at this guy.

445
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:38,408
- Long time.
- I missed you, man.

446
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:39,576
Good to see you.

447
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,578
- Brother.
- What's up?

448
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,747
Yo, check this out.
This is Tej.

449
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,749
Best circuit man
on the East Coast.

450
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,334
And this is my boy,
Roman Pearce.

451
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:49,920
We go way back,
I met this guy in juvie.

452
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:51,630
I pulled that job
with him in Miami.

453
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:53,131
I've heard about you.

454
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,801
Nice digs.

455
00:43:55,885 --> 00:43:57,677
Yeah, well,
the Ritz was sold out.

456
00:43:58,221 --> 00:43:59,971
So what's this
all about, Dom?

457
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:03,391
Yeah, man, why did you drag
us halfway around the world?

458
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:05,268
Because we got a job.

459
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,897
All right, so our target's
name is Hernan Reyes.

460
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:10,690
And he runs
the drug scene down here.

461
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:13,318
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

462
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:15,445
No paper trail
means no banks.

463
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,614
And no banks means
cash houses.

464
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,116
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

465
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:22,369
Spread throughout the city.

466
00:44:22,453 --> 00:44:24,287
And we're going
to hit them all.

467
00:44:25,748 --> 00:44:26,748
All of them?

468
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,250
All of them.

469
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:30,252
That sounds crazy.

470
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:32,295
You bring us
to a whole other country

471
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,422
so we can rob
the dude who runs it?

472
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,175
I thought this was business.

473
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:38,760
Sounds personal to me.

474
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:41,304
Is that what this is?

475
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:45,183
I got love for y'all, but
personal ain't good business.

476
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:49,062
I can't do this, homie.

477
00:44:50,314 --> 00:44:54,442
So what we're talking
about is $100 million.

478
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,570
You say what?

479
00:44:56,654 --> 00:45:00,282
Hundred... See, sometimes
I be over thinking, man,

480
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:03,410
and I know we just met, but
you just, kind of, got to...

481
00:45:03,494 --> 00:45:07,247
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,

482
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:08,748
we split even.

483
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,625
That's a little over
$11 million apiece.

484
00:45:11,627 --> 00:45:13,003
I am down.

485
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:14,504
I'm in.

486
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,549
Eleven million.

487
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:20,677
Sounds like a whole lot of
vaginal activity to me.

488
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:23,430
You can't pull off 10 heists
on the same mark.

489
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:24,598
You just can't.

490
00:45:24,682 --> 00:45:26,224
As soon as we hit
the first one,

491
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:29,060
they're going to do everything
they can to protect the rest.

492
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:31,813
Exactly.

493
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:11,519
Nobody move!

494
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:27,911
That's all of it.

495
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:29,204
You a dead man.

496
00:46:29,288 --> 00:46:30,372
You're all dead men!

497
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:32,707
You don't have
a place to hide.

498
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:36,711
Who's hiding?

499
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:38,088
Are you crazy?

500
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:39,381
Are you crazy?

501
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:42,342
Do you know whose house this
is? Whose money are you stealing?

502
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:54,229
We ain't stealing it.

503
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:06,241
You tell your boss
exactly who did this.

504
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,369
Tell him there's more coming.

505
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:16,042
<i>Voilà.</i>

506
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:18,003
Turn it over.

507
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:27,387
She's running on all eight.
Checks out fine.

508
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:31,850
Keep looking.

509
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:37,439
Boss, if something
was missing, we'd know.

510
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:06,718
It's a goddamn shame putting
bullshit like that on a classic.

511
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:09,137
You may as well slap
neon lights on it.

512
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:22,400
They took the chip.

513
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:26,237
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

514
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:27,739
Address cross-checks
against property

515
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:29,491
owned by one
of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

516
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:30,742
All right,
if that's our guys

517
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:33,411
then whatever was on that chip
led them directly to that house.

518
00:48:33,496 --> 00:48:34,662
It's them, for sure.

519
00:48:34,747 --> 00:48:36,081
How do you know that?

520
00:48:36,165 --> 00:48:40,460
Because no one else in Rio
is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

521
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:55,266
Explain.

522
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:57,018
They invaded
the Leblon house.

523
00:48:57,394 --> 00:48:58,728
Who invaded?

524
00:48:58,813 --> 00:49:01,189
The men from the train.

525
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:11,741
How much did they take?

526
00:49:11,909 --> 00:49:13,701
They didn't
take anything.

527
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:17,413
They burned it!

528
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:19,290
They burned my money?

529
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:22,502
Yes. And said
there's more coming.

530
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:31,594
Okay...

531
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:42,230
Then this...

532
00:49:44,108 --> 00:49:45,567
...is what
we're going to do.

533
00:49:52,116 --> 00:49:53,741
Clean the houses.

534
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:58,246
I want that money
under lock and key...

535
00:49:59,707 --> 00:50:00,790
...within an hour.

536
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,084
Understand?

537
00:50:05,296 --> 00:50:06,921
<i>Understood.</i>

538
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,318
Number One
is on the move, man.

539
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:44,250
Two is on the move.

540
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:09,984
I got mine.

541
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,007
I got eyes on Five.

542
00:51:59,702 --> 00:52:03,037
I know y'all said they were
consolidating the money somewhere, but,

543
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:06,249
y'all ain't going
to believe this.

544
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:18,428
Well, this job just got
a lot harder.

545
00:52:19,096 --> 00:52:20,930
If he's moving it
into a police station

546
00:52:21,015 --> 00:52:23,474
he's got some serious
brass in his pocket.

547
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:26,144
Looks like this is going to be
a shorter trip than I thought...

548
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:27,437
Hell, yeah,
we can't do this.

549
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:31,024
"Can't"? You mean,
"shouldn't."

550
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:34,068
I think this doesn't
change a thing.

551
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:39,490
I say we stick to the plan.

552
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:41,242
You say what?

553
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:42,994
This just went
from <i>Mission: Impossible</i>

554
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:44,954
to Mission:
In-freaking-sanity.

555
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:48,416
Whatever, man.

556
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,878
I ain't scared, I'm just letting you all
know, going in that building is crazy.

557
00:52:51,962 --> 00:52:53,379
I got this.

558
00:52:57,009 --> 00:52:58,343
What time
was the robbery?

559
00:52:58,427 --> 00:53:00,261
Around 11:00.

560
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:03,014
Here we go.

561
00:53:05,184 --> 00:53:06,684
Enhance it.

562
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:10,229
Their faces are covered.

563
00:53:10,314 --> 00:53:11,439
Run it through FRS.

564
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,155
Well, hello,
you son of a bitch.

565
00:53:22,034 --> 00:53:25,078
Wilkes! Run the photos of known
associates of Toretto and O'Conner

566
00:53:25,162 --> 00:53:28,039
against customs entries into
Brazil in the last two weeks.

567
00:53:28,123 --> 00:53:31,292
Check planes, trains, boats, everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.

568
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:40,718
They can change their names but
they can't change their faces.

569
00:53:40,803 --> 00:53:42,553
Something big
is going down.

570
00:53:44,306 --> 00:53:45,723
That's a 1970 Charger.

571
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:47,892
Fusco! Upload these specs
into the database.

572
00:53:47,976 --> 00:53:50,269
Have the computer cross-check
it with overhead satellites

573
00:53:50,354 --> 00:53:52,355
every 15 minutes,
the van behind it, too.

574
00:53:52,439 --> 00:53:55,191
If these vehicles move in the streets
of Rio, I want to know about it.

575
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:05,076
Everything okay?

576
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,202
Everything is okay.

577
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:08,955
Who is this Hobbs? This Federal
Agent running around town?

578
00:54:09,206 --> 00:54:10,206
Some American cowboy.

579
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:11,958
He's handled.

580
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:13,668
He killed sixteen
of our men.

581
00:54:14,378 --> 00:54:15,586
<i>Handle him better.</i>

582
00:54:15,754 --> 00:54:21,050
Look... He requested a rookie
patrol officer as his assistant.

583
00:54:23,804 --> 00:54:24,804
They won't be a problem.

584
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,710
- It's all here?
- Yes.

585
00:54:57,212 --> 00:54:58,963
What about Toretto and
O'Conner? Where are they?

586
00:54:59,423 --> 00:55:00,423
Nothing yet.

587
00:55:01,467 --> 00:55:03,301
But I have all our
officers searching.

588
00:55:04,136 --> 00:55:05,261
Not good enough.

589
00:55:06,138 --> 00:55:07,555
Put a price
on their heads.

590
00:55:07,723 --> 00:55:09,140
High enough...

591
00:55:09,725 --> 00:55:11,851
...to get every pair of eyes
in the city searching for them.

592
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:21,819
The beauty of public offices?

593
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,740
Public records.

594
00:55:26,158 --> 00:55:28,576
This is where he's keeping the
money. The vault in the evidence room.

595
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:33,998
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's
attention, right here, for a second?

596
00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:37,752
We're talking about breaking
into a police station.

597
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:39,545
Is anyone listening
to those words?

598
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,172
Anybody? Popo?

599
00:55:41,256 --> 00:55:43,841
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.

600
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:45,218
People we don't like.

601
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:48,221
You know, police stations are
designed to keep people in, not out.

602
00:55:48,305 --> 00:55:49,597
That's why it's
a stealth mission.

603
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,725
We'll be in and out before
they even know we were there.

604
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:54,352
Well, we'll need
to get eyes in there.

605
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:56,896
At least to find out the
make and model of that vault.

606
00:55:57,147 --> 00:56:00,483
So the vault
and then, so...

607
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:02,026
It's crazy.

608
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,946
Who's supposed
to do all this?

609
00:56:13,372 --> 00:56:15,289
What do you mean?

610
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,542
Why me?

611
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:19,544
Because you got
the biggest mouth.

612
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:21,629
That's for damn sure.

613
00:56:28,345 --> 00:56:29,345
Ooh.

614
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:32,723
Hello, beautiful.

615
00:56:32,808 --> 00:56:35,434
Look at those dimples.
Sexy, sexy.

616
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:37,562
Love those glasses.
Where did you get them from?

617
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:40,064
Are those like Gucci frames
or something?

618
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:41,315
No English?

619
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,193
No, no, no. Damn.

620
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:45,820
How are you, sir?

621
00:56:46,238 --> 00:56:50,074
Special Agent O'Conner. US
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

622
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:51,367
It says Caucasian.

623
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,412
That's a tan.
You know, a tan?

624
00:56:57,332 --> 00:57:01,377
Look, I'm working this case and I
got some evidence here to be held.

625
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:03,838
But I need to get in and check
your storage facility first.

626
00:57:03,922 --> 00:57:04,922
Nope.

627
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:08,301
Look, I know you're a true professional,
and I respect you, I promise.

628
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:10,553
You know, it looks like you
work out a little bit, too.

629
00:57:10,637 --> 00:57:13,097
What do you bench,
about 350?

630
00:57:13,515 --> 00:57:14,515
Ah, shit.

631
00:57:15,684 --> 00:57:17,018
Look, I'm just trying
to do my job, man.

632
00:57:17,102 --> 00:57:19,979
My boss sent me here to just make
sure that everything was safe.

633
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:21,063
It will be safe.

634
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:23,232
Let me just come in
and take a quick peek.

635
00:57:23,317 --> 00:57:24,317
Nope.

636
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:26,944
Come on, man. Hook a brother up, please?

637
00:57:27,029 --> 00:57:28,654
Nope. And you're
not my brother.

638
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:29,989
Brother from
another mother?

639
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:33,284
Look! No one enters the facility
but authorized evidence personnel.

640
00:57:33,368 --> 00:57:34,577
Now stop wasting my time.

641
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:35,620
I'm going to call
the embassy.

642
00:57:35,704 --> 00:57:37,163
No, no, no!
No, we're good.

643
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:39,624
We don't need to call them.
For what? We're good.

644
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:42,293
Here, I got the box.
We're all good.

645
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:45,296
I promise you. Thank you
so much for your time.

646
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,590
Swear to God, if you were on
the other side of that glass

647
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:50,051
I'd bust your damn face in.
Now translate that.

648
00:58:07,903 --> 00:58:11,614
It's done. See, I think I make a
better special agent than you ever did.

649
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,660
Well, that depends
on how you define "special."

650
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:19,997
Come on, now.
Let's see what we got.

651
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:21,582
Not funny.

652
00:58:28,924 --> 00:58:30,633
All right, come on.

653
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:37,181
Dawg,
you still can't drive.

654
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:41,811
Now, I see why you're always
getting into accidents.

655
00:58:41,895 --> 00:58:44,105
You can't even drive
a damn remote control car.

656
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:46,107
I'm going to need you
to shut up right now.

657
00:58:46,191 --> 00:58:48,317
- I'm not going to shut up.
- Shut up.

658
00:58:48,402 --> 00:58:49,777
Strap him in his
safety belt, man.

659
00:58:52,989 --> 00:58:54,532
Give me the remote,
dawg. Go left.

660
00:58:54,616 --> 00:58:56,742
It looks like something right over
there to the left. What is that?

661
00:58:56,827 --> 00:58:57,827
What is that?

662
00:58:59,204 --> 00:59:00,204
Bingo.

663
00:59:01,456 --> 00:59:03,457
What is that,
six-by-six?

664
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:04,625
Eight-by-twelve.

665
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,210
Seven-by-twelve.

666
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:09,422
Fitted with 18-inch-thick
steel reinforced walls

667
00:59:09,506 --> 00:59:13,050
with a insulated copper core to
protect against thermal lance.

668
00:59:13,135 --> 00:59:16,595
A Class-3 electronic lock with
a surefire Griffin retumbler

669
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,389
and a biometric palm scanner.

670
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:20,975
Ten tons of
top-of-the-line security.

671
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,727
Do I want to know
how you know all that?

672
00:59:22,811 --> 00:59:24,812
I had a life before
you knew me, O'Conner.

673
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,731
Let's just leave it
at that, all right?

674
00:59:26,815 --> 00:59:28,482
She is a beauty,
though, man.

675
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:30,735
A "beauty"
as in "good"?

676
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:33,571
"Beauty" as in, she's going to
start off playing hard to get.

677
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:37,908
Then, no matter how much I caress
her, no matter how much I love her,

678
00:59:37,993 --> 00:59:41,245
in the end, she still ain't
going to give up that ass.

679
00:59:47,836 --> 00:59:49,336
Two to one says
you blow the wrong pipe.

680
00:59:49,713 --> 00:59:51,756
Yo, why you got to be
so negative all the time, man?

681
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:54,300
I ain't negative.

682
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:57,178
I'm just <i>positive</i>
you're going to mess it up.

683
00:59:57,554 --> 01:00:00,556
I'm telling you, man,
you got issues.

684
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:09,023
Next time if there's no
elevator, I'm not coming.

685
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:12,568
You need to learn
to relax, loco.

686
01:00:34,216 --> 01:00:36,258
You better hurry up,
we got less than a minute.

687
01:00:36,343 --> 01:00:42,306
<i>Why do you always set</i>
<i>the timer so short?</i>

688
01:01:05,747 --> 01:01:06,997
I hope you know
where you're going.

689
01:01:07,082 --> 01:01:09,917
I got this. Relax, man.

690
01:01:10,085 --> 01:01:11,919
Relax.

691
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,766
...a police station.

692
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:27,560
Relax.

693
01:01:39,364 --> 01:01:41,198
You used too much
explosive! Again.

694
01:01:42,284 --> 01:01:43,951
Too much, too little...

695
01:01:44,536 --> 01:01:45,536
It's all the same.

696
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:51,041
That's some Buddha shit you learned from
a book in the prison library, isn't it?

697
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,752
And what you're doing
there on the wall...

698
01:01:53,837 --> 01:01:56,630
You got that from
the same book, huh?

699
01:01:57,132 --> 01:01:58,132
You're so negative, bro.

700
01:02:24,993 --> 01:02:27,328
Can I have some light?

701
01:02:30,749 --> 01:02:33,125
Got it. We got it!

702
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:34,835
Yeah, we're looking
at four cameras.

703
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:37,379
Yo, that's some
high-end shit, too.

704
01:02:37,464 --> 01:02:38,505
Marker optics.

705
01:02:39,049 --> 01:02:40,883
Hundred-degree
field-of-view.

706
01:02:41,176 --> 01:02:42,676
Ten seconds oscillation.

707
01:02:42,761 --> 01:02:44,762
Yeah, that's
a narrow window, man.

708
01:02:44,846 --> 01:02:46,513
Can't we just tap in
and replace the image?

709
01:02:46,598 --> 01:02:48,599
No, it's hooked
into a digital sync.

710
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:50,684
They would know we were
in the system.

711
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:52,811
The best we can do is peek.

712
01:02:52,896 --> 01:02:55,481
We're going to need some real
fast cars to get through this.

713
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,024
Not just fast.

714
01:02:57,317 --> 01:02:59,526
You got a hard right
and a hairpin.

715
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:01,278
We're going to need
something agile.

716
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:03,113
You guys mock up a track.

717
01:03:03,198 --> 01:03:04,198
O'Conner.

718
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:06,951
Let's go get some cars.

719
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,869
Nice.

720
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:50,077
Home sweet home.

721
01:04:08,013 --> 01:04:09,138
Or that.

722
01:04:10,015 --> 01:04:12,516
How about that?
All motor, no tuning issues.

723
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,935
I always wanted one of those.

724
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:18,605
Held the record on the
Avenida three years running.

725
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:21,108
Damn, bro...

726
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:23,819
You got a lot of balls to bring
your problems here, Toretto.

727
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:27,072
Not to mention a cop.

728
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:29,366
Yeah, we can keep
that on the low.

729
01:04:29,451 --> 01:04:32,411
Word on the street is a lot of
people are looking for you two.

730
01:04:33,371 --> 01:04:34,371
What?

731
01:04:34,706 --> 01:04:36,415
You didn't think
we'd recognize you?

732
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:39,793
No, we're kind
of counting on it.

733
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:42,546
That little coupe may run
the streets around here,

734
01:04:44,049 --> 01:04:48,093
but that monster has never
seen a set of tail lights.

735
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:50,137
- Ever.
- Well, she's about to.

736
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,348
Dominic Toretto's
ride in my garage.

737
01:04:54,434 --> 01:04:58,604
Now that...
will be a nice trophy.

738
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:02,941
Let's go, legend.

739
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:06,403
Car for car.

740
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:08,322
Car for car?

741
01:05:08,698 --> 01:05:10,199
You want it,
come and get it.

742
01:05:14,913 --> 01:05:16,747
Let's see what they got.

743
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:24,379
Really?

744
01:05:26,049 --> 01:05:29,259
Where did you get
that from? Papa Smurf?

745
01:05:29,344 --> 01:05:32,262
<i>Okay, O'Conner,</i>
<i>give it your best shot.</i>

746
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:56,328
How was that one?

747
01:05:56,412 --> 01:05:57,412
Camera caught you.

748
01:05:58,081 --> 01:05:59,957
- What?
- Yeah, it still caught you.

749
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:02,000
Man, I was milking the
hell out of that thing, too.

750
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,503
We're going to need
a faster car.

751
01:06:09,092 --> 01:06:10,843
I want my money.
Come on, man.

752
01:06:14,556 --> 01:06:15,556
Yeah!

753
01:06:18,184 --> 01:06:20,060
Let's get it! Watch this.

754
01:06:26,734 --> 01:06:30,279
That's exactly why your ass
ain't been driving.

755
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:43,500
I think I'm in love.

756
01:06:47,297 --> 01:06:48,797
That was real solid work.

757
01:06:48,882 --> 01:06:52,342
I think Camera 3
still caught you, though.

758
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:53,635
Let's do it again.

759
01:07:01,144 --> 01:07:03,103
That's the piggy bank
you ordered.

760
01:07:03,188 --> 01:07:05,105
- You're kidding me.
- Yep.

761
01:07:06,983 --> 01:07:09,776
Where in the hell
did y'all get one of these?

762
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:12,279
Well, we had a life
before you met us.

763
01:07:13,615 --> 01:07:16,950
All right, I'll get to work
on the electronic tumbler

764
01:07:17,035 --> 01:07:19,203
but there's still
another problem.

765
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:21,205
Palm scanner.

766
01:07:21,289 --> 01:07:23,081
And without Reyes' handprint,

767
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:25,542
Houdini himself
couldn't open this bitch.

768
01:07:25,627 --> 01:07:27,628
How do you know
it's Reyes' handprint?

769
01:07:27,712 --> 01:07:29,463
You got $100 million
in a safe.

770
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:31,256
You going to put somebody
else's handprint on it?

771
01:07:31,591 --> 01:07:34,343
Now there you go with
that negativity, man.

772
01:07:34,427 --> 01:07:35,761
That shit is eating
you alive.

773
01:07:35,845 --> 01:07:37,095
You check that.

774
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,223
Yo, check that.
Shut up!

775
01:07:39,307 --> 01:07:41,391
How are we supposed to get
Reyes' handprint?

776
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:44,228
Han.

777
01:07:44,312 --> 01:07:45,312
You're up.

778
01:07:47,315 --> 01:07:50,150
Sure. Nothing like
the easy stuff.

779
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:52,736
Let's go. I'll drive.

780
01:08:11,172 --> 01:08:13,173
- I make six bodyguards.
- Seven.

781
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:17,135
You think that guy with
a fanny pack is a tourist?

782
01:08:22,183 --> 01:08:24,643
So, how long were
you in the army?

783
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:27,521
That gun you pulled the
other day was a Jericho 941.

784
01:08:28,856 --> 01:08:30,607
Thumb-racking the slide?

785
01:08:30,692 --> 01:08:32,526
That was
straight-up Mossad.

786
01:08:33,611 --> 01:08:35,654
I got out of the military

787
01:08:36,864 --> 01:08:39,825
probably the same time
you quit smoking.

788
01:08:39,909 --> 01:08:41,868
The amount
of chips you eat,

789
01:08:42,328 --> 01:08:45,414
the way you always have to
keep your hands and mouth busy,

790
01:08:45,498 --> 01:08:48,083
you were a two-pack-a-day
man for sure.

791
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:51,795
Unfiltered.

792
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:56,883
Well, this is a bust.

793
01:08:58,052 --> 01:09:01,430
We're not going to be able to
get his fingerprints out here.

794
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:04,558
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.

795
01:09:04,642 --> 01:09:05,892
Or

796
01:09:06,311 --> 01:09:08,520
you don't send a man
to do a woman's job.

797
01:10:06,788 --> 01:10:09,539
We're going to figure
this out, I promise you.

798
01:10:12,835 --> 01:10:14,127
What's up?

799
01:10:14,754 --> 01:10:17,297
I thought you were
more of a thong man.

800
01:10:17,382 --> 01:10:18,715
We got the print.

801
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:21,593
Where?

802
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:25,555
Okay, that's crazy.

803
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:31,770
So, did he just slap that ass
or did he grab and hold on to it?

804
01:10:34,315 --> 01:10:36,400
Hey, this will work.

805
01:10:37,026 --> 01:10:38,276
I'm impressed.

806
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:40,362
- Got it?
- Got it.

807
01:10:40,446 --> 01:10:42,155
But you still didn't
answer the question.

808
01:10:48,162 --> 01:10:50,580
Oh, no. Guys, guys!
Guys, we have a problem.

809
01:10:50,665 --> 01:10:52,916
The whole team just got burnt.

810
01:10:54,335 --> 01:10:56,169
Now we're all wanted.

811
01:10:58,339 --> 01:10:59,339
How did this happen?

812
01:10:59,507 --> 01:11:03,093
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.

813
01:11:03,177 --> 01:11:05,011
Agent L. Hobbs.

814
01:11:05,388 --> 01:11:06,388
Hold on one second.

815
01:11:07,515 --> 01:11:08,557
Hey, Dom.

816
01:11:10,226 --> 01:11:12,018
Is that the guy you saw
in the favela?

817
01:11:14,856 --> 01:11:15,981
Yeah.

818
01:11:16,357 --> 01:11:19,818
Hobbs is the leader of the
elite task force for the DSS.

819
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:21,027
So he's good.

820
01:11:21,112 --> 01:11:24,197
When the FBI wants to find
somebody, that's who they call.

821
01:11:24,282 --> 01:11:26,032
Because he never
misses his mark.

822
01:11:26,117 --> 01:11:28,994
This guy is Old Testament.

823
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:32,372
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.

824
01:11:32,748 --> 01:11:35,167
And right now
he's hunting us?

825
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:36,960
Dom, we got to move up
our timeline.

826
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:38,170
Yeah, but how?

827
01:11:38,254 --> 01:11:41,715
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

828
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,050
If anything, we need
more room to breathe.

829
01:11:46,387 --> 01:11:47,762
Roman's right.

830
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,059
Think we need to get
some fresh air.

831
01:11:56,981 --> 01:11:59,065
We've got a hit.
'70s Charger.

832
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,151
Let's get a move on!

833
01:12:04,572 --> 01:12:07,157
Eastbound on
Avenida Atlantica.

834
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:08,658
Move, move, move, move!

835
01:12:14,916 --> 01:12:16,583
It stopped about
a block ahead.

836
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:18,668
Park it.
We're going on foot.

837
01:12:41,984 --> 01:12:43,109
Hey, Toretto.

838
01:12:51,202 --> 01:12:52,827
You're under arrest.

839
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,287
Arrest?

840
01:12:55,456 --> 01:12:57,374
I don't feel like
I'm under arrest.

841
01:12:58,125 --> 01:12:59,376
How about you,
Brian?

842
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,627
No, not a bit.

843
01:13:02,588 --> 01:13:03,838
Not even a little bit.

844
01:13:03,923 --> 01:13:06,174
Just give it a minute.
It'll sink in.

845
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:12,055
We didn't kill
those feds. That was Reyes.

846
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:13,431
I don't give a shit.

847
01:13:13,516 --> 01:13:16,309
I'm just here to bring in two
assholes whose names hit my desk.

848
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:19,813
Yeah, that sounds
like a real hero.

849
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:24,401
That's funny.

850
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:27,571
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.

851
01:13:27,655 --> 01:13:29,406
Or some wannabe
tough guy prick

852
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:31,866
who beat a man half to
death with a socket wrench.

853
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:33,827
Yeah, real tough.

854
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:37,998
You turn around and put
your hands behind your back.

855
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:40,584
I don't think so.

856
01:13:40,668 --> 01:13:43,295
Your mistake is thinking you
got a goddamn choice, boy.

857
01:13:47,466 --> 01:13:49,050
And your mistake?

858
01:13:49,677 --> 01:13:51,177
Thinking you're in America.

859
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:57,851
You're a long way from home.

860
01:14:00,354 --> 01:14:02,856
This is Brazil.

861
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,332
Come on, boss.
Another day.

862
01:14:22,043 --> 01:14:24,502
Come on, H,
it's a lot of heat.

863
01:14:29,717 --> 01:14:32,052
I'll see you soon,
Toretto.

864
01:14:33,387 --> 01:14:35,972
I look forward to it, cop.

865
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,260
Yep.

866
01:15:14,345 --> 01:15:15,720
Tracker's on.

867
01:15:17,098 --> 01:15:18,098
Got them.

868
01:16:24,331 --> 01:16:26,708
I don't understand.
Why come here?

869
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:30,044
Why risk it all
for $20 worth of silver?

870
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:34,883
Because it's worth it.

871
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:40,221
You should run,
you know.

872
01:16:40,973 --> 01:16:42,390
Hobbs will find you.

873
01:16:45,102 --> 01:16:48,021
You have every reason
to leave. Why stay?

874
01:16:55,446 --> 01:16:57,530
Why do you?

875
01:16:59,074 --> 01:17:01,075
My husband was
a good police officer.

876
01:17:01,911 --> 01:17:03,536
An honest man.

877
01:17:04,955 --> 01:17:06,664
We both grew up here.

878
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,959
Two years ago he was
murdered in the street

879
01:17:10,044 --> 01:17:11,795
right outside our door.

880
01:17:14,298 --> 01:17:18,051
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

881
01:17:20,387 --> 01:17:22,680
But everything
has a price.

882
01:17:25,392 --> 01:17:27,143
The people here
need a new start.

883
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:29,229
They need
to be free.

884
01:17:39,114 --> 01:17:40,740
You didn't kill
those men in the train,

885
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:42,700
did you?

886
01:17:47,248 --> 01:17:50,041
Now, why would you believe
anything I would tell you?

887
01:17:56,924 --> 01:17:58,216
Hey!

888
01:18:01,595 --> 01:18:03,304
Was she so special to you?

889
01:18:08,102 --> 01:18:10,436
I never thought anyone
could understand how much.

890
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:15,275
But you do.

891
01:18:38,465 --> 01:18:39,465
Yeah!

892
01:18:50,686 --> 01:18:51,978
Close, but not enough.

893
01:18:52,521 --> 01:18:54,105
Dom, the window
is too small, man.

894
01:18:54,189 --> 01:18:57,942
Only way we're going to beat the
cameras is with invisible cars.

895
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:03,031
And I know just where
to get them.

896
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,452
Let's take a ride, boys.

897
01:19:15,336 --> 01:19:17,378
Don't hurt yourself.

898
01:19:36,023 --> 01:19:38,399
It's been a while since I've been
behind the wheel of one of these.

899
01:19:38,692 --> 01:19:40,610
First time I've ever
been in the front seat.

900
01:19:48,369 --> 01:19:49,911
Rome, what took
you so long?

901
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:54,123
I thought for sure you'd be showing up
with some chrome spinners or something.

902
01:19:55,209 --> 01:19:56,209
Real funny.

903
01:19:57,711 --> 01:20:01,339
<i>I got $100,000 that says I can take</i>
<i>you all in the next quarter-mile.</i>

904
01:20:01,423 --> 01:20:02,966
Yeah, your broke ass
has got a hundred grand.

905
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:05,385
<i>If we pull off this job,</i>
<i>I will.</i>

906
01:20:05,761 --> 01:20:07,220
<i>The next two lights.</i>

907
01:20:07,513 --> 01:20:08,680
<i>Hundred thousand.</i>

908
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,433
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

909
01:20:12,977 --> 01:20:15,019
Let's make it a million.

910
01:20:15,896 --> 01:20:18,231
I like that. All right, a
million-dollar quarter-mile.

911
01:20:19,483 --> 01:20:21,025
All right, then.

912
01:20:21,318 --> 01:20:23,861
<i>You only live once.</i>
<i>Let's do it.</i>

913
01:20:24,363 --> 01:20:25,405
What do you say, Dom?

914
01:20:26,073 --> 01:20:27,532
We talking or we racing?

915
01:20:28,993 --> 01:20:30,076
Just don't cheat this time.

916
01:20:30,703 --> 01:20:33,329
Got to let that go.

917
01:20:51,932 --> 01:20:53,391
Yeah!

918
01:20:56,478 --> 01:20:57,562
Typical, Roman.

919
01:20:57,646 --> 01:21:00,106
I'm going to get
this money. I'm hungry.

920
01:21:08,407 --> 01:21:10,074
Don't make it too
easy for me, boys.

921
01:21:12,911 --> 01:21:13,911
No!

922
01:21:15,122 --> 01:21:16,873
Not this time, Dom.

923
01:21:21,712 --> 01:21:23,463
You got to want it, Brian.

924
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:55,495
Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

925
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,553
- Good race, O'Conner.
- Thanks, Dom.

926
01:22:14,515 --> 01:22:17,308
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for that shit?

927
01:22:17,392 --> 01:22:19,352
I told you
he didn't see it.

928
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:21,270
Your man right there?

929
01:22:21,355 --> 01:22:23,773
He let off the throttle
at the line.

930
01:22:23,857 --> 01:22:26,567
You didn't do nothing.
He let you win.

931
01:22:27,528 --> 01:22:29,237
Bullshit.

932
01:22:50,384 --> 01:22:53,177
- Vince, what are you doing?
- Quiet! They've been tracking you.

933
01:23:01,812 --> 01:23:02,895
I know she's here!

934
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:06,566
Find her!

935
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:08,276
Go! Go! Go!

936
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:24,333
It's okay. Wait!

937
01:23:24,418 --> 01:23:27,461
Reyes' guys were waiting
for me at the market.

938
01:23:28,422 --> 01:23:30,047
Vince saved my life.

939
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:36,929
You hungry?

940
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,518
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

941
01:23:44,271 --> 01:23:45,479
Because you're saying grace.

942
01:23:48,692 --> 01:23:50,109
Thanks, Vince.

943
01:23:57,242 --> 01:23:58,326
Yo, you burned it!

944
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:01,370
Yo, this is how my momma
does it. Relax.

945
01:24:01,455 --> 01:24:03,789
Yeah, but your mom is the
worst cook in the world.

946
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:06,751
Yo, don't you be talking
about my momma.

947
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:11,422
Yeah, come on, baby.
Who's good living?

948
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:13,633
- To you, bro.
- Cheers, cheers, cheers.

949
01:24:13,717 --> 01:24:15,968
So, we in Brazil.
It's the good life.

950
01:24:16,053 --> 01:24:17,053
Yeah.

951
01:24:17,137 --> 01:24:20,932
So, you got a little more
than $10 or $11 million coming.

952
01:24:21,016 --> 01:24:22,141
What you going to do
with your money?

953
01:24:22,226 --> 01:24:23,893
- Me?
- Yeah.

954
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:26,729
Actually, man, I been thinking
about opening up a garage back home.

955
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:30,483
Place where people can bring their
cars and not get completely ripped off.

956
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:31,692
You know what I mean?

957
01:24:31,777 --> 01:24:33,110
- Really?
- Yeah.

958
01:24:33,195 --> 01:24:36,072
So, your dream is
to start a day job?

959
01:24:36,156 --> 01:24:38,324
That's stupid.
Like, why would...

960
01:24:38,408 --> 01:24:40,993
No, it's not stupid at all.
I love what I do.

961
01:24:41,078 --> 01:24:42,078
That don't make
no sense to me.

962
01:24:42,162 --> 01:24:44,997
I know what I'm going
to do with my money.

963
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,918
Buying some cooking lessons
for my man.

964
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:50,878
See? See?

965
01:24:50,963 --> 01:24:53,256
There you go with
that negativity, man.

966
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,383
You know me.
Money ain't a goddamn thing.

967
01:24:55,467 --> 01:24:58,010
It's going to take a little more
than money to learn how to cook.

968
01:24:58,095 --> 01:24:59,345
That's horrible.

969
01:24:59,888 --> 01:25:03,557
But I heard they was looking for
a chef down at this animal shelter.

970
01:25:03,642 --> 01:25:04,725
You might want to...

971
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:06,519
I know the manager.

972
01:25:11,942 --> 01:25:13,609
Hey, Dom.

973
01:25:16,321 --> 01:25:17,822
Listen.

974
01:25:18,573 --> 01:25:22,285
I know that you're all set
for this job tomorrow,

975
01:25:22,369 --> 01:25:24,120
but if you need
an extra man, I could...

976
01:25:24,204 --> 01:25:25,538
You're in.

977
01:25:33,964 --> 01:25:35,506
There's always
room for family.

978
01:25:41,972 --> 01:25:43,014
Thank you.

979
01:25:47,602 --> 01:25:48,728
Get something to eat.

980
01:25:50,522 --> 01:25:52,148
Yeah.

981
01:25:54,026 --> 01:25:55,735
Can you believe
Mia calls this a curse?

982
01:25:59,531 --> 01:26:01,699
She might be right.

983
01:26:06,038 --> 01:26:08,497
You really like doing
that stuff, huh?

984
01:26:08,749 --> 01:26:13,002
When your life is on the line
that's when you learn about yourself.

985
01:26:17,966 --> 01:26:19,717
That's a fair deal.

986
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:27,141
We're less than 24 hours from the
biggest celebration of our life.

987
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:29,518
Y'all need a refill.
This is serious stuff.

988
01:26:29,603 --> 01:26:30,895
- No, I'm good.
- Cheers, baby.

989
01:26:30,979 --> 01:26:32,605
I'm good.
No, thank you.

990
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:33,689
No, she can't.

991
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:37,943
- What do you mean?
- She can't.

992
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:40,946
What do you mean
she can't? What is...

993
01:26:45,118 --> 01:26:47,370
Are you serious right now?

994
01:26:47,454 --> 01:26:51,165
Is that the reason you let him
beat you in the quarter-mile?

995
01:26:52,501 --> 01:26:55,753
- That was a baby gift.
- No, that's messed up.

996
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:57,421
No, you're not taking
that from me.

997
01:26:57,506 --> 01:26:59,131
Wait, wait,
hold on a second.

998
01:26:59,216 --> 01:27:03,511
So, did he just smack the ass
or did he grab and hold on to it?

999
01:27:03,887 --> 01:27:04,887
Which one was it?

1000
01:27:04,971 --> 01:27:07,473
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1001
01:27:07,599 --> 01:27:09,392
How can you keep
this a secret?

1002
01:27:09,476 --> 01:27:11,477
- Crazy, huh?
- It's your boy.

1003
01:27:11,603 --> 01:27:15,147
Why would you keep
something like that away from me?

1004
01:27:15,482 --> 01:27:17,274
Baby gift, huh?

1005
01:27:17,526 --> 01:27:20,361
- I have no idea what they're talking about.
- Oh?

1006
01:27:20,445 --> 01:27:23,447
What happened
to the pull-out method, man?

1007
01:27:24,533 --> 01:27:26,575
- Toast.
- Toast.

1008
01:27:34,918 --> 01:27:38,170
Money will come and go.
We know that.

1009
01:27:39,297 --> 01:27:42,675
But the most important thing in life
will always be the people in this room.

1010
01:27:44,094 --> 01:27:45,344
Right here.

1011
01:27:47,973 --> 01:27:49,014
Right now.

1012
01:28:03,613 --> 01:28:05,197
I'm all set.

1013
01:28:06,199 --> 01:28:09,201
Yo, Santos. Van good?

1014
01:28:10,287 --> 01:28:12,496
You know we're
always good, bro.

1015
01:28:16,376 --> 01:28:19,128
Hobbs is on the other side
of the city.

1016
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:21,797
We're not going
to get a better window.

1017
01:28:21,882 --> 01:28:24,133
Okay, guys,
it's show time!

1018
01:28:24,217 --> 01:28:25,801
First team in position,
let's go.

1019
01:28:25,886 --> 01:28:27,136
Come on, let's do this.

1020
01:28:39,441 --> 01:28:40,441
Hey, Dom.

1021
01:28:42,277 --> 01:28:43,402
I got eyes on Mia.

1022
01:28:48,408 --> 01:28:51,494
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.

1023
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,996
And what do they all
have in common?

1024
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,164
No extradition.

1025
01:28:57,250 --> 01:29:00,002
We're one hour away
from the rest of our lives.

1026
01:29:00,086 --> 01:29:01,378
Yeah.

1027
01:29:03,089 --> 01:29:04,089
Cops!

1028
01:29:06,676 --> 01:29:08,052
Come on. Go.

1029
01:29:19,648 --> 01:29:21,273
You just made a big mistake.

1030
01:29:22,776 --> 01:29:24,693
Took me a while to find
that tracking chip.

1031
01:29:25,195 --> 01:29:26,570
But not as long
to flip the receiver.

1032
01:29:26,655 --> 01:29:28,155
You're going down, Toretto.

1033
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:30,282
I'm right here.

1034
01:30:58,413 --> 01:31:00,414
- Dom!
- Stand back. I got this.

1035
01:31:06,338 --> 01:31:10,257
- Pull off!
- Dom! Please, stop!

1036
01:31:15,889 --> 01:31:16,889
Dom!

1037
01:31:26,066 --> 01:31:27,399
Dom!

1038
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:30,963
Yeah.

1039
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,299
We're coming in now.

1040
01:32:35,885 --> 01:32:38,554
Have the marshals meet us
at the airport when we land.

1041
01:32:46,438 --> 01:32:47,813
Ambush!

1042
01:33:05,457 --> 01:33:08,667
Wilkes, suppression fire.
Shut them down.

1043
01:33:12,881 --> 01:33:14,548
Stagger-step. Cover me.

1044
01:33:19,554 --> 01:33:20,596
Watch them!

1045
01:33:32,192 --> 01:33:33,275
Cut us loose!

1046
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:35,360
Come on! Cut us loose!

1047
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:35,188
- We're good?
- Yeah, let's go, let's go!

1048
01:36:08,473 --> 01:36:10,098
Hey, Dom.

1049
01:36:16,356 --> 01:36:18,523
You've got to meet my son.

1050
01:36:18,816 --> 01:36:20,567
Nico.

1051
01:36:25,323 --> 01:36:26,782
I will.

1052
01:36:29,702 --> 01:36:30,953
He's a good kid.

1053
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:37,417
You know,
we named him after you.

1054
01:36:39,212 --> 01:36:40,545
"Dominic."

1055
01:36:47,804 --> 01:36:49,805
You've got
my word, Vince.

1056
01:36:56,354 --> 01:36:58,438
You were
always my brother.

1057
01:37:08,074 --> 01:37:10,575
I got eyes on Nico now.

1058
01:37:21,254 --> 01:37:23,672
We need to move.
We don't have that much time.

1059
01:37:23,756 --> 01:37:24,881
I got us a flight out.

1060
01:37:24,966 --> 01:37:27,551
We can leave Rio in the
rearview in the next five hours.

1061
01:37:27,635 --> 01:37:29,428
Not to run away.

1062
01:37:30,847 --> 01:37:32,431
To finish the job.

1063
01:37:33,266 --> 01:37:35,684
Are you crazy, Dom?
We can't.

1064
01:37:36,269 --> 01:37:37,853
It's a suicide mission.

1065
01:37:38,938 --> 01:37:40,605
That's your man
over there on the table.

1066
01:37:41,983 --> 01:37:44,026
The plan is busted!

1067
01:37:44,318 --> 01:37:46,820
This is bullshit, man.
Reyes knows we're coming!

1068
01:37:46,904 --> 01:37:48,280
He's right.

1069
01:37:48,573 --> 01:37:51,366
They tripled the detail
at the police station.

1070
01:37:51,784 --> 01:37:54,036
It's going to be
a wall of gunfire.

1071
01:37:56,247 --> 01:37:58,331
Reyes doesn't get
away with this.

1072
01:37:58,624 --> 01:37:59,624
It's a trap, man.

1073
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:01,126
You know that.

1074
01:38:01,794 --> 01:38:04,129
Dom, listen to them.

1075
01:38:04,797 --> 01:38:07,382
Run, before it's
too late. Leave Rio.

1076
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,093
You can be free.

1077
01:38:12,263 --> 01:38:14,264
Running ain't freedom.

1078
01:38:15,725 --> 01:38:17,142
You should know that.

1079
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:24,649
You know you're all free
to make your own choices.

1080
01:38:28,863 --> 01:38:29,988
I'm in.

1081
01:38:39,373 --> 01:38:40,999
I'll ride with you,
Toretto.

1082
01:38:44,295 --> 01:38:46,838
At least until we kill
that son of a bitch.

1083
01:38:55,264 --> 01:38:56,848
So what's
the plan, Dom?

1084
01:38:57,683 --> 01:38:59,726
We can't just go
sneaking around anymore.

1085
01:39:01,229 --> 01:39:03,188
We don't sneak.

1086
01:39:03,981 --> 01:39:07,109
The only thing he cares
about is his money.

1087
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,693
We pull that,

1088
01:39:09,695 --> 01:39:11,113
we pull him.

1089
01:39:28,506 --> 01:39:29,548
See?

1090
01:39:30,716 --> 01:39:33,385
I called in every cop
on our payroll.

1091
01:39:34,887 --> 01:39:36,680
We're covered.

1092
01:39:38,391 --> 01:39:39,808
We've got every entrance
covered with weapons teams.

1093
01:39:39,892 --> 01:39:42,644
<i>God Himself couldn't</i>
<i>get at your money if He wanted to.</i>

1094
01:39:43,146 --> 01:39:47,482
God isn't my worry.

1095
01:39:57,243 --> 01:39:58,243
You ready?

1096
01:40:00,538 --> 01:40:01,538
I'm ready.

1097
01:40:59,889 --> 01:41:01,014
What's happening?

1098
01:41:01,098 --> 01:41:02,557
They're taking the vault!

1099
01:41:02,642 --> 01:41:04,309
- What?
- <i>The vault!</i>

1100
01:41:13,861 --> 01:41:17,113
Follow me! Quickly!

1101
01:41:21,452 --> 01:41:22,953
Let me through!

1102
01:41:33,005 --> 01:41:34,005
Don't move!

1103
01:41:35,216 --> 01:41:36,591
Stay down.

1104
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:07,956
Call it out, Mia!

1105
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,541
You've got a straight shot
for two blocks.

1106
01:42:11,043 --> 01:42:12,544
- Go right.
- Got it.

1107
01:42:34,942 --> 01:42:36,526
Well, the plan is working.

1108
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:41,489
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio
on your tail. You have to move fast.

1109
01:42:41,574 --> 01:42:42,657
What's the best route?

1110
01:42:42,742 --> 01:42:45,994
Okay, keep going straight another
half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,

1111
01:42:46,078 --> 01:42:47,996
<i>and then go left.</i>

1112
01:42:51,751 --> 01:42:52,792
That ain't going to work.

1113
01:42:54,879 --> 01:42:56,463
Spikes ahead, Dom.
We got spikes!

1114
01:42:56,881 --> 01:42:58,465
We're going right!

1115
01:42:59,842 --> 01:43:01,134
No, it's too tight,
we're not going to fit.

1116
01:43:01,218 --> 01:43:02,677
We've got no choice. Now!

1117
01:43:22,365 --> 01:43:23,531
Shit!

1118
01:43:30,164 --> 01:43:31,456
Holy shit!

1119
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:34,417
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.
Did you just take out a bank?

1120
01:43:43,469 --> 01:43:44,469
Two inbound!

1121
01:43:46,889 --> 01:43:48,348
All right, there's an alley
coming up on your left.

1122
01:43:48,432 --> 01:43:50,100
Yeah, I got it.

1123
01:44:43,487 --> 01:44:45,113
You little bastard!

1124
01:45:08,262 --> 01:45:10,972
All right, good job, Dom.
Right-hander, right here, right-hander.

1125
01:45:17,354 --> 01:45:19,397
Guys, there's a big group
coming at you from the south.

1126
01:45:19,482 --> 01:45:21,274
You have to do something now!

1127
01:45:24,153 --> 01:45:25,195
Hey, go wide.

1128
01:45:57,978 --> 01:45:58,978
Yeah!

1129
01:47:12,845 --> 01:47:14,137
You're all clear on the left.

1130
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:16,055
Good afternoon, officer!

1131
01:47:18,058 --> 01:47:20,476
License and registration,
please!

1132
01:47:26,692 --> 01:47:29,569
Yes! This is big-boy stuff!

1133
01:47:29,653 --> 01:47:31,070
We're clear on the right.

1134
01:47:31,322 --> 01:47:32,405
Oh, man.

1135
01:47:39,204 --> 01:47:40,246
Thanks, guys.

1136
01:47:40,623 --> 01:47:41,748
Any time.

1137
01:47:42,041 --> 01:47:43,625
I'll see you on
the other side.

1138
01:47:43,709 --> 01:47:46,002
You guys just carved out
a 10-second window.

1139
01:47:46,086 --> 01:47:47,545
<i>Make it count!</i>

1140
01:47:54,887 --> 01:47:56,054
Zizi, stay on them.

1141
01:48:22,581 --> 01:48:24,499
They can't outrun us
on the bridge.

1142
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,460
Shit.

1143
01:48:34,551 --> 01:48:35,760
They have no way out.

1144
01:48:37,763 --> 01:48:38,763
No!

1145
01:48:39,598 --> 01:48:40,682
There's too many of them.

1146
01:48:40,766 --> 01:48:42,725
Hey, there's too many of them.
We're not going to make it.

1147
01:48:46,438 --> 01:48:47,438
You're right, we aren't.

1148
01:48:48,732 --> 01:48:49,691
You are.

1149
01:48:49,775 --> 01:48:51,067
What are you talking about?

1150
01:48:51,276 --> 01:48:53,695
Just let the vault go.
Get out of there.

1151
01:48:53,779 --> 01:48:55,488
You're a father now, Brian.

1152
01:48:55,572 --> 01:48:57,740
No, I'm not leaving you.
Now you stick with the plan!

1153
01:48:58,450 --> 01:48:59,826
It was always the plan.

1154
01:49:00,577 --> 01:49:01,869
<i>Take care of Mia.</i>

1155
01:49:01,954 --> 01:49:04,372
Dom, you listen
to me now. Okay?

1156
01:49:04,456 --> 01:49:06,290
<i>You cut loose right now.</i>

1157
01:49:23,642 --> 01:49:24,684
Hey, what is he doing?

1158
01:49:28,647 --> 01:49:29,772
We've got him!

1159
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:47,874
Close down the bridge!

1160
01:50:22,117 --> 01:50:23,493
<i>Do something, asshole!</i>

1161
01:50:35,589 --> 01:50:36,714
Kill him, dammit!

1162
01:50:48,101 --> 01:50:49,560
Kill him now!

1163
01:52:01,258 --> 01:52:03,968
I thought I told you
to go on.

1164
01:52:05,929 --> 01:52:08,139
Yeah, I had
to make a call.

1165
01:52:25,741 --> 01:52:27,158
Help me.

1166
01:52:29,536 --> 01:52:31,537
That's for my team,
you son of a bitch.

1167
01:52:35,709 --> 01:52:37,418
It's a hell of a mess.

1168
01:52:38,128 --> 01:52:39,754
Yeah, it is.

1169
01:52:41,256 --> 01:52:43,007
You know I can't
let you two go.

1170
01:52:43,508 --> 01:52:45,092
I ain't made that way.

1171
01:52:47,846 --> 01:52:50,514
The way I see it, you've
earned yourselves 24 hours.

1172
01:52:51,683 --> 01:52:52,683
The money stays, though.

1173
01:52:54,019 --> 01:52:56,187
If I were you,
I'd use the time.

1174
01:52:56,521 --> 01:52:59,523
Make peace with whatever
demons you got left.

1175
01:53:03,987 --> 01:53:05,863
Because come tomorrow,

1176
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:08,366
I will find you.

1177
01:53:20,212 --> 01:53:21,504

No, you won't.

Thanks, guys.

You know I am.

You don't need to do this.

1192
01:56:47,502 --> 01:56:49,837
Just leave me alone.

1193

Bro, I'm not trying to
be negative, but casinos

1194
01:56:52,174 --> 01:56:54,884

- Yes, yes.

No, no. Not in this.

Man, this is crazy!

Yes, I guess that means there are
two in the Western Hemisphere, huh?
