00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,754
Hi, guys. Um, I am Tom Holland.

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:07,007
I'm joined today by Tobey Maguire
and Andrew Garfield.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,594
We just wanted to take a moment
to say a massive thank you

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,263
for all of your continued love
and support for this film.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,433
While we were making this film,
I think I can speak on behalf of all of us

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,478
that we knew that we had our hands
on something really special.

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,563
But I don't think
we could ever have imagined

8
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,774
it would have been received
as well as it has been.

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,567
So thank you so much.

10
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:29,154
We are just incredibly grateful
that you guys are here for it.

11
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,949
Thank you to everybody
for supporting this movie.

12
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:36,787
I got to show up with these guys
and have a beautiful experience.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,665
-Andrew, we have something to tell you.
-What?

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,876
It's important to both of us
that you know this. Okay?

15
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,045
-We love you.
-We love you.

16
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,173
About time. I've been waiting months.

17
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,676
I've been waiting months
since that day in Atlanta.

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,094
-I had it in here.
-Yeah.

19
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,638
It took every part of me not to say that.

20
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,098
This was worth the wait,

21
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,643
and I will wait for you guys
for centuries.

22
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,605
[Kiernan on TV] We come to you
now with revelations

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,860
about last week's attack in London.
An anonymous source provided this video.

24
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:12,739
It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio,
moments before his death.

25
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,741
You may find this video disturbing.

26
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,327
[Mysterio] I managed to send the Elemental
back through the rift,

27
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,621
but I don't think
I'm gonna make it off this bridge alive.

28
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,873
Spider-Man attacked me.

29
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,458
He has an army of drones,
Stark technology.

30
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,212
He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man. No one else.

31
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,548
[Edith] Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?

32
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,508
There will be significant casualties.

33
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,552
[Spider-Man] Do it. Execute them all.

34
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,263
[explosions booming]

35

37
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,273
[Jameson on TV] There you have it, folks:
Conclusive proof

38
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,319
that Spider-Man was responsible
for the brutal murder of Mysterio,

39
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,822
an interdimensional warrior
who gave his life to protect our planet

40
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:59,453
and who will, no doubt, go down in history
as the greatest superhero of all time.

41
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,747
But that's not all, folks.

42
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,248
Here's the real blockbuster.

43
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,042

-You helped him?
-[Spider-Man] I didn't--

He hit me.

[Jameson] All this time, people looked up
to this boy and called him a hero.

60
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,376
Well, I'll tell you what I call him,

[cameras clicking]

152
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,879
I didn't kill Quentin Beck.
The drones did, okay?

153
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,798
-The drones that are yours.
-No.

154
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,175
Nick Fury was there the entire time.

155
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,969
He can explain everything.

156
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,847
Nick Fury has been off-planet
for the last year.

157
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,807
-What?
-[MJ] Peter! Hey.

158

MJ! Uh-- They have nothing
to do with this, sir.

159

[both] Don't say anything
without a lawyer.

160

-Jones. I don't go by Watson.

162
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:26,029
-Ms Jones, why do you want a lawyer if--?
-If I have nothing to hide?

163
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,406
Exactly. Unless--

164
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,283
-I'm actually guilty of something?
-Uh-huh.

165
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,410
I'm very aware of your tactics
and my rights.

166
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,954
Just answer my questions.

167
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,747
I've seen your file.

168
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,959
You're a smart young woman
with a bright future ahead of her.

169
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,586
Why would you risk it all

170
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,047
by getting involved
with a vigilante like Peter Parker?

171
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,091
Washington Monument,

172
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,093

Tower Bridge!

174
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,972
You know,
if I didn't know any better, Peter,

175
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,225
it's kind of like
your enemy is national landmarks.

176

[door opens]

[Cleary] So sorry to keep you waiting.

-Can we get Ned a snack?
-Absolutely.

179
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,026
-He's been waiting.
-I got you.

180
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,736
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

181
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,114
-I'm not supposed to say anything to you.
-Not even a thing.

182
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:13,076
I just have one question.
When MJ told you Peter was Spider-Man--

183
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,161
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

184
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,455
-What's up?
-I knew way before MJ did.

185
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,041
-I was Spider-Man's "guy in the chair."
-I know about those.

186
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,376
-Dude, half my guys are guys in the chair.
-Exactly.

187
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,838
You would know.
I literally helped him find the Vulture.

188
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,174
-I didn't know that.
-I helped him hack a suit once

189
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,717
and helped him get to space.

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,929
So in Spider-Man's illegal vigilantism,
you were his main accomplice.

191
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,977
I would like to have
my words stricken from the record.

192
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:44,066
So if you did your job, I wouldn't have
to be on the boat saving people's lives.

193
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,902
I climbed up the side
of the Washington Monument.

194
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,655
Okay, now we're getting to some facts.

195
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,782
Tell me everything you know
about the Night Monkey.

196
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,116
Here's the funny thing about the law.

197
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,869
It's usually not open
to random self-interest interpretation.

198
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,331
Though you and I both know that hasn't
stopped people like you from trying.

199
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:03,418
So with all due respect,
and I mean that very insincerely,

200
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,588
unless you have
some real specific charges to throw at us,

201
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,215
legally, you can't hold us here.

202
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,843
Sounds like someone
who's been through the system before.

203
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:14,221
I've been arrested at a couple
of protests. I'm a real career criminal.

204
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:18,809
You should lawyer up.
Child endangerment's a nasty rap.

205
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,143
Excuse me?

206
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,395
A boy was entrusted to you,

207
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,856
and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

208
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:28,110
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself, you encouraged it.

209
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,862
Who does that?

210
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,239
I wanna see Peter right now.

[Kiernan on TV] Stark Industries
was caught in the web

212
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,744
of the Spider-Man/Mysterio
controversy today,

213
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,330
when federal agents opened
an investigation

into missing Stark technology.

against you are gonna stick.

-I advise securing a lawyer.

I could say under advisement of counsel,

I refuse to answer
the question respectfully

235

because the answer can incriminate me--

It's in Goodfellas.

You're gonna need a really good lawyer.

I have a weird question. Um...

304
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,394
Does any part of you
feel relieved about this?

305
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,233
[in normal voice]
Ever since I got bit by that spider...

306
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:41,280
I've only had one week
where my life has felt normal.

307
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,824
Or kind of normal, I guess.

308
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,242
And...

309
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,245
that was when you found out.

310
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:52,958
Because then everyone that was in my life
that I wanted to know knew.

311
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,084
And it was perfect.

312
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,253
But now everybody knows and...

313
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:01,466
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

314
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,136
And I'm still broke.

315
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,057
I'm...

316
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,060
excited to see you tomorrow.

317
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,439
Yeah. Me too.

318
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,773
[Happy] Wrap it up.

319
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,942
You both like each other.
We get it. Hang up.

320
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,528
There's no new ground being broken.
I need my eight hours.

321
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,906
-Have you been listening this whole time?
-Hi, Happy.

322
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,199
Uh, not by choice.

323
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,492
-MJ says hi.
-Hello.

324
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,328
It's back to school, folks.

325
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:33,248
And in their infinite wisdom,
Mayor Dingus and the city clown-cil

326
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,793
are welcoming back the town's
most notorious costumed killer--

327
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,253
Peter Parker.

328
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,882
Go get them, tiger!
Or should I say "spider"?

329
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,427
[reporter 1] The crowd has continued
to grow here all morning long

330
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,513
at the Midtown School of Science...

331
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,558
[reporter 2] The crowd seems evenly
divided between supporters of Spider-Man

332
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,643
and protestors.

333
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,436
[man 1] MJ!

334
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,772
MJ! MJ! We love you!

335
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,274
MJ, are you gonna have his spider-babies?

336
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,443
Back up. Back up. Back up!

337
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,655
[man 1]
MJ, you know he's a murderer, right?

338
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,365
[boy] Peter, do a TikTok with me.

339
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,492
[man 2] Mysterio forever!

340
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,618
[man 3] Do a flip!

341
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,287
-Hey, let's see you and MJ kiss!
-[Ned] Back off.

342
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,539
Who are you?

343
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,291
-Ned Leeds. Spider-Man's best friend.
-I'm Peter Parker's best friend.

344
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,961
You come at my boy,
you come at Flash Thompson.

345
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,088
If you wanna read
about our inspiring friendship,

346
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,257
you can in my new book, Flashpoint.

347
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,051
One spider, two hearts,
a million crazy-ass memories.

348
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,386
Check it out.

349

-[metal detector whirrs]
-[cell phone chiming]

350
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,598
-Go.
-No, I gotta wait--

351
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:34,017
-[guard] No. Go.
-I'll see you inside, okay?

352
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,896
Keep watching Midtown News all year

353
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,982
as we bring you up-close
and personal coverage

354
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:43,151
of Peter fighting his biggest battle yet:

355
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,778
College admissions.

356
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:49,950
Peter,

357
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:54,413
we would love to welcome you
back to Midtown High,

358
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,123
where we shape heroes.

359
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,083
-Uh-huh.
-Or murderers.

360
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,168
-Stop it.
-Huh?

361
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,921
-It's an honour to serve you, sir.
-It's not.

362
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,339
Mysterio was right.

363
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:06,133
-Stop. That's all.
-Mysterio was right.

364
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,844
Some students put this together for you.

365
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,722
-No, you did that.
-[Harrington] I helped a little bit.

366
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,725
[Wilson] And I tried to stop you
so many times, but you powered through.

367
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,268
-He did all of that.
-Did a great job.

368
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,770
I hope you have time to check it out.

369
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,565
Feel free to walk
or swing through the hallway.

370
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,901
Or crawl on the ceiling
to avoid everybody.

371
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,403
-We all know you can do it.
-I'm just gonna...

372
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,906
-I know what you did.
-Stop. You're embarrassing yourself.

373
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,616
He's a conspiracy theorist.

374

[dramatic music playing]

[cameras clicking]

376
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,467
We were lab partners. Did you know that?

377
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,384
[Wilson] Climb it!

378
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:53,889
Climb it! Climb it! Climb it!

379
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,892
[class continues chanting]

380
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,776
[chanting stops]

381
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,115
Look at that sticky bastard go.

382
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:13,784
[female student] Freak!

383
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,912
[Flash] I'm where he gets
all his best ideas.

384
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,747
That's why he calls me his Spidey mentor.

385
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,666
Peter! Good to see you, bud!
I'll see you later!

386
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,042
[clamouring]

387
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,087
Oh, my God, he's so cute!

388
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,590
[Betty] What's it like
being Spider-Man's teacher?

389
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:32,553
[Harrington] Well, Peter's always been
more than a student to me.

390
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:37,516
He's been more like a son.
Who's also my little brother.

391
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,476
[Betty] So, what do you think about

392
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,355
these crazy Mysterio conspiracy theories
that are spreading online?

393
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,649
There's a conspiracy theory that

394
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,527
Justin Timberlake was in NSYNC
at one time.

395
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,655
And then you look it up,
and, oh, he was in NSYNC.

396
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,908
My ex-wife, for example,
she's been spending a lot of time online.

397
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:57,494
And, you know,
the Internet is a wild place

398
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:01,415
that really beckons people like her
who are a little lost

399
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,418
and kind of have forgotten
where they came from and who they are

400
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,753
and that they love someone very much.

401
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,632
Sometimes you just forget these things
and you end up in a subreddit,

402
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,051
believing in Mysterio.

403
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,388
Sorry, what was your question?

404
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,808
[Betty] So you never noticed he had
extraordinary athletic abilities?

405
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,477
I mean, it's a science school,

406
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,023
so two push-ups is
extraordinary athletic abilities.

407
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:30,110
In your book, you revealed
that the name "Spider-Man" was your idea.

408
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:34,281
Were there any others that you tossed
around before settling on "Spider-Man"?

409
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,991
Yeah, uh, there were a few.

410
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,619
You know, "Arachnokid." "The Bitten."

411
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:42,539
When I think about it, there were times
that he was sticking to the wall,

412
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,709
or he had this stuff coming out
of his wrist.

413
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,378
But I didn't really
think much of it. I just...

414
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,008
I've been doing this a long time.
It's just a lot of kids.

415
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:56,845
I noticed that in your book
I'm not mentioned once.

416
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:00,390
No. No, I'm pretty sure you are. Uh...

417
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,476
I mean, you're...

418
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,436
Whoa, there are pictures in this?

419
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,480
If that spider had bitten me,

420
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,149
we'd be talking about
a different Spider-Man right now.

421
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:13,111
I think I would have maybe had
a different style costume.

422
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,489
Maybe something with flared legs, maybe.

423
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:16,532
As sexy as possible.

424
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:19,326
So, what is an appropriate text to send

425
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,537
to an ex-girlfriend
in the middle of the night?

426
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,001
You look great, by the way.

427
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:31,839
Thank you. You look as beautiful as ever.
[clears throat]

428
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,716
[Betty] What do you say
to the people who claim

429
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,719
that you're not really friends
with Peter Parker?

430
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,851
You know, it hurts.

431
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:44,935
Because...

432
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,355
You know, I...

433
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,523
Tell me:

434
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:53,485
If the spider that gave you
your powers were here right now,

435
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,445
what would you say?

436
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:59,825
Would you say, "Thanks"?
Or, "Thanks for nothing"?

437
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,743
I would say "Thanks."

438
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:03,829
"For nothing"?

439
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,039
You can catch the rest
of my exclusive interview

440
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:09,710
with Peter Parker today at lunch,
only on MNN.

441
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:13,338
Up next, Lady Liberty is getting
a makeover,

442
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,674
and some of Midtown High's
very own artists share

443
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,260
their ideas of what she should look like.

444
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,721
We'll be right back
after this important message

445
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:23,473
from Principal Morita
about cafeteria safety.

446
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,396
[Peter] Can we just stay up here all day?

447
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,191
-It is so crazy down there.
-[MJ] This one's good.

448
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,360
"Some suggest that Parker's powers
include the male spider's ability

449
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,070
to hypnotise females,

450
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:41,533
which he used to seduce Jones-Watson
into his cult of personality."

451
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,327
Stop. Stop.

452
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,995
Yes, my Spider-Lord.

453
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,214
[Ned] Finally, some privacy.

454
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,007
It is so crazy down there.

455
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,468
So I was thinking...

456
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:03,472
when we get into MIT,
we should live together.

457
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,516
-Yeah, for sure.

-So my aunt May?
-Yes.

617
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,959
Oh. Thank you. Happy?

618
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,252
No, I'm annoyed.

No, it's a nickname. Harold "Happy" Hogan.

620
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,506
He used to work with Tony Stark,
but then he was...

621
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,258
Would you just stop talking?

-Did it work?
-No.

630
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,629
You changed my spell six times.

631
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,339
-Five times.
-You changed my spell.

632
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:23,759
You don't do that! I told you.
And that is why.

633
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,512
That spell was out of control.
If I hadn't shut it down,

634
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,931
something catastrophic
could have happened.

-Call me "sir."

Sorry, sir.

we've been through,

somehow I always forget you're just a kid.

639
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,906
Look, Parker, the problem is not Mysterio.

640
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,242
It's you trying
to live two different lives.

641
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,786
And the longer you do that,
the more dangerous it becomes.

642
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:52,079
Believe me.

643
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:55,999
I'm so sorry about you
and your friends not getting into college,

644
00:31:56,083 --> 00:32:00,712
but if they rejected you and you tried
to convince them to reconsider,

645
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,965
there's nothing else you can do.

646
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,053
When you say "convince them,"

647
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,764
-you mean, I could have called them?
-Yeah.

648
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,391
I could do that?

649
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:15,811
You haven't called the...?

650
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,646
I got their letter. I assumed that was--

651
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:18,856
I'm sorry.

652
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:20,691
Are you telling me

653
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:24,027
that you didn't even think
to plead your case with them first

654
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:27,865
before you asked me
to brainwash the entire world?

655
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:32,536
When you put it like that...

656
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:41,962
Come on, pick up, pick up.

657

Dude, what? I'm busy.

658
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:45,090
Flash, where's the MIT mixer?

659
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,009
-Why?
-Because I need to talk to someone.

660
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,344
I'm trying to get Ned and MJ
a second chance at getting in.

What's in it for me?

00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,431
I'm risking a lot just talking to you.

663
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:54,558
Okay, I will, um...

664
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:58,228
pick you up and swing you
to school for one week?

665

For a month.

-For a week.
-Two weeks.

667
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,775
-Flash, please. Help me.
-You know what I want.

668
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,863
Okay, I'll tell everyone
you're my best friend.

669
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,907
-Flash, please, help me.
-Cool.

670

There's the assistant vice chancellor.
You can plead your case with her.

-Okay, perfect. Where is she?
-She left.

00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,622
-To go where?
-To the airport.

I really needed to talk to you and I know
you're on your way to the airport.

691
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:30,487
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are
the two smartest people I've ever met,

692
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,947
and I'm the dumbest person

so please don't let MIT be dumb like me.

MIT is dumb?

No, I'm saying, don't let MIT be dumb.

that wouldn't have let them help.

-Who are you? And where am I?

I think it's better we don't engage
with them because, frankly,

792
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:49,426
the multiverse is a concept
about which we know frighteningly little.

I detected an otherworldly presence.

I pursued it into the sewers,
where I found that...

1240
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,979
-[in normal voice] You gotta take it.
-Wait, what?

1241
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:10,399
If something bad happens,
you just push this and then it's over.

1242
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:12,277
We're not gonna leave you.

1243
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:13,612
You can't. It's dangerous.

1244
01:09:13,694 --> 01:09:15,697
-You have done enough.
-We're in this together.

1245
01:09:15,781 --> 01:09:19,326
I know we're in this together, Ned,
but I can't do this if you're in danger.

1246
01:09:19,408 --> 01:09:22,162
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

1247
01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:27,042
-Please.
-Fine.

1248
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:28,961
-[Peter] Thank you.
-But, Peter,

1249
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:31,296
if I don't hear from you,
I'm pressing the button.

1250
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,590
-Sure.
-Okay. And I will do it.

1251
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,718
Yeah, we all believe you, Michelle.

1252
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:39,680
No way that's his girlfriend. No way.

1253
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:42,390
-She'll do it.
-Absolutely, she will.

1254
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:46,645
-Okay. See you later.
-Be safe.

1255
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:47,938
-[Peter] You too.
-Okay.

1256
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:50,899
[both] Whoa.

1257
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:52,984
Okay.

1258
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:56,738
-Be careful, okay?
-Yeah. You too.

1259
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,659
[dramatic music playing]

1260
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:05,539
So, uh...

1261
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:08,458
who's coming with me?

1262
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:13,589
Well, I'm in.

1263
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:16,717
But if this goes sideways...

1264
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:19,970
I'm gonna fry you from the inside out.

1265
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:35,277
My client has nothing to do
with the missing technology.

1266
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,487
He's a law-abiding citizen.
He has nothing to hide.

1267
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,031
That's right.

1268
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:40,240
[cell phone buzzing]

1269
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:47,080
[dramatic music playing]

1270
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:55,797
-Where's Connors?
-[May] He wants to stay in the truck.

1271
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:58,675
-[Peter] Okay.
-[man] Mr Hogan, is something wrong?

1272
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,011
[whispers] Happy.

1273
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:04,181
Stop sweating.

1274
01:11:05,057 --> 01:11:06,225
How do you do that?

1275
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:10,103
-Yeah?
-I feel bad using Happy's place like this.

1276
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:12,189
No, no, no. He'll get over it.

1277
01:11:13,065 --> 01:11:16,151
[reporter on TV] New Yorkers oppose
the Statue of Liberty renovation...

1278
01:11:16,235 --> 01:11:17,069
Oh, sorry.

1279
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:20,197
So this is your plan, Peter? Hmm?

1280
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,615
No lab, no facilities?

1281
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:24,409
Just performing miracles
in a condominium? Hmm?

1282
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:27,704
What, you gonna cook us some cures
and some frozen burritos in a microwave?

1283
01:11:27,788 --> 01:11:30,791
-I could go for a burrito.
-He's gonna kill us all.

1284
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:32,167
Well, let's hope not.

1285
01:11:32,918 --> 01:11:35,045
-You're up first, Doc.
-What?

1286
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,713
Hey, I told you, I don't need fixing.

1287
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:39,550
I don't need fixing!

1288
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:43,971
Especially by a teenager using scraps
from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1289
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:46,640
Nah, nah, nah.
He got something back there.

1290
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:49,518
I can feel it. That weird energy.

1291
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:53,522
-What the hell is that?
-It's a fabricator.

1292
01:11:54,147 --> 01:11:57,651
It can analyse, design,
construct basically anything.

1293
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,904
I thought that was
the tanning bed Happy broke.

1294
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:04,825
Look at that.

1295
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:13,667
He's gonna kill us all.

1296
01:12:21,758 --> 01:12:22,885
Oh!

1297
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:24,303
What's going on there?

1298
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:28,098
[Peter] So the chip in the back of Doc's
neck was designed to protect his brain

1299
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:32,227
from the AI system that's controlling
these tentacles, but if you look here...

1300
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:35,105
the chip is fried.

1301
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:37,441
So rather than him being
in control of the tentacles,

1302
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:39,610
the tentacles are now in control of him.

1303
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:44,781
Which, I guess, explains why
he is so miserable all the time.

1304
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:48,702
But, if you look here,
if I can introduce self--

1305
01:12:48,785 --> 01:12:51,705
Self-healing composite circuitry.

1306
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:56,752
Exactly. So, theoretically,
I mean, if this were to work,

1307
01:12:56,835 --> 01:12:58,795
he would go back to the way he was.

1308
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:08,013
Thirsty?

1309
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:12,726
Well, yes, I am thirsty.

1310
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:14,937
Fresh water or salt?

1311
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:17,773
You know, because you're an octopus.

1312
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:20,817
What?

1313
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:23,612
Fresh water it is.

1314
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:25,906
Look at this place.

1315
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:29,993
-And all the possibilities.
-What, this condo?

1316
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:33,163
Yeah, yeah, the condo.
I love the whole open floor plan. No.

1317
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:35,457
Nah, man, I'm talking about the world.

1318
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:38,335
I kind of like who I am here.

1319
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:41,839
And all that power back there...

1320
01:13:43,006 --> 01:13:44,508
I could be so much more.

1321
01:13:45,759 --> 01:13:46,969
So why'd you come along?

1322
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:49,847
I have a daughter, and I want to see her.

1323
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:52,057
But he's not gonna send anyone home

1324
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,977
till he's finished
his little science project back there.

1325
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:56,770
You trust him?

1326
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:58,146
I don't trust anyone.

1327
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:01,733
-How'd you end up like that, anyway?
-Oh.

1328
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:04,903
The place where I worked at,

1329
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:09,741
they were experimenting with electricity
created by living organisms, and then...

1330
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:12,953
I fell into a vat of electric eels.

1331
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:16,039
You're kidding.
I fell into a supercollider.

1332
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:16,957
Damn.

1333
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,751
Gotta be careful where you fall.

1334
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:21,962
Remarkable.

1335
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:25,841
The technology and you.

1336
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,012
When all this is over,

1337
01:14:30,762 --> 01:14:35,267
if you need a job and you're willing
to commute to another universe...

1338
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:44,776
It worked. That totally worked!

1339
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:48,071
-I got it. I did it. Will you send him up?
-[May] Here we go.

1340
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:51,283
-Sorry.
-[May] Hold on, Doc.

1341
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:53,952
Oh, will these humiliations never cease?

1342
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:57,039
You, keep your science-fair project
away from me!

1343
01:14:57,122 --> 01:14:58,749
It'll work. Have faith.

1344
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:01,835
Says the reckless fool
who turned himself into a monster.

1345
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:04,963
[Peter] Please stop moving your head.

1346
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:08,509
-Hold still.
-Don't you dare. [grunting]

1347
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:16,683
[groans] I swear, when I get out of this,
we're gonna rip you a new--

1348
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,018
[powers down]

1349
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:22,189
Doc?

1350
01:15:28,111 --> 01:15:28,946
Doc?

1351
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:31,907
Doc?

1352
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:36,119
-Dr Octav--
-[panting]

1353
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:42,376
It's so quiet.

1354
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:49,132
Those voices inside my head...

1355
01:15:54,513 --> 01:15:55,806
I'd almost forgotten.

1356
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:57,266
[poignant music playing]

1357
01:15:57,349 --> 01:15:58,308
Otto.

1358
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:01,395
Yes. Norman.

1359
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:08,944
It's me.

1360
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:12,531
Would you look at that?

1361
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:36,263
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1362
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:37,639
Yeah, you're welcome.

1363
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:39,474
How can I help?

1364
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:42,352
[Peter on voicemail]
This is Peter. Leave a message.

1365
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:43,687
[beep plays on voicemail]

1366
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,899
Yeah, Peter, this is Happy.
I accessed my doorbell camera.

1367
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:49,193
Who are those guys, huh? Is that a cyborg?

1368
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:51,653
You bring a cyborg
with robot legs into my house?

1369
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:54,239
Was one of the guys made of mud?
What's going on? Call me.

1370
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:04,958
[Octavius] How does it feel, Norman?

1371
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:07,794
You're about to become whole again.

1372
01:17:09,296 --> 01:17:10,923
No more darker half.

1373
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:12,758
Just you.

1374
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:15,010
[Osborn] Just me.

1375
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:25,521
[Peter] Okay. Um...

1376
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:28,565
It just goes right here. This...

1377
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:29,650
[device beeps]

1378
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,902
That should be drawing power now.

1379
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:35,697
I'll come back in a second to check on it,
but keep an eye on the lights.

1380
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:38,700
When they're all green,
the electricity in your body's dissipated.

1381
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:42,538
Well, not all of the electricity. You need
electricity for your brain to function.

1382
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:43,997
Your nervous system is...

1383
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:46,875
I'm not really sure
why I'm explaining electricity to you.

1384
01:17:46,959 --> 01:17:49,795
-Hmm. Yeah, can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

1385
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:51,004
Are these your Legos?

1386
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:53,048
[computer beeps]

1387
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:55,300
Uh, I gotta go. I'll be back.

1388
01:17:59,847 --> 01:18:01,098
[sighs]

1389
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:03,684
-Something feels off.
-[Sandman] What do you mean?

1390
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:07,187
-I don't like this.
-Leave it alone.

1391
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:11,108
The sooner you guys get through this,
the sooner we go home.

1392
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:12,359
[device beeps]

1393
01:18:12,442 --> 01:18:13,735
[tyres screech]

1394
01:18:18,949 --> 01:18:21,243
-Well, where is he?

I'm gonna press it.

-What? No, he--
-I know he told me to wait...

1559

-but I'm gonna do it.
-I just wish--

1560
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:43,921
I just wish we could see him.

1561
01:31:49,218 --> 01:31:50,302
-Ned?
-Yeah?

1562
01:31:51,345 --> 01:31:52,763
-Do that again.
-Yeah.

1563
01:31:55,224 --> 01:31:56,475
I just wish we could see him.

01:32:00,395 --> 01:32:01,230
Okay.

01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,815
I just wish we could see Peter.

Is that him?

01:32:15,577 --> 01:32:17,955
-Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
-Peter. Peter!

[screaming]

1574
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,092
Hi. Hi.

1575
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:33,262
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1576
01:32:35,931 --> 01:32:37,266
Okay.

1577
01:32:39,852 --> 01:32:42,396
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm Peter Parker.

1578
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:46,650
-That's not possible.
-I am Spider-Man, in my world.

1579
01:32:46,733 --> 01:32:49,820
But then yesterday, I was--

1580
01:32:51,572 --> 01:32:53,365
I was just here.

1581
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:56,201
Wow.

1582
01:32:57,828 --> 01:33:01,331
String theory, multidimensional reality...

1583
01:33:02,624 --> 01:33:04,126
and matter displacement.

1584

All real?

1585
01:33:05,794 --> 01:33:06,795
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1586
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:08,088
I knew it.

1587
01:33:09,798 --> 01:33:11,592
This has to be because of the spell.

1588
01:33:12,217 --> 01:33:13,969
The spell? Like magic spell?

1589
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:15,888
-Uh, there's no spell. No.
-No spell.

1590
01:33:15,971 --> 01:33:17,723
-Magic's real here too?
-I mean--

1591
01:33:17,806 --> 01:33:20,225
-Shut up, Ned. Shut up.
-No, it's not real.

1592
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:22,853
-There's magicians, but there's no--
-Stop talking.

1593
01:33:22,936 --> 01:33:24,605
Stop. Stop.

1594
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:26,732
-Prove it.
-Prove what?

1595
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:30,194
-That you're Peter Parker.
-I don't carry an ID with me, you know?

1596
01:33:30,277 --> 01:33:32,696
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1597
01:33:35,365 --> 01:33:37,534
-Why'd you do that?
-To see if you have the tingle thing.

1598
01:33:37,618 --> 01:33:39,578
I have the tingle thing,
just not for bread.

1599
01:33:39,661 --> 01:33:41,663
Can you not throw the bread again?

1600
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:43,999
You're a deeply mistrusting person...

1601
01:33:45,709 --> 01:33:46,752
and I respect it.

1602
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:53,258
Crawl around.

1603
01:33:53,342 --> 01:33:55,260
-Crawl around?
-[MJ] Yes.

1604
01:33:55,344 --> 01:33:56,929
-No.
-Yes, crawl around.

1605
01:33:57,012 --> 01:33:58,680
-Why do I need to?
-[MJ] This is not enough.

1606
01:33:58,764 --> 01:34:00,015
-This is plenty.
-No, it's not.

1607
01:34:00,098 --> 01:34:01,767
-Yes, it is. It is.
-No, it's not. Nuh-uh.

1608
01:34:01,850 --> 01:34:04,394
-How do I stick to the ceiling?
-[MJ] Do it.

Ned. [speaking Tagalog]

1610
01:34:12,694 --> 01:34:16,114
My lola's asking
if you could just get the cobweb there.

1611
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:18,075
-Since you're, like, up there.
-Yeah.

1612
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:26,959
Thank you.

1613
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:32,714
We--

1614
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:34,174
We good?

1615
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:35,175
For now.

1616
01:34:35,926 --> 01:34:38,846
So I opened the wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1617
01:34:38,929 --> 01:34:41,223
I guess you keep doing it
until we find the real one.

1618
01:34:41,306 --> 01:34:43,225
-Ouch.
-No offence.

1619
01:34:43,892 --> 01:34:45,435
-[Ned] Okay.
-Okay. You got it.

1620
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:49,147
Find Peter Parker.

1621
01:34:49,231 --> 01:34:51,275
-What's the thing on his hand?
-Shh.

1622
01:34:51,358 --> 01:34:53,360
Find Peter Parker.

1623
01:34:55,362 --> 01:34:56,905
Find Peter Parker!

[suspenseful music playing]

Great, it's just some random guy.

1626
01:35:08,625 --> 01:35:09,501
Hello.

1627
01:35:10,002 --> 01:35:12,629
Um, I hope it's okay,
I just came through this, uh...

1628
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:15,507
Oh. It just closed.

1629
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:18,302
You're Peter?

1630
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:21,305
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1631
01:35:23,432 --> 01:35:25,100
I've seen you two--

1632
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:28,395
Hi.

1633
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:35,277
Wait. He's-- He's not your friend.

1634
01:35:48,457 --> 01:35:49,625
Huh.

1635
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:54,379
Wait. So you're Spider-Man too?
Why didn't you just say that?

1636
01:35:54,463 --> 01:35:56,965
I generally don't go around
advertising it.

1637
01:35:57,049 --> 01:35:59,134
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1638

-I just said that.
-That's what he just said.

-Yes, of course.

Uh, this might seem kind of weird,

1645
01:36:25,953 --> 01:36:28,580
but I've been trying to find
your friend ever since I got here.

1646
01:36:30,165 --> 01:36:31,875
I just have this sense...

1647
01:36:33,961 --> 01:36:35,295
that he needs my help.

1648
01:36:35,379 --> 01:36:36,380
Our help.

1649
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,424
He does.

1650
01:36:39,508 --> 01:36:41,218
We don't know where he is.

1651
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:45,305
And, um, honestly,
right now we're all he really has left.

1652
01:36:46,807 --> 01:36:51,812
Well, uh, is there someplace
that he might go

1653
01:36:51,895 --> 01:36:54,064
that has meaning to him?

1654
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:59,069
Like a place where he would go to just--?

1655
01:36:59,152 --> 01:37:00,654
Get away from everything?

1656
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:06,994
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

I know exactly where that would be.

about May.

1671
01:38:33,664 --> 01:38:38,877
Yeah. Sorry.
I got some understanding

1672
01:38:38,961 --> 01:38:39,837
of what it is you're--

1673
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,548
No, please don't tell me
that you know what I'm going through.

-Okay.
-She's gone.

And it's all my fault.

She died for nothing.

1677
01:38:58,689 --> 01:39:00,649
I'll do what I should have done
in the first place.

-[Peter 2] Peter--
-Please don't.

1679

You don't belong here. Either of you.
So I'm sending you home.

1680

Those other guys are
from your worlds, right?

1681
01:39:12,035 --> 01:39:13,537
So you deal with it.

1682
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,539
If they die, if you kill them...

1683
01:39:16,498 --> 01:39:17,332
that's on you.

1684
01:39:18,542 --> 01:39:19,418
It's not my problem.

1685
01:39:20,377 --> 01:39:21,628
I don't care anymore.

1686
01:39:23,046 --> 01:39:23,881
I'm done.

1687
01:39:28,927 --> 01:39:31,221
I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

It was my fault.

01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:52,534
I lost...

1693
01:39:55,704 --> 01:39:57,456
I lost Gwen, my, um...

1694
01:39:59,082 --> 01:40:00,083
She was my MJ.

1695
01:40:02,961 --> 01:40:04,171
I couldn't save her.

1696
01:40:05,839 --> 01:40:08,217
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1697
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:13,222
But I carried on, tried to, um...

1698
01:40:14,431 --> 01:40:16,683
Tried to keep going,
tried to keep being...

what she would've wanted.

I just stopped pulling my punches.

[Peter 2] The night Ben died...

1707
01:40:46,463 --> 01:40:48,590
I hunted down the man
who I thought did it.

1708
01:40:50,467 --> 01:40:51,760
I wanted him dead.

1709

I got what I wanted.

to learn to get through that darkness.

Even after she was hurt,

1717
01:41:32,134 --> 01:41:34,344
she said to me
that we did the right thing.

1718
01:41:43,645 --> 01:41:45,189
She told me that with great power...

1719
01:41:47,357 --> 01:41:49,109
Comes great responsibility.

1720
01:41:54,573 --> 01:41:55,991
Wait, what? How do you know that?

1721
01:41:56,074 --> 01:41:57,618
Uncle Ben said it.

1722
01:41:57,701 --> 01:41:59,161
The day he died.

1723

Marko, Dillon and, um...

1726
01:42:22,184 --> 01:42:24,645
I think that I can repair
the devices for Dillon and Marko,

1727

I've cured him once, so no big deal.

-What? It's no big deal.
-Great.

Yeah, that's great.

I think I can make an antiserum
for Dr Osborn.

Been thinking about it a long time.

Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1734

Right.

1869
01:50:21,288 --> 01:50:23,999
If it's personal, I don't wanna pry,
but I think it's cool.

1870
01:50:24,082 --> 01:50:27,169
I-- I wish I could tell you,
but it's, like, I don't do it.

1871
01:50:27,252 --> 01:50:29,546
Like I don't do breathing.

1872
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:31,590
-Like, breathing just happens.
-Whoa.

1873
01:50:31,965 --> 01:50:35,802
It's just, like, when it releases,
it's like a clean release.

1874
01:50:35,886 --> 01:50:36,803
Can I ask something?

1875
01:50:36,887 --> 01:50:38,096
-Yeah.
-Is it like:

1876
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:40,349
When you think it, it webs?

1877
01:50:40,432 --> 01:50:42,184
That's a good way to put it.

1878
01:50:42,267 --> 01:50:45,103
Because if I press...
I have to have a mechanism.

1879
01:50:45,187 --> 01:50:48,982
-Right.
-But for you, is it like, "Web"?

1880
01:50:49,066 --> 01:50:50,150
And then it webs?

1881
01:50:50,234 --> 01:50:53,111
Uh, not even conscious at this point.

1882
01:50:53,195 --> 01:50:54,947
It's just like riding a bike.

1883
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:59,368
Does it just come out of your wrists,
or does it come out of anywhere else?

1884
01:50:59,451 --> 01:51:01,662
Only-- Only the wrists.

1885
01:51:01,745 --> 01:51:03,956
Never had a web block?
I run out of webs all the time.

1886
01:51:04,039 --> 01:51:06,542
-I have to make my own in a lab.
-[Peter 2] Right. That's--

1887
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:09,586
-It's a hassle compared to what you got.
-Sounds like a hassle.

1888
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:13,131
But I did. You said that,
I was like, "Oh. I had a web block."

1889
01:51:13,215 --> 01:51:15,717
-Whoa. Why?
-Existential-crisis stuff.

1890
01:51:15,801 --> 01:51:18,470
Pfft. Yeah. Don't get me started on that.

1891
01:51:18,554 --> 01:51:20,848
I'm not sure what to say.
It's just a natural thing.

1892
01:51:20,931 --> 01:51:22,224
It just happens.

1893
01:51:23,517 --> 01:51:24,351
I don't know.

1894
01:51:24,434 --> 01:51:25,644
It's so cool, man.

1895
01:51:25,727 --> 01:51:28,647
-Like, I wanna see the holes.
-[Peter] Hey.

1896
01:51:28,814 --> 01:51:31,900
What are some of the craziest villains
that you guys have fought?

1897
01:51:31,984 --> 01:51:34,695
-Seems you've met some of them.
-That's a good question.

1898
01:51:34,778 --> 01:51:40,117
Yeah, I fought an alien
made out of black goo once.

1899
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:42,286
Oh, no way. I fought an alien too.

1900
01:51:42,369 --> 01:51:44,079
-On Earth and in space.
-Oh.

1901
01:51:44,162 --> 01:51:45,956
-He was purple.
-I wanna fight an alien.

1902
01:51:46,039 --> 01:51:49,793
I'm still, like, that you fought
an alien in space.

1903
01:51:50,669 --> 01:51:54,631
I'm always simultaneously,
like, completely stunned

1904
01:51:55,215 --> 01:51:59,052
by the fantastical nature of these things,

1905
01:51:59,136 --> 01:52:01,972
and it's also just like,
"Yeah. Okay. Yeah."

1906
01:52:02,055 --> 01:52:03,765
Yeah, it's Monday. Yeah.

1907
01:52:03,849 --> 01:52:04,850
I mean--

1908
01:52:05,475 --> 01:52:09,688
I'm lame compared-- I fought
a Russian guy in a rhinoceros machine.

1909
01:52:10,105 --> 01:52:10,981
That's cool.

1910
01:52:11,064 --> 01:52:12,649
Not as-- No, it's not.

1911
01:52:12,733 --> 01:52:15,444
Can we rewind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1912
01:52:15,527 --> 01:52:16,403
'Cause you are not.

1913
01:52:16,486 --> 01:52:18,572
Thanks. I appreciate that.
I'm not saying I am--

1914
01:52:18,655 --> 01:52:20,616
But it's just the self-talk.
Maybe we should...

1915
01:52:20,699 --> 01:52:23,452
-Listen, I--
-[Peter 2] 'Cause you're amazing.

1916
01:52:23,535 --> 01:52:25,454
Just to take it in for a minute.

1917
01:52:25,537 --> 01:52:28,040
-[Peter 3] Yeah, I can take it in.
-You are amazing.

1918
01:52:28,123 --> 01:52:30,709
-I can. Thank you.
-You are amazing. Will you say it?

1919
01:52:30,792 --> 01:52:32,336
I needed to hear that. Thank you.

1920
01:52:32,419 --> 01:52:33,587
[thunder rumbling in distance]

1921
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:35,881
All right, guys, focus up. You feel that?

1922
01:52:35,964 --> 01:52:36,798
Yeah.

1923
01:52:36,882 --> 01:52:38,717
[suspenseful music playing]

1924
01:52:44,389 --> 01:52:45,474
[Electro] What's up, Peter?

1925
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,062
How you like the new-new?

1926
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:56,235
Look, you give it to me,
I'm gonna destroy it. [chuckles]

1927
01:52:56,318 --> 01:52:57,736
But I'll let you live.

1928
01:52:58,403 --> 01:52:59,947
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1929
01:53:02,824 --> 01:53:04,451
[Spider-Man] Okay, guys, here he comes.

1930
01:53:11,166 --> 01:53:14,795
[Spider-Man 3] Hey, Max!
I missed you, man. Ho!

1931
01:53:16,755 --> 01:53:18,298
[Spider-Man] All right, MJ, heads up!

1932
01:53:19,341 --> 01:53:20,509
Got it! Close it.

1933
01:53:21,885 --> 01:53:24,471
[Ned grunting]

1934
01:53:24,555 --> 01:53:26,640
-Ned, it's not closing.
-Yeah, I know.

1935
01:53:26,723 --> 01:53:28,308
-Why isn't it closing?
-I don't know.

1936
01:53:28,392 --> 01:53:31,436
-Did you close it before? No?
-I mean, I've opened some.

1937
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:38,110
[roars]

1938
01:53:40,362 --> 01:53:42,781
Max, Max, Max. Can we talk for a second?

1939
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:44,950
-Just you and me, just talk?
-Look who showed up.

1940
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:46,952
My old friend Spider-Man.

1941
01:53:47,035 --> 01:53:48,996
I'm trying to save you.
That's all I've wanted.

1942
01:53:49,079 --> 01:53:50,664
-You're not trying to save me.
-I am.

1943
01:53:50,747 --> 01:53:52,541
You ain't even the shit no more.

1944
01:53:52,624 --> 01:53:55,961
-Oh.
-Don't worry about me. I'll save myself.

1945
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:59,381
-Burn up!
-[grunts] Oh!

1946
01:53:59,464 --> 01:54:01,091
Well, I got his attention. Now what?

1947
01:54:01,175 --> 01:54:02,676
[Spider-Man 2] Okay, great.

1948
01:54:03,427 --> 01:54:06,430
Uh, just FYI, lizard guy's here too.

1949
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:09,558
Guys, comm check. Hello?

1950
01:54:10,767 --> 01:54:13,353
-[Spider-Man 3] I need Max's cure!
-Yeah. I'm on it.

1951
01:54:14,313 --> 01:54:16,315
[Spider-Man 2]
Peter, I need the Lizard cure.

1952
01:54:16,398 --> 01:54:17,691
[grunts] Okay, okay.

1953
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:24,740
Where's the box, Peter?

1954
01:54:24,823 --> 01:54:27,618
-Flint, we could help everyone.
-I don't care!

1955
01:54:35,125 --> 01:54:36,001
[yells]

1956
01:54:39,004 --> 01:54:39,880
Sorry!

1957
01:54:40,714 --> 01:54:41,924
Ugh. Gross!

1958
01:54:42,633 --> 01:54:45,302
[Electro] Sad to tell you, Sandman,
nobody's going home.

1959
01:54:47,471 --> 01:54:48,430
[yells]

1960
01:55:23,048 --> 01:55:26,051
Oh! What the hell is going on out there?

1961
01:55:26,134 --> 01:55:27,886
I keep yelling at you, Peter 2!

1962
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:31,098
-But I thought you were Peter 2.
-What? I'm not Peter 2.

1963
01:55:31,181 --> 01:55:33,433
Stop arguing, both of you!
Listen to Peter 1.

1964
01:55:33,517 --> 01:55:36,436
-We're clearly not very good at this.
-I know, I know. We suck.

1965
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:39,356
-I don't know how to work as a team.
-Me neither.

1966
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:41,400
I do. I've been in a team, okay?

1967
01:55:41,483 --> 01:55:44,111
I don't wanna brag, but I will.
I was in the Avengers.

1968
01:55:44,194 --> 01:55:45,529
-The Avengers?
-Yeah.

1969
01:55:45,612 --> 01:55:46,822
-That's great.
-Thank you.

1970
01:55:46,905 --> 01:55:47,781
What is that?

1971
01:55:48,949 --> 01:55:50,158
You don't have the Avengers?

1972
01:55:50,242 --> 01:55:51,743
Is that a band? Are you in a band?

1973
01:55:51,827 --> 01:55:55,205
No, I'm not in a band.
The Avengers is Earth's mightiest--

1974

-How's this helping?
-It's not important.

1975
01:55:57,124 --> 01:55:58,959
All we gotta do is focus,
trust your tingle,

1976
01:55:59,042 --> 01:56:00,460
and coordinate our attacks.

1977
01:56:00,544 --> 01:56:03,255
Yes. Okay. Let's pick one target.

1978
01:56:03,338 --> 01:56:05,716
-Right.
-We take them off the board one at a time.

1979
01:56:05,799 --> 01:56:08,385
-You got it. Okay, Peter 1, Peter 2.
-Peter 2.

-Peter 3.
-Peter 3.

-Let's do this. Ready?
-[Peter 3] Wait, wait!

1982
01:56:12,723 --> 01:56:13,932
I love you guys.

We're gonna get you home.

I've never seen him this powerful.

2006
01:58:35,073 --> 01:58:37,367
[Spider-Man] It's the arc reactor.
We gotta get it off him.

2007

You're not gonna take this from me.

That's not gonna work.

2009

It's fine. You'll do it again.
We'll keep trying.

2016
01:59:26,416 --> 01:59:29,545
-All right, we got this. Shh.
-Focus and close the portal.

01:59:34,716 --> 01:59:37,261
And that is a lizard and we should go!

2019
01:59:39,972 --> 01:59:41,723
[both shouting]

2020
01:59:41,807 --> 01:59:42,683
Run!

2021
01:59:43,684 --> 01:59:46,144
Come on! Come on, this way!
Quick, quick, quick!

2022
01:59:46,228 --> 01:59:47,604
[Spider-Man] Connors, stop!

2023
01:59:54,987 --> 01:59:57,990
[laughing] Yeah.

2024
01:59:59,408 --> 02:00:00,534
[groans]

2025
02:00:10,460 --> 02:00:13,005
Leave them. They're mine.

2026
02:00:13,088 --> 02:00:15,674
I don't need your help.
I got it just fine.

2027
02:00:15,757 --> 02:00:17,926
Dr Octavius, no.

2028
02:00:20,512 --> 02:00:21,889
What are you doing?

2029
02:00:23,557 --> 02:00:24,766
Get it off of me.

2030
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:26,852
[dramatic music playing]

2031
02:00:35,736 --> 02:00:36,862
There you go.

2033
02:00:56,089 --> 02:00:56,965
[Spider-Man] MJ!

2034
02:01:07,601 --> 02:01:08,769
Whoa.

2035
02:01:09,353 --> 02:01:11,104
-We gotta hide this thing.
-Oh, right.

2036
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:16,985
-Nice, Ned!
-Yeah!

2037
02:01:18,237 --> 02:01:19,071
[MJ] Oh.

2038
02:01:20,656 --> 02:01:21,573
Where is he?

2039
02:01:21,657 --> 02:01:23,200
-[Ned] No!
-[MJ] Wait, wait, wait.

2040
02:01:23,283 --> 02:01:27,329
Before you do anything, Mister--
Doctor Strange, Peter's plan is working.

2041
02:01:27,412 --> 02:01:29,164
-What plan?
-He's curing them.

2042
02:01:38,215 --> 02:01:39,341
Dr Connors?

2043
02:01:42,761 --> 02:01:43,846
Welcome back, sir.

2044
02:01:45,931 --> 02:01:47,182
Well, I'll be damned.

2045
02:01:50,143 --> 02:01:51,770
Did you just open a portal?

2046
02:01:52,771 --> 02:01:53,939
Yes, sir, I did.

2047
02:01:54,731 --> 02:01:55,983
Hmm.

2048
02:02:01,697 --> 02:02:04,783
Max? Max?

2049
02:02:05,534 --> 02:02:08,662
-Don't worry. I'm all tapped out.
-Are you sure about that?

2050
02:02:10,622 --> 02:02:11,915
Back to being a nobody.

2051
02:02:11,999 --> 02:02:15,294
-You were never a nobody, Max.
-Yes, I was.

2052
02:02:15,919 --> 02:02:18,005
You didn't see me. [chuckles]

2053
02:02:18,547 --> 02:02:21,216
-Can I tell you something, though?
-[Peter 3] Yeah.

2054
02:02:22,259 --> 02:02:24,011
You got a nice face. You're just a kid.

2055
02:02:25,012 --> 02:02:26,680
-Eh.
-You're from Queens.

2056
02:02:27,806 --> 02:02:31,059
You got that suit.
You help a lot of poor people.

2057
02:02:31,143 --> 02:02:32,978
I just thought you was gonna be Black.

2058
02:02:34,188 --> 02:02:36,565
-Oh, man, I'm sorry.
-Don't apologise.

2059
02:02:36,648 --> 02:02:39,067
There's gotta be a Black Spider-Man
somewhere out there.

2060
02:02:42,529 --> 02:02:43,739
Goddamn eels.

-[Spider-Man 2] In the palm of your hand.
-Peter?

2063
02:02:57,544 --> 02:02:58,378
Otto.

2064
02:03:00,339 --> 02:03:02,132
Oh, it's good to see you, dear boy.

2065
02:03:02,966 --> 02:03:04,343
It's good to see you.

2066
02:03:05,135 --> 02:03:06,345
You're all grown up.

2067
02:03:08,096 --> 02:03:09,139
How are you?

2068
02:03:11,433 --> 02:03:12,476
Trying to do better.

-Strange, wait, we're so close.
-Skip it!

2071
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:24,655
I've been dangling
over the Grand Canyon for 12 hours.

2072
02:03:24,738 --> 02:03:27,824
[Peter] I know, I know, I know.
I, uh-- Um...

2073
02:03:28,659 --> 02:03:30,494
I'm sorry about that, sir. I mean...

2074
02:03:30,577 --> 02:03:33,580
-You went to the Grand Canyon?
-He could have used your help.

2075
02:03:33,664 --> 02:03:35,832
[Peter] It's okay.
These are my new friends.

2076
02:03:35,916 --> 02:03:38,377
This is Peter Parker, Peter Parker.
Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

2077
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:40,045
-They're mes from other universes.
-Oh.

2078
02:03:40,128 --> 02:03:42,881
They're here to help.
This is the wizard I told you about.

2079
02:03:42,965 --> 02:03:46,301
I am really impressed that you've managed
to give them all a second chance, kid.

2080
02:03:47,511 --> 02:03:49,638
But this has to end. Now.

2081
02:03:49,721 --> 02:03:53,100
[Green Goblin]
Can the Spider-Man come out to play?

Yeah.

-We're okay!

Poor Peter.
Too weak to send me home to die.

No.

2106
02:06:54,740 --> 02:06:56,450
I just wanna kill you myself.

02:08:50,814 --> 02:08:52,816
because of you.

2115

I may have struck the blow,

-It's you.
-[Peter 3] You okay?

Uh... Yeah, I'm good.
I've been stabbed before.

-[Peter 3] Yeah, no, that's happening.

-That's real.
-[Peter 2] Are there people in the sky?

-I gotta go.
-Yeah. I got it. You okay?

02:10:26,368 --> 02:10:27,661
[Peter] What's happening?

2133
02:10:27,744 --> 02:10:29,955
They're starting to come through.
I can't stop them.

2134
02:10:30,038 --> 02:10:33,083
There's gotta be something we could do.
Can't you just cast the spell again?

2135
02:10:33,166 --> 02:10:34,918
The original way, before I screwed it up.

2136
02:10:35,002 --> 02:10:36,920
[Strange] We're too late for that.
They're here.

2137
02:10:37,838 --> 02:10:39,882
They're here because of you.

2138
02:10:45,345 --> 02:10:46,847
What if everyone forgot who I was?

2139
02:10:46,930 --> 02:10:47,806
What?

2140
02:10:48,307 --> 02:10:51,226
They're coming here because of me, right?
Because I'm Peter Parker?

2141
02:10:51,810 --> 02:10:52,978
So cast a new spell.

2142
02:10:53,061 --> 02:10:55,480
But this time, make everyone forget
who Peter Parker is.

2143
02:10:55,564 --> 02:10:56,940
Make everyone forget...

2144
02:10:58,901 --> 02:11:00,319
-me.
-No.

2145
02:11:00,402 --> 02:11:03,197
-But it would work, right?
-Yeah, it would work.

2146
02:11:04,615 --> 02:11:07,201
But you gotta understand
that would mean that everyone

2147
02:11:07,284 --> 02:11:09,828
who knows and loves you, we...

2148
02:11:11,997 --> 02:11:13,874
We'd have no memory of you.

2149
02:11:15,667 --> 02:11:17,503
It would be as though you never existed.

2150
02:11:20,881 --> 02:11:21,715
I know.

2151
02:11:23,759 --> 02:11:25,052
Do it.

2152
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:31,350
You better go and say your goodbyes.
You don't have long.

2153
02:11:31,975 --> 02:11:34,019
-Thank you, sir.
-Call me Stephen.

2154

Thank you, Stephen.

2155
02:11:40,609 --> 02:11:43,403
Yeah. Still feels weird.

2156
02:11:46,073 --> 02:11:47,366
I'll see you around.

2157
02:11:49,201 --> 02:11:50,244

Hey. Uh...

2159
02:12:00,212 --> 02:12:02,756
I think this is it.
I think you're about to go home.

2160
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:04,341
-Okay.
-All right.

Thank you.

I just wanna-- I want you to--
I wanna tell you that--

2164
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:15,561
I don't know how to say this. I--

2165
02:12:15,644 --> 02:12:17,312
-Peter.
-I want you to know that I...

2166
02:12:19,022 --> 02:12:21,525
You know. It's what we do.

2167
02:12:23,402 --> 02:12:25,529
Yeah, it's what we do. Um...

2168
02:12:26,321 --> 02:12:28,782
Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ. I--

2169
02:12:28,866 --> 02:12:32,286
Uh... [grunts]
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Bye.

2172

-Oh.
-You're in so much pain, huh?

2173
02:12:44,715 --> 02:12:45,841
-I am.
-Yeah.

2174
02:12:49,928 --> 02:12:51,972
[MJ] Oh, you're okay. [exhales]

2175
02:12:52,931 --> 02:12:54,057
So proud of you.

2176

Okay, I think I got this.

2347
02:27:07,119 --> 02:27:10,831
You're saying that this whole place here,

2348
02:27:10,914 --> 02:27:12,833
it's just tons of...

2349
02:27:14,001 --> 02:27:15,377
superpeople.

2350
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:18,172
[Venom]
And he has been saying it for hours.

2351
02:27:18,964 --> 02:27:22,092
All right, tell me again.
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

2352
02:27:22,176 --> 02:27:26,013
There was a billionaire,
he had a tin suit and he could fly, right?

2353
02:27:28,348 --> 02:27:31,351
Okay, and there was
a really angry green man.

2354
02:27:31,435 --> 02:27:32,978
-Hulk.
-Hulk.

2355
02:27:33,061 --> 02:27:35,439
[Venom] And you thought
Lethal Protector was a shit name.

2356
02:27:35,522 --> 02:27:37,566
Yeah, because it is.

2357
02:27:37,649 --> 02:27:41,987
Now tell me again about
your purple alien that loves stones.

2358
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:44,740
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,
aliens do not love stones.

2359
02:27:44,823 --> 02:27:46,825
-Eddie, don't start.
-They don't.

2360
02:27:46,909 --> 02:27:48,911
Know what aliens love? Eating brains.

2361
02:27:48,994 --> 02:27:51,163
Because that's what they do. All right?

2362
02:27:51,246 --> 02:27:53,874
Señor, he made my family disappear.

2363
02:27:55,292 --> 02:27:56,335
For five years.

2364
02:27:57,753 --> 02:27:58,795
Five years?

2365
02:28:01,089 --> 02:28:02,216
That's a long time.

2366
02:28:04,885 --> 02:28:06,220
Maybe I...

2367
02:28:06,303 --> 02:28:09,014
Maybe I should go to New York
and speak to this...

2368
02:28:10,557 --> 02:28:11,558
Spider-Man.

2369
02:28:11,642 --> 02:28:14,686
Eddie, we are drunk.

[hiccups]

2371
02:28:16,522 --> 02:28:18,982
-Let's go skinny-dip!
-I don't think we should skinny-dip.

2372
02:28:19,066 --> 02:28:20,192
You have to pay the bill.

2373
02:28:20,984 --> 02:28:22,319
What is happening? No!

2374
02:28:22,402 --> 02:28:24,780
-No, we just got here! No, not again!
-Oh...

2375
02:28:29,451 --> 02:28:30,619
And there he goes.

2376
02:28:31,328 --> 02:28:34,248
Without paying the bill, no tips, nothing.

2377
02:35:42,634 --> 02:35:46,305
[man] Seniors, don't forget to schedule
your graduation photo pickup.

2378
02:35:46,388 --> 02:35:49,057
-[air horn blares]
-Cafeteria safety is no joke.

2379
02:35:51,143 --> 02:35:54,354
Respect the signs,
or pay the consequences.

2380
02:35:54,938 --> 02:35:57,691
This has been a message
from the Cafeteria Safety Council.

2381
02:35:57,774 --> 02:36:01,028
[Betty] And now, Betty's Corner,
with Betty Brant.

2382
02:36:01,612 --> 02:36:05,574
It seems like only yesterday
that we were just starting the adventure

2383
02:36:05,657 --> 02:36:07,201
that we call high school.

2384
02:36:07,284 --> 02:36:09,620
And what an adventure it's been.

2385
02:36:10,537 --> 02:36:12,122
We learned new things.

2386
02:36:12,206 --> 02:36:14,041
We travelled the world.

2387
02:36:14,124 --> 02:36:15,667
We fell in love.

2388
02:36:15,751 --> 02:36:19,004
We almost died. Multiple times.

2389
02:36:19,087 --> 02:36:21,423
We made friendships
that will last forever.

2390
02:36:21,507 --> 02:36:24,885
Also, some of us disappeared
for five years and then reappeared.

2391
02:36:24,968 --> 02:36:26,970
But the less we talk about that,
the better.

2392
02:36:27,721 --> 02:36:30,891
What's important is that we made it.

2393
02:36:30,974 --> 02:36:35,771
And as we look out on to an exciting
and uncertain future, just remember:

2394
02:36:35,854 --> 02:36:38,815
The memories we've made here
at Midtown High

2395
02:36:38,899 --> 02:36:41,151
are the ones that we will cherish forever.

2396
02:36:43,946 --> 02:36:45,572
That's Midtown News for today,

2397
02:36:45,656 --> 02:36:48,450
and for one last time,
this has been Betty Brant.

2398
02:36:48,534 --> 02:36:49,535
Signing off.

2399
02:36:50,619 --> 02:36:53,914
Happy graduation! Go Tigers! [whoops]
