1
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,175
My name is Federico Alvarez.

2
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,933
I'm one of the screenwriters
and the producer of this movie.

3
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,392
I'm Rodo Sayagues,
screenwriter and director.

4
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:31,855
And I'm Pedro Luque,
I'm the director of photography.

5
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,283
[Sayagues] And we're going
to watch the movie with you

6
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:42,116
and tell you a bit about the anecdotes
and what this movie meant for us.

7
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,033
[Alvarez] We're from Uruguay.

8
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:48,963
We did this in Spanish,
to do it in our native language

9
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,633
so it would be more natural,
but also to give an alternate version

10
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,054
of the commentary done by Rodo in English,
which I'm sure you can find somewhere.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,977
The fist logo of our company, Bad Hombre,
the production company.

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,806
This is the first movie under that logo.

13
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,938
[Sayagues] Well, let's begin.

14
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:16,487
-[Luque] The majestic city of Detroit.
-[Sayagues] Exactly.

15
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:21,447
[Alvarez] This take was an attempt...

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,998
It represents the first movie well.

17
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:29,375
On the first one, we started with Pedro,
we did the aerial take,

18
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,171
but this one is more sophisticated.

19
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,544
[chuckling]

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,298
[Luque] It's an homage to the first one
and an introduction to the same world.

21
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,921
[Alvarez] More special effects.

22
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:45,227
A girl walking in 3D.
Tell us, Rodo, why is the girl in 3D?

23
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,725
[Sayagues] Why is the girl in 3D?

24
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,102
Well, because she's three years old

25
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:56,489
and it was literally impossible
for her to do that, so...

26
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:00,409
[Alvarez] Besides, I imagine you'd be...
For how long were you filming in Detroit?

27
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,156
-[Sayagues] One day.
-[Alvarez] Right, one day.

28
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:05,456
-[Sayagues] Two days, right? One or two.
-[Luque] One or two days.

29
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,124
[Alvarez] Well, here they are in...

30
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:12,789
[Luque] Here we are in
the middle of Serbia, in a remote forest.

31
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,339
[Alvarez] What's that?

32
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,463
[Sayagues] Nobody was able
to tell us what that was,

33
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,592
but we thought it would be good
to include it in the scene.

34
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,093
[Luque] Especially keeping in mind

35
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:26,974
the apocalyptic or semi-apocalyptic world
of Don't Breathe.

36
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,056
[Alvarez] I imagine it's some sort of--
It looks like a generator, right?

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,311
Like some type of generator.

38
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,519
[Luque] I think it was from a water
treatment plant or something like that.

39
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,399
[Sayagues] I think the idea was...

40
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,199
we're opening with a scene
that takes place in a forest,

41
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:45,530
to include elements that will help us make
the transition from forest to city,

42
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:50,369
even if it's a city
half swallowed by nature...

43
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,997
and it looks like a city
in the middle of a jungle.

44
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,129
But the idea was that,
to urbanize that forest.

45
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,085
Also this,
the basketball hoop in the background,

46
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,011
elements that bring you
slowly to the city.

47
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:07,185
[Alvarez] Correct. Because originally,
in the script, it was like an auto plant.

48
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,264
I think the first version we wrote
was an auto plant, right?

49
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:16,944
[Sayagues] Yes, as a matter of fact
it does have the spirit of a junkyard.

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,646
[Luque] It's Detroit.

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,326
When we went to Detroit, we noticed
that there were rotten cars all over.

52
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,906
[Alvarez] And we were thinking
of creating the climax of the movie

53
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,912
in the same auto plant at a given time.

54
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,243
We thought that what would happen
in the third act

55
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,002
was that they would leave home and
they would get to the abandoned factory.

56
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:41,086
But then we thought about how many movies
are set in an abandoned car factory.

57
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,465
[chuckling]

58
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,762
How could we do that?

59
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,935
[Sayagues] Stephen Lang appears here,
the Blind Man.

60
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,763
[Alvarez] Was this the first time
you filmed him in character?

61
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,271
[Luque] No. We did a screen test
which was brutal.

62
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,649
That's where he shows up for
the first time, but it's not in the movie.

63
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,607
For us, that was the moment
we saw him be reborn.

64
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:06,285
-[Alvarez] Reborn.
-[Sayagues] Yes, that was exciting.

65
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,744
[Luque] This shot is in Detroit.
This shot-- No. This shot is also...

66
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,290
[Sayagues] It's half Detroit, half Serbia.

67
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,334
[Luque] Half Detroit, half Serbia, right.

68
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,788
-This house is...
-[Alvarez] Which half?

69
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,374
[Sayagues] That part with the forest
below, that's in Serbia.

70
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,880
[Luque] And the house.
And the top part is Detroit.

71
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,257
[Alvarez] But the house was 3D.

72
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,963
[Sayagues] It's 3D. The house is 3D.

73
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,391
[Luque] We built the house, the next shot,
the ones that come after.

74
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,435
[Alvarez] You can tell
there was a real house,

75
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,980
but I remember seeing the shot
without a house.

76
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,727
I thought it was Detroit.

77
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,277
[Sayagues] The shot without a house
is in Detroit.

78
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,444
[Luque] Here we are.

79
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,238
[Alvarez] This was one of
the first scenes we filmed.

80
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,156
[Luque] Yes.

81
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,607
[Sayagues] This was the first day filming.

82
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,364
It was my first day of filming
as a director. I was pretty nervous.

83
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,038
[Luque] Of movies.
We had done several commercials.

84
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,582
-[Sayagues] Everyone was nervous.
-[Alvarez] I was nervous, too.

85
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,206
I remember that it was
the first daily I saw from home.

86
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,413
During the pandemic,
you were making the movie

87
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:03,046
and I was here, at home,
and I hit play and started watching.

88
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,548
And I remember saying,
"Fantastic! It looks like a movie!"

89
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,970
[Sayagues] "Not too bad."

90
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,308
[Luque] The tender moment between...

91
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,386
The guy is still a toughie.

92
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,314
[Sayagues] I also remember
that we talked a lot

93
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,893
about the idea of starting filming
with this scene

94
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:26,528
because it was a scene
that required a lot of Madelyn,

95
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,450
playing the role of Phoenix,

96
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,825
and she was nervous as well
about having to start with a scene

97
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,033
where she was the protagonist.
But the truth is she did very well.

98
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,540
[Luque] You can read the hat, right?

99
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,839
[Alvarez] Yes, man. Shameless advertising.

100
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,915
[Sayagues chuckles]

101
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,591
[Luque] We had to put something.

102
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,880
[Alvarez] It was Stephanie's first movie,
like we said before.

103
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,384
[Luque] This is in the study,
the close-up of the girl.

104
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,469
[Sayagues]
It's also Madelyn's first movie.

105
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,721
I said no.

106
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,196
[Alvarez] This was interesting,
the idea of the blind man's only friend.

107
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:09,697
The only person who, more or less,
dares to say something to the blind man.

108
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,652
When I saw it,
I thought this shot looked great,

109
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,487
with the reflection
of the blind man there.

110
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,414
It was longer in the first cut,

111
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,958
where there was a bit more
of the guy's reflection.

112
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,376
We cut this scene quite a bit.
It used to be...

113
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,546
[Luque] This was one of the few scenes
we reshot some things for, right, Rodo?

114
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,714
[Sayagues] Yes.

115
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,168
[Luque] After filming,
we realized some shots were missing.

116
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,675
It was much more complex
and ended up looking simpler

117
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,676
in the final edit, and it works perfectly.

118
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,804
[Sayagues]
But we used that shot we missed.

119
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,511
We made it better in the same shot.

120
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,221
[Luque] Yes, yes. A couple of days later.

121
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,898
[Sayagues] A couple of days later
we said we were missing a shot.

122
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,691
Then we shot this one
and ended up using it.

123
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,937
[Luque] I just noticed there's a sign
that says "underpass.”

124
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,113
That was added in post, right?

125
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,031
-[Alvarez] Yes.
-[Sayagues] No, we placed it there.

126
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,200
-[Luque] We did?
-[Sayagues] Really.

127
00:06:55,665 --> 00:07:00,660
[Alvarez] Madelyn was in
the first casting.

128
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,586
[Sayagues] Yes, yes.

129
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,504
I think my mom sang it to me
when I was little.

130
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,423
[Alvarez] She was there
early in the process.

131
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,715
[Sayagues] Yes. Right away.

132
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,088
You wanna pay her a visit?

133
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,045
[Alvarez] And she had not
made movies, only TV.

134
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:16,976
[Sayagues] No, some TV shows,
but never a movie.

135
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,678
But she did great.

136
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,606
-This is Detroit.
-[Luque] Back in Detroit.

137
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:29,647
We had to find identical trucks
in Detroit and another in Belgrade.

138
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,611
[Sayagues]
This ended up looking very nice.

139
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:38,323
And these ashes that float,
I remember that it was Fede's idea.

140
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,374
A few days before filming he said,
"Are they going to have ashes floating?"

141
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,792
And I said, "What ashes?"

142
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,746
And the truth is without those ashes,
the scene...

143
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,298
[Luque] It gives it a certain magic.

144
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,420
[Alvarez] In Evil Dead,

145
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,048
I remember the first time
the cabin door opens, it's the same.

146
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,348
I don't know where I saw it,
but I remember asking for it.

147
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,596
They had this technique with a mop.

148
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:02,806
-One of those sticks with a thing.
-[Luque] Mop.

149
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:07,439
[Alvarez] They came with the thing
and shook it in front of the lighting,

150
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,066
they kept going and then, "Action!"

151
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,365
[Luque] This time they used
what they call stone candles.

152
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,443
Remember?
The ones we used in Spider's Web.

153
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:25,203
[Alvarez] I love this,
without any subtlety we planted it there.

154
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,788
[Sayagues] It must be said,
this is a cardinal sin

155
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,591
for screenwriters to place exposition
on a TV that is just...

156
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,091
[Alvarez] Of course. Most of the people
who are watching this with the comments

157
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,467
have already seen the movie.

158
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,640
People already know how the film ends.

159
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,467
Upon second viewing, you realize
that here, in the first few minutes,

160
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,969
Upon second viewing, you realize
that here, in the first few minutes,

161
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,601
they're already telling you
where the plot is going. [laughs]

162
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,310
The secret twist of the third act
is already there.

163
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,400
The story changed in editing.

164
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,660
Obviously,
the original scene was like this.

165
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,580
She would come and do all this
in the script, when we wrote it.

166
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:06,001
Later we realized in editing
that it worked better

167
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:10,081
if we saw the scene,
but then we pushed it back

168
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,883
and made it feel
like it was all a daydream,

169
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,300
like she was dreaming.

170
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,130
[Luque] We also gave it
a more saturated look.

171
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,807
[Alvarez] All the colors go up
and then get pushed back.

172
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,059
Really good effects.

173
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,013
You have to give credit
to all those people,

174
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:30,192
because they did all this,
Aparato did all this.

175
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,315
[Sayagues] This is a location in Serbia.

176
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:37,400
Everything was built,
except the background.

177
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:42,364
The city in the background
was done by Aparato, in a very good way.

178
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:47,748
[Alvarez] You can't see the chroma.
You can't see the blue screen at all.

179
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,587
-[Sayagues] It feels like Detroit.
-[Alvarez] Totally.

180
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:56,089
There is a section of Detroit
that looks exactly like this.

181
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,796
[Luque] Yes, we stopped
on a street in Detroit...

182
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,805
[Alvarez] For a public bathroom
in Detroit, the floor is pretty clean.

183
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,179
[Luque] They swept it.
It's a family place.

184
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,934
[laughter]

185
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,608
-[Sayagues] I really like this shot.
-[Alvarez] This shot is great.

186
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,857
It was one of the first shots I saw
and said, "Good, they're making a movie."

187
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,814
[Sayagues] They're filmmaking.

188
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,740
[Luque] It looks nice on the big screen.

189
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,151
[Sayagues] This is the shot
I like the most.

190
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,407
[Luque] This is Rodo's shot.

191
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,987
[Sayagues] I don't know why,
but I like it.

192
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,323
[Luque] This is your shot,
you planned it, envisioned it.

193
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,624
We had the mirror made
with those dimensions.

194
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:33,547
[Sayagues] And with the red wall behind,
because we thought, with great aspiration,

195
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:38,048
we thought later in the film
we would find out

196
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:42,382
the two of them were related
with blood ties that united them.

197
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,807
And the red line in the middle
which linked the two of them

198
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,259
seemed like fun to us.

199
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,150
[Alvarez] This man is great.

200
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,612
It's like he's excited
to see his daughter for the first time.

201
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,315
Like he wants to hug her.

202
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,945
[Sayagues] That finger is me.

203
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,525
[laughter]

204
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,329
Yes, Brendan is a great actor

205
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:11,877
and it was hard to play that role
because it has many different sides

206
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,456
and you can tell he was excited
to see her for the first time.

207
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,087
-[car door closes]
-[tinkling]

208
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,464
You okay?

209
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,431
[Alvarez] The anamorphic lenses
they chose are amazing.

210
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:29,227
In the previous shot,
you can clearly see it on the left.

211
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,770
[Luque] You can see the deformation.

212
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,394
[Alvarez] Pedro, explain those lenses.
Why do they look all deformed?

213
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:37,398
[Luque] Because it's a lens
that compresses the image laterally.

214
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:42,483
So, if you look closely,
out of focus they have an oval shape,

215
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,404
because what it does...
It's an old cinema invention.

216
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,579
It compresses the image laterally

217
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,500
so it fits into a small square
on the screen, and then it's stretched.

218
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,753
[Sayagues] This looks great to me.
It was a very wise decision,

219
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,956
because it gives the whole movie

220
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,419
a feeling that this is not exactly
the real world,

221
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,847
that this takes place in the dimension
of dreams, of nightmares.

222
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,847
But it's something very dreamlike
which separates it from the real world

223
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,395
and allows the fable
to make more sense as well.

224
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,645
[Luque] Of course.
That's the famous made-up world.

225
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,102
[Sayagues] And it also allows us
to do what we want

226
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,154
where we create the things we want,

227
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,485
which stretches the credibility
of the real world.

228
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,534
[Alvarez] It also gives it
a very "retro" feeling.

229
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,209
All the movies we loved
from the '80s and '90s,

230
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,332
they all used anamorphic lenses.

231
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,164
Something else caught my attention here.
I hadn't seen it in a while.

232
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,920
I remember when I saw it, I said,

233
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:48,007
"Wow, the sides are, like, tangled,
or circular."

234
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,594
It doesn't always happen
when they use long lenses,

235
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,349
it happens in some moments.

236
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,940
Incredible, the house of... What's his name?

237
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,642
-[Sayagues] Dave Warren.
-[Luque] Dave Warren.

238
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,273
[Alvarez] Dave Warren.
Look at the amount of detail for a set.

239
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,982
This is not a real house,
but there's so much detail.

240
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,534
I also liked that they kept details
from the first movie,

241
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,783
where you can see the wear in some walls
that he's slid his hand across many times.

242
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,248
Where you can see the wear in some walls
that he's slid his hand across many times.

243
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,790
[Luque] To guide himself.

244
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,493
[Alvarez] To guide himself.

245
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,714
Here you see the details
of the labels in Braille too.

246
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,792
The red labels in Braille.

247
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,216
And it's full of it.

248
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,390
There's one thing I noticed,
that I mentioned to Pedro at the time,

249
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,467
and I don't know if you noticed,

250
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,020
that all the paintings on the wall
are 3D paintings.

251
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,598
-[Luque] Yes, incredible.
-[Alvarez] 3D paintings.

252
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:43,028
[Luque] This shot was filmed
in the first movie, right? The open shot?

253
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,320
[Alvarez] No, no.

254
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:48,321
At one point, we considered recycling
some shots from the first movie,

255
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,527
but we didn't do it.
They don't appear after all.

256
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:56,162
[Luque] Here's our dear Hernandez.
She's out of focus.

257
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,913
[laughter]

258
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,791
I'm picking up the phone.

259
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,425
Who's there? Raul, Rocci.

260
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,093
This is the only road back to town.

261
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,884
[Luque] Of course, she's military, too.

262
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:18,222
[Alvarez] Everyone except Madelyn,
the character of Phoenix,

263
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,900
they're all ex-military.

264
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:25,604
It's a way to give realism
to this idea of who they are,

265
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,405
so capable with weapons and everything.

266
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,950
When you think of mercenaries
and things like that in movies,

267
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,697
it seems a bit fake to me.

268
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,405
But in the United States,

269
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,834
there are a lot of former soldiers,
young veterans.

270
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,376
[Luque] Yes.

271
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,792
Sure, baby.

272
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,956
Whatever you want.

273
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,631
[Alvarez] I like the story about how
this guy started barking in the back

274
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,177
and you didn't like it.

275
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,598
From my perspective
his bark seemed brutal.

276
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:58,178
A good example of how actors sometimes,
if they don't have many lines,

277
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,481
they look for ways
to make their character...

278
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,807
[Luque] Contribute.

279
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,020
[Alvarez] To catch your eye.
I think it's smart.

280
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,027
He also does it again later,
he barks again.

281
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,906
He found something there.
What's the name of the actor?

282
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,906
-[Sayagues] Bobby.
-[Luque] Bobby Schofield.

283
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,621
Or, as we called him, The Bobby.

284
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,418
-[Alvarez] The Bobby.
-[Luque] The Bobby.

285
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,171
[Alvarez] The way this moment
was captured is very good,

286
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,422
because I felt like these two will have
an encounter later on.

287
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,301
That look tells you that they'll face off
by the end of the film,

288
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:37,009
and it ends up being much quicker.

289
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,311
[Luque] Ooh! Of course.

290
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,765
This scene had its complications.

291
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,022
[Alvarez] It was all practical effects.
That blood, it's real?

292
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,568
-[Luque] It's all real.
-[Sayagues] All real.

293
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,029
It was complicated.

294
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:56,453
It was not easy, because the truck
was moving and we wanted her to crash...

295
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,200
[Luque] While still looking forward.

296
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:03,206
[Sayagues] Looking forward while Jim-Bob
was hitting her with the hammer.

297
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,288
-That wasn't easy to do.
-[Luque] But it was done.

298
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,465
[Alvarez] That's Braille as well, right?
On the wall, on the bottom left.

299
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,466
[Luque] Let's see, in her scene...
Yes, she wrote on her wall.

300
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,015
Instead of writing like a normal child,
she wrote with...

301
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,719
[Sayagues] She wrote, "Daddy, I love you,"
so he could read it.

302
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,640
[Alvarez] It says that?
-[Sayagues] It says, "Daddy, I love you."

303
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,193
[Alvarez] How ironic. He's very good.

304
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,277
You have no idea what it is to be alone.

305
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,943
[Alvarez] I think here's a phrase
that we added. It wasn't in the script.

306
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,496
He tells her he lost a daughter before.

307
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,701
Which makes me wonder,
what does she think about that?

308
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,330
Did she know her sister?

309
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,630
I suppose she thought
it was from a previous marriage,

310
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,333
from before she was born, obviously.

311
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,089
This shot is great too.

312
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,016
[Sayagues] This was Juanjo, the cameraman.

313
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,435
He said, "What do you think..."
He's a Spaniard.

314
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,514
"If we finish with the mirror,
it'll look great." And I said, "Yes."

315
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,723
[laughter]

316
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,184
[Alvarez] The shot is great.
And the isolation as well.

317
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,269
[Sayagues] Of course.
She's alone in that tower.

318
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,356
[Alvarez] She's, like,
trapped in the mirror.

319
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:19,320
And it's perfect to end the scene,
showing she's trapped in that place.

320
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,121
[Luque] We built the tower
exactly for that purpose.

321
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,199
There's a lot of symbols in her room.

322
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:28,503
[Alvarez] Another dog
in our dog-killing movies.

323
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,459
Doing what people love
to see in movies, dogs dying.

324
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,338
In Evil Dead they died...
They always die out of frame.

325
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:42,050
[Luque] You can't kill a dog on camera.

326
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:46,809
[Alvarez] There was a short flashback.

327
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,392
[Luque] In the first Don't Breathe,
a dog dies, right?

328
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,318
The dog doesn't die.

329
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,521
[Alvarez] That was to create
constant suspense in the movie,

330
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,901
whether it was going to die or not.

331
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:59,280
[Luque] It was like John Wick where
they kill the dog and shit goes down.

332
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,860
[laughter]

333
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,491
[Alvarez] This is our second one.

334
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,907
This shot is like an echo
of the first movie.

335
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,289
[Luque] Totally. Totally.

336
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:12,589
When they show the house at night
in the other movie.

337
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,802
Who named the dog Shadow?

338
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,631
-[Sayagues] That was him. It was Slang.
-[Luque] Slang, right?

339
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,308
[Sayagues] He had a dog named Shadow.

340
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,976
-[Luque] Really?
-[Alvarez] Yes.

341
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,856
He started early in the movie.
Was that in the script?

342
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,399
[Sayagues] No. It wasn't in the script.

343
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,274
[Alvarez] He always called him
by whistling or something.

344
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,196
[Sayagues] Yes, but we hadn't named him.

345
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,278
[rattling]

346
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,909
[Luque] Where are the boys?

347
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,782
-[Alvarez] It looks amazing.
-[Luque] Amazing.

348
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,363
[Sayagues] This was built in two houses.

349
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,577
This is the set that was built
on location, in order to film exteriors.

350
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,207
But everything that is inside
is in the same house

351
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,539
that was built in a studio.

352
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,715
[Alvarez] Incredible.

353
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,293
Also, very good construction.

354
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,381
It depends on the quality level
of the local builders.

355
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,888
-Look at the roof.
-[Luque] It's incredible.

356
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,219
[Alvarez] The roof,
the things, the plants.

357
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,851
It looks like that climbing plant
has been there for years.

358
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,773
[Luque] And the size of the thing.
That's important.

359
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:13,642
[Luque] And the size of the thing.
That's important.

360
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,398
-[Sayagues] It was gigantic.
-[Luque] And here we cut to the studio.

361
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,446
That was the exterior,
and this is in the studio.

362
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,775
[Alvarez] And this is the famous shot.

363
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,277
[whistles]

364
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,659
They don't know he's blind
until this moment,

365
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,912
when they realize he can't see.

366
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,460
They thought it would be easier.

367
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,630
It would've been easier
to shoot him right there.

368
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,879
[Sayagues] How would they know?

369
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,633
[Alvarez] Once again,
it's what we said in the first movie,

370
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:47,889
where they have prejudices
towards a blind man who cares...

371
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,814
[Luque] The Rubik's Cube is also Braille.

372
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,231
[all] Yes.

373
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,934
[Alvarez] I didn't know they existed.

374
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,773
[Sayagues] We all thought that,
and then Phoenix says to the blind man,

375
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,732
"It looks perfect."

376
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,613
[laughter]

377
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,705
-[Alvarez] Here comes that shot.
-[Luque] Yes.

378
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,121
[Alvarez] Here is the first cut.

379
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,249
[Luque] Right. There is the cut.

380
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,955
[Alvarez] Very well done. Impeccable.

381
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,757
[Luque] Very well. Here it is.

382
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,087
[Alvarez] In the first one
there is a similar moment.

383
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,343
The door opens,
they are looking at the cameraman.

384
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,678
[Luque] Yes. This Is a classic trick
that is hard to miss.

385
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,105
[Alvarez] Nobody thinks,
"The door opened there."

386
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,652
That's incredible, the dance
of the choreography between the camera.

387
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,485
People don't understand
the complexity of all this.

388
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,493
Everyone exactly in their place.

389
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,917
I mean, people don't understand
everything that can go wrong.

390
00:20:55,004 --> 00:21:00,090
Every moment of this shot.
You can spend all day doing this.

391
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,304
This, I remember, was also
one of the first things in the script.

392
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,756
We found a scene that is not here.

393
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:13,391
Besides, at this moment we are back 100%
in the world of Don't Breathe.

394
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,767
[Luque] Totally.

395
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:20,944
Here is Rocci, our favorite MMA fighter.

396
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,816
[Alvarez] Is he as tall as he seems?

397
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:29,074
[Sayagues] No, he is not as tall,
but he looks tough.

398
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,745
And he is strong.

399
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,617
[laughter]

400
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,120
-[Luque] He left it all.
-[Alvarez] Because he is a fighter.

401
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,580
-[Sayagues] MMA fighter, yes.
-[Alvarez] MMA, right.

402
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,165
[Luque] He has several fights on YouTube.

403
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,966
[alarm beeping]

404
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,012
-[Alvarez] Has he made movies?
-[Sayagues] Yes.

405
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,056
He was in White House Down, one of those.

406
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,430
[Luque] With Jason Statham.

407
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:57,936
There is one on each side.
What do we do in that moment?

408
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,772
[Sayagues] To be honest,
that is incredible.

409
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,320
-[Alvarez] Bye, light.
-[Luque] Oof.

410
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,067
[Alvarez] The timing is great.

411
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,160
One very good thing, which looking at it
seems very good to me,

412
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,912
is the casting of all these guys.

413
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,164
These movies sometimes,

414
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,168
when there are the famous henchmen,
as they call it,

415
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:27,003
it could have potentially been
super generic

416
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,214
and all exactly the same,
and actually there is something,

417
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,049
they all have their personalities
and they have their details.

418
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,344
[Sayagues] Yes, they are all different.

419
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,639
[Alvarez] And they have
their particular way of moving

420
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,940
and their strengths are different.

421
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,274
Really good.

422
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:53,202
[Sayagues] This is something
that came up here. We added that bit.

423
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:58,659
[Alvarez] Yes, that was not there.
The plan was to go to the door there.

424
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,627
They are moving.

425
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,422
-No cut there? There could not be a cut?
-[Luque] No.

426
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,671
Not there. Here either. This crossing.

427
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,557
[Sayagues] Adam is one of the nicest

428
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,886
and sweetest persons
that exist in the world,

429
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,187
with a psychopathic face.

430
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,060
[laughter]

431
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,771
[Alvarez] In the overalls.
He has his name there.

432
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:28,776
[Sayagues] Yeah. JB. We always thought
he worked in a mechanic's shop,

433
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:34,578
So now every time he goes to do
a dirty job, he wears his overalls.

434
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,904
[Alvarez] Did he have that haircut?

435
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,660
[Sayagues] No, we gave it to him.

436
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,084
[Luque] A lot of flat iron.

437
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,503
[laughter]

438
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,999
[Alvarez] Lucky for the person
that is doing the captions for this,

439
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,549
the flat iron.

440
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,048
[laughter]

441
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,131
A lot of iron.

442
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,841
[Sayagues] A lot of iron.

443
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,518
[laughter]

444
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,185
[Alvarez] What is in those boxes
from the Blind Man?

445
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,272
[Sayagues] The truth is
we don't have the answer to that.

446
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,071
[Alvarez] No, I remember
that the first time

447
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:10,646
we had put all the things
that the man needed.

448
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,194
We had put all the things
that the man needed.

449
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,616
He had lost his sight at a time
when he was quite old,

450
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:20,540
so there was a room that only had chairs
that he had taken out of the way.

451
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:25,416
[Luque] In the first one there was
that room that was full of stuff, a TV.

452
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,417
[Alvarez] A TV, obsolete things for him.

453
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,968
But this is a new house.
I don't know what he took there.

454
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,847
[Luque] That moment is very...

455
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,844
[Alvarez] And at the level of script,
the moment for people,

456
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,270
as the act of the dog playing dead comes,

457
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,394
there is some effect,
there must be something.

458
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:50,775
[Sayagues] That is the real dog,
but the actor is touching it.

459
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,400
[Alvarez] It's, like, paused.

460
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,607
[Luque] He is not breathing...

461
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,696
His breathing is paused.

462
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,704
[Alvarez] And this was always
in the script.

463
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,958
If there is something
that was going to make people

464
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,211
at least start to feel pity
for the blind guy,

465
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,008
it was going to be this moment, right?

466
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:17,089
Finding his dog, he discovers
that someone put a bullet in him.

467
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,513
[Sayagues] A bullet.

468
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,765
[Alvarez] Where did you get
the scar on the face?

469
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,223
Did you make it based on the first movie?

470
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,148
-[Sayagues] Yes.
-[Alvarez] Did they imagine it?

471
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,567
[Sayagues] Well, they took pictures
from the first movie and...

472
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,486
[Alvarez] I remember
that there was something,

473
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,814
I don't know if the contact lenses
were the same or...

474
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,149
[Sayagues] Contacts from the same person,

475
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:42,956
the same person who did everything
took it and did it all again.

476
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,158
-[Alvarez] Oh, it was the same person.
-[Sayagues] Yes.

477
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,125
[Alvarez] The house is very familiar.

478
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,173
A lot of people watch the movie
and think it's the same house.

479
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,672
The hall inside looks alike.

480
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:59,472
On the outside it doesn't look like
the house in the first movie.

481
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,301
[Luque] This one looks
like a country house.

482
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,396
[Alvarez] These Detroit houses
are all real houses.

483
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,100
It looks more country because
there is nothing else on the block.

484
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:13,858
[Luque] Of course, but remember
the first one was square.

485
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:18,942
[Alvarez] Thirty years ago,
that block was full of houses.

486
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:23,329
They started burning and falling apart,

487
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:29,081
and then Detroit gets the block back
and they cut the grass.

488
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,719
For those looking for the turkey baster.

489
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:42,970
Did it show up yet? It did.

490
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,346
[Sayagues] Yes, it did.

491
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,768
[Alvarez] The turkey baster
was on the wall in the back.

492
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,562
[Luque] A good pause.

493
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,515
[Sayagues] Before Jim-Bob shoots.

494
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,855
[Alvarez] The infamous turkey baster.

495
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,446
You don't see it again.

496
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,031
[Luque] Ouch. What a hit.

497
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,412
[Alvarez] It was one of those things
when you think

498
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,465
you don't need the Blind Man,
now you beg for the Blind Man to come.

499
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,923
The propane was well placed there.

500
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,804
[Luque] It's the shot
from the second unit.

501
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,305
"Go and make that shot."

502
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,104
[Sayagues] And the gas there, it shows.

503
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,680
[Alvarez] The first was the same.

504
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:37,316
We were constantly filming a unit
and sending the second unit to re-film,

505
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,866
to pick up details, close-ups,
and little things that are left behind.

506
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,990
[Sayagues] The second unit always
owes something. This and that.

507
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,078
[Luque] But they are indispensable.

508
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,910
[Alvarez] You went and directed that unit,

509
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,245
and then you would let him do it
and then watch it after?

510
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,205
[Sayagues] No. Sometimes I went.
Many times I went.

511
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,381
-[Alvarez] To be close.
-[Sayagues] Yes.

512
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,378
I went many times to see
what they were doing.

513
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:03,883
-[Alvarez] Who played basketball there?
-[Sayagues] Someone put it there.

514
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,428
-[Alvarez] Who played basketball there?
-[Sayagues] Someone put it there.

515
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,100
[Luque] It was a big argument.

516
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,178
What are we going to do
with the basketball hoop?

517
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,433
-[Sayagues] Let's leave it.
-[Luque] Leave it.

518
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,638
[Alvarez] It was there before.

519
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:17,318
[Sayagues] Probably the Blind Man
never noticed it was there.

520
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,644
[laughter]

521
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,696
[Alvarez] Maybe Madelyn played.

522
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,525
[Luque] We shall see.

523
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,455
The puzzle if this is on location...

524
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,038
This was on location after all, right?
The garage?

525
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,339
[Sayagues] Can't remember.
It was all on location.

526
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,339
[Luque] For example, the truck.
Who is driving?

527
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,511
[Alvarez] I think the truck
wasn't his, either.

528
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:50,344
These things, as we said,
as the world of the Blind Man moves,

529
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:54,522
it seems to me that he did not
buy this house.

530
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,098
[laughter]

531
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,604
He didn't buy it.

532
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,608
I think someone who died
used to live in this house,

533
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,406
someone died of an overdose
living there and they used it

534
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:09,954
as one of those crack houses
and he took it and repaired it.

535
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,247
I don't think it was--

536
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,951
A lot of the things we see
on the wall there

537
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,537
don't belong to the Blind Man, I'm sure.

538
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,213
Because he didn't have so many things.

539
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,462
If those were all his things,
movers would have been involved

540
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,418
from the other house with all his things,

541
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,347
and he would have ran away
after the events from the first movie,

542
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,720
and he wouldn't have stayed there
for even two minutes.

543
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,974
[Luque] The Blind Man is hiding there
in the truck, clearly.

544
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,725
[laughter]

545
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,890
[Alvarez] He wants something else.

546
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,149
That is the brother.
It's hard to put things together.

547
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:50,658
Since they all call each other "brother,"
it seems they are all brothers.

548
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,739
[Luque] My kids asked,
"Dad, is that really your brother?"

549
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,409
I say,
"No, that's what we call each other."

550
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,966
[Alvarez] That was one of the first gags
that we thought of.

551
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,292
[Luque] This one is so good.

552
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,628
[Alvarez] He was going to
fill his face with...

553
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,340
[laughter]

554
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:14,098
[Luque] It was difficult to film that,
because the guy couldn't breathe.

555
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,145
He was very uncomfortable.

556
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,269
[Alvarez] Is that makeup?

557
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,851
[Sayagues] It's makeup,
but he had to keep his mouth closed,

558
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,483
because if he opened it,
the illusion would fail.

559
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,108
[grunts]

560
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,944
[Alvarez] That's me making the sound,
you can't hear it, but I went...

561
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,155
[screeching]

562
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,833
We recorded it like this in the consensus
that we had some sounds that worked.

563
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,035
They brought me a microphone
and I started to do it.

564
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,122
-My contribution.
-[Luque] You did it like Mel Gibson.

565
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,503
They say he does that in the sessions.

566
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:49,132
[Alvarez] In the audio mix sessions
and things like that.

567
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,468
I think this was in the first one, right?
I knew he was military.

568
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,596
[Luque] Oh, what a moment.

569
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:03,226
His mouth was full of blood
because they put a hole in his cheek.

570
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,109
[Sayagues] And his lip is cut--
a great challenge.

571
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,439
[Luque] What's the need, God.

572
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,989
[Alvarez] "Dead SEAL, bro."

573
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:13,445
Bro, I love this. "Bro."

574
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,951
[Sayagues] Bobby added a lot
to that character.

575
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,460
We had to restrain him
because he was always adding things,

576
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,664
and we cut it a bit,
but what was left is great.

577
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,051
[Luque] The Blind Man here...

578
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,220
is thinking about his next move.

579
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,923
Does he know that she is in the box?
Yes, he yelled at the box.

580
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,424
Does he know that she is in the box?
Yes, he yelled at the box.

581
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,513
[Alvarez] Well, I think he trusts that
she reached the box, but he isn't sure.

582
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,724
[Luque] Phoenix is very well-trained.

583
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,685
[Alvarez] He trusts that he trained
her well and that she has arrived.

584
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,191
Especially if he hears noises
in the house still.

585
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:52,024
They're in the house because
they haven't found her yet, right?

586
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,735
If not, they would have already left.

587
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,327
But this is also
one of the first times in the saga

588
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:03,958
that you see him vulnerable, in trouble,
thinking about what he's going to do.

589
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,460
[Luque] Of course. It was like the shark
was there. He didn't know where he was.

590
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,508
[Alvarez] It appears and disappears
in general,

591
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,052
but this is the first time
we started to see it.

592
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,006
Only a little bit, because there are
very few windows the film gives you

593
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,761
to see what is happening with him.

594
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,264
I love this shot, there it is.

595
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,025
That shot from The Shining.

596
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,478
[Luque] That shot from The Shining
always needs to be there.

597
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:33,442
[Sayagues] Especially if you have an actor
with that look, you have to do it.

598
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,321
[Luque] Place the camera down there.

599
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,125
[Alvarez] When you know
where the movie is going,

600
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,417
I think they knew as well--

601
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:49,920
They knew he was not going to kill her.
He has to take her. He's trying.

602
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:56,347
[Luque] He is trying to make her get out,
like smoking a beehive.

603
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,265
[Sayagues] He is pushing her.

604
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:07,149
[Alvarez] This is where the accent
pops out. What is that accent? Irish?

605
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,023
-[Sayagues] British.
-[Alvarez] British.

606
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,651
[Luque] Alvacast there
breaking everything.

607
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,324
Very good records.

608
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,868
[Alvarez] Alvacast,
for those who don't know,

609
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,786
is a Uruguayan heavy metal band.

610
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,864
[Sayagues] From the '80s, early '90s.

611
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:31,086
[Alvarez] But why Alvacast?
The Uruguayan element amused you more?

612
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,589
[Sayagues] Well, because we wanted
to put a patch

613
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,798
with a half motorcycle logo
on this guy's back,

614
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:43,227
and we thought, "Let's do
something Uruguayan that looks cute."

615
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,805
[Luque] And the truth is
that Alvacast's typography is great.

616
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,857
[Sayagues] It's great. It looks very good
and it also meant something

617
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,231
because I also moved a lot

618
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,983
in that metal scene of those times,
so it was good.

619
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:56,907
[Alvarez] Yes, and they are also
one of those pioneering bands

620
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,987
at a time when no one did that,
that is something admirable.

621
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:06,247
[Luque] Do you remember that he also
wore that shirt in Spider's Web?

622
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:14,542
[Alvarez]
I love the "no gun" concept moment.

623
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,212
If the guy shoots
and blows up the whole place,

624
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,515
then he has no choice
than to hit the shovels.

625
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:25,060
[Sayagues] I love that, it was his idea,
what Stephen did,

626
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,559
-entering with his hand like asking...
-[Luque] Almost apologizing.

627
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,267
[Sayagues] Apologizing,
as if asking for peace, with fear.

628
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,022
[Alvarez] It's like he's hiding the...

629
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,774
[Sayagues] Yes, but he has a club
in the other hand.

630
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,400
[laughter]

631
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,028
[Luque] When he steps on the cap,
was that his idea?

632
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,530
[Sayagues] Could be.

633
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,664
[Luque] That fight is brutal.
It took days of filming.

634
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,742
We filmed parts and the second unit.

635
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,419
[Sayagues] Yes.

636
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,714
[Alvarez] It's one of those things
in post-production,

637
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,338
a shame that people
are left without listening

638
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,467
to one of the music queues
that were better

639
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,139
than those that Roque did for this fight.

640
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:07,265
He made a brutal composition
with flamenco stomping,

641
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,347
with orchestra and everything,
it was amazing.

642
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,058
But then we realized, at some point,

643
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,816
that without music
it was rawer and had more tension,

644
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,988
and in post-production,
we ended up taking it out.

645
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,614
The truth is the fight is very good, raw,

646
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,571
you hear every little noise
of the knife, the hand.

647
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,874
Now, when he grabs his fingers,
you hear the fingers breaking.

648
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,076
[grunts]

649
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:41,887
-[Luque] And there you have it.
-[Alvarez] They are not faking it.

650
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,465
[Sayagues] No, they fought hard, for real.

651
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,300
[Luque] Besides, Rocci is a fighter,

652
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:51,855
and Stephen Lang is like a method actor,
he goes all out.

653
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,935
[Alvarez] Yes, you can tell
that these two...

654
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,862
[Sayagues] I remember
when they were done filming this,

655
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:03,192
Stephen Lang, who likes to brag
about his physical strength,

656
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:07,200
when they finished, he said,
"Rodo, this guy is tough, for real."

657
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,497
[laughter]

658
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,952
[Alvarez] He is a professional fighter.

659
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,212
[Luque] Poor Phoenix
in the box full of water.

660
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,673
[Alvarez] It made sense
because water was always the idea

661
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:29,135
and the logic is that water pressure
doesn't let the door open.

662
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,766
There is going to be
so much outward pressure

663
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,063
that it doesn't allow her
to open the door.

664
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,232
I remember reading
after we had written all this,

665
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,693
that in real life
that cable won't kill you.

666
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:46,993
[laughter]

667
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,991
That the water has to be very salty

668
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,574
for it to transmit electricity
in a way that kills you.

669
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,874
[Luque] Oh, I see.

670
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,077
[Sayagues] But it makes you feel
a little bad, maybe.

671
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,536
[Alvarez] Probably...

672
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:02,168
But in the movie, you see it
and they are going to touch the cable.

673
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,923
[Sayagues]
We had our Hollywood moment here.

674
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,095
[Luque] It was a real explosion.

675
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,549
-With real fire.
-[Sayagues] We did it for real.

676
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,932
With real fire, total wild card.

677
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,013
[laughter]

678
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,316
[Alvarez] Christian Zagia.

679
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,647
-[Luque] Stellar appearance.
-[Alvarez] Uruguayan actor.

680
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,575
About to make his entrance in the movie.

681
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,411
How is the basement not on fire?

682
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,994
Maybe the Blind Man painted the walls
with fire-resistant stuff.

683
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,419
[chuckling]

684
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,039
[Luque] Oh, no, Phoenix is dying.

685
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,466
Go, man!

686
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,219
[banging]

687
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,349
[Sayagues] We have to recognize
Stephen Lang,

688
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:54,429
who crawled on that basement floor
for a week, nonstop.

689
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,856
-[Luque] Nonstop and giving ideas.
-[Sayagues] Yes.

690
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,272
[Alvarez] How does he have
the strength to throw that box?

691
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,524
[Luque] And to move
the boxes full of water.

692
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:08,360
[Alvarez] Yes, that weighs three tons.
This guy has superpowers.

693
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,495
[Luque] Look what he does.

694
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,995
[Alvarez] Against the wall,
he for sure can.

695
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,286
-There he goes back to the movie.
-[Sayagues] Go on, go on.

696
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,754
[grunting]

697
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,090
[Luque] Here he is opening...

698
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,006
-[spluttering]
-Breathe.

699
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,386
[coughs, gasps]

700
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,514
[Alvarez] You said the other day
that this line was not there,

701
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:35,685
when he says, "Breathe."

702
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,309
-[Sayagues] It wasn't in the script.
-[Luque] It wasn't in the original script.

703
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,312
[Alvarez] A journalist talking about
the movie found it interesting

704
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,736
that he said "breathe" so many times...

705
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,697
for a movie called Don't Breathe.

706
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,661
You saw that painting there on the wall,

707
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,535
the painting that is there,
the squares are in 3D

708
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,664
so that the blind can touch them
and appreciate the art.

709
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,667
This moment is great, and it's all makeup.

710
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,922
-[Sayagues] All makeup.
-[Luque] All makeup.

711
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,673
[Alvarez] The eyes as well?

712
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,507
[Sayagues] I think there is a bit
of post-production in the eyes

713
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,514
to make them red, but it's 99% makeup.

714
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,470
[Alvarez] Like ten hours in the chair.

715
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:22,229
[Sayagues] They made, like, a prosthesis,
too. A long time.

716
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,435
[Alvarez] For one take,
the things that are done.

717
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,696
Cover the exits.

718
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:40,159
Incredible that the bad guy
really comes back into story.

719
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,210
I don't know
what he was doing all this time.

720
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,038
He was taking care of the bridge there.

721
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,923
We asked him what he was doing.

722
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:53,256
He didn't want to get his hands dirty,
and he probably thought,

723
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,637
“I'm going to buy something
and you guys go find the little girl

724
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,344
and we'll see you at home."

725
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,850
Because he thought
it was going to be that easy, right?

726
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,147
Clearly, he realized that it was not.

727
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,274
They're still down here.

728
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:30,005
There is no flare in the movie.
There are no lenses there.

729
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,802
[Luque] Yes, there is a little bit
of anamorphic flare.

730
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,755
[Alvarez] But there's not a huge flare.

731
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,387
[Luque] It's not a big deal,
but there is some.

732
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:39,559
[Alvarez] Yeah.

733
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,470
[Luque] There it is.

734
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:43,767
Good.

735
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,020
[Alvarez] It looks like the same door
from the first one, but--

736
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,853
[Luque] Yes. All those...

737
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:55,114
[Alvarez] This is something that always
got me very excited about the script.

738
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:59,322
That it tells you more
about the blind guy's life,

739
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,500
what he does, the idea that
there would be half a house.

740
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,045
I remember they were talking about this,

741
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:12,217
that there's a section
of the greenhouse he uses,

742
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,262
and then the other is neglected
and all overgrown.

743
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,717
I remember he said it was
like a representation of the character.

744
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:25,227
There is a part of himself that he
can control, and another out of control.

745
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,233
<i>Luque) Yeah.</i>

746
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,612
The Blind Man has to deal with life.

747
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,990
[Alvarez] Here he's entering the part
that is all overgrown.

748
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,740
He hits like an I, right?

749
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,917
[Luque] Yes, he goes behind the house,
the part totally out of control.

750
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,542
It's not me you need to be scared of...

751
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,469
This greenhouse is also set in a studio.

752
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,310
[Alvarez] The character's clothes
look nice, too.

753
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:06,229
-[Sayagues] '80s style.
-[Luque] Yeah.

754
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:10,809
[Alvarez] That's Carlos Rosario,
our costume designer,

755
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,778
who also worked on the first one,

756
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:19,156
and he always likes to spice up
the characters, not leave them plain.

757
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,486
-[Luque] It's a gender issue, right?
-[Sayagues] Yeah.

758
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:27,953
[Alvarez] I feel it enhances them,
gives them certain importance.

759
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,503
It removes the generic quality.

760
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,955
<i>Luque) Yeah.</i>

761
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,711
-No!
-[gunshot]

762
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,042
[Alvarez] But the blind guy
looks almost the same.

763
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,344
[Luque] The blind guy has to be iconic.

764
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:41,048
[Sayagues] It's like his uniform.

765
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,806
[Alvarez] Yeah, the military pants
and the muscle shirt.

766
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,607
[Luque] This scene is amazing.

767
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,278
[Raylan] You really don't remember me,
do you?

768
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,607
He kneels down to her height.

769
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,237
[Alvarez] This is so good.

770
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,947
What would the audience think here?

771
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,659
How many people already knew?

772
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:12,337
Surely they didn't know
how things would unfold, right?

773
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:18,210
But imagine what that was like for her,
thinking about her mother all the time,

774
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,636
and suddenly this shows up.

775
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,511
This is in a studio, you said?

776
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,263
[Luque] Yes, it's all set in a studio.

777
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:30,806
[Alvarez] So no sunlight, but studio
lights gleaming through the glass.

778
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,360
[Luque] Yes, it's all based on street lights, the lights from the house...

779
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:41,359
that always create these two tones
which were also present

780
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,159
in part one, right?

781
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,657
[Sayagues] We go back to that opening
scene in which he finds her in the street.

782
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,001
Ashes from the house fire
are still falling down.

783
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:53,999
[Luque] A terrible fire.

784
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:59,547
[Alvarez] I think this is the only time
during the saga you may see him home,

785
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,344
at daylight, a nicely lit scene.

786
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,799
-[Luque] Yeah.
-[Alvarez] With a hopeful feeling.

787
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,057
[Sayagues] Here he's choosing to stay
there and be this girl's father,

788
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,140
when he hears on the news
where she really came from.

789
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:20,614
[Alvarez] And here it's when Raylan
runs into her, finds her.

790
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,489
[Sayagues] I like it when these mystery
movies show you a flashback

791
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,913
that gives a new meaning to what
you already saw and adds a new piece

792
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,457
for you to keep building up the story.

793
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,035
[Alvarez] Most movies would use it like

794
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,667
-a climax scene, in the last 20 minutes.
-[Sayagues] Yes.

795
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,169
[Alvarez] The good thing about
this movie, Don't Breathe,

796
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,878
is you do nothing in the first 45 minutes.

797
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,761
We're here and we have 45 minutes left
with twists and turning points.

798
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,346
With twists.

799
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,016
[Sayagues] Doing this was fun.

800
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,067
[Alvarez] This reminds me of RoboCop.

801
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,691
[Sayagues] Yes. A bit of RoboCop
and Predator, too.

802
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,239
-[Luque] Predator.
-[laughter]

803
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,738
[Alvarez] Speaking of the jungle.

804
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,695
[Luque] And the Vulcan spinning,

805
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,206
chopping down trees.

806
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,040
Take her to the truck
while I hunt this motherfucker.

807
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,920
[Alvarez] So good, this set.
The wood turned out great.

808
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,839
[Alvarez] So good, this set.
The wood turned out great.

809
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:24,920
[Sayagues] Yes.

810
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,257
[Luque] In part one, the blind guy
also had his plants, his indoor growth.

811
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,013
[Alvarez] It's the small one,
you can barely notice it.

812
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,561
Most people miss it.
They won't understand it.

813
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:38,267
[Luque] Thing is, in part one, entering
the basement means something else.

814
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,437
[Sayagues] I find it amusing
how this scene turned out,

815
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,771
especially thanks to Bobby.

816
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:49,578
I find his physical performance amazing.

817
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,450
-[Alvarez] Yes.
-[Sayagues chuckles]

818
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,330
[Sayagues] It's scary, this guy
totally out of control, with a crazy face.

819
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,161
[laughter]

820
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:02,466
I feel that even knowing he can't
hurt her now, he'll slap her anyways

821
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,963
-for sure.
-[Alvarez] He can't help himself.

822
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,465
[grunting]

823
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,342
See.

824
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,137
It seems like he grabbed her.

825
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,262
<i>Luque) Yeah.</i>

826
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,219
Oh, this is a great scene.

827
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,304
-Bobby's face...
-[laughter]

828
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:21,230
Everything is quite complex,
there's a lot of...

829
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,812
of prosthetics, right?

830
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,991
[Alvarez] Oh, also this scene
with that shovel.

831
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,408
[Luque] That shovel!

832
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,987
[Alvarez] That shovel is super heavy.

833
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:35,199
[Luque] We could not find any.

834
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,581
-We had to ask for it to be made.
-[Sayagues] Yes.

835
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:41,538
[Alvarez] Amazing, that scene.
Another great moment

836
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,921
is watching the shots
and watching that head tilt. Amazing.

837
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,587
[laughter]

838
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,014
The guy is drooling.

839
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:56,390
The idea here in the script is
that Phoenix would see him

840
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,941
for what he really was,
that she'd see this violent nature of his

841
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,360
that obviously she'd never seen before.

842
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,189
[Sayagues] He had a monster inside

843
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:10,696
that finally came out.
It was provoked and it came out.

844
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:17,202
[Alvarez] And here's Jim-Bob
seeing that his brother has died.

845
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,876
-[Luque] What a scene...
-[Alvarez] A lot of repression.

846
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,044
Look at his face there, God.

847
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,838
[laughter]

848
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,256
[Luque] He looks like
a Francis Bacon painting.

849
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,381
[Alvarez] For God's sake.

850
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:33,762
[Sayagues] You always want these
characters to take this personally.

851
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:39,893
[Alvarez] It's known here there's a fight
coming, like in every classic action film

852
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,395
from the '80s and the '90s,
whenever one of the brothers gets killed--

853
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,568
Well, you know.

854
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:49,192
In Die Hard, he was killed...

855
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,735
Enough of these silly games.

856
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,162
All these emotions, nicely done.

857
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,491
[Luque] Yes, it's great.
It's also important being able

858
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:03,078
to connect, at least, with these guys.

859
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,163
Even if they're the bad guys.

860
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,749
[Sayagues] Interestingly,
the dynamic between them changed.

861
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,632
He's dragging her.
He's the monster he's always been.

862
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,180
-And she is starting to notice it.
-[Luque] And she's like...

863
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:18,009
[Alvarez] You never thought of using
that weapon in the opening long shot?

864
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,765
Showing there was a weapon there?

865
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,564
[Sayagues] I can't remember
if we thought of it or not.

866
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,358
[Alvarez] That came in late.

867
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,685
You called me at some point

868
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,397
and told me we had to plant a gun
for the Blind Man.

869
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:34,109
I don't know if this was something
Slang said, or someone else...

870
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,698
who said he wanted--

871
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,996
He needed to bring his own weapon.

872
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,701
[Sayagues] Thing is, this gun shows up
at the beginning, when they're training.

873
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,661
[Luque] The gun is in the beginning.

874
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:51,130
[Alvarez] People say, "One dog was killed
already. Please don't kill two."

875
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,924
[Luque] This dog was mean, this pit bull.

876
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,474
[Alvarez] It was?

877
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,394
[Sayagues] There was a good one
and a bad one.

878
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,517
[Alvarez] There's always a good one
and a bad one.

879
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,393
[laughter]

880
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,440
And you had a doll too.

881
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:15,276
[Sayagues] We had a doll, actually.
Pedro and I acted like puppet masters.

882
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,485
[Alvarez] Where is it?
Did you bring that doll?

883
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,572
[Luque] It must be with the guy
who made it, quite a big shot.

884
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,656
[Alvarez] Yes.

885
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,709
[Sayagues] Those are expensive, and they
can be used later for something else.

886
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,629
[Alvarez] That doll was nicely done.

887
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:29,706
[Sayagues] Very nice, yeah.

888
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,292
[Alvarez] The difference in part one,
remember, is we had

889
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,924
a stuffed dog we bought at some gift shop.

890
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,471
[Luque] And this is Phoenix's stunt?

891
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,299
[Sayagues] Yes, this is...

892
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,883
-[Luque] Dunja.
-[Alvarez] What's that?

893
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,140
-That was on a set?
-[Sayagues] No, on location.

894
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,768
[Luque] This is in the studio.
For short shots.

895
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,224
[Alvarez] See the background.

896
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,901
[Luque] And this is on location.

897
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,900
[Sayagues] It was raining.
You can see the raindrops there.

898
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,528
That was a tricky day,
5:00 in the morning and raining.

899
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,535
[Luque] This is a different set.

900
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,704
[Alvarez] Rain would flood that house.

901
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,248
[Sayagues] This is the doll.

902
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,871
[Luque] That's me.

903
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,079
Sometimes it's me
and sometimes the real dog.

904
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,211
[Alvarez] You were acting
as puppet master.

905
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,760
[Luque] At some points I did, I liked it.

906
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,009
[Sayagues] Look here, there's a scene
where we act as puppet masters.

907
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,888
Let's see, that one there. That one, yes.

908
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,015
[Alvarez] It works fine.

909
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:31,484
[Luque] You have to take it seriously,
as funny as it might be.

910
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,528
[Sayagues] It would never cross your mind
that what you're seeing,

911
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,232
the back of the dog's head,
is fake, it's a doll.

912
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,278
The back of the dog's head,
is fake, it's a doll.

913
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:42,988
[Luque] Such a great scene, this one.
When he decides, "I can't kill him, dude."

914
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,790
-[Alvarez] "Enough dogs have died today."
-[Sayagues] I remember talking to him--

915
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,959
We realized while shooting this scene
that what was at stake

916
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,209
for the character wasn't his life,
because the dog wouldn't kill him.

917
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,540
He had a gun.
He could easily kill the dog.

918
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:58,128
It was his honor at stake.
He was going to break his moral code.

919
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:02,932
[Alvarez] So, he may be a monster and all,
but at least

920
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,343
on a certain level,

921
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,894
if there's something he loves,
it's animals, he's a dog lover.

922
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,315
[Luque] Sure.

923
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,268
[screaming]

924
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:15,069
Phoenix!

925
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,235
Well, he took her.

926
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,902
He listens. He's got a fine ear.

927
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,080
[Alvarez] For Raul,
this is his first scene,

928
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,033
and then you realize he's not a bad guy.

929
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,541
He does it carefully, with compassion.

930
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,794
I loved that in the script,

931
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:44,303
the way in which he was going to cross
to the other side and leave the dog caged.

932
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:47,351
[Sayagues] That metal frame
was really heavy,

933
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:51,477
remember, super heavy,
and Slang lifted it like it was nothing.

934
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,650
[Luque] It was something
totally custom made,

935
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,319
because such a thing didn't exist.

936
00:51:56,405 --> 00:52:00,114
It was something we had in mind,

937
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,612
but it didn't have an equivalent
in real life.

938
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,751
[Sayagues] Raylan.

939
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,501
They had this all planned out, I think.

940
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,966
[Luque] Where's the cooler?
Didn't they carry organs?

941
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,765
[Sayagues] That was a magic trick.

942
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:31,893
[Alvarez] Of course, at the beginning
after the ad, you could see that cooler...

943
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,275
and that was another step forward
in the arc.

944
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,650
[Luque] What are you doing?
Have you gone crazy? Your dog is in there.

945
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,904
[Sayagues] A great thing here,

946
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,532
is we just saw that
there's a difference between them.

947
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,115
The blind guy couldn't kill the dog,
even though it was not his,

948
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:53,747
but this guy, being its owner,
does not care.

949
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,295
So they have quite different moral codes.

950
00:52:56,382 --> 00:53:01,127
[Alvarez] With the script,
we also wanted to raise the topic of...

951
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:05,680
fatherhood, and who has--

952
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,349
Whether or not you are entitled
to your children's love,

953
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:12,099
in a story about this guy, the blind guy,

954
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,055
who loves her
like she was his own daughter

955
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,811
and takes care of her,
despite being such a monster.

956
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:20,145
Takes better care of her as a father
than the other one,

957
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,857
who is her real father,
but willing to kill her for his reasons.

958
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:28,616
It was a question about who deserves
the affection of these children.

959
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,447
So this guy with a dog,

960
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:34,876
the story with the dog also represented
this same question.

961
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,080
In a certain way, the dog's father,
who was Raylan,

962
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,164
wouldn't hesitate to kill him,

963
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:45,379
so the blind guy ends up being
a better father for that dog.

964
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:49,340
At least he takes care of him
and eventually earns the dog's affection.

965
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:54,271
-[Luque] Yes. It's the same thing.
-[Alvarez] And he'll save him.

966
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,939
[Sayagues]
Here, fire is destroying the house,

967
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,392
and he risks himself to set the dog free.

968
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,148
[Alvarez] He risks his own life
to save this dog.

969
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,031
We'll have to investigate
in another Don't Breathe story,

970
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:10,487
when there are more movies,
what happened to him.

971
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,539
Surely a dog saved his life at some point.

972
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,583
-[Luque] Yes.
-[Alvarez] Sure, in war or somewhere.

973
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:22,916
There must be a past story
that made him love animals so much.

974
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:27,846
[Luque] Maybe through the loneliness
this character experienced

975
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,640
when he lost his daughter,
maybe the dog helped him through it.

976
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,638
The dog saved him, in a way.

977
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:36,642
[Sayagues] That was a fantastic job
from the stuntmen

978
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,565
who jumped head first like that,
just like you saw it.

979
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,476
[Alvarez] Another reference to part one.

980
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:45,188
[Sayagues] But the other way around.
It's his turn now to be up there.

981
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,319
-[Luque] And much worse.
-[Sayagues] Yes.

982
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,615
[Luque] With fire underneath.

983
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:52,912
[Alvarez] He then remembered Alex
from the first movie, and was like, "Oh."

984
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,581
But well, he was lucky enough
to fall on top of that.

985
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:59,126
[Sayagues] This shot must be
the most epic shot in the whole movie

986
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:02,456
because all the fire,
or most of it, is real.

987
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:06,167
-[Luque] It's real.
-[Sayagues] So it was very time-consuming

988
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,923
and all the Belgrade firemen were there,

989
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:13,224
and everything was set up
for Stephen Lang to do this...

990
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,894
with the house actually on fire.

991
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,347
[Luque] Remember we struggled
to put that fire out?

992
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,023
[Sayagues] Yes, yes.

993
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,100
[Alvarez] You also set
the real set on fire, right?

994
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,152
-[Luque and Sayagues] Yes.
-[Alvarez] It was useless.

995
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:30,530
[Luque] Useless. It had windows
with bars that were on fire.

996
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:34,078
[Alvarez] What I'd like to know
is if those were called flame bars.

997
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:38,499
[Sayagues] No, look what it was.
Well, it was like that, but much larger

998
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,293
and also the house caught on fire
in two minutes.

999
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,791
[Alvarez] Of course, that's madness.

1000
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,459
[Alvarez] Of course, that's madness.

1001
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,338
[Luque] In Detroit.

1002
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:52,179
[Alvarez] It's the third time
we've burned a house for our movies.

1003
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:57,807
[Luque] Yeah, I have a lot of experience
with burning houses.

1004
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,979
[Alvarez] The cabin caught fire.

1005
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,524
The Girl in the Spider's Web
also ended with a burning house.

1006
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,567
[Luque] That huge hotel, remember?

1007
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:07,691
[Alvarez] We should've set
this one on fire.

1008
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,442
[laughter]

1009
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,160
This is Detroit, right?

1010
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:16,829
-[Luque] Well, the exterior is.
-[Alvarez] Yeah, the exterior.

1011
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:21,034
-[Sayagues] This is...
-[Luque] Close to the Latin Quarter.

1012
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,540
[Sayagues] This is Serbia.
Yes, it's Serbia.

1013
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,792
[Luque] Yes, it's a small town
called Arandelovac.

1014
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,123
[Sayagues] Arandelovac.

1015
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,834
[Alvarez] I saw that fish tank and said,
"Wow, that must explode."

1016
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,669
[laughter]

1017
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:35,882
Like every '90s movie,
if there's a fish tank...

1018
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,638
[Luque] Those always explode
in slow motion.

1019
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,471
[Alvarez] Showing a fish in the back
gasping for its last breath.

1020
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,680
[Luque] Yes.

1021
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,903
[Alvarez] This scene was longer.

1022
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:54,359
We censored the original scene
in which Raylan showed her how to smoke.

1023
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,069
[Luque] This image is amazing.

1024
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,995
[Alvarez] I thought it was great,

1025
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,619
because I felt it was
a good way of representing

1026
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,499
the idea of, if you were thinking
that it wasn't that bad

1027
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:09,878
that Raylan had taken her,
the worst scenario is bad parenting,

1028
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:15,134
but you see he's showing her how to smoke
in the first scene. Off to a bad start!

1029
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,302
Off to a bad start.

1030
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:22,353
-But we did shoot it, right?
-[Sayagues] We did.

1031
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:26,182
The scene ended up being too long
and it didn't get to the point.

1032
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:31,567
The key is always to enter a scene
close to the point you need to make clear.

1033
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:36,493
[Alvarez] Also I think the rating would
have killed us, we'd become NC-17.

1034
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,569
[Sayagues]
Yes, it was sort of troublesome.

1035
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:42,786
[Alvarez] Although, in Stand By Me,
there is a boy smoking.

1036
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:47,245
[Luque] Those times were different.
People smoked inside a hospital.

1037
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,752
What was my mother's name?

1038
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,925
[Sayagues] I love how this scene turned
out, how the shots get narrowed.

1039
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,754
She starts asking
increasingly intimate questions,

1040
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,215
more relevant for her.

1041
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,597
There's some sort of intimacy here.
I really like...

1042
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,895
the way we shot from the sides.

1043
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,223
[Luque] Yes, more and more closed.

1044
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,900
[Sayagues] He touches her,
she lets him touch her,

1045
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,729
like she's falling under his spell.

1046
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:16,908
[Luque] She's falling into the spiderweb.
Remember what we said?

1047
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,951
Everything that man told you is a lie.

1048
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,949
What happened to him?

1049
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,329
[Alvarez] Yes, it scares me to think where
the spider might be, it will show up soon

1050
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,832
but it's around somewhere.

1051
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,708
[Luque] Hanging from the ceiling.

1052
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,963
[Alvarez]
See the excess of ramps in this room.

1053
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,293
[laughter]

1054
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:39,050
That's why it's there now.

1055
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,971
Jesus.

1056
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:49,599
We knew exactly what we were writing
up to this point.

1057
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:54,278
From here on is
when we had a bunch of alternatives.

1058
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:58,699
It always started here. I think the first
version was the one with the heart,

1059
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,152
and everything
that's going to happen next.

1060
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:04,659
Then we moved on
to two alternative versions

1061
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,209
and then we went back to the one
with the heart, that was great.

1062
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:12,505
And for the ones with a great memory,
those who remember that "wanted" face,

1063
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:17,506
his face is on TV, on the news about...

1064
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:19,086
[Luque] Organ trafficking.

1065
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:22,219
-[Alvarez] Organ trafficking, right?
-[Sayagues] There's a man.

1066
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:25,267
[Luque] That's the gang of bad guys
who are really bad.

1067
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,969
[laughter]

1068
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:30,398
But they were nice people.
With their criminal records.

1069
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,566
[laughter]

1070
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,157
[Alvarez] Genius. I think this moment is...

1071
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,950
[Luque] Here's where everything goes away.

1072
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:47,157
[Alvarez] An iconic scene of this saga.

1073
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,788
It's like you convince yourself
her mother is dead,

1074
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:55,669
but you don't realize the whole story
is a lie from the blind guy.

1075
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,249
Until now.

1076
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,344
She looks like Elvira.

1077
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,717
[Luque] The one from The Addams Family.

1078
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,469
[laughter]

1079
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,512
[Alvarez] The mother's good.
Who's the actress?

1080
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,064
[Sayagues] Fiona. She's amazing.

1081
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:16,394
She spent just one week
doing the few scenes she had,

1082
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,980
but the truth is
something unbelievable happened,

1083
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,190
that didn't happen before during filming.

1084
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,777
Every time she was on set
and every time she performed,

1085
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,865
there was a deathly silence
because everyone was mesmerized by her.

1086
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:32,042
-Everyone stared at the monitor.
-[Luque] It was amazing.

1087
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:35,667
[Sayagues] Her presence was magnetic.

1088
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:41,882
[Alvarez] I had seen her in a series,
Utopia, a very good English series.

1089
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,802
They've been trying to make
the American version for a long time.

1090
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:50,181
I remember watching all the chapters
of the English version at one point

1091
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:51,854
and she was so good there.

1092
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,857
Here, she's perfect. She's amazing.

1093
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:57,230
This shot is also very good.

1094
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,939
The work with the light,
how she gradually appears.

1095
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,149
You can't see her face up to that point.

1096
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,498
This for me is the scariest moment
of the whole movie.

1097
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,919
[Luque] Yes! It's the scariest moment.

1098
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,416
[Alvarez] Maybe because
I know what's next.

1099
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,043
If you don't know what's next, you can't...

1100
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:22,752
But it's clear that this woman
won't bring anything good to the story.

1101
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,462
[laughter]

1102
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,224
Normally this would've--
In any other movie,

1103
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,894
this scene would've been
a scene of reunion and hope.

1104
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:37,646
She was reunited with her mother.
Heidi there with the mother...

1105
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:42,025
And you know from the way it's filmed

1106
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:48,703
that clearly nothing good is going to
come out of this union. Brilliant.

1107
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:53,282
[Luque] Now, what nerve the mother has
to pull all these theatrics.

1108
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,708
[Alvarez chuckles]
She's genuinely excited.

1109
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,752
[Luque] No, she's totally excited.

1110
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,456
[Alvarez] She appreciates her own life
more than her daughter's,

1111
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,915
but she is excited.

1112
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:06,174
I think she's more excited
to see hope that she will live...

1113
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,425
[Luque] Right, selfishness.

1114
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,722
[Alvarez] Yes, total selfishness.

1115
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,345
[Sayagues] We also talked about...

1116
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,473
[Luque] She also hugs her lovingly! Scary.

1117
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:17,056
-[Alvarez] She hugs her inside her heart.
-[Luque] All those lies.

1118
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,561
[Sayagues] We talked with Fiona.

1119
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:19,858
[Alvarez] Like the Blind Man
crying over Cindy's murder

1120
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,647
[Alvarez] Like the Blind Man
crying over Cindy's murder

1121
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,572
in the first one, but he actually cries
because of what's inside her, the kid.

1122
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,071
[Sayagues] What we talked about with Fiona
is that either way,

1123
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,869
she's her biological daughter,
from her womb,

1124
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:34,165
as we see in the photo,
so she's moved somehow.

1125
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,583
Perhaps when she planned all this,

1126
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,128
she didn't consider
that when she saw her in person,

1127
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:44,209
she was going to be moved, so it makes her
more insane and conflicted,

1128
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,169
and she has to go even more crazy
to be able to continue with the plan.

1129
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,380
[Luque] Yes, she has to delve into...

1130
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,887
[Alvarez] That's why at this moment
she starts coughing up the blood.

1131
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:56,596
She reminds herself that, well...

1132
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,021
[Luque] She has no other choice.

1133
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,391
[Alvarez] This couple, for me,
is one that--

1134
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:04,319
On Halloween,
I want to dress up like them.

1135
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,022
[laughter]

1136
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:09,529
[Luque] Bonnie and Clyde.
Everything goes wrong.

1137
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,075
[Alvarez] No, because I really believe
the love between the two of them.

1138
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,122
There is no doubt that they are in love.

1139
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,998
They make a great couple on screen,
very good.

1140
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:21,078
[Luque] Yes.

1141
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,958
[Alvarez] He'll do anything for her.

1142
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,165
[Luque] He's madly in love with her.

1143
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,378
[Sayagues] He's a prisoner of the spell,
too.

1144
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,133
[Alvarez] Right.
-He's a follower. She's the emperor.

1145
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,931
[Luque] Exactly.

1146
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:35,806
[Alvarez] She's the one
that really carries out all of this,

1147
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,057
since everyone does what they do for her

1148
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:41,061
because the others will say it too.
She is the cook...

1149
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:45,019
She's the one who cooks
the product that leaves them...

1150
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,275
-[Sayagues] Everyone is dominated by her.
[Alvarez] Yes.

1151
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,608
[Sayagues] And like we were saying,
she behaves like a spider here.

1152
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,319
She's going to get on her feet
and start getting close to her.

1153
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:54,653
[Luque] Completely a spider.

1154
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,615
[Sayagues] A lady spider
that makes its prey sleep.

1155
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,876
The smoke from the chemicals...

1156
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:04,872
Also, the animal print in the back
that Carlos brought...

1157
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,172
[laughter]

1158
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,749
[Luque] A lot of texture.

1159
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,595
[Alvarez] Yes, yes,
the underwear is spider-like.

1160
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,636
[Luque] It seems furry.

1161
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,058
[Alvarez] Yes.

1162
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,818
[Sayagues] Little by little
we begin to reveal that there's...

1163
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,942
a surgery room behind them.

1164
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:32,616
[Alvarez] I can't imagine
what the audience is thinking...

1165
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:37,322
since they don't know
what we know when we watch this,

1166
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,120
where this is headed
and what the mother will propose.

1167
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:44,627
[Sayagues] This is difficult for her.
She's about to cry.

1168
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,581
It's something that affects her.

1169
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:51,882
[Luque] And the truth is
that her performance is great.

1170
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,632
-It's amazing.
-[Alvarez] It's great.

1171
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:58,012
-[Luque] She was completely into it.
-[Sayagues] Yes, 100%.

1172
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,891
[Luque] She was on the edge and there...

1173
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,098
Doctor said it has to be a...

1174
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,057
It must be...

1175
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,391
[Alvarez] She's great.

1176
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,773
...a compatible donor.

1177
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,362
And it was also a comment from us,
as the first one had

1178
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:18,116
a lot of social commentary
on the subject of weapons,

1179
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:22,541
and that, if they invade your home,
if you have the right to kill or not

1180
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,164
just because someone came in to steal.
You remember?

1181
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:28,373
With this, we also used
a bit of social commentary

1182
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,709
in that the most helpless people,
like Raylan and his wife,

1183
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,716
if they need an organ transplant,
they will never get it.

1184
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:35,921
[Luque] It's true.

1185
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:38,097
[Alvarez] We read a lot,
we did research on it

1186
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:42,519
and if people with few resources
need a heart transplant

1187
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,687
or something very big like that,

1188
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,641
they go to the bottom of the list,
obviously.

1189
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,351
We'll finally be together...

1190
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:54,282
So, we knew that madness
was justified in their heads

1191
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:59,362
and that they knew that
never by right, never by law,

1192
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,572
would they get what they needed.

1193
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,580
I don't know about the real world,
but in the world of Don't Breathe,

1194
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,753
it's totally impossible to get an organ
for a transplant.

1195
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:17,884
I loved that light.

1196
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,308
Suddenly, there's a flair, almost like
the light of hope is turned on.

1197
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,101
[Luque] That's the idea.

1198
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,683
Is he dead? No.

1199
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,145
[Alvarez] Is that the location
or another one?

1200
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:33,479
[Sayagues] It's the house next door.
We did a repurpose of the house next door.

1201
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,439
[Luque] It was rebuilt and made...

1202
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,991
[Alvarez] True, because
the neighbor's house was burned down.

1203
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:43,322
[Luque] Yes. It was made in a similar
shape to the house we already had.

1204
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,532
We changed the mailbox. Those things...

1205
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,619
[Sayagues] We had to set the mailbox
and automatically...

1206
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:49,999
[laughter]

1207
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,080
-The greenhouse, too.
-[Luque] Yes.

1208
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,462
[Sayagues] The greenhouse
was built next to it.

1209
01:06:55,845 --> 01:07:00,305
[Alvarez] A great moment is when he
almost thanks the dog for saving his life,

1210
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,552
and the dog is just there...

1211
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:07,479
From here on, the dog
becomes like the comic relief.

1212
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,226
[Luque] That's true.

1213
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:12,776
[Alvarez] The story's funny part
is the dog and their relationship.

1214
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,604
All the moments with the dog are funny.

1215
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,156
That moon that was just seen there
was real, right?

1216
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,701
[Luque] It was real. That moon was there.

1217
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:33,334
[Sayagues] And as if this poor man didn't
suffer enough punishment in this movie,

1218
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:37,418
now he comes to find out
that his only friend

1219
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,879
is dead and it's because of him.

1220
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:45,677
[Alvarez] Well, it's one of the moments
that starts to build his arc,

1221
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:49,354
that will make him see what he sees
in the last scene,

1222
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,399
that the monster in this movie is him,

1223
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:57,229
because she...

1224
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:01,317
Hernandez was an innocent being
who pays for his crimes.

1225
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,403
If he hadn't taken Phoenix,
Hernandez wouldn't have died.

1226
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:09,248
You always feel very sorry
when you see someone

1227
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,542
who clearly doesn't show
that much affection,

1228
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,291
but he clearly loved her
more than one can imagine.

1229
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:22,588
With this story,
I think he begins to see who he is

1230
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:25,174
and the damage he's causing.

1231
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:33,357
Also, one of the great ideas--
I don't know where they came from,

1232
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:40,072
but we came up with how to make
the Blind Man find the house.

1233
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,368
Because at that time, two minutes before,
you'd think there's no way

1234
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,240
that he will find that hotel.

1235
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:47,446
[Sayagues] This was your idea.

1236
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,124
I remember at one point,
we were stuck with how he would find it,

1237
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:56,671
and you came up with the idea that
if you tell the dog to go home, he will.

1238
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:57,919
[Alvarez] He will.

1239
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,340
[laughter]

1240
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,169
Luckily, they lived in the same state.

1241
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,381
-[laughter]
-They were nearby.

1242
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:09,726
You get it from the fact
that Raylan was in his mother's house

1243
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,520
that we know is not very far from there,
and that they're all there.

1244
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,018
And if he was looking for Phoenix,

1245
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,021
he was doing so in the neighborhood
near that place.

1246
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:21,776
It was logical to expect
that their location wasn't very far.

1247
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,574
[dripping]

1248
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:35,460
Well, here begins the shot
of total madness.

1249
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:40,632
-[Sayagues] It feels like another movie.
-[laughter]

1250
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,085
[Luque] That dropper shot
was the last one filmed.

1251
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,295
-[Sayagues] It's true.
-[Alvarez] In the whole movie?

1252
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,802
-[Sayagues] Yes.
-[Alvarez] A highly glorious shot.

1253
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:49,223
[Sayagues] The dropper shot.

1254
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:53,140
That's when we realized
that the dropper was missing!

1255
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:55,313
[laughter]

1256
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:59,352
[Luque] My God. This is terrifying, too.

1257
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:06,908
I hope you understand
the high risks of this procedure.

1258
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,860
[Alvarez] He's great.

1259
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:12,323
[Sayagues] This actor has
a lot of experience in theater and cinema,

1260
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:13,623
all in England...

1261
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:20,589
Great actor. He came to play a small role,
but the truth is that he crushed it.

1262
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:23,508
[Alvarez] Another example
of invisible special effects.

1263
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,676
This had been filmed differently,

1264
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,629
and at one point,
we decided that, for realism,

1265
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,761
it would be great
if they wore medical clothes,

1266
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,388
because they were in,
like, more civilian clothes.

1267
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,264
-[Sayagues] The girls?
-[Alvarez] Yes. Both.

1268
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:38,223
The hospital clothes they're wearing
were added in post-production.

1269
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,183
-That's amazing, really.
-[Luque] Amazing.

1270
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,770
[Alvarez] Not just the clothes were added.

1271
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,731
I think the mother's feet...

1272
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:48,157
the mother's arms
and feet were too, I think.

1273
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,951
[Sayagues] The feet, not the arms.
The feet.

1274
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,402
[Luque] Look at that texture.

1275
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,113
[Sayagues] So good, yes.

1276
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,164
[Luque] Here we have the fellas, waiting...

1277
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,494
[Alvarez] There's Raul,
the one who's going to have his--

1278
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,296
His story is really well told.
Honestly, you...

1279
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:05,045
you believe him
when he takes that turn in the end.

1280
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:06,843
He gets the credit
for these minimal scenes.

1281
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,512
[Luque] Basically, Raul can't believe it.

1282
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,385
[Alvarez] They weren't told
what would happen.

1283
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,716
[Sayagues] Not exactly.

1284
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,302
[Alvarez] No, they were told
that it was important

1285
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,639
to save her, to go get Phoenix.

1286
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:22,271
But they were never told
what would happen to her.

1287
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,811
Still fucking wrong.

1288
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,371
The feet are CG, I think.

1289
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,414
-[Luque] Right.
-[Alvarez] All the clothes are CG.

1290
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:39,084
[Sayagues] And if you look
at the mother's legs,

1291
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,288
they're a bit gangrenous
because she doesn't use them that much.

1292
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:45,373
[Alvarez] Right.
-[Sayagues] They're kind of rotten.

1293
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:51,471
[Luque] This movie
and the previous one, 100,

1294
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:55,300
are so rich in detail...
in those kinds of details.

1295
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,805
And it's something that's fun to do,

1296
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:04,060
and it takes thinking about it,
getting yourself thinking about the story.

1297
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,487
[Sayagues] That's also what
making a movie is about,

1298
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,689
is to think about all those little things.

1299
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:12,526
And it also comes naturally because
every question they ask you

1300
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,738
about how we do this here,
what we put here, what the closure's like,

1301
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:19,541
and you pay attention to small details
that end up building up to what it's like.

1302
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:24,372
[Luque] Yes, as long as
you always focus on the story,

1303
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,127
you don't have to look for answers.

1304
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,752
[Alvarez] When there is a good team,

1305
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,884
each department
is thinking about all those details.

1306
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:35,215
-[Luque] That's true.
-[Alvarez] They're thinking about

1307
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,640
what to do regarding the clothing
to tell the story,

1308
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:42,722
the art of the house to tell the story.

1309
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,860
That's the pleasure
of working at this level in these films,

1310
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:51,190
in which everyone, the team leaders,
are top-notch people

1311
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:54,197
-who help a lot to tell the story.
-[Luque] Yes.

1312
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,661
Well...

1313
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:00,620
-[Alvarez] Ugh. [laughs]
-[Luque] Those rats are real.

1314
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,792
[Sayagues] This is a set
built in the studio.

1315
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,290
[Luque] Yes.

1316
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,418
[Alvarez] Great. I don't know.
Were there initial plans to build this?

1317
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,546
[Sayagues] No. All of this came up
in the process and thank God...

1318
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,547
[Alvarez] And when we went scouting,

1319
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,505
we really visited
sinister locations, right?

1320
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,683
[Luque] Yes, from other movies
in those sinister locations.

1321
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,682
[Alvarez] Luckily, this time
we didn't have to visit those.

1322
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,098
[Luque] Here, Jim-Bob has to...

1323
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,769
get it together.

1324
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,605
[Alvarez] Originally...

1325
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:35,867
in the first conception of the film,
at the script level,

1326
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:39,412
we thought that, from here on,
the entire third act

1327
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,205
was going to be filmed with the mode--

1328
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,456
With the kind of night vision
that we invented in the first film.

1329
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,459
And that all this was going to be,
like, in total darkness.

1330
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:53,043
We said, "Well, it's a moonless night
and it's going to be total darkness."

1331
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,502
That was the original concept.

1332
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:58,340
Honestly, this is better because it looks
more interesting, of course,

1333
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,345
and for now, he doesn't need it.

1334
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,143
-[Luque] No.
-[Alvarez] He doesn't need the dark,

1335
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:07,224
but then the idea came up of what comes
afterwards, the cans and the smoke.

1336
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,776
The epic red smoke.

1337
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:11,978
[Alvarez chuckles]

1338
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:14,440
[Luque] Oof! He swallows the bell.

1339
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,774
[Alvarez] The bells
that were in Hernandez's car.

1340
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,236
[choking]

1341
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:24,537
What does he say when he kills him
in the final version?

1342
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:25,788
For Hernandez or for the dog?

1343
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:26,868
[Sayagues] For the dog.

1344
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:29,876
[Alvarez] That day
he didn't say anything, right?

1345
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,001
[Sayagues] No.

1346
01:14:31,092 --> 01:14:34,005
[Alvarez] In post-production,
we decided he had to kill...

1347
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:37,429
This shot of the fall is epic.

1348
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:40,883
That, when he Kills him,
he tells him the reason why.

1349
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:45,266
I think that in post-production,
we first put, "This is for Hernandez."

1350
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:49,520
Then, the studio, I think
out of their few notes seeing this--

1351
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,850
-Do you remember?
-[Sayagues] Yes.

1352
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,856
[Alvarez] We wondered
if they'd give us freedom.

1353
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:55,860
The only note that the studio had was,

1354
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,908
“It's great, but it'd be better
if when he Kills him,

1355
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,611
he says, 'This is for my dog.

1356
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:02,992
-[Sayagues] "For the Shadow."
-[Alvarez] "This is for Shadow."

1357
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:06,074
And I think the note was very good.
"This is for Shadow."

1358
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,785
[Luque] Here, he hits the floor
next to him with a hammer.

1359
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:11,041
-[Sayagues] Yes.
-[Luque] This shot was very dangerous.

1360
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:15,421
He'd hit it so hard,
I was afraid the hammer would break.

1361
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,502
[laughter]

1362
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:21,260
-And Bobby was so scared.
-[Sayagues] No, Adam.

1363
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,684
[Luque] Adam was so scared
that he'd break his head.

1364
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:28,058
This guy was wearing his contact lenses.
He could barely see.

1365
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:29,890
[Sayagues] He couldn't see.
That day was intense.

1366
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,941
-[Luque] That day was...
-[Sayagues] Intense.

1367
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,190
-[Luque] Adam was left broken.
-[Sayagues] Yes.

1368
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,692
[Luque] Later, he was filming
with the second unit...

1369
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:39,069
-[Sayagues] Yes.
-[Alvarez] And in that part...

1370
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,446
Isn't he a dancer?

1371
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,618
-[Sayagues] He's a dancer.
-[Luque] Yes.

1372
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,743
-[Alvarez] Well, he had the agility.
-[Luque] But he was left broken.

1373
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,915
He was psychologically compromised
for a few days.

1374
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:50,164
[Sayagues] Yes, compromised and exhausted.

1375
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:51,540
-[Alvarez] Really?
-[Sayagues] Yes.

1376
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:57,130
During all that fight, the whole day
of filming was very intense for them.

1377
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,758
[Alvarez]
Those post-production clothes, amazing.

1378
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:02,009
[Luque] They're so good.

1379
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:05,342
I think maybe I won't wear anything
for the next movie.

1380
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:06,801
[Alvarez] All in post-production.

1381
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,057
[Sayagues] So good.

1382
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:12,599
-The set looks so nice.
-[Alvarez] He's Gary Oldman now.

1383
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:13,808
[Luque] Yes.

1384
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:19,440
This one was also brave
because there is no light, supposedly.

1385
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:23,777
Although, now in the story,
in the internal story clock,

1386
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:27,205
it's beginning to... to clear up.

1387
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,534
[Alvarez] Yes. It could be street lights.

1388
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:33,837
But as they say, the light comes
from the same place as music.

1389
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:37,757
[Luque] Exactly. But, well,
here the idea was a bit

1390
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,926
to establish this same set
in a different way.

1391
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:44,339
[Alvarez] Raul and the new henchmen
that appeared.

1392
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,390
[Luque] Yes. His friends.

1393
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,135
[Alvarez] Yes. Great shot.

1394
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:55,058
When did you decide to make it all blue?

1395
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,401
[Sayagues] I'm not sure.

1396
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,820
[Luque] We were talking about it.
I can't remember exactly.

1397
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:00,942
For me, it was a bit...

1398
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:05,743
It was natural because
the hole above this basement,

1399
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:11,079
in the fantasy, it's like an air hole
that's between the buildings.

1400
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:15,166
[Sayagues] The light got there
from this dawn gloom.

1401
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:17,748
[Luque] Of dawn. This is awesome, though.

1402
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,879
[Alvarez] It was a way of depicting
how to use even more senses.

1403
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:27,056
-[Luque] Yes.
-[Alvarez] Now, touch.

1404
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:35,436
He used smell in the first one.
He'd smell the shoes.

1405
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:36,516
[Luque] Yes.

1406
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,102
[Alvarez] Obviously,
he uses hearing all the time.

1407
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,688
We have to create a way
for him to use taste.

1408
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:42,943
[laughter]

1409
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,569
I don't know how.

1410
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,904
[Sayagues] And here,
Raul's arc is completed.

1411
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,831
[Alvarez] Here,
the Blind Man could have died.

1412
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,659
-[Sayagues] He could've killed him, yes.
-[Alvarez] Almost killed.

1413
01:17:56,130 --> 01:18:02,217
But Raylan made a mistake
that was to cross the moral line and...

1414
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,427
that's not cool with Raul.

1415
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:05,799
[laughter]

1416
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,472
[Raul] You'd better hurry.

1417
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:09,640
[Luque] Act cool, Raul.

1418
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,096
[Alvarez] That was
a great missed opportunity

1419
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,228
when he says, "That's not cool with me."

1420
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,559
He should've said,
"That's not cool with Raul."

1421
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:22,236
[laughter]

1422
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,985
-[Luque] Raul here... great.
-[Alvarez] Here, he makes sure that

1423
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:29,239
he's loosening up now,
because he was also convinced

1424
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:32,118
that the machete would fly into his head.

1425
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:33,698
[laughter]

1426
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,457
[Sayagues] Here, we get into
the epic scene of the movie.

1427
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:42,962
This was the biggest scene.
Actually, it was the most demanding scene.

1428
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:45,885
[Alvarez] Tito's pool.

1429
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,086
[Sayagues] Marshal Tito's pool.

1430
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:51,470
Yes, that was the palace,
one of the palaces used by the generals.

1431
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,348
[Alvarez] That location was--
It was one of the houses, right?

1432
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:58,727
One of the houses in Serbia and...
Belgrade. That was the house of...

1433
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,933
There was more than
one pool in that house, right?

1434
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:02,564
-[Sayagues] Yes.
-[Luque] It had an outdoor pool.

1435
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,692
But that pool was an indoor one.

1436
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:10,197
This pool,
it seems that it never worked well.

1437
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:13,370
[Alvarez] Really?
-[Luque] Apparently, it always had leaks.

1438
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,744
[Alvarez] Look at the depth of that, wow.

1439
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,371
-[Luque] Yes, it's amazing.
-[Alvarez] It's not real.

1440
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,497
[Luque] Right.

1441
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,078
[Alvarez] It was enlarged
in post-production.

1442
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,414
[Sayagues] It's a big scene
with lots of things happening.

1443
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,250
I think it took us
like a whole week to film.

1444
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:26,505
[Luque] A week and a half.

1445
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,087
-[Sayagues] Yes.
-[Luque] It was very complicated.

1446
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,171
[Alvarez] It's normal.

1447
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:36,512
The good climaxes of any movie
have to take up 25% of the shooting time.

1448
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:41,099
[Sayagues] Well, the lighting setup
is also very complex.

1449
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,193
It took days to put that together.

1450
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,987
[Alvarez] Right,
it was a physical location.

1451
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,484
-You had real lights outside.
-[Luque] Yes.

1452
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:52,489
We had to cover up all of this
with a big tent. It was raining.

1453
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:55,321
[Alvarez] Right, I was going to ask
what would happen if it rained.

1454
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:59,455
[Luque] Yes. It was raining hard outside
and we had to put up a big tent.

1455
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,003
The grips there saved the day.

1456
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:08,881
[Alvarez] I remember we tried
so many different colors for this part.

1457
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,045
[gunshots]

1458
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:18,557
This was such a great find.

1459
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,438
We made it dark without it being dark.

1460
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:28,192
It was daytime
and they were all in the same condition.

1461
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:33,068
With all the smoke,
you couldn't see anything.

1462
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:36,112
It has a samurai movie vibe.

1463
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:40,037
Some parts seem as if they were taken
from a Kurosawa movie.

1464
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:45,463
You have knives,
contrast, and it's all red.

1465
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:49,668
[Luque] It's exasperating, right?
Not knowing where it can come from.

1466
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:52,629
[Alvarez] Absolutely.
It feels like one of those movies,

1467
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:56,557
of a samurai fight in the fog.

1468
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:57,804
The knives.

1469
01:20:57,895 --> 01:20:59,306
[Luque] Yes, a bladed weapon.

1470
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:00,386
[Alvarez] Zatoichi.

1471
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:11,280
This part replicates the first one.

1472
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:15,910
Where the Blind Man kills Cindy.
He kills a loved one.

1473
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:22,083
Unintentionally, he kills someone
he was trying to protect.

1474
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:25,878
[Luque] The consequences of such violence.

1475
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,206
"NO!"

1476
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,712
[grunting]

1477
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:35,546
Of course, when he screams,
he reveals his position

1478
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,177
and that's when he attacks.

1479
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:41,269
[Alvarez] But Raylan is furious now.

1480
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:42,390
<i>Luque) He is.</i>

1481
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:46,896
[Alvarez] He now has
the strength he needs.

1482
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,475
[Luque] This drives me crazy.

1483
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:53,190
All this was so hard to shoot.

1484
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:55,240
-So hard.
-[Alvarez] Yes.

1485
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,944
[Luque] Each shoot has its own thing.

1486
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:04,371
[gasping]

1487
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:09,585
[Alvarez] This is metaphorically
the cutting of the umbilical cord.

1488
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,337
[Luque] The bond with her mother.

1489
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,715
[Alvarez] Since the beginning,
you see there's something

1490
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:16,967
that won't let her move on.

1491
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,343
[Luque] That's right.

1492
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,799
[Alvarez] Her mom. Who she is.

1493
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:24,057
But her mother
wasn't what we all expected.

1494
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:25,889
[Luque] She needs to let her go.

1495
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,064
[laughter]

1496
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,646
-Ah.
-[Alvarez] God.

1497
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:30,726
[screaming]

1498
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,112
Phoenix!

1499
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,655
[Sayagues] She falls anyway.

1500
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:38,484
[Luque] She falls, but it saves her.

1501
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,536
-Who comes in?
-[Alvarez chuckles]

1502
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:44,073
[Alvarez] Was that a puppet?

1503
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:49,834
[Sayagues] There's one.
There's a real dog attacking its trainer

1504
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:55,802
and here's a puppet, a rubber dog,
that he throws out the window.

1505
01:22:55,888 --> 01:23:01,133
[Luque] There's a broken fake arm,
there's the head biting the arm, too.

1506
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,969
This also demanded
a lot of second unit work.

1507
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,146
[Alvarez] What's funny about
this phrase you'll hear now,

1508
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,898
"Now you're gonna see what I see,”
wasn't in the first movie,

1509
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:19,029
but was invented
by Sony's marketing department

1510
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:22,987
for the trailer.

1511
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:27,040
And the people liked it so much that--

1512
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:30,370
[Luque] There comes the pudding...

1513
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:31,795
[laughter]

1514
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:34,715
This part was complicated, too.

1515
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,633
[Sayagues]
There's digital compositing there--

1516
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,882
[Luque] The tricky thing
was putting the eyes back on.

1517
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:41,213
Melting them was easy.

1518
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,299
[laughter]

1519
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:46,101
[Sayagues]
There's digital compositing there.

1520
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:51,604
There's a silicone head
with that pus inside, and it bleeds.

1521
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:52,933
[Luque] The eye juice.

1522
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,359
[Sayagues] The eye juice.

1523
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:58,447
[Luque] Poor Phoenix.
She's alive at least.

1524
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,442
[exclaiming]

1525
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,451
He hears her.

1526
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:16,423
Stop.

1527
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,634
Stop!

1528
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,172
You...

1529
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:27,559
You mustn't come near me.

1530
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:36,061
[Alvarez] The good news is
the Blind Man finally saw.

1531
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:40,193
At the last moment,
he stopped being morally blind at least.

1532
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,274
[Luque] True.

1533
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:45,077
[Alvarez] I think he realizes who he is

1534
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:48,872
when he leaves the house
and finds Hernandez dead,

1535
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:51,291
that's when he has the revelation.

1536
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:56,498
The only reason he went there
is to tell Phoenix what he feels.

1537
01:24:56,592 --> 01:25:01,052
To tell her the truth about himself.

1538
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,926
And he's punished for it.

1539
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,974
-[Luque] He pays the maximum price.
-[Alvarez] The ultimate price.

1540
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,221
[Luque] His own life.

1541
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:13,432
[Alvarez] Not only does he pay
by losing her,

1542
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:15,516
because she won't stay in his life,

1543
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:21,527
but he also pays with his life,
for having stayed there.

1544
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,324
[Sayagues] He also went there
to set her free

1545
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:28,996
so that she won't come back
and try to find him.

1546
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:32,495
He wants her to know who he really is
and what he has done.

1547
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:35,790
[Alvarez] He's pushing her away.

1548
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:40,546
He hopes she can move on with her life.
It's really hard for her.

1549
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:45,714
Stephen Lang is brilliant in this scene.

1550
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,923
-[Sayagues] He is.
-[Alvarez] He was made for this scene.

1551
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,258
-Go!
-[gasps]

1552
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:55,106
[Luque] In addition to
all the technicalities it required,

1553
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:59,481
it had this super special moment.

1554
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:02,563
[Alvarez] We spent most of the time
shooting the action scenes,

1555
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,148
but not the final monologue.

1556
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:06,529
[Luque] Just a few days.

1557
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,531
[Alvarez] That's what happened.

1558
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,283
[Luque] We did a good job.

1559
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:14,459
[Sayagues] We took the time
that was needed.

1560
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,753
He came prepared
and nailed it on the first try.

1561
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,045
[Luque] True.

1562
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,671
[sobbing]

1563
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:27,050
[Alvarez] If the hand had rested
a bit longer on his shoulder,

1564
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,178
you'd have thought it was Phoenix
telling him, "It's okay."

1565
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,726
-[Sayagues] Yes. But no.
-[Luque] But no.

1566
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:35,975
[Alvarez]
The Blind Man doesn't fight back.

1567
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:38,979
-[Sayagues] He's given up.
-[Alvarez] He's ready to die.

1568
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:40,275
[Sayagues] That's all.

1569
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:43,150
[Alvarez] He believed
what he had said to her.

1570
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,483
Saying goodbye to her was like dying.

1571
01:26:47,577 --> 01:26:52,788
And by staying there, that's what he got.
He got stabbed in the back.

1572
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,035
[Luque and Sayagues] Yes.

1573
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:59,746
[Alvarez] That's all for him.

1574
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:05,759
So Shakespearean.

1575
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:09,055
[Luque] Totally. And she came back.

1576
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:11,844
These two are...

1577
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,643
[Alvarez] The loss of his eyes,
it's all a Greek tragedy.

1578
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,266
[laughter]

1579
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:20,145
But they are together.

1580
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,521
[Luque] Together in death.

1581
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:25,108
[Alvarez] It's crazy.

1582
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,654
[Luque] And now comes the famous scene.
You can't end without one.

1583
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,865
[Sayagues] You have to do it
at some point.

1584
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,497
[Luque] Leonardo continues
to influence us.

1585
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:44,920
[Sayagues] This whole moment is
about feeling sorry for the wounded.

1586
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,342
-It's about mercy.
-[Alvarez] Yes.

1587
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,716
One of the best decisions for me,

1588
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:53,674
completely counterintuitive but incredible

1589
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:57,387
that made this moment
very rare and special,

1590
01:27:57,481 --> 01:28:00,769
that suited this character perfectly,

1591
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:05,444
is that in any other movie,
there would be music.

1592
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:10,900
There would be music in the background
that would make you sad about his death.

1593
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:13,281
But we consciously decided,

1594
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:18,286
for all the crimes he committed,
he doesn't deserve any music.

1595
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:21,243
-[Luque] Nothing.
-[Alvarez] Not even a trumpet.

1596
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:24,547
[imitating trumpet] Nothing at all.

1597
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,749
So we removed it in post-production.

1598
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:30,552
And it created
a very demeaning atmosphere.

1599
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,303
We wanted him to die like a dog.

1600
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:37,976
He didn't deserve any recognition.

1601
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:41,897
-That's what we tried to express.
-[Luque] Right.

1602
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:45,977
[Alvarez] That's what we tried to convey.

1603
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:48,984
But she can't help feeling sorry for him.

1604
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:54,035
That's what any kid her age would do
in her situation.

1605
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,487
She can't change what she feels,

1606
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:59,289
which is why this ending
is like a tragedy.

1607
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:02,459
[Sayagues] She's also heartbroken.
Finding out must be really hard.

1608
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:06,130
[Alvarez] It's tragic for her,
for the audience,

1609
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:10,631
who might have expected
a more painful punishment.

1610
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,803
But I think what we did here
is more relatable.

1611
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:18,054
If he'd received the perfect punishment,

1612
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:20,476
it wouldn't feel real.
It would be too Hollywood.

1613
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,431
[Sayagues] And here...

1614
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:30,154
the texture and the light change a bit,
like the world changed.

1615
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,982
-[Alvarez] And this is Detroit again?
-[Luque] This is Detroit again.

1616
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:39,280
[Sayagues] A new dawn
in the life of Phoenix.

1617
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:46,003
[Luque] The lighting
was quite expressionistic.

1618
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:48,501
But it fits perfectly.

1619
01:29:56,057 --> 01:30:00,597
[Alvarez] Now she's accepted, she's free.

1620
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:03,554
She hasn't accepted her past.

1621
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:09,064
But she's accepted that she's free
to choose who she wants to be.

1622
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,987
She's now in control of her life.

1623
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,609
-At the end of the story.
-[Sayagues] Yes.

1624
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:18,991
[Luque] And she accepts the name, Phoenix,
which he gave to her.

1625
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:24,325
[Alvarez] I don't know if it has to do
with her relationship to her father.

1626
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:28,128
We don't know yet how she feels
about that relationship.

1627
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:33,209
Not just yet, but what we do know now
is she's in complete control of her life.

1628
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:39,766
She has taken control
and she knows everything now.

1629
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,183
She can now have a better life.

1630
