It has become increasingly clear,
Citizen Robespierre,

167
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:57,287
that your motivations are to use
this blade to your ultimate power!

[people clamoring]

Let me speak!

There is no man in this room
who has objected to my methods.

If you say I am guilty,
you are all guilty!

[Barras]
You are not a defender of freedom.

173
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:20,769
You have deemed yourself judge,
jury and executioner, have you not?

174
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:23,939
You're worse than Caesar!
Worse than Caesar!

- This is my uniform.
- [scoffs]

There is a very young man who wishes
to see you.

His name is, uh, Eugène Beauharnais.

00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:47,888
Mmm.

227
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:49,556
Ow.

228
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:51,767
[clears throat]

229
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,188
[Junot] Citizen.

230
00:23:04,738 --> 00:23:06,073
General Bonaparte.

231
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:07,657
Yes?

232
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:11,912
My name is Eugène Beauharnais,
son of Joséphine Beauharnais.

233
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:13,663
What do you want?

234
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,208
My father's saber.

235
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:21,254
I-It was taken from him before
he was arrested and executed.

236
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:23,507
Yes?

237
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:27,844
I-It would mean a great deal to me and
to my mother if it were returned to us.

238
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:29,805
It's all we have of him.

239
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,348
The sword is a weapon.

240
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,977
I cannot allow citizens
to have weapons in their possession.

241
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:40,148
The sword is a keepsake
for me to remember my dear late father.

242
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:42,734
Perhaps, but it is a weapon nevertheless.

243
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,115
Young man, why are you here?

244
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,869
My mother said that you were the only man
of authority to retrieve the sword.

245
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,010
All of these are
from officers who were sentenced to die.

246
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:13,015
Did no one think
to attach names to any of them?

247
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:18,061
No, there are no names.

Thank you.

251
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:04,107
Is there reason to introduce myself?

252
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:07,069
No, General.

253
00:25:07,903 --> 00:25:08,987
[Napoleon] Good.

254
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:13,533

Do you find him without appeal?

261
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,544
No.

262
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,295
Then perhaps that is enough.

263
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:14,761
Do not underestimate your grace.

When you look at me,
do you see an aristocrat?

00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:13,028
No.

270
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:18,909
My husband had more than one lover.

271
00:27:21,203 --> 00:27:24,081
And when his head was cut off,
all his mistresses watched.

272
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:34,549
When I was in prison, I was told the
only way to survive was to get pregnant.

273
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:38,637
So, General...

274
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:47,688
do I need warn you of my indiscretions?

275
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:50,649
No, madame.

276
00:27:52,234 --> 00:27:54,319
Does where I have been concern you?

277
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,617
No, madame.

278
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:20,262
If you look down, you'll see a surprise.

279
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:24,057
And once you see it,
you will always want it.

Yes.

289
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:10,187
There is a belief amongst the Committee

290
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:13,148
that there is an attack
on the Council coming by this mob.

291
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:18,820
I have less than 4,000 troops
and very little in the way of weapons.

292
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:23,825
There are 40 cannons in Sablons.
I could have them here in three hours.

00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:25,827
This mob is 20,000 strong.

Yes.

As my second-in-command,
what would you intend to do

296
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:38,799
if this assignment of defense
was transferred to you?

297
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:48,767
I accept, on the condition
that I command this as I see fit.

298

Without interruption.

{\an8}<i>as I have been sent to liberate Egypt.</i>

330

Are there limits to what I can tell you?

00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:02,117
There shouldn't be.

358
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:07,164
Should I tell you something
at the risk of giving you personal pain?

359
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:11,418
Yes. [chuckles]

00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:21,970
Your wife has taken

- Yes. [chuckles]

That my wife would do this to me? Mmm.

Yes.

365
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,137
No dessert for you. You may leave.

I would never lie to you.

How do you know this?

00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:36,545
Lucille is my lover. She writes to me.

Joséphine's lady-in-waiting is your lover?

Prepare two frigates and two
smaller vessels in the greatest secrecy.

...this will be seen as desertion.

Where's my wife?

She has left to greet you in Lyon.

- Do not lie to me. Where is my wife?

She left earlier today, General.

- Lyon?
- Yes, sir.

How could you care so little

- for me and my feelings?

Do you think so lowly of me?

No. I don't.

400
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:36,641
Then why?

401
00:41:39,394 --> 00:41:42,439
Because you're what? Say it.

402
00:41:46,693 --> 00:41:47,694
I'm sorry.

403

That's not enough.

- What do you-- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say

406
00:41:54,618 --> 00:41:57,996
that I am the most important thing
in the world!

407
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:00,332
You are.

408
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:02,876
- Say it!
- You're-- You're-- You're-- You're--

409
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:07,631
You're the most important thing
in my life, in the world. You a--

410
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:11,051
- And without me, you are nothing.
- I'm nothing.

411
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:12,803
And you will do anything!

412
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,222
I'll do anything.

413
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:20,394
I'm not built like other men.

414
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:26,108
And I'm not subject to petty insecurity.

You're a beast.

You are nothing without me.

Say it.

You are just a brute
that is nothing without me.

I am just a brute
that is nothing without you.

Yes.

[Joséphine sighs]

00:43:51,443 --> 00:43:52,611
Did you have affairs?

431
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:56,323
Of course I did.

432
00:44:03,663 --> 00:44:05,123
And did you love them?

433
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,794
No. No, I did not.

434
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:16,218
Were they pretty?

435
00:44:18,428 --> 00:44:20,263
Yes, some of them.

436
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:24,768
They served their purpose.

437
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,021
More than I do?

438
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,818
They cried less.
That made them more attractive.

439
00:44:36,238 --> 00:44:37,239
Don't--

440
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:41,118
Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me.

441
00:44:44,913 --> 00:44:46,415
[whispering] Just don't leave me.

442
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:51,253
You don't have to forgive me.
Just promise me you won't leave again.

443
00:44:57,009 --> 00:45:00,721
What is it that made you desert
your troops in Egypt?

444
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:01,805
Shh!

445
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:05,225
Citizens...

446
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:08,770
what country are we in?

447
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:15,569
Because she doesn't resemble
the France that I left.

448
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:22,159
Who should be responsible
for her governance while I'm away?

449
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:25,912
Because it is not you, Citizen Gohier.

450
00:45:26,747 --> 00:45:27,748
It is not you.

451
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:31,543
It certainly is not you.
Although you're very good at scowling.

452
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:36,590
It is not you, Barras.

453
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:37,716
Or you, Talleyrand.

454
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:40,135
Or you, Sieyès.

455
00:45:41,678 --> 00:45:42,679
So, who?

456
00:45:44,181 --> 00:45:46,808
Who should be responsible?
Fouché, do you have any ideas?

457
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:49,603
- No?
- [sighs]

458
00:45:51,396 --> 00:45:54,191
I have returned to France
to find her bankrupt.

459
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:57,944
Printing money that is spent within hours,

460
00:45:59,863 --> 00:46:02,157
the Austro-Russian overrun of Italy,

461
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:05,494
the Anglo-Russian occupation of Holland,

462
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:12,125
and what appears to be
the imminent invasion of France herself.

463
00:46:15,087 --> 00:46:18,590
And yet, you accuse me of desertion.

464
00:46:20,008 --> 00:46:23,387
Added to which the discovery
that my wife is a slut.

465
00:46:36,566 --> 00:46:41,738
The only thing that every French citizen
can agree on is that you are our Caesar.

466
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:46,326
What do you want?

467
00:46:48,328 --> 00:46:49,746
[chuckles]

468
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:51,415
Well...

469
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:57,337
the people would accept my rule
if I have your support.

470
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:04,344
Like you, though,
I believe that the Directory is corrupt.

471
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:10,892
But together, we can save this country
from a restoration of the monarchy,

472
00:47:11,852 --> 00:47:14,104
and we can preserve
the ideals of the Revolution.

473
00:47:16,815 --> 00:47:20,569
And I think that
a seizure of power is possible

474
00:47:21,903 --> 00:47:23,739
with your help, at the right time.

475
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:27,034
And I think this is the right time.

476
00:47:27,784 --> 00:47:30,454
So, you expect me to be your sword?

477
00:47:32,205 --> 00:47:33,206
[chuckles]

478
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:41,923
I expect that a coup d'état,
well-timed, well-executed...

479
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:47,471
could transfer power
into the hands of three consuls:

480
00:47:48,388 --> 00:47:49,681
myself, Ducos...

481
00:47:52,267 --> 00:47:53,310
and you.

00:47:53,935 --> 00:47:54,936
[scoffs]

Hmm?

486
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,654
It's a simple letter of resignation
we would like you to--

487
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:06,865
I am not signing anything.

488
00:48:06,865 --> 00:48:10,243
You can piss before I sign anything away!

489
00:48:10,243 --> 00:48:11,328
Gentlemen.

490
00:48:13,288 --> 00:48:14,706
[panting]

491
00:48:14,706 --> 00:48:16,583
[grunting]

492
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,713
[shouts] Who's doing this?

493
00:48:23,048 --> 00:48:24,216
Good morning, Paul.

494
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:26,551
Hmm.

495
00:48:27,386 --> 00:48:29,513
I'm going to make this very simple
for you.

496
00:48:30,514 --> 00:48:33,892
I have documents announcing
your resignation from the Council.

497
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:37,562
You must retire
before you have your breakfast, please.

498
00:48:38,814 --> 00:48:43,151
Tell them I return with joy
to the ranks of simple citizen.

499
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:46,113
I shall.

500
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:51,284
[knocking]

501
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:53,370
There are some gentlemen here to see you.

502
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:58,125
Citizen Moulins, we have
a letter of resignation for you to sign.

503
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,753
- No, no, no. I am eating my breakfast.
- [spouse] No.

504
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:04,506
I am enjoying a succulent breakfast.

505
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:08,927
This is outrageous! I shall finish
my breakfast before you touch me!

506
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:11,847
- [cries] No!
- Enjoy your breakfast.

507
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:14,933
[wailing]

508
00:49:33,452 --> 00:49:34,745
[Council member 1] Director!

509
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,956
I believe the time has come
to demand an explanation.

510
00:49:37,956 --> 00:49:39,666
- [Council member 2] Hear, hear!
- [clamoring]

511
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:44,880
Uh, thi-this emergency session
is to draw a list of nominations

512
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,468
for a-- a new Directory
to deal with the threat--

513
00:49:49,468 --> 00:49:52,137
- [members clamoring]
- the threat of the royalists.

514
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:54,348
We are being asked to pass a resolution

515
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:57,267
forming a provisional government
to three councils:

516
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:01,897
General Bonaparte and Citizen Sieyès
and Roger Ducos.

517
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:05,609
Where are the five members
of the Directory?

518
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:07,736
[members clamoring]

519
00:50:07,736 --> 00:50:09,738
[Council member 1]
Have they magically disappeared?

520
00:50:09,738 --> 00:50:12,949
- [Council member 3 chuckles]
- And we are here, surrounded by troops,

521
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,868
isolated far from Paris.

522
00:50:14,868 --> 00:50:16,536
- [clamoring]
- Order! Order!

523
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:19,456
[Council member 1]
This is becoming increasingly clear:

524
00:50:20,374 --> 00:50:23,251
that your brother, Napoleon Bonaparte,

525
00:50:24,461 --> 00:50:28,340
with his show of military might,
is acting as an outlaw.

526
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,593
- [members clamoring]
- [Lucien] I vow to solve this matter.

527
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:35,430
[Council member 1] And that this is
a ridiculous and poorly executed takeover.

528
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,140
A power-hungry upstart.

529
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,185
- [members shouting]
- [Napoleon] Enough! Enough!

530
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:44,189
If there is any question
of what is happening here, I will answer!

531
00:50:44,189 --> 00:50:45,565
How dare you!

532
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:49,486
This is--
You have violated the constitution!

533
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:51,613
- You have--
- [Council member 4] Hold him!

534
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:54,991
- [Council member 5] Get him!
- [struggling]

535
00:50:54,991 --> 00:50:56,785
[all clamoring]

536
00:51:00,956 --> 00:51:03,166
- Arrest him!
- Stop him!

537
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:04,793
[panting]

538
00:51:04,793 --> 00:51:06,169
Oh, fuck!

539
00:51:06,169 --> 00:51:08,255
[Council members shouting]

540
00:51:09,256 --> 00:51:10,257
[yelps]

541
00:51:11,675 --> 00:51:13,051
[Council member 6] Kill him!

542
00:51:14,177 --> 00:51:16,138
[grunts, panting]

543
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:20,183
[guards straining]

544
00:51:20,183 --> 00:51:21,977
- [mutters]
- Let me through!

545
00:51:25,022 --> 00:51:26,273
Right. [pants]

546
00:51:26,273 --> 00:51:30,444
We are being terrorized
by deputies armed with daggers!

547
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:34,448
And these madmen have outlawed themselves

548
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:37,159
by their attempt
on the liberty of this country!

549
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:39,745
- They're trying to kill me!
- They're trying to kill him.

550
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:42,330
- [Council member 7] Open these doors!
- [grunts]

551
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:45,667
[Lucien grunts]

552
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:48,211
[Council member 3] Let us out of here!

553
00:51:48,211 --> 00:51:53,133
I will kill my brother if he betrays
the freedom of the French people!

554
00:51:54,593 --> 00:51:56,094
Get in there now!

555
00:51:56,094 --> 00:51:58,597
- [Lucien] Fuck.
- [guards shouting]

556
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:04,394
[guard 1] Move, move. Get back. Back.

557
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:07,064
[guard 2] Move it. Move it!

558
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,069
- [guard 3] Back. Move back.
- [guard 4] Move back. Out of the way.

559
00:52:12,736 --> 00:52:14,821
[guard 5] Move, move. Backwards.

560
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:21,203
[Council members gasping]

561
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:22,621
Good luck, brother.

562
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:28,960
[Napoleon panting]

563
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,341
Stand aside.

564
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,522
Shall we vote?

565
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:53,026
Where are we going?

566
00:52:53,026 --> 00:52:55,737
[people cheering]

567
00:52:55,737 --> 00:52:57,739
All our harsh words are behind us.

568
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:03,120
I need you to be my most tender friend.

569
00:53:06,957 --> 00:53:10,127
Over this door is our destiny.

570
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:16,675
[cheering continues]

571
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,872
[French officer] Present arms!

572
00:54:41,426 --> 00:54:43,512
- [aristocrat] First Consul.
- My lord.

573
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:45,514
Milady.

574
00:54:46,765 --> 00:54:47,933
[inhales sharply]

575
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:51,311
- Citizen Bonaparte.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

576
00:54:51,311 --> 00:54:52,938
- First Consul.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

577
00:54:52,938 --> 00:54:54,231
First Consul.

578
00:54:57,776 --> 00:54:59,069
Come, little one.

579
00:54:59,778 --> 00:55:02,698
You get into the bed of your master's.

580
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:05,450
[chuckling]

581
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:09,871
[aristocrats chattering]

582
00:55:16,128 --> 00:55:18,922
Hello, madame!

583
00:55:18,922 --> 00:55:20,590
Hello, good evening.

584
00:55:26,138 --> 00:55:27,764
Mother, the Duke of Avignon.

585
00:55:27,764 --> 00:55:29,016
It's good to meet you.

586
00:55:39,026 --> 00:55:41,528
Ah. Could this be Joséphine?

587
00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:45,365
- Mother, Joséphine. Joséphine, Mother.
- [Letizia] Good to see you.

588
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:48,160
Oh, it's Charles.

589
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,120
This way.

590
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:03,342
[scribe] "Your Majesty, England
and France are wasting their prosperity."

591
00:56:03,342 --> 00:56:04,343
Let me try again.

592
00:56:06,845 --> 00:56:09,473
- Your Royal Majesty, England and France...
- [clears throat]

593
00:56:09,473 --> 00:56:12,351
- are wasting their prosperity...
- Your-- Your Majesty.

594
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:14,144
What did I say?

595
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:18,440
[stammers]
"Your-- Your-- Your Royal Majesty."

596
00:56:19,691 --> 00:56:21,818
"Your Royal Ma"-- [inhales deeply]

597
00:56:21,818 --> 00:56:25,697
Your Majesty, England
and France are wasting their prosperity.

598
00:56:28,075 --> 00:56:30,494
I am not ashamed to take the initiative.

599
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:33,330
I have, I think,
sufficiently proven to the whole world

600
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:36,249
that I do not fear the chances of war.

601
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:41,880
But peace is my heartfelt wish
for England and France.

602
00:56:43,298 --> 00:56:44,299
Read it back to me.

603
00:56:45,217 --> 00:56:48,720
I have notified all foreign powers
of your accession to the Consul,

604
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,307
I have addressed letters
to all diplomatic agents abroad,

605
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:56,311
{\an8}and I understand that you have made
friendly overtures of peace to England.

606
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:57,688
{\an8}Ca-Caulaincourt.

607
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,525
What I need from you is
a better understanding

608
00:57:01,525 --> 00:57:03,402
of the Russian Tsar Alexander.

609
00:57:04,111 --> 00:57:06,947
Would you consider the tsar an ally
to England or France?

610
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,744
Well, I would think that his trade
with England is more beneficial to him

611
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:14,246
than his trade with France.

612
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,959
And do you have a sense of
British influence in the Russian courts?

613
00:57:18,959 --> 00:57:21,545
[Caulaincourt] I do not,
but I imagine it is quite robust.

614
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:23,922
Robust?

615
00:57:29,011 --> 00:57:31,847
What kind of man is he? Describe him.

616
00:57:33,432 --> 00:57:35,267
Well, he's young. [sighs]

617
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,562
- He's vain.
- [scoffs]

618
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:41,648
He's popular, and he wishes to remain so.

619
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:42,816
He's popular?

620
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:46,611
Really?

621
00:57:46,611 --> 00:57:49,823
His greatest fear is to be killed
in his bed, like his father.

622
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,658
[laughs]

623
00:57:52,659 --> 00:57:56,955
This makes him dangerously fickle
to whoever last has his attention.

624
00:57:58,081 --> 00:58:01,168
So he needs an ally
that he can also call a friend.

625
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,343
No more bets.

626
00:58:13,013 --> 00:58:14,389
What a surprise.

627
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:16,433
How nice to see you out.

628
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:18,769
Excuse me, gentlemen.

629
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:21,772
Good evening.
I'm just trying to lose some money.

630
00:58:21,772 --> 00:58:25,442
Ah. Well, after this hand,
why don't you come and join me?

631
00:58:25,442 --> 00:58:27,235
I'm at my usual table.

632
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:28,487
That's a lovely idea.

633
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:31,531
Good evening.

634
00:58:32,657 --> 00:58:34,951
Mmm. Did you hear?

635
00:58:36,953 --> 00:58:41,875
Your Majesty received a letter of peace
from the First Consul today.

636
00:58:43,752 --> 00:58:47,339
Monsieur Talleyrand, if I may be honest?

637
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:48,423
Of course.

638
00:58:48,423 --> 00:58:53,261
Austria's coalition with England is
in such a strong position against France,

639
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:57,224
that these peace overtures are clearly

640
00:58:57,224 --> 00:58:59,685
only for your handling
of French public opinion.

641
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:02,688
[chuckles] Oh, my friend.

642
00:59:04,731 --> 00:59:06,817
- You know me so well.
- [diplomat chuckles]

643
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:11,029
Yes, it is true.
It is public opinion Napoleon is after.

644
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:14,074
But my warning to you
is that he's as hungry for it

645
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:16,243
as any man in the history of the world.

646
00:59:16,243 --> 00:59:18,120
So my suggestion, with respect,

647
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,957
would be to take
this little offering of peace from him...

648
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:30,716
or suffer the consequences
from a man bent on peace at any cost.

649
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,971
The English ambassador, Lord Whitworth,
has arrived, Consul.

650
00:59:44,855 --> 00:59:48,066
Do not look at me as if
you don't know what I'm about to say.

651
00:59:49,776 --> 00:59:52,487
Are you aware of my letter of peace
to your king?

652
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,322
I am not.

653
00:59:55,782 --> 00:59:57,075
Shall I repeat it?

654
00:59:57,075 --> 01:00:00,829
[inhales deeply] No, you may not. [sighs]

655
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:03,290
Take this as a warning to your king.

656
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:06,043
I will keep you guessing and scared.

657
01:00:06,043 --> 01:00:08,253
You will watch your borders and your back,

658
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:11,256
and your manners are bound,
sooner or later, to be French.

659
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:13,717
I will offer no more letters of peace,

660
01:00:13,717 --> 01:00:18,221
and I will take the lack of a swift reply
as an act of disrespect!

661
01:00:18,221 --> 01:00:21,433
You think you're so great
because you have boats!

662
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:28,106
'Tis a shame such a great man
should have no manners.

663
01:00:41,495 --> 01:00:42,496
Yes?

664
01:00:45,082 --> 01:00:46,083
Are you pleased?

665
01:00:48,752 --> 01:00:51,254
Are you about to tell me
something that will make me angry?

666
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:53,590
Let's hope not.

667
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:58,303
The European families think
nothing more of you than a Corsican thug.

668
01:00:59,054 --> 01:01:00,764
- Therefore...
- [chuckles]

669
01:01:00,764 --> 01:01:04,518
...I'm going to suggest something
that's been a long time arriving.

670
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,232
I suggest that you abandon
your role as First Consul of France

671
01:01:11,191 --> 01:01:15,612
in exchange for the title
"Victorious Consul."

672
01:01:17,656 --> 01:01:20,075
By another name, "king."

673
01:01:20,075 --> 01:01:22,953
[chuckles]

674
01:01:22,953 --> 01:01:24,037
What?

675
01:01:24,037 --> 01:01:26,498
[scoffs] "King."

676
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:29,918
Uh, yes, king.

677
01:01:32,796 --> 01:01:33,797
King?

678
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:47,561
- [chuckles]
- Mmm.

679
01:01:47,561 --> 01:01:49,646
[murmuring]

680
01:01:53,817 --> 01:01:55,694
My hair has been set.

681
01:01:55,694 --> 01:01:58,572
- [murmuring continues]
- The way you like it.

682
01:02:01,033 --> 01:02:03,535
- [whines]
- [scoffs] Oh, you filthy man.

683
01:02:03,535 --> 01:02:05,162
My hair has been set now.

684
01:02:05,746 --> 01:02:08,206
[murmuring continues]

685
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,710
I have the most beautiful wife.

686
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,712
- [whines]
- I-- All right, come on then.

687
01:02:16,757 --> 01:02:17,758
Hat off.

688
01:02:20,135 --> 01:02:21,136
Mmm.

689
01:02:23,096 --> 01:02:24,222
[grunts]

690
01:02:24,973 --> 01:02:26,767
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

691
01:02:27,851 --> 01:02:29,686
- You feel that?
- [sighs] What?

692
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:32,439
Can you feel that?

693
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:34,900
- That's yours. That's yours.
- [breathing heavily]

694
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,109
It's yours.

695
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:37,194
Thank you.

696
01:02:39,112 --> 01:02:40,989
[grunts, breathing heavily]

697
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:52,584
[chuckles] Oh.

698
01:02:54,461 --> 01:02:55,671
[Napoleon] Mmm.

699
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:01,551
Oh. [chuckles] Stop.

700
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:04,096
Why aren't you pregnant?

701
01:03:08,392 --> 01:03:11,687
Is that a question,
or is that an accusation?

702
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,106
- [Napoleon] Mmm.
- [sighs]

703
01:03:15,899 --> 01:03:17,109
It was a question.

704
01:03:17,901 --> 01:03:19,403
[grunts, chuckles]

705
01:03:19,403 --> 01:03:20,696
Now it's an accusation.

706
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:27,411
Well, I've seen Dr. Corvisart,
and he has no answer.

707
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,459
Only that I do
what Madame de Rémusat has done.

708
01:03:36,837 --> 01:03:37,838
[Napoleon] Which is?

709
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:40,382
[sighs] Which is...

710
01:03:42,968 --> 01:03:45,679
along with hopeful thinking
and a bit of red wine,

711
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:48,598
he suggested I take the waters
at Aix-la-Chapelle.

712
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,270
And why haven't you?

713
01:03:54,646 --> 01:03:57,524
As wife of the First Consul,
I haven't found the time.

714
01:03:57,524 --> 01:04:00,527
I spend many hours cleaning up after you.

715
01:04:05,073 --> 01:04:06,533
Find the time.

716
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:11,705
[inhales sharply] I don't need to explain
to you the importance of this, do I?

717
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:13,957
What, you want an heir?

718
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,501
I want one now.

719
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:18,295
[smacking lips]

720

- [growling continues]
- [laughing]

722
01:04:34,186 --> 01:04:37,230
Oh, my God. [gasps, chuckles]

723
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:40,817
- [growls]
- [chuckles]

724
01:04:40,817 --> 01:04:42,903
[choir singing in Latin]

725
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:20,649
[song ends]

726
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,030
May God affirm you on his throne,

727
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:33,328
and Christ give you to rule with him
in his eternal kingdom.

728
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:54,725
[attendees gasping]

729
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:02,691
I found the crown of France in the gutter.

730
01:06:04,693 --> 01:06:09,031
I picked it up with the tip of my sword
and cleaned it...

731
01:06:11,116 --> 01:06:13,243
and place it atop my own head.

732
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:17,039
[attendees murmuring]

733
01:06:39,853 --> 01:06:45,150
The most glorious,
the most august Napoleon,

734
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:47,778
emperor of the French,

735
01:06:47,778 --> 01:06:51,198
is crowned and enthroned!

736
01:06:52,032 --> 01:06:53,742
Long live the emperor!

737
01:06:53,742 --> 01:06:56,328
[all] Long live the emperor!

738
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,830
Long live the emperor!

739
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:02,459
[choir singing in Latin]

740
01:07:32,072 --> 01:07:34,074
[tapping]

741
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:40,664
[Napoleon] I do not support this idea.

742
01:07:40,664 --> 01:07:43,417
You suggest divorce after years of debate.

743
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:45,293
You can see that it has me divided.

744
01:07:45,293 --> 01:07:46,378
[Talleyrand] Mmm.

745
01:07:48,005 --> 01:07:49,423
[sighs]

746
01:07:49,423 --> 01:07:51,258
I am not ambitious.

747
01:07:51,258 --> 01:07:53,176
I've never declared war with anyone.

748
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:57,931
No.

749
01:08:00,183 --> 01:08:04,521
You are the greatest leader
in the history of the world

750
01:08:04,521 --> 01:08:06,565
and the world's only chance at peace.

751
01:08:11,611 --> 01:08:15,532
The security of the empire and peace
in the world depends upon an heir.

752
01:08:16,033 --> 01:08:17,034
[sighs]

753
01:08:19,453 --> 01:08:21,455
[dinner guests chattering]

754
01:08:23,206 --> 01:08:26,376
[Joséphine] It was an option. [chuckles]

755
01:08:26,376 --> 01:08:27,961
And I said it at the time.

756
01:08:35,218 --> 01:08:36,845
[Napoleon] Are you enjoying yourself?

757
01:08:38,805 --> 01:08:42,267
I'm going to war to defend our people,

758
01:08:42,267 --> 01:08:44,811
and my wife cannot provide me an heir.

759
01:08:48,523 --> 01:08:51,193
If you do not bear me a child tonight,

760
01:08:52,986 --> 01:08:54,528
there will be a divorce.

761
01:08:56,907 --> 01:09:00,285
Hasn't been enough lovemaking
in this home to bear a child.

762
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,704
Yes, there has.

763
01:09:03,914 --> 01:09:07,541
- [Joséphine sighs]
- There have been years of it. Years.

764
01:09:09,294 --> 01:09:10,711
And with more than just me.

765
01:09:11,505 --> 01:09:15,592
- [inhales deeply] Oh.
- And still you are empty.

766
01:09:15,592 --> 01:09:17,177
And you're fat.

767
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:22,224
I enjoy my meals. I do.

768
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,893
Destiny has brought me here.

769
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:27,437
Destiny has brought me this lamb chop.

770
01:09:31,023 --> 01:09:32,067
[yelps]

771
01:09:52,879 --> 01:09:53,880
Joséphine.

772
01:09:56,633 --> 01:09:57,634
[sniffles]

773
01:09:58,427 --> 01:09:59,760
- Come then.
- [sniffles]

774
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:01,930
Come.

775
01:10:05,392 --> 01:10:07,309
[sighs]

776
01:10:08,644 --> 01:10:12,523
I love your talents and your taste.

777
01:10:14,776 --> 01:10:17,446
And while I'm away,
I will miss your grace.

778
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:19,489
- [sighs]
- And your dignity.

779
01:10:20,782 --> 01:10:22,576
And I will come back to you.

780
01:10:24,745 --> 01:10:25,746
[sighs]

[Austrian soldier shouts]

785
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,779
To today's victory. Hmm?

786
01:10:59,404 --> 01:11:01,406
Look, I'm always here for you, Francis.

787
01:11:02,407 --> 01:11:05,702
But I must admit, I'm overwhelmed
with the excitement of the battlefield.

788
01:11:06,745 --> 01:11:08,538
{\an8}I should not deceive you, Alexander.

789
01:11:08,538 --> 01:11:11,750
{\an8}This battle against him will be brutal
and terrifying.

01:11:38,402 --> 01:11:40,362
Get in defensive position!

I miss your warmth.</i>

<i>On this day, we celebrate

01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:50,849
That's it.

[French soldier shivering]

- Your Majesty.
- Mmm?

816
01:13:58,166 --> 01:13:59,668
We are discovered.

817
01:14:01,253 --> 01:14:02,254
Good.

818
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:04,840
Tell the men to rest.

Send in the infantry.

847

Take their position on the higher ground.
At the double.

Renounce, sir. We're pinned in.

01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:43,572
Off the ice! Withdraw!

872
01:20:50,454 --> 01:20:51,663
Cut off their retreat.

Francis. So nice to finally meet you.

878
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,886
Please come in where it's warm.

879
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,139
- Thank you.
- You must forgive me.

880
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,725
This has been my only palace
for the last two months.

881
01:21:54,935 --> 01:21:58,939
Seems very agreeable.
You make excellent use of it.

882
01:21:58,939 --> 01:22:00,982
Well, we do what we can
on the battlefield.

883
01:22:01,775 --> 01:22:04,069
- Yes, we do, don't we?
- Mm-hmm.

884
01:22:04,069 --> 01:22:06,321
It's nice to finally meet another emperor.

885
01:22:07,614 --> 01:22:09,866
Uh, where, may I ask, is Alexander?

886
01:22:09,866 --> 01:22:12,327
Are we waiting for his arrival
before we get started?

887
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:16,123
I do not believe he will be joining us.

888
01:22:16,123 --> 01:22:18,709
- He's beside himself with rage.
- [sighs]

889
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:25,382
I realize I must compliment you
for making me commit an enormous error.

890
01:22:26,466 --> 01:22:28,218
- An error?
- [Napoleon] Yes.

891
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:30,762
What error have you made?

892
01:22:32,764 --> 01:22:35,892
To be speaking with you here
and accepting this invitation for peace,

893
01:22:36,768 --> 01:22:38,478
I have not followed up my victory.

894
01:22:39,938 --> 01:22:43,191
I could have taken the whole Russian
and Austrian army prisoners.

895
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:47,112
Yes.

896
01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:49,823
But after all, there will be less tears.

897
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:55,704
And I know you will remember
this gesture of kindness. Yes?

898
01:22:57,122 --> 01:22:58,749
Thank you. [sighs]

899
01:23:02,794 --> 01:23:03,795
Toast?

900
01:23:12,929 --> 01:23:19,394
To friendship, a glorious peace
and the best interest of Europe.

901
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,611
Mmm. Burgundy.

902

- [classical music playing]

903

- [whines] Hold on.

904
01:23:51,385 --> 01:23:52,552
- [barks]
- Hey, whoa, whoa!

905
01:23:52,552 --> 01:23:54,596
- [chuckling]
- Whoa, we don't say woof.

906
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:57,808
Okay. [babbles]

907
01:23:57,808 --> 01:24:00,977
That's my boy. Attaboy.

908
01:24:00,977 --> 01:24:03,897
Come here. Come here.
Sit, sit, sit. [babbling]

909
01:24:03,897 --> 01:24:05,482
- [dog barks]
- [barks]

910
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,373
It is time to put this mystery to rest,
Emperor.

911
01:24:21,915 --> 01:24:24,710
I want to know if it's you or Joséphine.

912
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:32,092
And to that end, we will conduct
a very practical experiment.

913
01:24:34,928 --> 01:24:38,098
At the end of the hallway-- Take this--

914
01:24:38,974 --> 01:24:42,936
Waiting for you, undressed,
ready to receive,

915
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:48,358
is 18-year-old
Eléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne.

916
01:24:51,528 --> 01:24:53,697
She's brunette with brown eyes.

917
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:56,450
And the object of this, well,

918
01:24:56,450 --> 01:25:01,788
hardly unpleasant task is to see
if you can father a child.

919
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:05,167
- And then we will have an answer...
- Mmm.

920
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:07,002
...to this nagging question

921
01:25:07,002 --> 01:25:12,132
of who is keeping who from an heir
to the throne of France.

922
01:25:16,094 --> 01:25:17,095
[sighs]

923
01:25:17,637 --> 01:25:18,764
Shall we go?

924
01:25:19,389 --> 01:25:20,724
May I have another, please?

925
01:26:08,146 --> 01:26:10,148
[chattering, laughing]

926
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:22,202
The girl is pregnant.

927
01:26:22,202 --> 01:26:24,496
You made her pregnant. [chuckles]

928
01:26:26,164 --> 01:26:27,165
[Napoleon] Mm-hmm.

929
01:26:27,165 --> 01:26:29,251
[chattering, laughing]

930
01:26:37,551 --> 01:26:39,177
Uh, I know I didn't see her.

931
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:41,096
[speaking indistinctly]

932
01:26:46,393 --> 01:26:48,562
When are you going to insist we divorce?

933
01:26:50,272 --> 01:26:52,065
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

934
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:57,946
From the only woman that I've ever loved
and given all that I've conquered.

935
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:03,994
I'm just too tired to wait
for you to tell me what I know is coming.

936
01:27:06,413 --> 01:27:07,664
If you insist.

937
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:13,128
[sighs] I'll make it easy for you.

938
01:27:17,674 --> 01:27:22,095
[sighs] I know
you will have a bastard child.

939
01:27:27,309 --> 01:27:31,104
If I succeed in making the birth of a boy
that I shall call my own son,

940
01:27:32,022 --> 01:27:35,984
I want you as a witness
to pretend the confinement of the empress.

941
01:27:38,195 --> 01:27:39,404
[stammers] Your Highness,

942
01:27:39,404 --> 01:27:42,949
you are asking me to lie about the status
of the mother of your heir.

943
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:46,661
That is another way of putting it, yes.

944
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:47,746
[scoffs]

945
01:27:48,914 --> 01:27:54,670
Emperor... [sighs] ...it is my honor
and my duty, of course,

946
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,672
to do as you require of me.

947
01:27:56,672 --> 01:28:00,634
But if asked, I cannot contain
that which I know to be the truth.

948
01:28:01,677 --> 01:28:03,679
And painful though it is,

949
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:08,266
the truth is that the empress is
no longer capable of bearing you a child.

950
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:22,406
My good Joséphine. [sighs]

951
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:24,866
Hmm?

952
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,286
You know how I've loved you.

953
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:34,626
It is you, to you alone,

954
01:28:35,836 --> 01:28:39,423
that I owe the few moments
of happiness I have known in this world.

955
01:28:39,423 --> 01:28:40,549
Hmm.

956
01:28:43,385 --> 01:28:47,139
My destiny is more powerful than my will.

957
01:28:49,224 --> 01:28:55,230
And my affections must yield
to the interests of my people.

958
01:28:55,814 --> 01:28:57,816
[chuckling]

959
01:29:16,877 --> 01:29:20,130
The imperial decree
for the dissolution of the marriage

960
01:29:21,298 --> 01:29:25,010
between the Emperor Napoleon
and the Empress Joséphine.

961
01:29:29,473 --> 01:29:30,474
[sniffles]

962
01:29:33,643 --> 01:29:38,940
"My people desire that this throne,
where providence has placed me,

963
01:29:39,483 --> 01:29:41,151
would be given to my children.

964
01:29:42,903 --> 01:29:47,074
However, I have lost hope
of having children from my marriage

965
01:29:47,074 --> 01:29:49,826
to my beloved wife, Empress Joséphine.

966
01:29:50,827 --> 01:29:54,915
I have then been led to listen
only to the good of the state

967
01:29:54,915 --> 01:29:58,418
and to want the dissolution
of years of my life."

968
01:29:58,418 --> 01:29:59,503
[Josephine chuckles]

969

01:30:05,467 --> 01:30:10,180
You have embellished my life for 15 years.

971
01:30:12,432 --> 01:30:17,854
The memories of which
will remain forever etched in my heart.

01:31:01,648 --> 01:31:03,025
Sorry.

01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:07,487
- Emperor. Wait.
- Go. No, listen, listen. All right?

982
01:31:07,487 --> 01:31:10,198
This is for your country.
That's what this is, all right?

983
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:11,908
- [whimpers]
- Now say it.

984
01:31:13,368 --> 01:31:14,578
Say it.

"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

Agreeing to the dissolution
of our marriage,

987
01:31:29,509 --> 01:31:31,970
as I must, does not change my feelings.

988

a-always his-- his truest friend."

which separates us forever.</i>

{\an8}<i>Your mistaken ambition has ever been</i>

{\an8}<i>and will continue to be the guide

some consolation for my sufferings.</i>

- Good morning, madame.
- Thank you. What's your name?

- Fleur.
- Fleur. Pleasure.

I miss you.

1003
01:34:02,162 --> 01:34:04,164
Marital life is very agreeable now.

1004
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,546
You've shown such great courage so far.

You must maintain it.

Do not permit yourself
to fall into melancholy.

1008

You look best when you're happy.

1009
01:34:31,817 --> 01:34:33,402
Please take care of your health.

1010
01:34:34,403 --> 01:34:35,779
It is precious to me.

1011
01:34:37,114 --> 01:34:38,448
Will you write me tomorrow?

1012
01:34:39,241 --> 01:34:40,367
Mm-hmm.

1013
01:34:42,828 --> 01:34:43,954
And the next day?

1014
01:34:44,663 --> 01:34:45,664
Yes.

1015
01:34:46,748 --> 01:34:47,874
And the day after that?

1016
01:34:49,209 --> 01:34:50,210
Mm-hmm.

1017
01:34:51,712 --> 01:34:53,547
- And the day after that?
- Yeah.

1018
01:34:56,967 --> 01:34:57,968
Good.

1019
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:04,391

[door closes]

1021
01:35:08,228 --> 01:35:12,065
{\an8}Once, an English ambassador
challenged my reasons for war.

1022
01:35:12,733 --> 01:35:16,194
{\an8}He said,
"You French, you fight only for money,

1023
01:35:16,194 --> 01:35:18,447
while we English, we fight for honor."

1024
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:23,285
I replied,
"Everyone fights for what they lack."

1025
01:35:24,036 --> 01:35:26,580
[chuckles, stammers]

1026
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:29,666
This is not-- This is not your story.
This never happened to you, did it?

1027
01:35:29,666 --> 01:35:30,709
Of course it did.

1028
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:32,169
- Of course it did.
- What do you mean?

1029
01:35:32,169 --> 01:35:34,338
We had the same saying
with my people and the Turks.

1030
01:35:34,338 --> 01:35:35,630
- [chuckles]
- Do you?

1031
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:37,799
The English lack honor.
We can agree on that.

1032
01:35:37,799 --> 01:35:40,635
- [Alexander] Listen, there is-- [sighs]
- [mosquito buzzes]

1033
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:46,391
There's nothing I think we can agree
more with than our hatred for Britain.

1034
01:35:49,728 --> 01:35:54,232
I just have to say that it actually--

1035
01:35:54,232 --> 01:35:57,819
It would be my absolute pleasure
and honor if I could call you my brother.

1036
01:36:01,615 --> 01:36:03,617
There is a way for you to call me brother.

1037
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:11,208
Last night, at dinner, I was... [sighs]

1038
01:36:11,208 --> 01:36:13,627
...charmed by your sister.

1039
01:36:13,627 --> 01:36:15,087
[chuckles]

1040
01:36:15,087 --> 01:36:16,171
Is she spoken for?

1041
01:36:16,171 --> 01:36:18,090
Ah. Sadly, yes.

1042
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:21,885
She's to be married
to the Duke of Oldenburg, I'm afraid.

1043
01:36:22,594 --> 01:36:25,555
Uh, and what of her younger sister? Anna?

1044
01:36:25,555 --> 01:36:27,974
[stammers]
Is there a formal offer for Anna?

1045
01:36:27,974 --> 01:36:30,268
- [mosquito buzzes]
- [blows]

1046

[chuckles]

1047
01:36:35,023 --> 01:36:38,568
Uh, well, you see, An-Anna,
she's 15 years old.

1048
01:36:39,778 --> 01:36:40,946
That is a detail.

1049
01:36:40,946 --> 01:36:42,864
[mosquitoes buzzing]

1050
01:36:44,366 --> 01:36:48,954
Our friendship is built on
our mutual distrust of England.

1051
01:36:49,663 --> 01:36:54,042
When we hold to the Continental Blockade,
we choke them from the trade,

1052
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:56,420
and we fight for our most sacred rights.

1053
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,672
That is what is important between us.

1054
01:36:59,339 --> 01:37:00,340
I just had a thought.

1055
01:37:01,008 --> 01:37:02,300
- No.
- No, say it.

1056
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:04,011
- Should I tell you?
- Please.

1057
01:37:05,262 --> 01:37:08,015
Imagine an army. 50,000 men.

1058
01:37:08,515 --> 01:37:11,768
Russians, Frenchmen,
perhaps even Austrians,

1059
01:37:11,768 --> 01:37:14,563
marching by way of Constantinople
into Asia

1060
01:37:14,563 --> 01:37:16,314
would have only to reach the Euphrates

1061
01:37:16,314 --> 01:37:18,734
to make England tremble
and bring her down on her knees

1062
01:37:18,734 --> 01:37:20,569
- before the continent.
- [chuckles]

1063
01:37:23,864 --> 01:37:25,032
It is incredible.

1064
01:37:26,241 --> 01:37:27,242
Toast.

1065
01:37:31,788 --> 01:37:32,873
[sighs]

1066
01:37:34,082 --> 01:37:35,584
- To you.
- To us.

1067
01:37:36,793 --> 01:37:41,715
His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon,
wishes to make a formal offer to Austria

1068
01:37:41,715 --> 01:37:44,009
and to His Majesty, King Francis,

1069
01:37:45,218 --> 01:37:48,513
for the hand
of the archduchess, Marie-Louise.

1070
01:37:50,182 --> 01:37:51,308
His eldest daughter.

1071
01:37:52,642 --> 01:37:53,852
No.

1072
01:37:54,895 --> 01:37:57,689
Uh, this union would bring together
Austria and France

1073
01:37:57,689 --> 01:37:59,900
in an unbreakable matrimonial bond.

1074
01:38:01,693 --> 01:38:03,695
[in German] Is this a joke?

1075
01:38:06,073 --> 01:38:12,829
[in German] I may find it humorous...
but His Majesty does not.

1076
01:38:30,722 --> 01:38:32,391
[in English]
Did you have a pleasant journey?

1077
01:38:32,391 --> 01:38:34,017
It was wonderful. Thank you.

1078
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:41,608
You're quite petite.

1079
01:38:42,651 --> 01:38:43,860
I'm not accustomed to that.

1080
01:38:45,195 --> 01:38:46,613
[Marie-Louise chuckles]

1081
01:38:47,739 --> 01:38:49,032
How do I look to you?

1082
01:38:50,659 --> 01:38:52,411
Do I resemble my portrait?

1083
01:38:52,994 --> 01:38:57,332
Oh, yes.
And even more handsome and strong.

1084
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:02,129
And you are even more handsome,
more be-beautiful.

1085
01:39:02,879 --> 01:39:06,174
[chuckles]
I hope you're pleased with your choice.

1086
01:39:07,843 --> 01:39:11,013
I hope so too.
Would you like to see the bedroom?

1087
01:39:11,013 --> 01:39:13,390
[chuckles] Yes, thank you.

1088

Nearly there. Nearly there.

- [French soldier 2] Thank you, sir.

[soldier coughing]

[Napoleon shouting] Where are you?

1150
01:46:47,302 --> 01:46:49,596
300,000 souls lived in this city.

And they've all just left?

Where are you?

Don't be frightened.

1156
01:47:28,635 --> 01:47:30,846
I'm just gonna give you a little spanking.

1157
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:03,211
It's not very sporting, is it?

1158
01:48:05,088 --> 01:48:06,965
For his honor and Russia's, not mine.

1159
01:48:12,387 --> 01:48:14,348
There's dignity to be had in defeat.

Who did this?

1164
01:49:00,435 --> 01:49:01,436
They did.

1165
01:49:02,938 --> 01:49:06,149
No, they did not. Be sensible.

1166
01:49:09,069 --> 01:49:12,197
- Who set these fires?
- [sighs]

1167
01:49:12,197 --> 01:49:15,701
Your Majesty, they did.

[sighs]

1169
01:49:21,331 --> 01:49:24,292
He'd rather burn his own city
than negotiate with me.

1170
01:49:25,085 --> 01:49:27,129
I didn't think he had the courage.

1171
01:49:32,592 --> 01:49:38,140
Well, we'll go to Saint Petersburg
and have him burn that too.

1172
01:49:40,017 --> 01:49:43,562
We have let too much time slip away.

1173
01:49:45,272 --> 01:49:48,650
We would be marching
into the Russian winter

with horses that are not raised
for this weather.

If we go back to Poland,
we can wait out the winter months.

We are winning.

[Napoleon sighs] <i>Joséphine.

The allied coalition of Austria, Prussia,
Russia and England,

and with the agreement
of the French Council,

grant you sovereignty
of the island of Elba.

pensions for the Bonaparte family
and the Empress Marie-Louise.

1207
01:52:21,345 --> 01:52:26,558
It also provides for Empress Joséphine
to retain all of her properties

1208
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:31,897
and an allotted annual income
of one million francs.

I love France too much.

All I've desired was its glory.

1212

I would never bring her misfortune.

I know what it is like
to be underestimated.

But your eyes, your charm and your spirit,

Bonaparte, Your Majesty. He has returned.

Will you please inform the general that
I shall like to come and speak with him?

Do you recognize me, soldiers?

1279

02:01:45,450 --> 02:01:46,952
I want to come home.

1285
02:01:48,412 --> 02:01:49,705
Will you join me?

1286
02:01:51,456 --> 02:01:53,208
Long live the emperor!

1287
02:01:53,208 --> 02:02:00,716
- Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!

1288
02:02:00,716 --> 02:02:03,218
- [pledging continues]
- [cheering]

1289
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:15,022
[crying]

1290
02:02:40,714 --> 02:02:45,635
On May 26th, Dr. Corvisart was called

1291
02:02:46,928 --> 02:02:52,100
and found her chest congested
and her throat inflamed.

1292
02:02:54,478 --> 02:02:56,980
Her illness was diphtheria.

1293
02:03:00,067 --> 02:03:05,947
On May 29th, last sacrament was given,
and she died.

1294
02:03:10,577 --> 02:03:12,454
And no one thought to notify me?

1295
02:03:18,251 --> 02:03:19,461
[sighs]

1296
02:03:22,756 --> 02:03:23,757
Hortense.

1297
02:03:26,677 --> 02:03:29,429
Do you blame-- [breathes shakily]

1298
02:03:29,429 --> 02:03:30,722
Do you blame me?

1299
02:03:33,016 --> 02:03:34,559
- [sniffles]
- I don't blame you.

1300
02:03:34,559 --> 02:03:35,644
Of course not.

1301
02:03:38,522 --> 02:03:43,402
I'm not to bear the burden
of responsibility... [breathes shakily]

1302
02:03:43,402 --> 02:03:45,404
...for the misfortunes of your mother.

1303
02:03:46,530 --> 02:03:48,615
I want the letters that I wrote to her.
[sniffles]

1304
02:03:48,615 --> 02:03:52,744
I'm sorry, I don't have them.
They were stolen by her valet.

1305
02:03:54,287 --> 02:03:55,455
[blows]

1306
02:03:55,455 --> 02:03:56,748
Where did she keep them?

1307
02:03:59,126 --> 02:04:01,628
In the cupboard in her bedroom,
next to her bed.

1308
02:04:05,257 --> 02:04:06,675
What did he do with them?

1309
02:04:09,094 --> 02:04:10,679
Her valet sold them.

1310
02:04:17,102 --> 02:04:19,062
- [cries]
- [Hortense] I'm sorry.

1311
02:04:22,024 --> 02:04:23,025
I forgive you.

1312
02:04:27,821 --> 02:04:30,949
{\an8}[congress member]
Napoleon Bonaparte has destroyed

1313
02:04:30,949 --> 02:04:34,911
{\an8}the only title
upon which his very existence depended.

1314
02:04:36,329 --> 02:04:39,666
{\an8}This congregation of allies shall form

1315
02:04:39,666 --> 02:04:43,211
{\an8}along the borders of France
and Belgium an army.

1316
02:04:43,211 --> 02:04:45,964
70,000 troops from England,

1317
02:04:47,299 --> 02:04:49,885
120,000 troops from Prussia.

1318
02:04:51,970 --> 02:04:55,932
This vermin has routed
the farmyards of Europe

1319
02:04:56,808 --> 02:04:58,977
while the farmers snored.

1320
02:04:59,561 --> 02:05:01,772
We should have struck this blow long ago.

1321
02:05:02,856 --> 02:05:07,194
He has held the world hostage
with his egotism,

1322
02:05:07,194 --> 02:05:10,489
his insatiable hunger for power,

1323
02:05:10,489 --> 02:05:13,992
and his lack of simple good manners.

1324
02:05:14,951 --> 02:05:17,412
We will all sleep again without him.

1325
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:23,710
I believe I speak for all of us when I say
that the only regret we all share

1326
02:05:24,419 --> 02:05:27,839
is that we allowed this vermin
to live at all.

1327
02:05:29,007 --> 02:05:32,636
250,000 men with the traitor.

1328
02:05:33,845 --> 02:05:39,810
25,000 men, 125,000 men

1329
02:05:39,810 --> 02:05:42,562
and 100,000 men...

1330
02:05:46,066 --> 02:05:49,403
against our 125,000 men.

1331
02:05:51,863 --> 02:05:53,448
This is a fight on land.

1332
02:05:55,117 --> 02:05:58,120
This is what Britain does not know
how to do that I know.

1333
02:06:00,414 --> 02:06:04,501
Strike quickly
against Wellington and Blücher.

1334
02:06:05,293 --> 02:06:06,878
Defeat them separately.

1335
02:06:07,921 --> 02:06:11,341
Disallow them from uniting forces here.

1336
02:06:24,396 --> 02:06:25,605
Morning.

1337
02:06:25,605 --> 02:06:27,691
- Morning.
- [grunts]

1338
02:06:27,691 --> 02:06:29,234
The Prussians are advancing.

1339
02:06:30,318 --> 02:06:31,820
We should begin the offensive.

1340
02:06:32,529 --> 02:06:34,614
[Napoleon]
We must wait for the ground to dry.

1341
02:06:37,117 --> 02:06:40,412
Blücher will never make it in time.
I'll have Wellington by lunch.

1342
02:06:47,836 --> 02:06:51,006
[thunder rumbling]

1343
02:06:52,966 --> 02:06:54,384
[sighs, grunts]

1344
02:06:56,345 --> 02:06:57,763
[clears throat]

1345
02:07:03,226 --> 02:07:06,438
I never get wet if I can help it.
[clears throat]

1346
02:07:52,526 --> 02:07:55,445
[thunder rumbling]

1347
02:08:12,129 --> 02:08:13,505
What shall I tell the men?

1348
02:08:15,549 --> 02:08:17,259
Tell them to make the rain stop.

1349
02:08:20,262 --> 02:08:24,599
- [British soldier 1] Coming through!
- [British soldier 2] In formation!

1350
02:08:26,059 --> 02:08:28,729
[Wellesley]
Now's your time, lads. Now's your time.

1351
02:08:30,063 --> 02:08:31,690
Now, listen very carefully.

1352
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:38,071
Patience is the order of the day today.
Patience shall win the day.

1353
02:08:38,822 --> 02:08:41,074
We must hold this ground.

1354
02:08:41,783 --> 02:08:43,577
Let them come to us.

1355
02:08:43,577 --> 02:08:45,495
[soldiers] Huzzah!

1356
02:08:50,834 --> 02:08:52,085
Go on, boys. Go on.

1357
02:08:54,254 --> 02:08:55,255
Whoa.

1358
02:08:56,048 --> 02:08:57,257
Good morning, General Blücher.

1359
02:08:57,257 --> 02:08:59,968
- Good morning.
- Estimated time of arrival, sir?

1360
02:08:59,968 --> 02:09:02,387
- Officer?
- About five hours.

1361
02:09:02,387 --> 02:09:04,056
About five hours.

1362
02:09:20,614 --> 02:09:21,990
Come on, boys. Come on, boys.

1363
02:09:23,241 --> 02:09:24,242
[grunts]

1364
02:09:26,995 --> 02:09:28,997
[soldier shouting, distant]

1365
02:09:34,544 --> 02:09:35,837
Oh, there he is.

1366
02:09:36,755 --> 02:09:42,427
He appears to be... [chuckles]
...just sleeping.

1367
02:09:43,887 --> 02:09:49,309
One thing you cannot resist, my friend,
is a frontal attack.

1368
02:09:52,229 --> 02:09:55,232
Let's see how this general
can attack our position.

1369
02:09:58,235 --> 02:10:03,073
Sir. I have the emperor in my sights.
Do I have permission to fire?

1370
02:10:03,073 --> 02:10:04,282
Certainly not.

1371
02:10:04,783 --> 02:10:07,077
Generals commanding armies
have better things to do with their time

1372
02:10:07,077 --> 02:10:08,203
than to shoot at one another.

1373
02:10:08,203 --> 02:10:10,747
Hold your fire, rifleman,
on pain of death.

1374
02:10:10,747 --> 02:10:12,624
Go on, boys. Come, come.

1375
02:10:12,624 --> 02:10:14,501
[British soldier] A runner coming through!

1376
02:10:16,003 --> 02:10:17,671
Blücher, 11 to 12 miles, sir.

1377
02:10:18,505 --> 02:10:20,340
[British general 1] Attention, follow me.

1378
02:10:20,841 --> 02:10:23,385
- Blücher at 11 to 12 miles, sir.
- Jesus Christ.

1379
02:10:23,385 --> 02:10:25,554
- I want a report every hour.
- Yes, sir.

1380
02:10:28,348 --> 02:10:32,019
[French soldier]
Runner coming through. Make way.

1381
02:10:32,019 --> 02:10:35,022
Oh. Oh.

1382
02:10:36,606 --> 02:10:39,526
[panting]
Prussians on the roadside, 12 miles.

1383
02:10:45,782 --> 02:10:49,661
Prussian troops have been sighted
on the road, sire. Twelve miles.

1384
02:10:53,290 --> 02:10:54,499
Ready the cannons.

1385
02:10:58,128 --> 02:10:59,796
Ready the cannons!

[French soldiers clamoring]

1387
02:11:02,883 --> 02:11:05,010
[French general] Go on! Move!

02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:13,685
[French soldiers shouting]

[French soldier 1]
Ready! Cannons are ready!

02:11:29,701 --> 02:11:31,411
Prepare to fire!

02:11:49,638 --> 02:11:51,181
[British general 2] Take cover!

1396
02:11:53,975 --> 02:11:56,311
Straight into position. Steady.

1397
02:11:56,311 --> 02:12:00,482
Prepare for the advance. Get ready.

1398
02:12:01,817 --> 02:12:03,276
Prepare for the advance.

1399

Readjust to 195!

1400

Prepare to fire! Fire!

1404
02:12:19,334 --> 02:12:20,961
[French soldiers] Fire!

- [British general 3] Hold fast, men!

Second wave, advance! Over the top, men!

1417
02:13:16,892 --> 02:13:18,310
Hold the line!

1418
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:20,354
Cannons!

1419
02:13:21,063 --> 02:13:22,856
- Fire!
- [French soldiers shouting]

1420
02:13:26,276 --> 02:13:27,819

[British general 2] Fire!

1423
02:13:41,708 --> 02:13:43,835
[British general 3]
You there, get on that cannon.

1424
02:13:45,879 --> 02:13:47,756
[French soldiers clamoring]

1425
02:13:53,970 --> 02:13:55,013
[British soldier] Fire!

1426

[screaming]

1427
02:14:01,895 --> 02:14:03,689
[French general 2] Fill the gap!

1428
02:14:05,524 --> 02:14:06,942
[French general 1] Keep the line!

[soldiers shouting]

1430
02:14:14,449 --> 02:14:17,077
Skirmishers, keep advancing! [yelps]

[French general 2] Get in formation.

1432
02:14:18,495 --> 02:14:20,330
Fire at will.

1433
02:14:25,627 --> 02:14:27,963
[British general 2]
Keep them back, men. Fire.

1434
02:14:27,963 --> 02:14:31,049
[drums playing]

1435
02:14:31,049 --> 02:14:34,302
Go on, go on. Don't let them rally!

1436
02:14:38,557 --> 02:14:41,268
[British general 2 speaks indistinctly]
...the strike position.

1437
02:14:41,268 --> 02:14:43,812
[French runner]
Get up, boys. Go on. Go on, boys.

1438
02:14:45,397 --> 02:14:46,732
Whoa, whoa.

1439
02:14:49,276 --> 02:14:52,195
Prussians, roadside, five miles.

1440
02:14:53,905 --> 02:14:55,532
[French general] Five miles, maybe less.

1441
02:14:57,534 --> 02:14:59,202
We have to act before Blücher arrives.

1442
02:14:59,870 --> 02:15:00,871
Out.

1443
02:15:03,707 --> 02:15:04,708
Out!

1444
02:15:15,635 --> 02:15:18,388
- [British general 2 shouting]
- [French general] Cavalry!

1445
02:15:19,681 --> 02:15:21,475
Charge!

1446
02:15:21,475 --> 02:15:23,810
[French army shouting]

1447
02:15:28,482 --> 02:15:29,983
Prepare to receive cavalry.

1448
02:15:29,983 --> 02:15:32,527
[British general]
Prepare to receive cavalry.

1449

[soldiers shouting]

1450
02:15:41,203 --> 02:15:45,582
[Wellesley] We must hold our ground.
Stand fast to the last man.

1451
02:15:45,582 --> 02:15:47,918
We must not be beat!

1452
02:15:48,710 --> 02:15:50,962
Or what will they say in England?

1453
02:15:50,962 --> 02:15:54,216
- [British general] Hold the line.
- [British soldier] Keep it tight.

1454
02:15:54,216 --> 02:15:57,177
[soldiers shouting]

1455
02:15:58,553 --> 02:16:02,057
[British general]
Steady, men. Stay in formation.

1456
02:16:05,477 --> 02:16:07,854
[French soldier] Long live the emperor!

1457
02:16:10,190 --> 02:16:12,109
[British general] Company, halt!

1458
02:16:12,776 --> 02:16:16,154
[British general 2]
Form square! Form square!

1459

[French general] Long live the emperor!

1461
02:16:37,467 --> 02:16:41,138
[British general] One section, fire.
Two section, fire.

1462
02:16:42,097 --> 02:16:44,850
[soldiers shouting, grunting]

[grunts]

1465
02:16:57,529 --> 02:17:00,449
[French general] What do we do, sir?
We can't break through.

1466
02:17:00,449 --> 02:17:02,993
[British general] Keep them running.
Get in back with the square.

1467
02:17:05,704 --> 02:17:07,289
Show them your British steel.

1468
02:17:10,917 --> 02:17:13,878
[breathing heavily]

1469
02:17:18,967 --> 02:17:20,927
[French general] Present arms!

[huffs]

1471
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:25,974
Shoulder, hold!

1472
02:17:30,562 --> 02:17:32,314
- They're here, the Prussians.
- [grunts]

1473
02:17:35,191 --> 02:17:37,069
- [grunts]
- First over the rise, Emperor.

1474
02:17:37,069 --> 02:17:38,861

[soldiers shouting]

1476
02:18:03,094 --> 02:18:05,180
[French soldier 1]
We need to find a way through!

1477
02:18:08,016 --> 02:18:10,018
[French soldier 2]
Break the square. Break the square!

[Napoleon] Charge bayonets.

02:18:22,823 --> 02:18:24,658
[French general] Charge bayonets!

1482
02:18:26,743 --> 02:18:31,289
Your Emperor is with you.
You are the brave of Austerlitz.

1483
02:18:32,164 --> 02:18:33,709
Never surrender.

1484
02:18:34,543 --> 02:18:37,045
For homeland and glory!

1485
02:18:43,927 --> 02:18:46,680
[British general] Shoulder to shoulder!
Form lines!

1486

Infantry, advance.

02:18:57,190 --> 02:19:03,030
- Battalion! [indistinct] Advance!
- [sighs]

1491
02:19:08,701 --> 02:19:10,078
[French general] Keep the line!

1492
02:19:12,371 --> 02:19:14,583
[British general] Footmen, fire!

1493
02:19:18,503 --> 02:19:20,589
Second line, fire.

1494
02:19:24,509 --> 02:19:25,886
Prepare to charge!

1495
02:19:28,305 --> 02:19:29,681
Charge!

02:19:36,438 --> 02:19:38,231
[British general] Go on! Batter them!

1498
02:19:40,650 --> 02:19:42,819
[British general 2] Advance! Advance!

1499
02:19:55,082 --> 02:19:56,290
Cavalry advance, sir?

1500
02:19:57,542 --> 02:19:58,834
Cavalry advance.

1501
02:19:59,419 --> 02:20:01,838
[British general]
Prepare for counterattack.

1502
02:20:01,838 --> 02:20:06,677
Men, enter. Full support.

[soldiers screaming, grunting]

[grunting]

1508
02:20:41,628 --> 02:20:45,424
No. He can't help himself.

1509
02:20:46,675 --> 02:20:48,385
[British general] Sir, Blücher.

1510
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:56,101
Thank God.

1511
02:20:56,601 --> 02:21:01,565
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

1512
02:21:02,899 --> 02:21:05,777
Come see how <i>masse de la</i> France dines!

1513
02:21:05,777 --> 02:21:08,447
Yeah! Hyah!

1514
02:21:08,447 --> 02:21:09,656
[pants]

1515
02:21:10,449 --> 02:21:12,367
[gunshot fires]

1516
02:21:34,639 --> 02:21:36,933
Yeah! Yeah!

1517

[soldiers struggling]

[shouting, screaming]

1519
02:22:11,385 --> 02:22:15,847
The battle is mine.
There will be an end to the war.

{\an8}[whistle blowing]

1521
02:22:23,397 --> 02:22:25,315
[British general] Senior officer, on deck!

1522
02:22:27,859 --> 02:22:29,736
Good day, good day, good day.

1523
02:22:32,989 --> 02:22:38,370
I am the first to admit
when I make a mistake. But I never do.

1524
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:40,288
Because it is geometry.

1525
02:22:41,748 --> 02:22:44,126
I simply know
precisely where to place a cannon.

1526
02:22:45,669 --> 02:22:50,382
But tragically I cannot transfer
this knowledge to my marshals. [sighs]

1527
02:22:51,466 --> 02:22:54,678
That might be
what is most difficult in life.

1528
02:22:56,638 --> 02:22:58,306
Accepting the failures of others.

1529
02:22:59,391 --> 02:23:00,642
You must not do that.

1530
02:23:03,103 --> 02:23:04,438
Encourage greatness.

1531
02:23:09,776 --> 02:23:11,987
- Mind your head, sir.
- [Wellesley grunts]

1532
02:23:13,822 --> 02:23:15,574
[British general] Mind your head, sir.

1533
02:23:22,706 --> 02:23:25,792
- What are they doing there?
- Sir, it's the midshipmen. They adore him.

1534
02:23:25,792 --> 02:23:26,960
Well, get 'em out.

1535
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:28,962
Clear the room. Uh, quickly.

1536
02:23:45,354 --> 02:23:47,397
- Your grace--
- Good morning, General.

1537
02:23:47,397 --> 02:23:48,774
These boys are delightful.

1538
02:23:50,692 --> 02:23:51,985
May I sit down?

1539
02:23:51,985 --> 02:23:53,070
Please.

1540
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:55,655
[clears throat, sniffs]
And this breakfast.

1541
02:23:56,656 --> 02:24:01,036
Now I know why you have
such a successful navy. Thank you.

1542
02:24:01,828 --> 02:24:04,456
- [grunts]
- [Wellesley clears throat]

1543
02:24:06,917 --> 02:24:09,294
I've never visited
the English countryside.

1544
02:24:09,294 --> 02:24:11,254
I imagine I'll love the Cotswolds...

1545
02:24:14,716 --> 02:24:17,803
- soft flowing hills, gentle light.
- [sighs]

1546
02:24:19,763 --> 02:24:24,142
Uh, my dear sir,
it is only by a narrow margin of opinion

1547
02:24:24,142 --> 02:24:26,436
that you have been spared the fate
of being shot.

1548
02:24:26,436 --> 02:24:27,604
[scoffs]

1549
02:24:27,604 --> 02:24:30,440
[chuckles]
Politically, I'm afraid it's impossible

1550
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:33,944
for the British government
to allow you to stay in England.

1551
02:24:36,029 --> 02:24:39,074
You are permitted three officers
and 12 servants

1552
02:24:39,074 --> 02:24:41,368
to accompany you into exile.

1553
02:24:42,202 --> 02:24:45,872
Exile will be contained to the island
of Saint Helena

1554
02:24:45,872 --> 02:24:50,544
under the watchful eye
of Governor Hudson Lowe and his family.

02:24:50,544 --> 02:24:51,628
[grunts]

1556
02:24:52,879 --> 02:24:53,880
Saint...

1557
02:24:55,090 --> 02:24:58,510
Helena. It's a small island.

1558
02:24:58,510 --> 02:25:00,971
[chuckles] More of a rock, really.

1559
02:25:02,014 --> 02:25:04,766
A thousand miles
from the mainland of Africa.

1560
02:25:05,517 --> 02:25:10,022
I'm told it's very pretty, tranquil.
You'll have time to reflect.

1561
02:25:11,732 --> 02:25:13,900
Your correspondence will be monitored,

1562
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:17,529
your presence verified twice daily
by the orderly officer.

1563
02:25:27,789 --> 02:25:31,043
[crew member] Fix that rigging line.
Draw up the sails.

1564
02:25:32,627 --> 02:25:33,962
Go below deck!

1565
02:25:39,217 --> 02:25:40,635
[crew shouting]

<i>Next time, I will be Emperor,</i>

1571
02:26:05,911 --> 02:26:07,913
<i>and you will do as I say.</i>

1572
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:17,881
[Napoleon] <i>Well, you were right.</i>

1573

Girls, what's the capital of France?

1577
02:27:03,010 --> 02:27:04,011
Paris.

1578
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:05,721
And Russia?

1579
02:27:06,430 --> 02:27:08,682
Petersburg. And Moscow before.

1580
02:27:10,642 --> 02:27:15,063
Moscow.
And who burnt Moscow to the ground?

1581
02:27:19,484 --> 02:27:20,485
I don't know, sir.

1582
02:27:21,945 --> 02:27:22,946
I did.

1583
02:27:23,739 --> 02:27:27,576
I believe, sir, the Russians burnt it
to get rid of the French.

1584
02:27:28,076 --> 02:27:29,077
Who told you that?

1585
02:27:29,870 --> 02:27:31,329
It's common knowledge, sir.

1586
02:27:34,207 --> 02:27:35,333
[children chuckle]

1587
02:27:35,333 --> 02:27:37,711
Go. Go play.

<i>It is a secret.
And I will show you when you arrive.</i>

And let's try this again.</i>
