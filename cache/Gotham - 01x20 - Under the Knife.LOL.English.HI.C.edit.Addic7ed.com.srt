<i>He's a serial killer.</i>

5
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:11,853
Whoever did this is a monster.

6
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:13,522
The blood of his next
victim is on my hands.

7
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,424
If you don't drop it,
that blood could be Lee's.

<i>Because the Ogre retaliates against any cop</i>

11
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:23,598
You need my help to find him.

12
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:25,334
Who sent you?

13
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:28,337
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

(car horns honk, siren wails in distance)

17
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:46,254
Hey!

18
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:50,359
You look far from home.

19
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:53,895
Get away from him.

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,530
Or what?

21
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,800
(scoffs)

22
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:00,836
Whatever.

00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,109
SELINA: Come on.

24
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:08,410
Did you go back?

25
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,445
Yeah. The cops are there.

26
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:13,782
And?

27
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:15,284
And?

28
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:17,219
What do you think?

29
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:19,922
He fell out of a five-story
window. He's dead.

30
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:23,125
(voice breaks): Why'd you do it?

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,527
He told us what we wanted.
He told us about Bunderslaw.

32
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,662
You didn't have to go and kill the guy!

33
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:28,196
Yes, I did! 'Cause the moment we'd left,

34
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:29,565
he was gonna go tell his boss!

35
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,867
Who works for you, by the way.

36
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:33,769
He's the one who tried to kill me,

37
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:36,672
who tried to kill your butler...

38
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:38,941
who probably killed your parents.

39
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:42,477
I saved your life.

40
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:45,314
Besides... you wanted to do it, too.

41
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:47,683
You just didn't have the guts.

42
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,787
- Wait...!
- Just go home.

43
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,956
We still have to find out who
Bunderslaw is and what he wants.

44
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,424
You mean you do.

45
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:59,428
You really think this is
over? He's gonna come after us.

46
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,965
So what's next? Hmm?

47
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:09,504
- His safe.
- What?

48
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,039
Every senior executive at Wayne Enterprises

49
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:12,441
has a safe in their office.

50
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:15,310
A-Any secrets Bunderslaw
has, that's where they'll be.

51
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,812
Key or combination?

52
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,448
Key. My dad had one.

53
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:22,618
He'll probably keep it on him, then.

54
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:26,388
Figure out a way to get me
close, and I'll steal it.

55
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:29,157
- Can you do that?
- I think so.

56
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:33,462
And what happened tonight, you tell no one.

57
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:35,797
Not your buddy Detective Gordon,

58
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:37,799
not your butler.

59
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,835
No one.

Where's Thompkins?

65
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,669
Detective Gordon, Dr.
Thompkins said I was free

66
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:15,037
to use this room. She's very nice.

67
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,305
She's not like the old medical examiner.

68
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,574
Ed, just tell me where she is.

69
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:21,577
- No riddles.
- Home. She went home.

70
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:26,315
Hope you find her.

71
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,461

Jim, is that you?

00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:21,603

76
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:29,945

77
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:34,516
Go on.

00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:39,154

80
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:46,395
- I... slow down.
- Lee, please.

81
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:47,396
Start over.

82
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,565
This case you caught, the dead woman,

83
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,033
she was murdered by a serial killer?

84
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:54,136
Yes. Who's killed a
dozen women, maybe more.

85
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,939
And Loeb gave you this on purpose?

86
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:58,574
He wants to hurt me.

87
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,743
And how am I in danger?

88
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:04,012
He murders the loved ones of any cop

89
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:05,781
who investigates him.

90
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:08,250
It's how he's been able
to get away with it so far.

91
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:10,052
Anyone who comes after him,

92
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:11,253
he's killed someone they love

93
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,955
and the investigation's been buried.

94
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:15,691
Bullock knows a cop...

95
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:17,426
Came home and found his wife.

96
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,763
Her throat had been cut.

97
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:25,534
Oh...

98
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,803
That's why Loeb gave me the case.

99
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:30,439
Either I give up, like everyone else...

100
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:32,908
and live, knowing I let a killer go free...

101
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:34,810
or I keep on,

102
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:37,813
and someone I love is killed.

103
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:43,252
You're not giving up, are you?

104
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:44,620
I can't.

105
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:49,158
That's why I need you to
get out of Gotham right now.

106
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:50,526
Tonight.

107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,828
No.

108
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,498
You want to protect me? Find him.

109
00:05:58,268 --> 00:06:00,803
I'm gonna stay here and do my job.

110
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,809
But I do like that you think of me

111
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:08,844
as a loved one.

112
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:12,615
I do.

113
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:17,086
Love you.

114
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,788
And it only took a serial
killer to get you to say that.

115
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,631
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

116
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,976
Hi.

117
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,784
(door opens, closes)

118
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:05,892
This is it.

119
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:08,929
Home sweet, you know.

120
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:12,366
This is a great space.

121
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,601
Selina?

122
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,136
Hmm.

123
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,505
- Sort of a roommate.
- Hmm.

124
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,807
She comes and goes.

125
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,190
Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball.

126
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,782
Didn't you know I'm a member of society?

127
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,050
I go every year.

128
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:33,620
Get my picture taken in a pretty dress.

129
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:35,789
Smile.

130
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,805
Aren't you scared of my being here?

131
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,241
Should I be?

132
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,343
Are you dangerous?

133
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:58,812
I don't know... is your
boyfriend gonna come home?

134
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:02,816
I never said I had a boyfriend.

135
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,727
I assumed a woman as beautiful as you...

136
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,462
You assumed I had a boyfriend

137
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,831
and you assumed I would
be the kind of woman

138
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,566
who would cheat on him.

139
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:21,201
Well, I'm not.

140
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,837
And I don't have a boyfriend.

141
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,573
And if a bus hit me tomorrow,

142
00:08:26,608 --> 00:08:28,642
no one would care.

143
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,881
That change things?

144
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,117
- Yes, actually, it does.
- Make it more illicit?

145
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:39,586
Or would there be less chance
of us getting attached...

146
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:41,588
One night and done.

147
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:42,990
Only that would happen anyway.

148
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:45,525
Because once you saw the real me,

149
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,262
you would run screaming,
like everyone else.

150
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:54,134
I have to say, you're not
who I imagined you'd be.

151
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:56,169
Surprise.

152
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,406
You can let yourself out.

- And I will.
- (laughs)

159
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:20,460
But first I have to
finish with that gentleman.

160
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:21,929
Who knew running

161
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:24,932
a nightclub was so much work?

162
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,967
My poor darling.

163
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,810
As I was saying,

164
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:40,147
you and your crew are the best
gun and knife men in the city.

165
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:42,749
Your hit on Councilman Klein...

166
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:44,651
A thing of beauty.

167
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:47,221
- And I'm a fan, so...
- Cheers.

00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:49,122
What do you want?

169
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:50,924
For you to help me kill Don Maroni

170
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,126
and all of his lieutenants.

171
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:55,462
You're having a laugh.

172
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:58,398
I'm fairly certain I'm not.

173
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,300
And Falcone's good with this?

174
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:02,836
He will be. When it's done.

175
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:05,939
Thank you. No, thank you.

176
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,841
So you like being number two.

177
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:13,847
Falcone gives Victor Zsasz
first dibs on every new contract.

178
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:17,284
You bring him the bullet-riddled
corpse of his enemy

179
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,353
and all of that will change.

180
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:21,622
This is your chance to move up.

181
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:24,758
(wry chuckle)

182
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,860
You're a mad fella, aren't ya?

183
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,330
Fair enough.

184
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:32,232
Come by the bar tomorrow.

185
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:34,268
We'll talk details.

186
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,309
What's this about, Harvey?

187
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:43,410
BULLOCK: Have a seat.

188
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:45,379
This is my partner Jim Gordon.

189
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:46,880
Detective.

190
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:49,750
Eight years ago, you
investigated the murder

191
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:51,418
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

192
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,655
- That was a long time ago.
- It was the Ogre.

193
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:56,156
Julie Kemble was his first victim.

194
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,991
But you dropped the investigation,

195
00:10:58,026 --> 00:10:59,159
and because of that,

196
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,727
11 more women have been murdered.

197
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:02,296
(chuckles) Seriously, guys, you know...

198
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,697
Stop.

199
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,666
We also know the Ogre

200
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,335
kills the loved ones of
the cops that hunt him down.

201
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:10,904
That pattern started with you.

202
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:15,042
We think you found
something that spooked him.

203
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:18,545
Your notes from the investigation.

204
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,013
The last page,

205
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:21,582
something's been scratched out.

206
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,050
I want to know what.

207
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,087
He killed my wife.

208
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:29,857
I still got a daughter, Harvey.

209
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:33,594
Beth Tudor.

210
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,362
Katherine Wood.

211
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,064
Jessica Parker.

212
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,533
11 women.

213
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:44,471
Each one was someone's daughter.

214
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:46,340
It has to stop.

215
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:49,076
Yeah. I was doing background

216
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,579
on the dead girl. Someone
told me she was a nurse

217
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:54,581
for a private medical clinic uptown.

218
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,917
It was on Grant and 80th.

219
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,752
Some cosmetic place.

220
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:01,221
We'll put cops on your
daughter until this is done.

221
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:10,397
(camera clicks)

222
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:25,279
So you forgive me?

223
00:12:25,313 --> 00:12:27,815
Mm-hmm.

224
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:31,251
- I'll see you tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

225
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:34,855
How's it hanging, Riddle Man?

226
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,391
Uh, it's hanging...

227
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,393
fine.

228
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,528
(trembling sigh)

229
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:44,465
Mr. Nygma,

230
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,300
did you need something?

231
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:47,968
Oh. Yes. Uh...

232
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:50,137
Detective Gordon wanted me to
go through the forensic evidence

233
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,639
- of these old murders.
- Okay.

234
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:55,743
- Are those bruises?
- Uh...

235
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:58,312
Did Officer Dougherty do that?

236
00:12:58,346 --> 00:13:00,714
Um, he was... upset, and he didn't mean to.

237
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:02,683
I-I said some things
I shouldn't have, and...

238
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,718
Miss Kringle, this is not
right. He can't just...

239
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:09,089
Mr. Nygma, it is none of your concern.

240
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:11,425
Now, I-I need to get started

241
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,761
on these files, so...

242
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,884
Alfred.

243
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,585
Should you be up?

244
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,321
Oh, thank you, Master Bruce. I feel...

245
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:42,156
I feel much better.

246
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,824
Can I get you anything?

247
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:46,493
Yes, actually. I've decided to attend

248
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:48,896
the Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball tonight.

249
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,464
All the senior management will be there,

250
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:51,799
and I think people should see

251
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,001
that a Wayne is still at
the head of the company.

252
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,003
I shall set your tux out for you.

253
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,605
Alfred...

254
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,640
Yes, Master Bruce.

255
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:05,446
Wh-When you were in the army...

256
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,716
you had to kill people, right?

257
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,184
Yes.

258
00:14:10,218 --> 00:14:11,752
Yes, I did.

259
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:14,722
And it was necessary?

260
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:17,057
Oh, I see... so you
overheard the conversation

261
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:19,526
that Reggie and I had
that was best left unsaid.

262
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:21,528
But in answer to your question, yes.

263
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:24,498
Yes, it was necessary.

264
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,067
Now, if you'll excuse me,

265
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:28,836
I better go and find my good cufflinks,

266
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,437
if we're stepping out.

267
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:33,040
No, but, uh, you're-you're
still recovering.

268
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:34,975
What, I'm supposed to let
you walk into that nest

269
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,377
of vipers on your tod?

270
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:38,379
There'll be hundreds
of people there, Alfred.

271
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:40,347
I won't be in any danger.

272
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:42,383
So you say. But you're not gonna go alone.

273
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,551
I won't be alone.

274
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,455
I've invited Selina Kyle.

275
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,257
Selina Kyle?

276
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:53,527
To the Wayne Enterprises Ball?

277
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:55,963
I see.

278
00:14:55,997 --> 00:14:58,065
What do you see?

279
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:00,067
Nothing. I mean, you
know... I mean, you're...

280
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:02,603
a healthy young lad and
she's a very pretty young girl

281
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:04,939
with a penchant of wearing,
well, a little too much leather.

282
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:07,875
- Alfred, it's not like that.
- Then what's it like?

283
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,811
Well...

284
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,646
well, what if it is, huh?

285
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:14,582
What's wrong with that?

286
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:17,885
Absolutely nothing.

287
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,554
So, I will wait in the car outside,

288
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:23,090
so you don't feel my watchful eye,

289
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:26,160
but I will be close by, if there needs be.

290
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:29,263
That is the deal.

291
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:31,098
Fine.

292
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:32,433
Could you call around and send

293
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:35,569
some dresses and shoes
to where she's staying?

294
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,605
This is the address.

295
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,509
It's a charity ball, Alfred.

296
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,678
I'll be fine.

297
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:54,755
Freaky, huh?

298
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:58,092
You wonder how they
recognize themselves after.

299
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:01,095
Doc Thompkins is fine.

300
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,797
No one's gonna touch her
at the precinct. Relax.

301
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:06,700
You do understand it's because
of me that she's in danger.

302
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:08,502
Anything that happens is my fault.

303
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:09,970
You can't hold yourself responsible

304
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:11,772
for the actions of a psychopath.

305
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:14,141
Sure, I can.

306
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:16,277
Detectives... I'm Dr. Cushman.

307
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:17,611
How can I help you?

308
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:20,881
We're looking into the murder
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

309
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,883
She worked here about eight years ago.

310
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:25,286
Of course. Terrible thing.

311
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,087
Julie was a talented nurse.

312
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:29,623
But she'd only just started
here when it happened.

313
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:32,293
She'd been recommended
by one of our patients.

314
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:34,695
- The patient's name?
- (scoffs): Well, I'm afraid

315
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:37,031
I can't give you that. Confidentiality.

316
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,699
Really?

317
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,968
You're gonna make us get a warrant?

318
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:42,803
Yes.

319
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:44,805
"I specialize in fake
boobs, but I got ethics.

320
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,140
I need a warrant."

321
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:48,275
We'll talk to Judge Harkness. I'm sure...

322
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,849
That car was in front of the precinct.

323
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,417
Jim, wait up.

324
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,025
(starts engine)

325
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,193
(tires screeching)

326
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:10,498
(tires screeching)

327
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:11,532
(car horn blaring)

328
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:17,705
- You sure about this?
- It was him.

329
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,106
You saw his face?

330
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:21,108
No. I should've been looking for a tail.

331
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:23,110
It's obvious he tracks our investigations.

332
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,912
BULLOCK: Called in a description
of the car and a partial plate,

333
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,280
but I'm not too hopeful.

334
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:28,115
So what's the next move?

335
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,051
Gordon, you got a call. Says it's urgent.

336
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:38,192
- Gordon.
- JASON: Detective.

337
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,482
I didn't get a chance to say
hello properly in the alley.

338
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:41,517
Listen to me...

339
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,501
Don't bother tracing this. I won't be long.

340
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,633
I'm giving you one chance
to turn yourself in.

341
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:49,136
You make me come after you,
and I will put you down.

342
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:50,271
Something tells me you've begun

343
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:52,206
to buy your own press, Detective.

344
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,309
The hero cop who's gonna clean up Gotham.

345
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:58,479
The rising star of the GCPD.

346
00:17:58,513 --> 00:18:00,281
I'll stop you, that's for damn sure.

347
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:01,716
No, Detective, you won't.

348
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,783
But keep on your present course,

349
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:04,251
and I will kill someone you love.

350
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,721
This is your only warning.

351
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:09,757
(click, dial tone)

352
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,325
BULLOCK: Oh, no.

353
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,495
Tell me that wasn't him.

354
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:19,834
He's used to intimidating cops.

355
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:22,069
We have to show him we're not afraid.

356
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,238
And how do we do that?

357
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:29,302
You're okay with this? You're sure?

358
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:32,313
Yes. It's the right thing to do.

359
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:41,188
(cameras clicking)

360
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:44,191
I called you here today...

361
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:46,193
because the people of
Gotham deserve to know

362
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:48,696
that there's a serial
killer in their midst.

363
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,565
For years, he's killed with impunity,

364
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,803
aided by a culture of silence
and fear among the police.

365
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,539
That ends now.

366
00:18:58,573 --> 00:19:02,476
We'll be providing the names
and photos of all of the victims.

367
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,478
Please call with any information.

368
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:07,114
And to the man who committed
these horrific crimes,

369
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:10,851
(on TV): your days of hiding are over.

370
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:13,721
I'm coming after you.

371
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:16,223
And I'm not gonna stop.

372
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,326
- (sighs)
- What are those for?

373
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,628
The Wayne Charity Ball.

374
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:34,766
It's boring but good for
the gallery's business.

375
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,967
Well, I'll probably see you there.

376
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:38,937
- (knocking on door)
- What?

377
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,638
I'm going with Bruce Wayne.

378
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:43,775
Wait, what?

379
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,377
- MAN: Delivery for Selina Kyle.
- SELINA: Oh.

380
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:48,046
Uh, over there.

381
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:53,118
MAN: Thank you. Enjoy.

382
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:55,220
(man speaks indistinctly)

383
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:57,489
(door shuts)

384
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,557
(sighs)

385
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:02,060
Am I really supposed to wear these?

386
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:03,395
Okay...

387
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:06,831
we have a lot of work to do.

388
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:13,004
Got it.

389
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:15,040
That was the doctor. Harkness
sent over the warrant.

390
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:16,508
The dead girl came to the clinic

391
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:19,344
by way of a Miss Constance van Groot.

392
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:22,546
Van Groot... that's one of
Gotham's oldest families. Shipping.

393
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,683
Yeah. We thought the Ogre might be rich.

394
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:27,452
- Could be the old lady had a son.
- You got an address?

395
00:20:27,486 --> 00:20:28,453
Right here.

396
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,095
Well, Butch, Connor and
his crew are on board.

397
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:38,763
They hate Maroni even more than I...

398
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:41,666
Shut up. Maroni and his crew are here.

399
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,601
I couldn't turn 'em away.

400
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:45,503
- No, of course. No matter.
- No.

401
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:46,705
She was already here.

402
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:48,606
MARONI: Is that my buddy Oswald?

403
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:49,741
- (gasps)
- Come here.

404
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,242
Oh, Oswald.

405
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:57,749
(Maroni chuckles)

406
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,585
There he is.

407
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:03,088
Mother, what are you doing?

408
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:05,924
I'm having a drink with Mr. Mar...

409
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:06,925
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

410
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:09,094
I told you... Sal.

411
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:11,363
With Sal.

412
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:13,465
But we shouldn't impose

413
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:14,866
- any longer...
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

414
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,136
No, you're not taking my Gertrud.

415
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,205
Oh, his Gertrud.

416
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,439
(Gertrud chuckles)

417
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:23,441
- Sit. Join us.
- (gasps)

418
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:25,777
GERTRUD: Oswald, sit.

419
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:28,213
Sit, Oswald.

420
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,248
(knocking on door)

421
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:34,919
Hello.

422
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:36,721
I'm Bruce Wayne.

423
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,623
- Barbara Kean.
- Oh.

424
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:40,558
Selina never said you're
who she's staying with.

425
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:42,661
Detective Gordon spoke of you.

426
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:46,097
Well, Selina can be a little guarded.

427
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:47,832
(chuckles) Yes, I know.

428
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:49,968
Stop talking about me.

429
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:57,575
Selina.

430
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:00,845
You look very nice.

431
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,580
The shoes hurt.

432
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:05,183
Have fun.

433
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:07,452
BARBARA: Look for me at the ball.

434
00:22:07,486 --> 00:22:09,854
It was nice meeting you.

435
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,993
Think she's here?

436
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:21,800
(echoing): Miss Van Groot!

437
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:24,035
GCPD!

438
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,838
I need to say this is not exactly legal.

439
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:29,374
We're running out of time.

440
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:31,676
(clanking, man gasping)

441
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:34,045
(gagging)

442
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
GORDON: Over here.

443
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,324
(man grunts, gasps)

444
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,226
Oh!

445
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,828
He's good.

446
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:52,664
Call it in. I'm gonna go
check the rest of the house.

447
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:04,309
(weakly): He told me...

448
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:06,711
but I was too slow.

449
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:08,914
(doors creaking)

450
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,516
Hello?

451
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:18,223
Miss van Groot?

452
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:22,694
I'm a police officer.

453
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:26,765
Miss van Groot?

454
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,250
Ugh...!

455
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:47,285
(distant): Gordon!

456
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:50,455
Now!

457
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:55,727
Jim Gordon,

458
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,762
Constance van Groot.

459
00:24:14,863 --> 00:24:16,864
(classical music playing,
indistinct conversations)

460
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:26,674
(indistinct chatter, light laughter)

461
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:29,601
Everyone's staring at us.

462
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,671
Well, I am Bruce Wayne.

463
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,108
Well, I am.

464
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,276
Anyway, I don't see Bunderslaw anywhere.

465
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,113
He's probably not coming.

466
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,715
But he's on the guest list.

467
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,183
Just keep dancing.

468
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:48,186
And smile, maybe?

469
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,824
Name's Jacob Skolimski.

470
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,559
He's not talking, but near as we can tell

471
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:56,061
he was the old lady's butler.

472
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,329
And you're thinking the
Ogre's this guy's son,

473
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,830
not the dead woman's?

474
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,533
Yeah, yeah. Coroner said the
old bird's been dead for years.

475
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:04,202
My guess, Ogre killed her,
daddy pretends she's still alive,

476
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:07,606
so crazy serial killer son
can keep living off her money.

477
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,309
He tried to kill himself.
He knew you were closing in.

478
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,744
- He has to be in contact with his son.
- BULLOCK: Yeah.

479
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:15,047
Listen, Gordon's running
pretty hot on this one, Cap.

480
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,248
Can you blame him?

481
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,783
Thinks Thompkins is the next victim.

482
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:20,152
Still, watch him.

483
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,787
Alvarez called.

484
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,889
Nothing on the son in the system.

485
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,924
We have to make him talk.

486
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:28,894
Make this simple.

487
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,729
Give us your son's name and address.

488
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,431
JACOB: Or what?

489
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:34,733
I'm not afraid of you.

490
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,737
Only because you don't know me.

491
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:41,840
Listen, I get wanting to protect your son,

492
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,042
but how many more women
is he gonna have to kill

493
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,944
before you realize he
needs to be locked up?

494
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,913
What are you talking about?

495
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,781
Don't play dumb with me. You were hiding

496
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,517
a rotting corpse upstairs for years,

497
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,152
but no, no, my son's an angel,

498
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:55,687
he didn't murder close to

499
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,490
- a dozen women that we know of.
- My son...

500
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,325
He made one mistake.

501
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,593
One.

502
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,996
Anything else is lies.

503
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,000
So tell us the truth.

504
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:14,940
Hear, hear. Cheers.

505
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,808
Selina, what happened last night...

506
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,510
That can never happen again.

507
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,178
I told you I didn't have a choice.

508
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:21,313
I don't accept that.

509
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,015
(scoffs)

510
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:25,617
I knew you wouldn't be able to handle it.

511
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:28,867
You're right. I did want to kill him.

512
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,255
Keep your voice down.

513
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,525
But there's a line, Selina.

514
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,827
And you can say I don't
have guts, but the fact is

515
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:38,230
I will never cross it.

516
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,565
I guess that's where we're different, then.

517
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,501
'Cause if I had to do it again, I would.

518
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:47,506
And it wouldn't bother me one bit.

519
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,647
That's Bunderslaw.

520
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,892
- (chuckles)
- (clears throat)

521
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:09,995
Riddle Man.

522
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,597
Officer Dougherty, a word.

523
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:22,274
I can start a war or end one.

524
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,276
I can give you the strength of heroes

525
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,510
or leave you powerless.

526
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:26,845
I might be snared with a glance,

527
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,381
but no force can compel me to stay.

528
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,784
What am I?

529
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,753
Got me.

530
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,355
Love.

531
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,590
Miss Kringle has given hers to you.

532
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,126
And in return, you hurt her.

533
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,863
- I saw the bruises.
- And?

534
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:46,865
And you cannot do that.

535
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,700
The next time you do that, I'll...

536
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:50,936
Whoa! Calm down.

537
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,371
You'll give yourself a girly fit.

538
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,806
Have you ever been with a woman?

539
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,809
(clicks tongue) Didn't think so.

540
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:02,748
They need a firm hand.

541
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,816
That goes double for Kringle.

542
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:07,085
Girl's got a tongue.

543
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,121
I won't let you hurt her.

544
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,691
(laughs) Oh, yeah?

545
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,397
What are you gonna do?

546
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:23,469
(clicks tongue)

547
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:25,504
That's what I thought.

548
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,908
Later, Riddle Man.

549
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,386
Care to dance?

550
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,193
- You.
- Me.

551
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,096
It was not a place for a boy to grow up.

552
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,699
Miss van Groot kept herself sealed off

553
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,701
from the world, but she doted

554
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,736
on my son.

555
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,039
Treated him as her own. Still, I...

556
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,008
I didn't realize how deep it went.

557
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:05,010
This kid's own mom was out
of the picture, so it seems

558
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:08,113
he started thinking he was this
van Groot woman's secret son.

559
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:09,681
<i>SKOLIMSKI: I tried to tell him</i>

560
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:13,552
it wasn't true, but he had
built this fantasy, and...

561
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,320
Miss van Groot led him on.

562
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:18,090
She was deranged. Cruel, even.

563
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,391
<i>BULLOCK: So, about ten years ago,</i>

564
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,528
he confronts her, he demands
that she acknowledge him,

565
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:25,164
give him her last name,
put him in the will.

566
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:26,632
She laughs at him,

567
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:28,534
said it was all just a big joke.

568
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,035
So he kills her.

569
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,571
His dad feels guilty,
helps him cover it up.

570
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,339
So the old woman rejects him,

571
00:29:34,374 --> 00:29:36,408
he kills her... bang,
you got a serial killer

572
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,210
with a "Mommy didn't love me" complex.

573
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:39,912
But there's a wrinkle.

574
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,414
I don't know where my son is.

575
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:45,317
He called me today, told me
the police would be coming.

576
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:47,019
But I haven't seen him

577
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:49,488
since the day he killed Miss van Groot.

578
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:54,193
My son is not a bad man.

579
00:29:55,562 --> 00:29:58,630
Your son has been
seducing and killing women

580
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:00,065
for almost a decade.

581
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,434
(wheezing laughter)

582
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,839
Why is he laughing?

583
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:10,042
My son... seducing women?

584
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:13,912
Oh, let me show you my son... two pictures.

585
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:15,581
It's all I managed to save.

586
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:18,684
You've heard "a face
only a mother could love"?

587
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:21,620
Well... his mother couldn't.

588
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,690
She left us after he was born.

589
00:30:24,724 --> 00:30:27,059
(chuckling): Oh, yes... my son,

590
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,128
the seducer.

591
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:36,902
Now you can see why it makes sense

592
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,370
he scratched his face
out of those pictures.

593
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,606
But that means this can't be the Ogre.

594
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,776
- We're chasing the wrong guy.
- Jim had an idea.

595
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,145
Judge Harkness's warrant was very specific.

596
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,546
I don't have to say anything.

597
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,614
Then nod.

598
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:50,315
Did you operate on this man?

599
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,452
I need to know what he looks like now.

600
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:56,288
Or the next woman he
kills will be on your head.

601
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:18,606
Never, never,

602
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,391
would he play with the other children.

603
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:23,342
You know, even then,

604
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,013
he was too good for them.

605
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:28,477
And now, he is a respectable

606
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:30,473
man of business...

607
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:32,698
My Oswald.

608
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,266
Well...

609
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,734
this has been a delight.

610
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,503
But it's late.

611
00:31:37,537 --> 00:31:39,471
One thing...

612
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:42,174
- Gertrud, my love.
- Aw...

613
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,343
A question that's been bothering me.

614
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:47,012
Oh, no. Oh... no, no.

615
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:48,580
Is this an act?

616
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:52,184
(both laughing)

617
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:53,585
Are you pretending

618
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,821
that he's just a nightclub owner?

619
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:58,323
Or are you really that stupid?

620
00:31:58,358 --> 00:32:01,193
- Stop!
- I don't understand. I...

621
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:04,062
- Your son...
- Don Maroni, I am warning you!

622
00:32:04,097 --> 00:32:06,098
Is a cold-blooded psychopath.

623
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,099
No, no, no, no, no...

624
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,201
I can't count how many men he's killed.

625
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:11,537
My own friend, Frankie Carbone,

626
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:12,938
he stabbed him a dozen times.

627
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,808
What kind of person plunges a knife

628
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,943
into someone over and over?

629
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,912
He is a filthy liar, Mother!

630
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:22,681
He's just angry because
I played him for a fool!

631
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:23,849
(gasping): Oh! Oswald...

632
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:27,786
You know, don't you? Oh, I can see it.

633
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,787
(whimpering) Let go of her!

634
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,089
Did you catch him, one night,

635
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:31,723
washing the blood from his hands?

636
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:34,393
When did you realize that you had

637
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:36,061
given birth to a monster?

638
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,396
(shouts, sobs)

639
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:45,204
You are going to pay for this!

640
00:32:45,238 --> 00:32:46,738
Maybe.

641
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:49,408
Or maybe this ends with me

642
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:51,376
dumping your lifeless body into the river.

643
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,379
Either way, you and Momma
Gertrud can stop pretending.

644
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:00,919
Place is looking good.

645
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:04,490
(door opens)

646
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,958
- Shh, shh...
- (sobbing)

647
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:07,659
(door closes)

648
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,411
The other night, when
you saw my invitation,

649
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:13,213
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

650
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:14,214
I wasn't.

651
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:16,416
I didn't get invited.

652
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,118
Oh, so you're crashing.

653
00:33:19,153 --> 00:33:21,955
Oh, no, I'm... on the list.

654
00:33:21,989 --> 00:33:24,824
It's amazing what a
$10,000 donation will do.

655
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:27,927
You donated $10,000 to this?

656
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:29,429
Why?

657
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:31,931
I was hoping that would be apparent.

658
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:38,104
And what if I decided not to come?

659
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:39,439
Well, then, I'd have been making

660
00:33:39,473 --> 00:33:42,108
a generous donation to charity,

661
00:33:42,142 --> 00:33:46,746
and I would've been very... disappointed.

662
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:14,807
The way things ended last night,

663
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:17,544
it was my fault.

664
00:34:17,578 --> 00:34:19,879
But I felt something.

665
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:21,648
I couldn't let it slip away.

666
00:34:21,682 --> 00:34:23,683
Well, that's very sweet, but...

667
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:27,053
You said that when people see the real you,

668
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:28,555
they run screaming.

669
00:34:30,224 --> 00:34:32,659
Someone said the same thing to me once,

670
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:35,461
that no one would ever love me.

671
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:37,330
Who?

672
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:39,632
The woman I thought was my mother.

673
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,801
Barbara...

674
00:34:41,836 --> 00:34:44,270
I know what it's like...

675
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:46,039
to be one person on the inside,

676
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:49,042
and have the world see another.

677
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:50,543
I lived like that.

678
00:34:50,578 --> 00:34:54,314
And it almost destroyed me.
I can see it destroying you.

679
00:34:57,184 --> 00:34:59,486
I don't want to dance anymore.

680
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,522
The person that I am now, I created.

681
00:35:02,556 --> 00:35:06,025
I brought him into being.

682
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,695
I can do the same for you.

683
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:13,032
Aren't you tired of playing games?

684
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:16,603
Of hiding?

685
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:23,076
Yes.

686
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:30,683
- (laughing) Good-bye.
- See you soon.

687
00:35:32,953 --> 00:35:34,954
Hello. I'm Bruce Wayne.

688
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:35,955
Sid Bunderslaw.

689
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,557
(quiet click)

690
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:39,726
BRUCE: I'm going around,
trying to get to know everybody

691
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,894
who works for the company.

692
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,729
You do work for Wayne
Enterprises, don't you?

693
00:35:42,763 --> 00:35:43,730
I do.

694
00:35:43,764 --> 00:35:46,032
I'm the Director of Physical Operations.

695
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:48,034
Which, I'm afraid, is a bit dull.

696
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:50,904
There are many much more
interesting people here.

697
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:54,107
Ah, yes, well, I'm sure I'll
get to meet everyone, eventually.

698
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:56,142
If you'll forgive me, Bruce,

699
00:35:56,177 --> 00:35:57,444
I have an early flight tomorrow.

700
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:58,912
It's been a pleasure.

701
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,314
It was, um...

702
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:03,450
it was nice meeting you.

703
00:36:08,155 --> 00:36:09,155
SELINA: Sorry.

704
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:12,292
(Bruce sighs)

705
00:36:15,162 --> 00:36:18,031
See? Nothin' to it.

706
00:36:24,004 --> 00:36:26,239
What is it?

707
00:36:30,344 --> 00:36:32,078
Nothing.

708
00:36:32,113 --> 00:36:34,114
(siren wails in distance)

709
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:43,957
Stop right there, buster!

710
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:45,625
(car door opens)

711
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,794
Riddle Man?

712
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:50,797
What the hell are you
doing, creeping around here?

713
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:53,266
You need to leave Miss Kringle alone.

714
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,267
What?!

715
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:57,537
I'm not gonna let you hurt her.

716
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:59,839
Ever again.

717
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:01,741
I think you need to leave Gotham...

718
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:03,510
tonight.

719
00:37:03,544 --> 00:37:05,545
(chuckling)

720
00:37:06,547 --> 00:37:08,948
I get it now.

721
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:11,268
You got a thing for my girl.

722
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,487
That's too funny.

723
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:18,992
Don't take this personal.

724
00:37:19,026 --> 00:37:21,895
(yells in pain)

725
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:23,963
Aw... (scoffing laugh)

726
00:37:23,998 --> 00:37:25,632
You want some more?

727
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:28,902
Upsi-daisy... oh!

728
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:32,739
Oh, dear.

729
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,342
(gasps)

730
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:47,087
(grunting)

731
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:51,257
(train clacking)

732
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,926
Riddle Man...

733
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,762
Oh, dear.

734
00:37:56,764 --> 00:37:58,431
Oh, dear.

735
00:37:58,466 --> 00:37:59,599
Oh, no.

736
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:02,569
(gasping, laughing)

737
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,508
Oh, dear.

738
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:10,543
(laughing)

739
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:13,847
(gasps)

740
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:15,014
Oh, dear.

741
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:18,351
Oh, dear...

742
00:38:30,787 --> 00:38:33,622
- Oswald.
- Feeling better?

743
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:36,058
I made tea. (laughs)

744
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:37,559
I'm afraid you had...

745
00:38:37,593 --> 00:38:39,361
well... (laughs)

746
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:40,762
a little too much to drink.

747
00:38:40,797 --> 00:38:42,731
Mr. Maroni, he...

748
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:45,067
he has a strange sense of humor...

749
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:46,935
Oswald...

750
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:49,771
I am not some bumpkin from the country,

751
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:51,473
with hay in my brains!

752
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:52,841
No...

753
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,876
I am your mother...

754
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:58,413
and I will love you, no matter what.

755
00:38:58,448 --> 00:39:02,951
But lie to me now...

756
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:05,654
you will break my heart.

757
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,058
Oswald...

758
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:14,563
have you done things...

759
00:39:14,597 --> 00:39:16,331
you should not?

760
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:18,900
I...

761
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:23,138
Mother...

762
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:24,806
I'm a nightclub owner.

763
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:27,976
That's all.

764
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:29,278
(shuddering breaths)

765
00:39:29,312 --> 00:39:31,013
(sighs)

766
00:39:33,716 --> 00:39:35,651
(shuddering breaths)

767
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:40,255
I'm tired now.

768
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,825
I'm tired.

769
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:50,632
(crying quietly)

770
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,302
(sobs)

771
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:59,074
(knocking on door)

772
00:40:01,444 --> 00:40:04,246
(Oswald sniffles, knocking continues)

773
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:10,452
Yeah, I got a delivery
for Gertrud, from Sal.

774
00:40:10,486 --> 00:40:11,687
Tip's not included.

775
00:40:12,922 --> 00:40:15,290
You tell Sal it's over.

776
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:16,792
The guns are bought.

777
00:40:16,826 --> 00:40:19,227
The killing room is waiting.

778
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:22,331
He doesn't know it, but he's a dead man.

779
00:40:30,506 --> 00:40:32,007
On second thought...

780
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:33,542
I'll tell him myself.

781
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:35,911
(delivery man groans)

782
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,050
(gasping)

783
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:44,453
GERTRUD: O-Oswald?

784
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:45,887
Who was that?

785
00:40:45,922 --> 00:40:48,957
It's Mr. Yatsko, from next door.

786
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:51,260
He needs help taking out some trash.

787
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:54,196
You, you... please, you help him, then.

788
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:01,670
(broken glass clinking)

789
00:41:03,306 --> 00:41:04,506
Jason van Groot?

790
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,508
His real name is Jason Skolimski.

791
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:09,077
He used the old woman's name
when he went to the clinic.

792
00:41:09,112 --> 00:41:10,879
But there's no Jason van
Groot or Skolimski in Gotham.

793
00:41:10,914 --> 00:41:13,148
- The guy's a ghost.
- So, the old woman

794
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,083
rejects him, he goes to the doctor,

795
00:41:15,118 --> 00:41:16,451
gets himself a pretty new face.

796
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:18,287
That's where he runs into the nurse.

797
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:20,022
And we're off to the races.

798
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:21,423
I don't suppose you got a picture.

799
00:41:21,457 --> 00:41:23,358
Missing from the file. No surprise there.

800
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:25,794
But the good doctor was kind enough

801
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:26,995
to do a sketch.

802
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,064
It's been ten years since he last saw him,

803
00:41:29,098 --> 00:41:30,065
but at least it's a start.

804
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:32,935
So we have his real name,
but not what alias he's using,

805
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:35,370
or what he looks like
beyond a decade-old sketch.

806
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:38,607
Did he say anything
else on the phone today?

807
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:40,642
Anything we might've missed?

808
00:41:40,677 --> 00:41:42,811
GORDON: Nah, just warned me to back off.

809
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:44,646
Told me not to believe my own press

810
00:41:44,681 --> 00:41:47,015
as the rising star of the GCPD.

811
00:41:50,653 --> 00:41:52,654
What is it?

812
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:55,257
The paper that said that...

813
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,559
They ran an old photo of
me, from a charity gala.

814
00:41:59,262 --> 00:42:00,429
I wasn't alone.

815
00:42:08,471 --> 00:42:10,739
(pounding on door)

816
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:13,308
GORDON (muffled): Barbara!

817
00:42:13,343 --> 00:42:15,978
- Is Barbara here?
- No. Why?

818
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:17,312
Where is she?

819
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:19,248
- When's the last time you saw her?
- At the Wayne Ball.

820
00:42:19,282 --> 00:42:20,516
She left with some guy.

821
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:24,987
- Was this the guy?
- It's kind of a crappy drawing.

822
00:42:25,021 --> 00:42:26,488
(firmly): Was this the guy?

823
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,993
Yeah, I think so.

824
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:34,029
Why? Who is he?

825
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,941
What's through there?

826
00:42:46,976 --> 00:42:48,277
See for yourself.

827
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:26,177
