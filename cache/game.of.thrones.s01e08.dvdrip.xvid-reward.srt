1
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,400
(Wooden swords clacking)

2
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,920
Yah! Left high, left low.

3
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,280
(Swords clanging, men shouting)

4
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,840
Right low, lunge right.

5
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,480
You break anything,
the septa will have my head.

6
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,880
- What is...
- (Screaming)

7
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,480
Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

8
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,560
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.

9
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,120
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

10
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,840
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

11
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,080
- Hush!
- (Swords clanging, men yelling)

12
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,600
Go back to your room.

13
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,000
Bar the doors and do not open them
for anyone you do not know.

14
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,920
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as l told you.

15
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,960
Run!

16
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
- (Man) This way!
- (Door banging)

17
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,920
(Screaming)

18
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,280
Left, right. Rah!

19
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,480
- Now you are dead.
- You said right,

20
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,200
but you went left.

21
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,800
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.

22
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,880
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
- You were not seeing.
- l was so. l watched, but you...

24
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,200
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

25
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,720
The seeing, the true seeing,

26
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,120
that is the heart of swordplay.

27
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,160
(Door opens)

28
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,160
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

29
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,200
And why is it that Lord Eddard
is sending Lannister men

30
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,840
in place of his own?

31
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,320
- l am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.

32
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,440
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

33
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,520
And l don't have to go
with you if l don't want.

34
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,800
(Laughs) Take her.

35
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,640
Are you men or snakes,
that you would threaten a child?

36
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,840
Get out of my way, little man.

37
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,040
l am Syrio Forel...

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,960
Foreign bastard.

39
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
..and you will be speaking to me
with more respect.

40
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,560
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

41
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,760
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

42
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,240
Run to your father.

43
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,960
Bloody oafs.

44
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,960
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me. Run.

45
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,360
The first sword of Braavos does not run.

46
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,960
- (Wood clatters)
- What do we say

47
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,440
to the god of death?

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,200
Not today.

49
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,800
Go.

50
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,960
(Men moaning)

51
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,680
(Swords ringing)
(Men screaming)

52
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,960
Not today. Not today.

53
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,120
(Gasps)

54
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,640
Stay away from me.
l'll tell my father.

55
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,360
l'll... l'll tell the queen.

56
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,920
(Chuckles) Who do you think sent me?

57
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,960
(Horses neighing)

58
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,400
Needle.

59
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,760
There she is.

60
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,080
- What do you want?
- l want you, wolf girl.

61
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,720
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

62
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:44,360
- My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!

63
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,920
- Stay away!
- (Gasps)

64
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,200
(Door clanging, creaking)

65
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,640
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

66
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
Varys.

67
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,240
l promise you it isn't poisoned.

68
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,280
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

69
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Not so much, my lord.

70
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,000
l would save the rest, if l were you.

71
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,800
Hide it. Men have been known
to die of thirst in these cells.

72
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,680
What about my daughters?

73
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,080
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

74
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,680
Even my little birds cannot find her.

75
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,880
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

76
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,720
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...

77
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,520
all dead, it grieves me to say.
l do so hate the sight of blood.

78
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,840
You watched my men
being slaughtered and did nothing.

79
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,160
And would again, my lord.

80
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,280
l was unarmed, unarmoured
and surrounded by Lannister swords.

81
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,400
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

82
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,640
What madness led you to tell the queen

83
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,120
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

84
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,320
The madness of mercy.

85
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,480
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.

86
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,680
lt's always
the innocents who sumer.

87
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,720
lt wasn't the wine
that killed Robert, nor the boar.

88
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,040
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

89
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,400
but it was your mercy
that killed the king.

90
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,880
l trust you know you're
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

91
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,400
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.

92
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,840
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.

93
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:13,720
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

94
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,840
lf that's true,

95
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:23,840
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

96
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,880
Not today, my lord.

97
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,400
Tell me something, Varys.

98
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,120
Who do you truly serve?

99
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,840
The realm, my lord.

100
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
Someone must.

101
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,320
(Door creaks, clangs)

102
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,000
lt's Othor, without a doubt.

103
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,320
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord,
Iess the hand the wolf tore om.

104
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,720
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

105
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,640
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, l'd say.

106
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,280
- Mmm.
- The smell.

107
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,160
(Snims) What smell?

108
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,080
There is none.

109
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,720
lf they'd been dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

110
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,520
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.

111
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,800
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.

112
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,240
l want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

113
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
You may be a coward, Tarly,
but you're not stupid.

114
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,040
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

115
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,240
I
Lord Commander

116
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,920
Maester Aemon
awaits you in his chambers...

117
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,640
A raven from King's Landing.

118
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,160
Come on, move 'em out.

119
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,040
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

120
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,200
and pour one for yourself.

121
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,080
The king is dead.

122
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,120
ls there any word of my father?

123
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,160
Sit.

124
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,120
Lord Stark has been

125
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,880
charged with treason.

126
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,600
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

127
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,520
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

128
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,960
l hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

129
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,360
Your duty lies here now.

130
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,200
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

131
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,520
l'm sure they'll be

132
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,240
treated gently.

133
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,960
(Varys) Your father has proved to be
an amul traitor, dear.

134
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,840
King Robert's body was still warm

135
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,880
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

136
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,360
He wouldn't do that.

137
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,040
He knows how much
l love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

138
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,960
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

139
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,480
Send for my father. He'll tell you -
the king was his friend.

140
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,320
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent
of any wrong. We know that.

141
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,800
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.

142
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,080
How can l allow you to marry my son?

143
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,960
(Pycelle) A child born of a traitor's seed

144
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,280
is no fit consort for our king.

145
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,760
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

146
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,120
but in 10 years who knows
what treasons she may hatch?

147
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,120
No, l'm not. l'll be
a good wife to him, you'll see.

148
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,440
l'll be a queen just like you, l promise.
l won't hatch anything.

149
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,000
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

150
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,960
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

151
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,520
(Sighs)

152
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn
and your brother, the eldest,

153
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,800
- what's his name?
- Robb.

154
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,920
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

155
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father,

156
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,200
urge your brother
to keep the king's peace.

157
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,240
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

158
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,120
lf... If l could see my father,
talk to him about...

159
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,960
You disappoint me, child.

160
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,320
We have told you
of your father's treason.

161
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,560
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

162
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,440
l only meant that...

163
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,600
What will happen to him?

164
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,440
- That depends.
- On...

165
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,000
- On what?
- On your brother.

166
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,800
And on you.

167
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,520
Treason?

168
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,000
Sansa wrote this?

169
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,400
lt is your sister's hand,
but the queen's words.

170
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,320
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

171
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,400
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his arse kissed?

172
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,240
This is a royal command, my lord.

173
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,880
- If you should refuse to obey...
- l won't refuse.

174
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,800
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
l'll go to King's Landing.

175
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,680
But not alone.

176
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,400
Call the banners.

177
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
All of them, my lord?

178
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,640
They've all sworn to defend my father,
have they not?

179
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,520
They have.

180
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,680
Now we see
what their words are worth.

181
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,800
Yes.

182
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Are you afraid?

183
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,680
l must be.

184
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,160
Good.

185
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,680
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.

186
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,440
(Cawing)

187
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,920
You've had this since dawn?

188
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,280
He sent it to me, not you.

189
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,440
- l've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?!

190
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,560
My husband has been taken prisoner.

191
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,920
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?

192
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,280
Your son against the Lannisters?

193
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,640
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

194
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,760
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

195
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,280
He is your brother by law!

196
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,240
Does family mean nothing to you?

197
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,000
Family means everything to me.

198
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,800
And l will not risk Robin's life

199
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,480
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

200
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,640
- l'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

201
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,520
You just ate.

202
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
You will not support us, then?
Do l understand you correctly?

203
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,960
- But l'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

204
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
You're always welcome here, sister.

205
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,080
But if you're asking me
to send men from the Vale to fight...

206
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
That is what l ask.

207
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,040
Go on, sweet.

208
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,080
Time for your bath.

209
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,520
l'll feed you after.

210
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,840
lf you fear for the safety of your son...

211
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,800
Of course l fear
for the safety of my son!

212
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,760
Are you an idiot?

213
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,160
They killed my husband.

214
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,560
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

215
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,000
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.

216
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,320
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

217
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,960
where they belong,

218
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,160
to protect their lord.

219
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,000
(Tyrion whistling a tune)

220
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,120
Will you shut up?

221
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,960
There's hill tribes all around here.

222
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,720
lf l'm going to die, it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

223
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,040
l should just take your food
and leave you here.

224
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,680
Eh?

225
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,600
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.

226
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,200
You don't think l'd do it, do you?

227
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,600
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

228
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,600
Golden women?

229
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,840
Stick with me and you'll have them all,

230
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,880
for as long as l'm around
and not a moment longer.

231
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,720
But you knew that.

232
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,640
That is why you so valiantly
took up arms to defend my honour.

233
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,760
Fair enough.

234
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,640
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

235
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,800
and ''my lord'' you
every time you take a shit.

236
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,280
l'm not your toady
and l'm not your friend.

237
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,520
Though l would treasure
your friendship,

238
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,680
l'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

239
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,320
And if the day ever comes
when you're tempted to sell me out,

240
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
remember this -

241
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,640
whatever their price,

242
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,240
l'll beat it.

243
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,360
l like living.

244
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,200
(Whistles)

245
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
- (Rustling)
- (Bronn whispers) Tyrion.

246
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,160
Tyrion.

247
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,840
Tyrion.

248
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,600
(Birds chirp, flutter)

249
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,680
Come, share our fire.

250
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,880
Help yourselves to our goat.

251
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,080
When you meet your gods,
you tell them

252
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,560
Shagga, son of Dolf,
of the Stone Crows sent you.

253
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,720
l am Tyrion, son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

254
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,760
How would you like to die,
Tyrion, son of Tywin?

255
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,440
ln my own bed,
at the age of 8O

256
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,000
with a belly full of wine
and a girl's mouth around my cock.

257
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,040
(Laughing)

258
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,440
(All laughing)

259
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,400
Take the halfman.

260
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,360
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

261
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,520
No, no, no, no, no!

262
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,480
My... My house is rich and powerful.

263
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,480
lf you see us through these mountains,
my father will shower you with gold.

264
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,920
We have no use
for a halfman's promises.

265
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,200
Halfman maybe, but at least l have
the courage to face my enemies.

266
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,000
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver

267
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,480
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

268
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

269
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:54,240
Good enough for killing sheep,
if the sheep don't fight back.

270
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,360
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

271
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,040
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

272
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,680
That trinket is worth more
than everything your tribe owns.

273
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,080
But if you help us,
Shagga, son of Dolf,

274
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,280
l will not give you trinkets.

275
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,840
l will give you this.

276
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,160
What is ''this''?

277
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,720
The Vale of Arryn.

278
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,920
The lords of the Vale
have always spat upon the hill tribes.

279
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,040
The lords of the Vale want me dead.

280
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,600
l believe it is time
for new lords of the Vale.

281
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,480
(Crow cawing)

282
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,040
(Ser Alliser) Now there's a rare sight...

283
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,960
Not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

284
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,480
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

285
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,800
Blood will always tell.

286
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,760
You'll hang for this, bastard.

287
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,480
l told you not to do anything stupid.

288
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,800
You're confined to quarters. Go.

289
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,840
(Barking, whining)

290
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,400
Ghost, what's wrong?

291
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,240
ls someone out there?

292
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,680
(Whining and growling)

293
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,680
(Snarling)

294
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,080
(Growling)

295
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,280
Commander?

296
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,840
(Barks, whines)

297
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,880
Stay.

298
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
Hello?

299
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,760
- Who's there?
- (Whines)

300
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,000
- Lord Commander?
- (Door slams)

301
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,840
(Barking)

302
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,200
(Growling)

303
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,080
(Mormont) Snow?

304
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,120
Commander!

305
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,400
(Yelps)

306
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,000
(Screaming)

307
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,440
Move!

308
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,480
(Men yelling, women screaming)

309
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,000
(Grunts)

310
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,040
(Screaming and yelling continue)

311
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,520
What did they do?

312
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,760
Lamb men make good slaves.

313
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,360
Khal Drogo will make a gift
of them to the slavers,

314
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,400
and the slavers will give us gold...

315
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,680
...and silk, and steel.

316
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,560
(Daenerys) l thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

317
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,600
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

318
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,360
ships to sail to Westeros.

319
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,440
(Women screaming)

320
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,080
Jorah, make them stop.

321
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,120
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

322
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,640
These men have shed blood for their khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

323
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,920
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.

324
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,040
The riders do her honour.

325
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,280
lf her wailing omends the Khaleesi,

326
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,360
l will bring you her tongue.

327
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,040
Princess, you have a gentle heart,
but this is how it's always been.

328
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,920
l do not have a gentle heart, ser.

329
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,720
Do as l command
or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.

330
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,920
(Rakharo speaks Dothraki)

331
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,360
- Come.
- (Man speaks Dothraki)

332
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,000
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.

333
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,400
And those women there.

334
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,640
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

335
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,880
l can,

336
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,720
and l will.

337
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,320
(Man speaks Dothraki)

338
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,960
(Dothraki continues)

339
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,720
(Drogo speaks Dothraki)

340
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,840
Moon of my life,

341
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,800
Mago says you haven taken his spoils,

342
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,240
a daughter of a lamb man
who was his to mount.

343
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,040
Tell me the truth of this.

344
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,640
Mago speaks the truth,
my sun and stars.

345
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,600
l have claimed many daughters this day...

346
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,160
...so they cannot be mounted.

347
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,520
This is the way of war.

348
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,480
These women are slaves now...

349
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,680
...to do with as we please.

350
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,960
lt pleases me to keep them safe.

351
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,920
lf your riders would mount them,
Iet them take them for wives.

352
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,960
Does the horse mate with the lamb?

353
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,800
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.

354
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,200
You are a foreigner.

355
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,280
You do not command me.

356
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,120
l am Khaleesi. l do command you.

357
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,360
(Drogo snickers)

358
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,280
See how fierce she grows?

359
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,520
That is my son inside her,
the stallion that will mount the world,

360
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,920
filling her with his fire.

361
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,920
l will hear no more.

362
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,440
Mago, find somewhere else
to stick your cock.

363
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,800
A Khal who takes orders
from a foreign whore is no Khal.

364
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,480
(Speaks Dothraki)

365
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,560
(Speaks Dothraki)

366
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:02,120
l will not have your body burned.

367
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,880
l will not give you that honour.

368
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,280
The beetles will feed on your eyes.

369
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,400
The worms will crawl through your lungs.

370
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,000
The rain will fall on your rotting skin...

371
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,440
...until nothing is left of you but bones.

372
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,720
First you have to kill me.

373
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:36,800
l already have.

374
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,520
My sun and stars is wounded.

375
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,520
A scratch...

376
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,160
...moon of my life.

377
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,920
Where are the healers?

378
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,880
This is the bite of a fly.

379
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,280
l can help the great rider with his cut.

380
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,120
The Khal needs no help
from slaves who lie with sheep.

381
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,600
She is mine. Let her speak.

382
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,640
(Speaks English) Thank you, silver lady.

383
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,240
(Speaks English) Who are you?

384
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,320
l am named Mirri Maz Duur.
l was the godswife of this temple.

385
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,600
Witch.

386
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,920
My mother was
godswife here before me.

387
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,720
She taught me how
to make healing smokes and ointments.

388
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,560
All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.

389
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,600
The great shepherd sent me
to earth to heal his...

390
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,760
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.

391
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,160
Lamb or lion,

392
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:49,160
his wound must be washed
and sewn or it will fester.

393
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,120
Let her clean your wound,
my sun and stars...

394
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,520
...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.

395
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,560
(Men chatting)

396
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:22,160
For 30 years l've been making
corpses out of men, boy.

397
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,720
l'm the man you want
Ieading the vanguard.

398
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,200
Galbart Glover will lead the van.

399
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,800
The bloody wall will melt

400
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,000
before an Umber
marches behind a Glover.

401
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,720
l will lead the van
or l will take my men

402
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,920
and march them home.

403
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,240
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

404
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:51,200
And when l am done
with the Lannisters,

405
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:54,960
l will march back north,
root you out of your keep

406
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,600
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

407
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,960
Oathbreaker, is it?!

408
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:06,320
l'll not sit here and swallow insults
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

409
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,600
(Snarls)

410
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,200
(Screaming)

411
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,160
(Snap)
(Screams)

412
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,840
My lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

413
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,840
against your liege lord.

414
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,800
But doubtless the Greatjon
only meant to cut my meat for me.

415
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,160
Your meat...

416
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,680
is bloody tough.

417
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,080
(Jon Umber chortles)

418
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,040
(All laughing)

419
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,480
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

420
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,640
- Where are you going?
- South. For Father.

421
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,480
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

422
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,000
l don't want them to know
we're coming.

423
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:30,680
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.

424
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,720
Can't l come with you?
l can ride now.

425
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,840
You've seen me riding.
And l won't get in the way, l...

426
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,400
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

427
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:42,600
Until l return that will be you.

428
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,160
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

429
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,000
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

430
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,040
- l will.
- l'll send letters whenever l can,

431
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,960
but if you don't hear from me,
don't be scared.

432
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,000
Until l return.

433
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,720
How long have you been
hiding out there?

434
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,760
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

435
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,560
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.

436
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,880
Robb will free Father
and they'll come back with Mother.

437
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,880
No, they won't.

438
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,560
(Bran) Please watch over Robb.

439
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,640
And watch over
all the other men from Winterfell.

440
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,800
And Theon too, l suppose.

441
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,520
You hear them, boy?

442
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,000
The old gods are answering you.

443
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,280
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.

444
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,560
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only gods.

445
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,880
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.

446
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,920
Well, your friend
did put a knife to my throat.

447
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,240
l'm not complaining, little lord,

448
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,280
just telling truths.

449
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,640
What did you mean
about hearing the gods?

450
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,880
You asked them,
they're answering you.

451
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,240
Shh.

452
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,560
- Open your ears.
- (Leaves rustling)

453
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,760
lt's only the wind.

454
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,400
Who do you think
sends the wind if not the gods?

455
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,240
They see you, boy.

456
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,680
They hear you. (Sighs)

457
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,880
Your brother will get
no help from them where he's going.

458
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,480
The old gods have
no power in the South.

459
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,160
The weiM/oods there were all
cut down a long time ago.

460
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,720
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

461
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,000
(Running footsteps)

462
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,360
(Osha giggles)
Well, there's a big man.

463
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
He has giants' blood
in him or l'm the queen.

464
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,560
- Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
- (Laughs)

465
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,960
- Go dress.
- Hodor.

466
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,040
Are there really giants beyond the wall?

467
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,400
Giants and worse than giants.

468
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,000
l tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

469
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:49,320
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

470
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,360
North, not south!

471
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,800
- The cold winds are rising.
- (Leaves rustling)

472
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,400
They were touched by white walkers.

473
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:17,680
That's why they came back.

474
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,000
That's why their eyes turned blue.

475
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,040
Only fire will stop them.

476
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,400
- How do you know that?
- l read about it in a book...

477
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:31,360
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

478
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,640
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers

479
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,960
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

480
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,840
And when they wake up...

481
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,440
And when they wake up, what?

482
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,640
l hope the Wall's high enough.

483
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,640
(Men chattering in camp)

484
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,400
Summer snows, my lady.

485
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:29,040
Robb's brought the North with him.

486
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,600
The river lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

487
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,000
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a second Lannister army from the South.

488
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:44,560
Our scouts confirm
it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.

489
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:47,720
One army or two,
the kings in the North

490
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,360
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

491
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,320
Mother!

492
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,080
You look well.

493
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,040
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight
in these troubled times.

494
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,960
We had thought not
to meet you here, my lady.

495
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,280
l had not thought to be here.

496
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,640
l would speak with my son alone.

497
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,920
l know you will forgive me, my lords.

498
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,120
You heard her!
Move your arses!

499
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,400
Come on, out.

500
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,320
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

501
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,960
Have no fear, my lady.

502
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,560
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole

503
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:31,280
and then it's on
to the Red Keep to free Ned.

504
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,960
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

505
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,240
You're not wasting away, are you?

506
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,120
l remember the day
you came into this world,

507
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,680
red-faced and squalling.

508
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,720
And now l find you leading a host to war.

509
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,440
- There was no one else.
- No one?

510
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,520
Who were those men l saw here?

511
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,520
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

512
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,720
lf you think you can
send me back to Winterfell...

513
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,040
Oh, would that l could.

514
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,120
There was...

515
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,160
a letter.

516
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,600
From Sansa.

517
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,800
From the queen, you mean.

518
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,520
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

519
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,400
How many men do you have?

520
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,360
18,OOO.

521
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,680
lf l go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

522
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,560
You would never
be allowed to leave. No.

523
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,240
Our best hope,
our only hope,

524
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,520
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if l lose?

525
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:06,000
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

526
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,200
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

527
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,560
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

528
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,080
And the years have not made him kinder.

529
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,360
lf you lose,

530
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,280
your father dies, your sisters die,

531
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,360
we die.

532
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,640
Well, that makes it simple, then.

533
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,000
l suppose it does.

534
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,640
From here it might be best
if Bronn and l continue alone.

535
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:00,960
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.

536
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,760
Not best for me.

537
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
lf the halfman betrays us,

538
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,520
Shagga, son of Dolf,
will cut om his manhood...

539
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:12,280
And feed it to the goats, yes.

540
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,480
All right, then.

541
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,560
Time to meet my father.

542
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,200
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

543
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,080
Father.

544
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,480
The rumours of your demise
were unfounded.

545
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,800
Sorry to disappoint you.

546
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,080
And who are these...

547
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:06,240
companions of yours?

548
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,080
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

549
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,120
chieftain of the Stone Crows.

550
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,440
Timett, son of Timett
ruler of the Burned Me!n.

551
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,160
This fair maid is Chella,
daughter of Cheyk,

552
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,120
leader of the Black Ears.

553
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:26,520
And here we have Bronn, son of...

554
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:30,560
You wouldn't know him.

555
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,360
May l present my lord father,

556
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:37,000
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,

557
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,240
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

558
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,200
Kind of you to go to war for me.

559
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:48,880
You left us no choice.

560
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,200
The honour of the house was at stake.

561
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,480
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

562
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,920
We have our dimerences, Jaime and l.

563
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:00,040
He's braver. l'm better-looking.

564
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:02,600
He's been covering himself in glory.

565
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:05,320
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

566
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,160
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

567
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,080
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

568
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,040
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

569
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:18,880
How did my sweet sister persuade the king
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

570
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,560
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

571
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,080
My sister rules, you mean.

572
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,240
Stark's son has called his banners.

573
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,480
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

574
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:38,240
One taste of battle and he'll run back
to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.

575
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,800
Maybe. Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

576
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,480
You'd like him.

577
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,320
While we're on the subject of war,

578
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,400
l made promises to my friends here,

579
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:54,760
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

580
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,640
We shall require
3,OOO helms and shields,

581
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
plus swords, pikes,

582
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,640
gorgets, maces...

583
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:04,880
lf it please my lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

584
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,360
that the northmen
have crossed the Neck.

585
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,880
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws. So be it.

586
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,040
Kevan, command
the drummers beat assembly.

587
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,320
And send word to Jaime
that l am moving against Robb Stark.

588
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,240
At once, my lord.

589
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,400
lt is said that the men
of the mountain clans are great warriors.

590
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,200
Ride with me against my enemies

591
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,000
and you shall have
all my son promised you and more.

592
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,360
Only if the halfman fights with us.

593
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,000
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

594
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,400
the little lion's life is ours.

595
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,360
(Rodrik) The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.

596
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,280
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his knights at a disadvantage.

597
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,160
No, we need to get around him and break
Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

598
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,960
Do that and the river lords will join us.

599
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,520
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at the Twins.

600
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,880
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.

601
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:19,120
''The late Lord Frey'' my father calls him.

602
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,840
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

603
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,720
Some men take their oaths
more seriously than others.

604
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,640
(Grunting)

605
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:36,040
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

606
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,160
So what's it going to be?

607
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,840
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

608
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,400
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.

609
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,400
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
Ieaving this tent with his head.

610
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,480
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.

611
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:01,640
He looked to be counting.

612
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,960
How high did you get?

613
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,960
20,OOO. Maybe more.

614
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,400
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

615
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,320
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

616
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:29,760
And he understands honour...

617
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,240
and courage.

618
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:37,320
Let him go.

619
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,000
Robb.

620
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:54,880
Tell Lord Tywin
winter is coming for him.

621
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,200
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

622
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:03,400
Yes, my lord.

623
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:05,440
Thank you, my lord.

624
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:17,200
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

625
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,880
You call me boy again.

626
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,960
Go on.

627
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,920
(Growls)

628
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,720
Oi.

629
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,160
(Pycelle) It is also the wish of His Grace

630
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,040
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

631
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:56,800
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

632
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,320
..be at once raised to the rank of lord...

633
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,680
Lord Gyles.

634
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,960
..and granted
the ancient seat of Harrenhal,

635
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,480
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honour

636
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,280
after him until the end of time.

637
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,680
(Lords mutter)

638
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:21,520
ln the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,

639
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:25,760
it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,

640
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,120
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,

641
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,360
be appointed Hand of the King.

642
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,280
Lastly,

643
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,080
in these times of treason and turmoil,

644
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,080
it is the view of council

645
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,120
that the life and safety

646
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:46,080
of King Joffrey

647
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:50,160
be of paramount importance.

648
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:54,160
Ser Barristan Selmy.

649
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,640
Your Grace,
l am yours to command.

650
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,640
Rise, Ser Barristan.

651
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:08,480
You may remove your helm.

652
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,840
You have served the realm
Iong and faithfully.

653
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,560
Every man and woman
in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

654
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:22,840
But it is time to put aside
your armour and your sword.

655
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,600
lt is time to rest
and look back with pride

656
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:28,480
- on your many years of service.
- (Murmuring)

657
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,760
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

658
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,200
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

659
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,960
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?

660
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,600
(Joffrey) You let my father die.

661
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,440
You're too old to protect anybody.

662
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:50,240
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined

663
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,680
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

664
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,360
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade

665
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,440
with the blood of the king
he had sworn to defend!

666
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,360
Careful, ser.

667
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,400
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good ser.

668
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,920
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

669
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:09,640
with servants
to look after your every need.

670
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,560
A hall to die in
and men to bury me.

671
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:18,000
l am a knight.

672
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:21,000
l shall die a knight.

673
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,720
A naked knight, apparently.

674
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,720
(Laughter)

675
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,160
Even now l could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

676
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,160
Here, boy!

677
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,800
Melt it down and add it to the others.

678
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,320
(Doors creak, clang)

679
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,600
lf any man in this hall
has other matters

680
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,240
to set before His Grace,
Iet him speak now

681
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,760
or go forth and hold his silence.

682
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,520
Your Grace.

683
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,560
Come foM/ard, my lady.

684
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:27,280
(Steward) The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.

685
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,760
Do you have some business
for the king and the council, Sansa?

686
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,720
l do.

687
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,720
As it please Your Grace,
l ask mercy for my father,

688
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,280
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

689
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,440
Treason is a noxious weed.

690
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,400
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.

691
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,120
l want to hear what she says.

692
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,080
Thank you, Your Grace.

693
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:58,600
Do you deny your father's crime?

694
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:02,320
No, my lords.
l know he must be punished.

695
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,960
All l ask is mercy.

696
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,640
l know my lord father
must regret what he did.

697
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,680
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

698
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,400
You all know he loved him.

699
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,000
He never wanted to be Hand
until the king asked him.

700
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:19,720
They must have lied to him -
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.

701
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,600
They must have lied!

702
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:24,040
He said l wasn't the king.

703
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,160
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.

704
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,120
Maester Pycelle
was giving him milk of the poppy.

705
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:34,880
He wasn't himself.
OtheM/ise he never would have said it.

706
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,760
A child's faith.

707
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,080
Such sweet innocence.

708
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:45,760
And yet they say wisdom
oft comes from the mouths of babes.

709
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,200
Treason is treason!

710
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,320
Anything else?

711
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,440
lf you still have any amection
in your heart for me,

712
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,520
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

713
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,840
Your sweet words have moved me.

714
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,680
But your father has to confess.

715
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,080
He has to confess
and say that l'm the king...

716
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,880
or there'll be no mercy for him.

717
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,280
He will.
