1
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,351
Hello?

2
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,527
Nancy?

3
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,610
Nancy!

4
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,451
Hello?

5
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,087
Oh, my God...

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,131
Nancy!

7
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,345
Hey, what's the matter?

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,435
Nothing.

9
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,586
You're so beautiful.

10
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,345
Nancy!

11
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,489
Steve?

12
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,494
- Hey, Steve.
- Mmm.

13
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,255
I'll...

14
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,292
see you tomorrow, okay?

15
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,420
Mmm-hmm.

16
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,630
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.

17
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,878
Oh, I scared you?

18
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,175
I know, I should have called.

19
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,843
Where have you been?

20
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,386
We agreed on 10:00.

21
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,432
After the assembly, some people
wanted to get something to eat.

22
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,507
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

23
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,810
You didn't think to call and let me know?

24
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,512
With everything that's been going on?

25
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,349
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

26
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,183
I'm sorry, Mom.
What more do you want?

27
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,563
Hey, wait...

28
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,814
Whose sweatshirt is that?

29
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,361
Steve's.

30
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,696
So is Steve your boyfriend now?

31
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,073
What?

32
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,153
No!

33
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,285
It was just cold,
so I borrowed his sweatshirt.

34
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,616
It's not a big deal.

35
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,869
Nancy?

36
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,544
What?

37
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,006
You can talk to me.

38
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,960
You can talk to me.
Whatever happened.

39
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,762
Nothing happened.

40
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,762
Nancy.

41
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,686
Nothing happened.

42
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,141
Can I please go?

43
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,008
Will? Will?

44
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,755
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

45
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,839
Will...

46
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,174
Please...

47
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,884
Will...

48
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:55,974
It's me.

49
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,561
It's me. Just talk to me.
Talk to me.

50
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,643
Just say...

51
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,898
- Mom?
- Jonathan!

52
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,857
- Come here. Come here.
- Mom, what is this?

53
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,488
Come here. Come here.

54
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,911
- What's going on?
- It's Will. It's Will, he's...

55
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,829
he's trying to talk to me.

56
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,994
- He's trying to talk to you?
- Yes, through... through the lights.

57
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,203
- Mom...
- I know.

58
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,663
I know.

59
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,873
Just... just watch.

60
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,551
Will... your brother's here.

61
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,427
Can you show him what you showed me, baby?

62
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,304
Please...
Did you see that?

63
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,352
It's the electricity, Mom.

64
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,680
- It's acting up.
- No.

65
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,355
It's the same thing that fried the phones.

66
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,980
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

67
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,277
Something is going on here!

68
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,980
- Yesterday, the wall...
- What? What about the wall?

69
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,236
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

70
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,694
I just know that Will is here.

71
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,278
No, Mom.

72
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,035
- Maybe if I get more lamps...
- No, Mom.

73
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,540
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay?

74
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,792
He is just lost.

75
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,967
People are looking for him,
and they're going to find him.

76
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,635
Okay.

77
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,929
- This isn't helping.
- Okay, okay.

78
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,302
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,637
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

80
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,469
Can you just try and get some sleep?

81
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,226
- Yeah.
- Huh? Can you do that for me?

82
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,557
- I promise. I will.
- Yeah?

83
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,608
- Yeah.
- I just need to sit here for a minute.

84
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,566
All right, I'll go make breakfast.

85
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,147
- Okay.
- Yeah?

86
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,749
Will?

87
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,839
We just tell our parents
we have AV Club after school.

88
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,508
That'll give us at least a few hours
for Operation Mirkwood.

89
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,136
You seriously think that
the weirdo knows where Will is?

90
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,930
- Just trust me on this, okay?
- Okay.

91
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,507
- Did you get the supplies?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,264
Binoculars... from 'Nam.

93
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,471
Army knife... also from 'Nam.

94
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,022
Hammer, camouflage bandana...

95
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,271
and the wrist rocket.

96
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,353
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon
with a slingshot?

97
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,904
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

98
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,324
And second of all,
the Demogorgon's not real.

99
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,400
It's made up.

100
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,737
But if there is something out there,
I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

101
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,498
- and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get?

102
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,586
Well, alrighty.

103
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,914
So, we've got...

104
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,376
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

105
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,007
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

106
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,259
- banana, and trail mix.
- Seriously?

107
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,841
We need energy for our travels.
For stamina.

108
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,052
And besides, why do we
even need weapons anyway?

109
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,763
- We have her.
- She shut one door!

110
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,018
With her mind!

111
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,771
Are you kidding me?
That's insane!

112
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,729
Imagine all the other cool stuff
she could do.

113
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,903
Like...

114
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,446
I bet... that she could make this fly!

115
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,154
Hey. Hey.

116
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,830
Okay, concentrate.
Okay?

117
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,201
Okay, one more time.

118
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,538
Okay.

119
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,338
Use your powers, okay?

120
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,421
Idiot.

121
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,173
- She's not a dog!
- Boys!

122
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,004
Time for school!

123
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,220
Just stay down here.

124
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,597
Don't make any noise,
and don't leave.

125
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,100
If you get hungry,
eat Dustin's snacks, okay?

126
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,056
- Michael!
- Coming!

127
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,516
You know those power lines?

128
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,397
- Power lines?
- Yeah.

129
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,523
The ones behind my house?

130
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,820
Yes.

131
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,442
Meet us there, after school.

132
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,194
After school?

133
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,616
Yeah, 3:15.

134
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,827
Ah.

135
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,499
When the numbers read three-one-five,
meet us there.

136
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,797
"Three-one-five."

137
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,840
Three-one-five.

138
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,406
Hey!

139
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,577
Hey!

140
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,156
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

141
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,707
Yeah, totally.

142
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,791
I just...

143
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,209
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.

144
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,790
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.

145
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,125
I know.

146
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,051
I know.
Of course not.

147
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,676
But what about, like, Tommy,
and Carol and them?

148
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,847
You're being paranoid.

149
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,344
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, it's cute.

150
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,513
Hey...

151
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,269
I had a good time.

152
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,314
Yeah.

153
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,104
Yeah.
Me, too.

154
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,080
Mmm.
Hmm.

155
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,561
Hey, Ally.
Where's Barb?

156
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,479
Um, shouldn't you know?

157
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,728
You haven't seen her anywhere...
at all?

158
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,987
There she is.
Emerald City.

159
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,193
I heard they make
space weapons in there.

160
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,277
Space weapons?

161
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,488
Yeah. You know, like,
Reagan's Star Wars.

162
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,245
I guess we're gonna blow
the Ruskies to smithereens.

163
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,576
Hey, can I help you?

164
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,622
Uh, yeah.
We're here for a tour.

165
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,502
Oh, we don't give tours.

166
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,629
Okay...
A quick look around.

167
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,336
You have to get clearance for that.
You can contact, uh...

168
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,012
Rick Schaeffer at
the Department of Energy.

169
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,181
Maybe you seen it on TV.
We got a local kid that's missing.

170
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,099
We have reason to believe
he might have snuck in here.

171
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,644
Like I said,
you have to speak to Mr. Schaeffer.

172
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,939
- What's your name?
- Patrick.

173
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,610
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor,
and I got reporters breathing down my neck

174
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,278
and I got a very upset mother.

175
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,864
Now, I know the kid's not in there,
but I gotta check off this box.

176
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,156
Patrick, would you do me a favor?

177
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,789
Would you speak to your boss
and see what you can swing for us?

178
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,378
I'd really appreciate it.

179
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,332
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.

180
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,492
<i>was occupying a large part of Lebanon.</i>

181
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,744
<i>Today, Syria has become a home for...</i>

182
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,958
<i>I have the power!</i>

183
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,664
<i>gift that will last forever.</i>

184
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,920
<i>From the Harmony Treasures' collection...</i>

185
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:11,944
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

186
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,368
- Joyce...
- Just ring me up, Donald.

187
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,495
And you think this missing boy
may have crawled through there?

188
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,202
Well, that was the idea.

189
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,709
Yeah, I just don't see
how that'd be possible.

190
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,505
We've got over 100 cameras.

191
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,209
Every square inch covered,
plus all my guys.

192
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,386
No one breaks in here.

193
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,088
Certainly not some kid.

194
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,595
Those cameras, you keep the tapes?

195
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,557
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you guys do in here?

196
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,392
You're asking the wrong guy.

197
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:12,526
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians?
- I expect. Something like that.

198
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,028
- Who's in charge here?
- That'd be Dr. Brenner.

199
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,983
And he builds the space lasers?

200
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,910
- Space lasers?
- Ignore him.

201
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,999
This is the night of the 6th and 7th
we're seeing here?

202
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,417
That's correct.

203
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,555
Is that it?

204
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,557
Like I said, we would have seen him.

205
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,018
The night of the 7th,
we had a search party out for Will.

206
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,815
You remember anything about that night?

207
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,143
Mmm, not much to remember.
Called it off.

208
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,820
- 'Cause of the storm.
- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.

209
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,568
You see any rain on that tape?

210
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,199
What are you thinking?

211
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,823
I don't know.

212
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,031
But they're lying.

213
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,320
That's why science doesn't
make any damn sense to me.

214
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,077
No, I swear. Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.

215
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,376
Oh, thanks, man.
It's a heated pool.

216
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,294
Well, if it's not frostbite,
then what is it?

217
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,212
Ugh, I don't care what it is,
it's disgusting!

218
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,006
Get it off the table.
We're eating here.

219
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,378
Ew!

220
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,090
Hey, Tommy.

221
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,046
When you left, did you see Barb?

222
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,553
- What?
- Barbara.

223
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,099
She's not here today.

224
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:13,304
I seriously have no idea
who you're talking about.

225
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,559
Come on, don't be an ass, man.
Did you...

226
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,481
Did you see her leave last night or not?

227
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,194
No, she was gone when we left.

228
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,738
Probably couldn't stand
listening to all that moaning.

229
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,655
Oh, Steve!

230
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,159
- Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve!
- Oh, Steve...

231
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,331
Oh, Steve!

232
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,999
Okay, chill.

233
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,999
Listen... I'm sure she's fine.
She's probably just...

234
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,581
she's probably just, like,
skipping or something.

235
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,086
Yeah.

236
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,759
Yeah, probably.

237
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,067
- How about this one?
- Too big for the sling.

238
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,405
So, do you think Eleven was born
with her powers, like the X-Men,

239
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,784
or do you think she acquired them, like...
like Green Lantern?

240
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,991
She's not a superhero.
She's a weirdo.

241
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,498
Why does that matter?
The X-Men are weirdos.

242
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,045
If you love her so much,
why don't you marry her?

243
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,463
What are you talking about?

244
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,041
- Mike, seriously?
- What?

245
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,171
You look at her all, like...

246
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,720
"Hi, El! El! El! El!"

247
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,172
I love you so much!

248
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,098
- "Would you marry me?"
- Shut up, Lucas.

249
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,675
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.

250
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,515
What are you losers
doing back here?

251
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,141
Probably looking for their missing friend.

252
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,145
That's not funny.
It's serious. He's in danger.

253
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,399
I hate to break it to you, Toothless,
but he's not in danger.

254
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,855
He's dead.
That's what my dad says.

255
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,236
He said he was probably killed
by some other queer.

256
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,402
Come on.
Just ignore them.

257
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,284
Watch where you're going, Frogface.

258
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,625
- You all right?
- Yeah.

259
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,924
Hey.

260
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,505
How about this one?

261
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,092
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

262
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,642
Yeah, this is it.

263
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,595
Oh, yeah.

264
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,056
Yeah, this is the monster killer!

265
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,186
Whoo!

266
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,417
Hey.

267
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,129
Oh, hey.

268
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,259
- Hey!
- Hey, Karen.

269
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,339
Hi...

270
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,017
I brought you a casserole.

271
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,180
Oh! Thank you, uh...

272
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,816
Uh, you wanna... come in?

273
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:06,161
Hey, Marissa.
How you doin'?

274
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,623
You have a lot of nerve showing up here.

275
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,049
What?

276
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,127
You could have at least called, said,

277
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,681
"Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out.
Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."

278
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,259
Yep.

279
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,305
I'm sorry. Uh...

280
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,766
Maybe we could go out again next week?

281
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,398
Newspapers?
You guys got newspapers around here?

282
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,910
<i>We have the New York Times,
the Post, all the big ones.</i>

283
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,532
Organized by year and topic.

284
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,330
You can find the corresponding microfiche
in the reading room.

285
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,205
Okay, we're looking for anything
on the Hawkins National Laboratory.

286
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,036
Well, shouldn't you be looking
for that missing kid?

287
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,292
Yeah. We are.

288
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,333
<i>Uh, so, why don't you start
with the Times,</i>

289
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,838
<i>and we'll check out the Post.</i>

290
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,390
The librarian?

291
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,892
Will always loved
Christmas, you know.

292
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,273
So I thought if I...
I put the lights up...

293
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,943
I don't know, he...

294
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,695
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

295
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,276
It's silly, I know.

296
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,408
No.
No, it's not silly.

297
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,490
How is Jonathan holding up?

298
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,542
You know,
he's good at taking care of himself.

299
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,585
He always has been, you know?

300
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,913
I...

301
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,170
I mean,
he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...

302
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,802
Is something the matter?

303
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,220
Uh, no.

304
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,547
No, I just...

305
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,849
We're having electrical problems.

306
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,051
Joyce.

307
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,553
I want you to know something.

308
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,765
If you need anything, anything at all...

309
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,395
Ted and I are here for you.

310
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,522
Thank you.
Thanks.

311
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,898
Okay.

312
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,731
How... how's Mike
dealing with this?

313
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,612
Is he, uh, okay?

314
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,661
Mike?
Uh... I don't know.

315
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,282
He skipped school yesterday.

316
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,324
He's never done anything like that before.

317
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,949
Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

318
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,120
Oh, where's Holly?

319
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,426
Hey!

320
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,178
She shouldn't be here.

321
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,764
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's quite the explorer these days.

322
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,104
- Wait, did you see something?
- Yeah.

323
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,857
What did... what did you see?
Tell me.

324
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,813
- What did you see? What...
- Joyce... Joyce!

325
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,776
Listen... Karen,
thank you for the casserole,

326
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,110
but I need you to leave.

327
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:08,904
Okay?

328
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,498
Come on, come on, come on...

329
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,536
<i>- Hello?
- Hi.</i>

330
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,496
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

331
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,956
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

332
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,086
<i>Good.
I'm good.</i>

333
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,385
Um, I was just wondering, uh,
is Barb there?

334
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,428
<i>Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.</i>

335
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,883
But she did come home, right?
After the vigil?

336
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,220
No, she said she was staying
with you last night.

337
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:37,102
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.

338
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,356
I meant, did she come home this morning?

339
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,609
I think she left some textbooks
and she was gonna go pick them up.

340
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,907
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

341
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,912
Do... do you know what?
I just remembered... she's at the library.

342
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,617
Nancy, will you please have her call me
as soon as you find her?

343
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,667
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

344
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,086
Sorry to bother you.

345
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,184
Hey, man.

346
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,261
What's going on?

347
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,347
Nicole here was, uh,
telling us about your work.

348
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,728
- We've heard great things.
- Yeah, sounds cool.

349
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,528
And we'd just love to take a look.
You know, as... connoisseurs of art.

350
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,570
I don't know
what you're talking about.

351
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,864
- Oh, no? Oh...
- Hey.

352
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,158
Please, give me my bag.
No, just...

353
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,702
Man, he is totally trembling.
He must really have something to hide.

354
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,029
Here we go.

355
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,830
Ah...

356
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,906
Here we go.

357
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,702
- Oh, man.
- Let me see.

358
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,537
Dude.

359
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,541
Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

360
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,250
- I was looking for my brother.
- No.

361
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,088
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.

362
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,431
- What's going on?
- Here's the starring lady.

363
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,633
What?

364
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,810
This creep was spying on us last night.

365
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,101
He was probably gonna
save this one for later.

366
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:07,648
See, you can tell
that he knows it was wrong, but...

367
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,778
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

368
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,817
It's hardwired into 'em.

369
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,780
You know, they just can't help themselves.

370
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,749
So...

371
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,536
we'll just have to take away his toy.

372
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,751
- Steve...
- No, please, not the camera.

373
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,547
No, no, wait, wait...
Tommy, Tommy.

374
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,547
It's okay.

375
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,637
Here you go, man.

376
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,519
Come on, let's go.
The game's about to start.

377
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,229
Boo.

378
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,601
Bye.

379
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,158
Hey, Nance!

380
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,494
Come on.

381
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,358
Three-one-five.

382
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,024
Three-one-five.

383
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,325
Three-one-five.

384
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,019
No! No!

385
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,392
Papa! Papa!

386
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:49,942
Papa!

387
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,314
Papa!

388
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:55,981
No!

389
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,500
Incredible.

390
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,718
El!

391
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,263
You okay?

392
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,605
Hop on.
We only have a few hours.

393
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,077
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

394
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,247
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

395
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,699
"blow me."

396
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,126
Bull, if you did that,
you'd be in detention right now.

397
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,669
Saturday.

398
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,542
I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

399
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:16,748
Oh, he's so a virgin!

400
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,754
Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.

401
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,796
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

402
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,427
I totally forgot.

403
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,099
I told my mom I would, um...

404
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,676
I would do something with her.

405
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,602
Well, what do you mean?
The game's about to start.

406
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,146
I'm sorry.

407
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,142
What the hell's wrong with her?

408
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,195
Maybe she freaked out
when you went all psycho on the psycho.

409
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,270
Oh, give me a break.

410
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,652
What'd you expect,
dating Miss Perfect?

411
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,664
Why did they hurt you?

412
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:52,871
What?

413
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,454
Oh, that.

414
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,538
Uh...

415
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,294
I just fell at recess.

416
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,418
- Mike...
- Yeah?

417
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,969
Friends tell the truth.

418
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:10,051
I was tripped by this mouth breather,
Troy, okay?

419
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,602
Mouth breather?

420
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,554
Yeah, you know...

421
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,764
a dumb person.

422
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,019
A knucklehead.

423
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,190
Knucklehead?

424
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,904
I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.

425
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,824
I just didn't want you to think
I was such a wastoid, you know?

426
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,026
- Mike...
- Yeah?

427
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,611
I understand.

428
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,950
Oh.

429
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,781
Okay, cool.

430
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,083
Cool.

431
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,477
Barb?

432
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,984
Barb!

433
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,712
Barb?

434
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,762
Barb?

435
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,489
Barb?

436
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,488
Oh!

437
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,564
Will... are you here?

438
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,034
Okay, good, good, good, good.

439
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:16,991
Are you...

440
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,121
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

441
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,668
Can you do that for me,
sweetie?

442
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,791
Can you do...

443
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,583
Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

444
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,803
Baby, I need to know...

445
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,431
...are you alive?

446
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,690
Are you safe?

447
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,118
I need to know where to find you, honey.
Where... where are you?

448
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,667
Can you...
can you tell me where you are?

449
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:05,085
Can you...

450
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,749
Please, baby.
I need to find you. Tell me what to do.

451
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,715
Please just...

452
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,140
Will...

453
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,290
Hey! You're home early!
How was the game?

454
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,708
Nancy?
What's the matter?

455
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,877
It's Barb.

456
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,178
I think...

457
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,464
something happened.

458
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,222
Something terrible.

459
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,891
<i>I don't know, Chief.</i>

460
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,223
What don't you know?

461
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:10,480
This lady, Terry Ives,
sounds like a real nut to me.

462
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,610
Her kid was taken
for LSD mind control experiments?

463
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:15,780
She's been discredited.

464
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:16,948
Claim was thrown out...

465
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,151
Okay, forget about her.

466
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,489
Take a look at this.

467
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,788
- Dr. Martin Brenner.
- Who?

468
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,490
Brenner.

469
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,496
He runs Hawkins Lab.

470
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:27,622
Okay.

471
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,205
You don't find that interesting?

472
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,710
Not really.

473
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,668
He was involved in some hippie crap
back in the day, so what?

474
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:39,927
No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.

475
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,133
Doesn't mean he had
anything to do with our kid.

476
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,264
Come on. Look at that.
Hospital gowns. All of 'em.

477
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,516
Now, that piece of fabric
that the teacher found by the pipe.

478
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,519
That sure looked
like a hospital gown to me, huh?

479
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,022
- Am I wrong?
- I don't know, Chief.

480
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,443
Come on, man.

481
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,816
Work with me here.

482
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,490
I'm not saying that there's
some grand conspiracy.

483
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,817
I'm just...

484
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,955
I'm saying maybe something happened.

485
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:10,878
Maybe Will was in the wrong place
at the wrong time

486
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,875
and he saw something
that he shouldn't have.

487
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,630
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.

488
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,257
<i>Hey, Powell,
is the chief with you?</i>

489
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,550
Hopper here.
What do you got?

490
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,217
Here.

491
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,802
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

492
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,436
Hiding.

493
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:13,140
No, no, this is where he lives.

494
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,226
He's missing from here.
Understand?

495
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,777
- What are we doing here?
- She said he's hiding here.

496
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,574
Um... no!

497
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,323
I swear, if we walked
all the way out here for nothing...

498
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,904
That's exactly what we did.

499
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,036
I told you she didn't know
what the hell she was talking about!

500
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,830
Why did you bring us here?

501
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,129
- Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then?

502
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,797
Call the cops,
like we should have done yesterday.

503
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,466
- We are not calling the cops!
- Hey, guys?

504
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,760
- What other choice do we have?
- Guys!

505
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,679
Will...

506
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:10,997
Okay.

507
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,416
Okay, baby, talk to me.

508
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,209
Talk to me.
Where are you?

509
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,876
"R." Good, good, good, good.

510
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,332
That's good.
Come on, come on.

511
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,216
"I..."

512
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,378
G...

513
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,179
H... T...

514
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,090
H...

515
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,220
E...

516
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,347
"R... E..."

517
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,973
"Right here."

518
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,097
"Right here"?

519
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,854
I don't know what that means.

520
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,231
I need you to tell me what to do.

521
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,311
What should I do?

522
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,648
How do I get to you? How do I find you?
What should I do?

523
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,183
Oh, Jesus.

524
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,394
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.

525
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,383
It's not Will.
It can't be.

526
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,485
It's Will.
It's really Will.

527
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,405
Mike...

528
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,658
"Mike"? "Mike," what?

529
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,865
You were supposed to help us
find him alive.

530
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,369
You said he was alive!

531
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,871
Why did you lie to us?

532
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,161
What's wrong with you?

533
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,996
What is wrong with you?

534
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,290
- Mike...
- What?

535
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,217
Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.

536
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,343
Mike...

537
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,141
Mike, where are you going?
Mike!

538
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,265
Mike!

539
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,281
Mom?

540
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,239
Mom, what happened?

541
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,574
It's okay.

542
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:42,913
Hey.

543
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,500
Michael?

544
00:48:49,524 --> 00:48:57,524
