1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,400
How I ever let him lay a hand on me?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,280
I'm glad he's out of your life.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,080
Guard up, jab, jab.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,240
Lead, jab, jab, right.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,280
- What you doing?
- Alfred's teaching me to fight.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,480
I need you to take me
to the Pike brothers.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,120
The firebugs from the Narrows?

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,720
I just hang
with their sister, Bridget.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,120
Hey, boys. We need the best,
and you guys are the best.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,440
Bridget, you just got a promotion.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,360
- G.C.P.D.
- Run.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
- I got her. Drop it! Drop it!
- No.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,360
One moment, Mr. Penguin.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,040
Mother.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,720
<i>I don't know nothing.</i>

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,200
You are going to go to Galavan.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,640
Once you're inside his organization,

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,240
you will find my mother
and rescue her.

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,080
He'll buy it, if we sell it right.

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,680
That penguin just went crazy.

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,920
I mean, like, crazier
than I've ever seen him.

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,080
And you said it was me
who set up the count house raid.

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,600
Said I was traitor and a rat.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,400
And he...
He came at me with a cleaver.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,760
I tried to protect myself
and he did this.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,560
Sick bastard.

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,400
How did you get away?

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,520
There's a lot of blood. A lot.

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,480
He tried to take another swing
he slipped and fell

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
and so I just run.

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,160
I run, and I run

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,560
and then next thing
I knew I woke up in the hospital.

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,640
Give me a shot, Mr. Galavan.

35
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,080
Let me show you what I can do.

36
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,640
Well, I'd like to help you out,
Butch.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,000
But I already had several capable
two-handed thugs in my employ.

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,320
They don't know Gotham like I do.

39
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,240
I got brains. You ask anyone.

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,000
What do you think, ladies?

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,720
I think he's cute

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
like a sad bear.

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,680
I supposed he's telling the truth.

44
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,880
The little man was cracking up
the last time I saw him.

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,080
He was very mean to me once.

46
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,240
Held me hostage in my own apartment.

47
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,040
Said some nasty things.

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,160
- Isn't that right, stumpy?
- That's right, ma'am.

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,960
And I'm sorry for it.

50
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,040
Business is business, you know.

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,520
Please, let me work for you,
Mr. Galavan.

52
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,920
I got nobody else to turn to.

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,840
Oh, yes.

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,480
We can put cool things
on a stump

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,520
like knives and mallets and stuff.

56
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,120
How about a little, tiny chainsaw?

57
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
Yes.

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,160
Well, that settles it.

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,320
Welcome aboard, Butch.

60
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,560
Thank you, sir.

61
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,800
Bravo, congressman.

62
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,480
Well-saved.

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,080
You really are quite spry
for a big man.

64
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,040
Have you reconsidered your position?

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,160
Can I count on your support
this election?

66
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,800
Yes, yes, you have my full support.

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
Thank you so much.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
{\an5}Freeze.

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
{\an5}Man, I do nothing.
Why are you chasing me?

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
{\an5}Police officer died last night.

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,880
{\an5}Killed by a firebug crew on a spree.

72
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,160
{\an5}- You're a firebug, aren't you?
- No, man.

73
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,720
{\an5}I've been out of the game
a long time.

74
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,920
- Don't lie to me, Nino.
- I swear.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,960
Sir, that's a violation
of officer conduct regs.

76
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,760
{\an5}Luke Garrett burned to death
in front of me 12 hours ago.

77
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,720
I'll conduct myself as I see fit.

78
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,440
{\an5}These crews were working
with the kid, a girl,

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
{\an5}wears a homemade fire suit.

80
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,240
{\an5}If for real, never heard
of a female firebug before.

81
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,480
{\an5}It's mad real like a unicorn
or something.

82
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Sir.

83
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
{\an5}Captain Barnes said
we must report any infractions.

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,680
{\an5}- Even by superior officers.
- You do that.

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
{\an5}What are you doing?

86
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
I can't sleep.

87
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,200
{\an5}I don't know what to do with myself.

88
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,000
{\an5}That's the point of being free.

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,520
{\an5}You get to do
whatever the hell you want.

90
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,720
What am I gonna do?

91
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,720
{\an5}I killed someone last night.
I can't go home.

92
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,040
{\an5}- I can't go to the police.
- You gotta get out of town.

93
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,440
How? I've got no money.

94
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,080
{\an5}No problem.

95
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
{\an5}We'll get you some.

96
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,840
{\an5}You mean like crime.

97
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,960
{\an5}Man, you are square.

98
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,600
I guess I got no choice.

99
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,720
Why are you helping me?

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,400
Maybe you remind me of me.

101
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,920
If I was a doufus.

102
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,480
This crime,
what exactly you got in mind?

103
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen, or should
I say pimps, hoss, and thieves.

104
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,280
Do I have some product for you today?

105
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,760
Do you like what you see?

106
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,960
Come on, let me hear you.
Do you like what you see?

107
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
All right.

108
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,160
Oh, check it out. Check it out.

109
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,640
Yes, nice and sturdy.

110
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,120
- I want her!
- Bidding will start at 800, a piece.

111
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,640
Oh, we got 800.
Can I get 850? Got 850.

112
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,960
Can I get 900? I got 900.

113
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,840
Can I get 950? 950? I got 950.

114
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,760
Those girls are for sale?

115
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,000
Told you this place was freaky.

116
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,160
We need to help them.

117
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
We're here to help you.

118
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,280
Because you killed a cop remember?

119
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,800
We get the money, we go.

120
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,040
- But...
- Listen.

121
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Listen.

122
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,640
We go down the stairs.

123
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,440
A lock on the backdoor is busted.

124
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,240
I know, because I busted it.

125
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,080
Go in, wait for me to make my move.

126
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,840
How will I know when?

127
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Pay attention.

128
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,600
Sold for 2500 to the gentlemen
with a burgundy hat.

129
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Yes, indeed, come on ladies.

130
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
Found you a nice new home!

131
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,520
Oh, you'll be very satisfied.
Very, very satisfied.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Next up!

133
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,680
Check her out as she walks
down the place.

134
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,160
See how graceful she is.
Look at this one!

135
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,280
I'm going to start the bidding
here at 900!

136
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Can I get 900?

137
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,560
Hey, pervs, this is a robbery.

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,000
Milo, kill that punk.

139
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
She's with me.

140
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,400
Now, each of you,
put all your cash in the bag.

141
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Or what?

142
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,120
I ain't scared of you two.

143
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,040
Yeah, all right.

144
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,360
- Anybody else got a problem?
- No, no.

145
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,600
Yeah, I don't think so.

146
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,000
- Will you help me?
- Let me out.

147
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,080
And for the record, oh, y'all suck.

148
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,320
Come on, come on! Get me out of here!

149
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Hey, stop!

150
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,080
- Oh, my God.
- I know, right?

151
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Let's go.

152
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,480
Note in my file, are you serious?

153
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,920
Do I look like I'm joking?

154
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,600
We do not beat suspects.

155
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Ever!

156
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I get it.

157
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
- Luke was a good kid.
- We took him out of the academy.

158
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,760
You told him he was ready.
Now, he is dead.

159
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,800
You lose people in the war.
You know that.

160
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,600
Make no mistake. This is war.

161
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,480
But that doesn't give you or me
the license to break the law.

162
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
There's a line.

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,840
I learned that the hard way.

164
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,440
Respectfully, sir, this is Gotham.

165
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,880
There are gray areas.

166
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,400
I've learned that the hard way too.

167
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,960
And did you even get a lead
while you were out avenging Luke?

168
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

169
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,360
Now, you got one now.

170
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,440
The day the owner called this in
a security camera caught it.

171
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
She's our firefly.

172
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,080
I don't know who the other one is.

173
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I do.

174
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Damn it.

175
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,000
Focus. Focus.

176
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,640
Head down. Head down.

177
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,240
Distractions will be
the death of you, Master Bruce.

178
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,040
Now, get in your toes.
In your toes, move.

179
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,520
Oh, don't dance around
like a bloody show girl.

180
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,040
Come on. That's better. Better.

181
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,920
Now, big left, big left.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Go on.

183
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,040
Now, your enemies

184
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,080
are gonna fight a lot dirtier
than that.

185
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,000
Bloody hell.

186
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,200
Very good, Master Bruce.

187
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Have you spoken to Mr. Fox

188
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,120
- about the computer?
- Yes, I have, yeah.

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,480
How much longer till it's fixed?

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
I'll tell you when it's done,
won't I?

191
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,120
- Patience.
- I'm out of patience, Alfred.

192
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,280
I'm ready to begin.

193
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,640
I'll tell you when you're ready,
Master Bruce.

194
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm ready now. I know I am.

195
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,840
Oh, by the way, by the way,
Ms. Silver called.

196
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,600
She wants you to go
have dinner this evening.

197
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,240
- Silver called?
- Yeah.

198
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,800
Told you. You're not ready.

199
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,920
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

200
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,160
Well, he's just up
and moved out of town.

201
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,200
He was rude and inconsiderate

202
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,360
and perfectly in character
for Tom Dougherty.

203
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,800
Do you ever wonder where he went?

204
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,840
He could be dead in a ditch
for all I care.

205
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,680
- Kristen.
- And I mean it too.

206
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,920
He... he wasn't very nice to me.

207
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
- That's awful. I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

208
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,040
But it all worked up for the best.

209
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,600
I know.
You and Ed seem to be getting along.

210
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,400
He is so gentle and kind.

211
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,840
Almost too gentle.

212
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,040
Look, I think a man
needs to have a little...

213
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,720
a little fire, a little danger
in him, don't you think?

214
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,080
Oh, I don't know about that.

215
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,320
And sometimes I feel like

216
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,640
he's holding something back
from me.

217
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,160
Like a secret?

218
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
I don't know.

219
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,280
I just, I guess I just wish
he would open up a little more.

220
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,600
Good morning.

221
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,160
Ms. Kringle. Ms. Thompkins.

222
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Hi.

223
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,840
What do you call a three-legged cow?

224
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,840
- I am terrible with...
- Lean beef.

225
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,920
Or supper at my place?

226
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,840
Oh, Ed.

227
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,120
Ginger to ginger, we both know,
you know where Selina Kyle's at.

228
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,680
So why don't you tell me now
and save us the hassle.

229
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Who's Selina Kyle?

230
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,600
- Cat.
- Cat?

231
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,280
Look, Ivy, you want me
to call the children's home

232
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,680
and have them come and get you now?

233
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,880
Or should I get a candy bar
and forget to have someone watch you.

234
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Candy bar.

235
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,840
I struck out.

236
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,120
None of those three kids
I talked to have seen Selina.

237
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,120
Relax, your Uncle Harvey
has you covered.

238
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,760
She's in a squat off Jenkins,
condemned SRO.

239
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
I know it.

240
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,840
Hey, last time we saw this chick,
she had a shotgun pointed at us.

241
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,880
Maybe you should take
the fascist youth, huh?

242
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,880
No.

243
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,520
With Selina it's best to go quietly.

244
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,400
When you get to the bus station,
take the first bus south.

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,640
Stay on till the end of the line.

246
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,360
Well, what do I do then?

247
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,920
You got plenty of money,
you can do what you like.

248
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,080
Thank you for everything.

249
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,920
You've been a really good friend.

250
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
I got my cut.

251
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
No biggie.

252
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Bridget, you need to run.

253
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,320
- Bridget, run. Run, run, run.
- No.

254
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,040
- Selina! Selina!
- Let her go.

255
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,440
No.

256
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Selina!

257
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Help me!

258
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Hey!

259
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Hands in the air.

260
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,160
- Drop the gun.
- Like hell I will.

261
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,880
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Who?

262
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,160
We've got both of you on tape.

263
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,840
Don't know what you're
talking about, Gordon.

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,880
She's burned down
half a dozen buildings,

265
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,840
killed a cop.

266
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,240
You're running
with a bad partner, kid.

267
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,240
You don't understand.
She was forced to do all of that.

268
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay.

269
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,680
Let me help her.

270
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Who is she?

271
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,120
Who's forcing her to do this?

272
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,640
Look, there's a lot of angry cops
out there.

273
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,080
She's gonna get shot on sight
unless I get to her first.

274
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,040
Her name is Bridget Pike.

275
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,080
Her brothers took her back.

276
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,600
Joe and Cale Pike.
They like kidnapped her.

277
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,440
They're the ones who made
her start burning stuff

278
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,920
in the first place.
It's their fault the cop died.

279
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Pike brothers.

280
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,160
Why they burned down
Wayne Enterprises buildings?

281
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,280
- Who paid them?
- Why the hell should I know

282
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
why the Pikes do anything?

283
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,680
They're freaking nuts.

284
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,000
They treated Bridget like a slave,
chained her to the wall.

285
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,360
And you're angry about it.

286
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,760
Is that why you're armed?

287
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,480
You're gonna go after the Pikes?

288
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,400
- Rescue you friend?
- No.

289
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
That's a yes.

290
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,200
Look, you're gonna get
your friend and yourself killed.

291
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,680
Let me handle the Pikes.

292
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,520
No offense, Jim

293
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,720
but I like my chances
better than yours.

294
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Why get involved?

295
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,480
Why risk you neck?

296
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,200
- Who is this girl to you?
- No one.

297
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,240
Just a girl in the neighborhood.

298
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,240
I give you my word,

299
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,960
I will do everything I can
to keep her safe.

300
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,120
But you have to stay out of it.

301
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,520
Tell me where she is.

302
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Damn.

303
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,200
She's got six grand here.

304
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,440
Little Bridget put on
a big girl pants.

305
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,200
You can take all of it. I don't care.

306
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,680
Oh, I'm taking it.

307
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,880
That's not the issue.

308
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,760
The issue is you thinking
that it's cool

309
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,680
to just ditch your brothers.

310
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,160
Oh, snap.

311
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,680
Bridget's gonna get it.

312
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,800
Joe, please.

313
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,800
Did you even think about us, huh?

314
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,320
Did you even think how we would feel?

315
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,680
No, no!

316
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,920
Joe, I didn't mean anything by it.

317
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,760
I'm a sensitive guy
and you hurt my feelings.

318
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,920
You know, without family
what do you got?

319
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,960
You got nothing, right?

320
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,760
You wanna be part
of the family again?

321
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
I said...

322
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,200
do you feel like being part
of this family again?

323
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,720
Yes.

324
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,840
Damn.

325
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Damn, that hurt.

326
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Bridget's back.

327
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,280
If you try anything
like that again, I'll kill you.

328
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,880
And I'll skin that little cat
bitch too, you hear me?

329
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,720
You're never leaving.

330
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,480
- Yes.
- Good.

331
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,440
Go make our supper.

332
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,960
All right, let's pack it up.

333
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Dear me.

334
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,880
A mallet.

335
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,280
That's useful?

336
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,400
Don't even start.

337
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
Tell me you bring good news.

338
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,800
I'm in. I'm in good.

339
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,040
And? And?

340
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,840
I'm asking questions.
But it's dangerous.

341
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,720
If I push too hard,
Galavan will be on to me.

342
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,040
I told you, he's a smart guy.

343
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,280
Look at me, Butch.

344
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,400
Are you my servant?

345
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,200
Yes.

346
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,400
Do you obey me in all things?

347
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Yes.

348
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,480
Then why do you bring me excuses?

349
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,040
Go find my mother

350
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
before I chop off the other hand.

351
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Yes, boss.

352
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Come on, harder.

353
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,640
Come on, Joe.

354
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,520
What are you gonna do?

355
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,560
- Kill us?
- Yup.

356
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
I'll check the other room.

357
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
Clear!

358
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,800
- She's not here.
- Damn.

359
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,040
I hate how it smells like good
barbeque.

360
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Bitch!

361
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Bullock, hey!

362
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,960
What? He scared the hell out of me!

363
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,800
And now he's dead.
Nice work, Bullock.

364
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Well, yeah, my kicks did it.

365
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,120
Maybe it's because
he's fired like a taquito.

366
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,720
It's not on me.

367
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,000
Looks like Selina
was telling the truth.

368
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,000
Look, no one speak ill
of the dead

369
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,680
but these asshats had it coming.

370
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,600
These asshats
were professional arsonist.

371
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,080
Somebody hired them.

372
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,560
But why Wayne Enterprises?

373
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
Who cares?

374
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,560
Right, there's a freaky
firefly chick on the loose

375
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,120
with a flame thrower.

376
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,480
Let's start there.

377
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,000
Hallelujah.

378
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
Hello, Butch.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

379
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
I just wanted to check in,
see how things were going.

380
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,360
Any complaints?

381
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
No, sir, I'm fine
like a bottle of wine.

382
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Good.

383
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,440
You have a real future here.

384
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,640
You are a hard worker.
You're loyal to a fault.

385
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Thank you, boss.

386
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,280
If only you were loyal to me.

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,360
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

388
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,080
Come on, Butch, have some dignity.
I know what you're doing.

389
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,920
You're looking for Penguin's
mother, weren't you?

390
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,480
The hand was a nice touch.

391
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,440
Almost fooled me.

392
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,520
How on earth did penguin
gets you to do that?

393
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
I'm his servant.

394
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,440
I have to obey him in all things.

395
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,920
Penguin's done a number on you,
huh?

396
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,600
Tinkered with your wiring.

397
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,280
Perhaps we can help.

398
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,480
Tabi!

399
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,600
Tabi, could you come here please?

400
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,680
Penguin has brainwashed
this poor soul.

401
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,800
- Can we help?
- Be my pleasure.

402
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,160
All right, let's talk about this.

403
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,320
Can we talk about this?

404
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,520
Take it easy. What are you doing?

405
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,560
Relax. I just wanna help.

406
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,640
I'll leave you two to it.

407
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,600
Remember, dinner's in an hour.

408
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,400
We've set up a perimeter.

409
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,760
She can't have gotten far,

410
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,560
and we're sitting
on Selina Kyle's place.

411
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,680
Keep me posted.

412
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,360
Bridget Pike was abused
her whole life.

413
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,920
Forced to set those fires.

414
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,160
I promised my informant
I would keep her safe.

415
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Weren't you the one saying
that Luke Garrett was just a kid?

416
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,760
That we owe him justice?

417
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,120
- I know, that's what I said.
- And you were right

418
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
and now she killed him.

419
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,040
Now she has two more dead bodies
on her.

420
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,200
So, I don't care about the hows
and the whys and the boohoos.

421
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,080
You don't make promises
you can't keep.

422
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,640
You find her, and you take her down.

423
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,000
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.

424
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,280
You must have spent years up here
watching these birds.

425
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,040
Remember when Mickey Slattery
called us orphaned bastards

426
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,880
and we try to throw him off the roof.

427
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,800
The cops are outside my place.

428
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,040
- You need to get out of town.
- I'm not scared of them.

429
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,480
Bridget, I know what you did
to your brothers.

430
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,480
Not that they didn't deserved it
but...

431
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,240
I was surprised.

432
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
Kyle flamed up good,

433
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,800
but it was Joe
who burned the brightest.

434
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,280
You don't sound like yourself.

435
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,960
I'm not myself anymore. I'm free!
Just like you told me I was.

436
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,520
So, what are you gonna do?

437
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,720
I'm gonna go after the rest of them.

438
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
- The rest of who?
- The pervs and the bullies!

439
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,760
The ones who hurt people like us.

440
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,280
No one's ever gone after me
or hurt me.

441
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Yeah. Right.

442
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,360
Rule number one,
look after number one.

443
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,520
That's you!

444
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,840
Don't be crazy
or you'll get yourself killed.

445
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,520
Don't worry about me, Selina.

446
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,440
- This is what I was meant to do.
- Bridgit, please, don't do this.

447
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,080
It's nice to have someone
who cares about me.

448
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,000
Thank you.

449
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,880
I don't care.
I just think you're being dumb.

450
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,960
But, hey...

451
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
good luck.

452
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,040
I'll see you around.

453
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
A toast.

454
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,840
I'm so sorry.

455
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,280
Something came up last minute.

456
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,760
As I was saying...

457
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
To family.

458
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,280
In the end, that's all that matters.

459
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Family.

460
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,160
I hope, in time, you'll come
to think of us as family, Bruce.

461
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
Thank you.

462
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,200
It's... it's been some time
since I had a meal like this.

463
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,520
You mean with girls?

464
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,480
You should come over more often.

465
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,960
We can, like, hang out or whatever.

466
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
I'd like to.

467
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,920
Look how cute they are.

468
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,240
Don't you just wanna eat them?

469
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,160
Tabitha,
leave the young people alone.

470
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,480
Well, they are cute and they know it.

471
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,720
These were the best mashed
potatoes I have ever had.

472
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,040
I swear, I'm gonna get plump.

473
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,920
I like that you have an appetite.

474
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
- Stop it, your spoiling me.
- I won't stop it.

475
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,640
I want nothing more
than to spoil you.

476
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,800
Ed, so forceful.

477
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,640
There's something else
I wanna tell you.

478
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,280
I just... I won't scare you away.

479
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,080
Please, tell me anything.
Do not hold back.

480
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,960
Kristen...

481
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,560
I like you very much.

482
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,280
I... I feel the same way about you.

483
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,600
And...

484
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,760
And?

485
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
Mr. Nygma...

486
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,800
is that your bedroom over there?

487
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,280
You like to see it?

488
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,720
Gordon, phone call for you.

489
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,840
- This is Gordon.
- Do you remember your promise?

490
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Yes.

491
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
I think I know where she's going.

492
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,520
Go, go, go!

493
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Go, go!

494
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,080
Come on. Go! Go!

495
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
All right...

496
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,120
All right. No one gets hurt tonight.

497
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,320
We follow protocols and stay safe.

498
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,840
Yes, sir.

499
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,040
Freeze!

500
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,320
- Hands in the air.
- Hold your fire.

501
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,960
Bridget Pike.

502
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,760
Stay away.

503
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,400
My name is Jim Gordon.

504
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,800
I know what your brothers did to you.

505
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,680
I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

506
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,560
You don't know anything.

507
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,840
You put your weapon down
and come with me.

508
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,680
I can help you.

509
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,280
There are places you can go.

510
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm not going to jail.

511
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,120
You're a juvenile.

512
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,400
We can work something out.

513
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,800
- Wait, wait!
- I said hold your fire.

514
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Bridget!

515
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Stop!

516
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Take cover.

517
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,040
Bridget, wait!

518
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm glad we have a moment alone.

519
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,640
There's something I need to discuss.

520
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,520
An executive at Wayne Enterprises
is been reported missing.

521
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,160
Sid Bunderslaw.

522
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Do you know him?

523
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,320
Yes.

524
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,400
We've met several times.

525
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,160
- What happened?
- No one knows.

526
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,280
But it doesn't look good.

527
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,480
How did you hear?

528
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,320
Let's just say I have friends
in high places

529
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,920
and I've been following the goings-on
at Wayne Enterprises very closely.

530
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,840
What have you learned?

531
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,200
That your father was a good man.

532
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,520
A great man, even.

533
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,840
But in spite of that,
bad things happen at this company.

534
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,360
Unfortunately, I think you're right.

535
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,720
I can tell you're very mature
of your age.

536
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,200
Ready to tackle the problems
of your company head on.

537
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,840
But you'll need help.

538
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,080
Once I'm mayor, I would very much
like to be that person.

539
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Thank you.

540
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,280
Mr. Galavan, I appreciate it.

541
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,160
Butch, what has happened?

542
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
I found your mother.

543
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Where?

544
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
In a warehouse down by the port.

545
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
But they got me looking.

546
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,680
You halfwit!
If they kill my mother...

547
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,080
They don't know I'm here.

548
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,800
And the tiger lady,
she wanted to take her time with me

549
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,040
so she chained me up and I got out.

550
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,960
We gotta go now.

551
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,080
Yes. Yes, yes.

552
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,440
Good, Butch, you've done well.

553
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,800
Your loyalty will be rewarded
handsomely.

554
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,280
I swear it.

555
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,560
- Yes, boss.
- Rest here for a minute

556
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,880
and I'll go gather the troops.

557
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
How old are you?

558
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,040
Old enough to shoot you,
if that's what you are thinking.

559
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,120
No, that's not what I was thinking.

560
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,160
You don't have to point a gun
at me, I'm not gonna hurt you.

561
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,320
Damn right, you're not.

562
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,440
- My name is Lee.
- I know what your name is.

563
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
What's your name?

564
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,840
You're cute, for a doctor.

565
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,200
Thanks, you're cute, for a gangster.

566
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Hi, Selina.

567
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
- Sorry about this, Lee.
- Oh, hey, no problem.

568
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,000
So is Bridget okay?

569
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
I'm sorry.

570
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,240
She's not gonna make it.

571
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,600
- You said that you'll help her.
- I tried, Selina. I tried.

572
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,840
But she didn't wanna go quietly.

573
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,600
I think she wanted it
to end this way.

574
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,520
Look, Selina...

575
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,160
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

576
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,440
I know you were telling the truth
about Bridget.

577
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,760
And her brothers put her up to this.

578
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,360
I need to know who hired them.

579
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,400
I already told you I don't know.

580
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,520
And I still don't believe you.

581
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,960
What do you care?

582
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,280
You don't care about people like us.

583
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,120
It's not like you're really gonna
go after your little friend.

584
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
My friend?

585
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Do you mean Penguin?

586
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,880
Why would he set those fires?

587
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,080
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Ask him yourself.

588
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,680
I'm done talking to you.

589
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,400
I should've never trusted a cop.

590
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,200
I tried to help her,
it just went a different way.

591
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,520
Is that what you call it
when someone dies?

592
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,480
Is that what you tell yourself?

593
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
I'm sorry.

594
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Whatever.

595
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,600
You're so sweet.

596
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,120
Kristen, what's the matter?

597
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
I'm scared.

598
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,840
Of what?

599
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,200
Of Tom Dougherty.

600
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,480
He used to tell me...

601
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,080
if he ever saw me
with another man he would kill me.

602
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,760
I'm terrified of what will happen
when he comes back.

603
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,000
You don't need to worry about that.

604
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,560
You don't know him. He is a monster.

605
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,880
Listen to me.

606
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,680
You do not need to worry
about Tom Dougherty.

607
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,040
You are sweet, but...

608
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,400
you're not a fighter,
you couldn't possibly take him on.

609
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,080
Trust me, it's being taken care of.

610
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,200
What does that mean?

611
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,920
Some time ago,
he and I had an altercation.

612
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,520
I asked him to treat you
with more respect.

613
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,960
- Oh, my God.
- And he said he would treat you

614
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,080
anyway he liked and he assaulted me.

615
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,960
- Oh, my God.
- So anyhow, long story short.

616
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
I killed him.

617
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,520
Oh, man. That's...

618
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,760
You had me going for a minute there.

619
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,680
He was outside of your apartment
under the elevated train.

620
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,160
I stabbed him and he died.

621
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
- Ed, that's not funny.
- I'm not being funny.

622
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,800
T. Dougherty.

623
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Do you believe me now?

624
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,640
Oh, my God.

625
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
What's wrong?

626
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,000
- Where are you going?
- How could you?

627
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,320
- No. Please, sit down.
- Don't touch me!

628
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,480
Would you please let me explain.

629
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,120
There's nothing to explain.
I don't even know who you are.

630
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,320
No, that's wrong. You are a murderer.

631
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,080
He was a monster, you said so.
He was abusing you.

632
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,200
I can't believe I even fell for you.

633
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,040
- You sicko!
- I'm not sick.

634
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,440
I love you. I did it for you.

635
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Everything I ever thought
about you, I was right.

636
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,840
- I should have my head examined.
- Don't say that.

637
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,000
Wait, what were you doing
outside my house?

638
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,280
- I was worried for you.
- You were stalking me.

639
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,760
You are a psychopath!

640
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,960
That is not true.
That's not who I am.

641
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,560
Don't say that about me.

642
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,760
You are going to prison

643
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,920
where they will do horrible
things to you.

644
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,720
- Things that you deserve.
- Don't say that to me.

645
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,000
No. Don't touch me.

646
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,360
- Let go of me, freak!
- Please don't call me that.

647
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Help!

648
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,600
Listen to me.

649
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,000
I am not the man you think I am.

650
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,440
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

651
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,120
I had to kill him because he hit you.

652
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Do you understand that?

653
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,320
I did it for you.

654
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,840
I promise I would never do
anything to hurt you ever again.

655
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
I love you.

656
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,680
I've loved you since
the first moment that I saw you.

657
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
Kristen?

658
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,680
Kristen?

659
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,600
No, no, no.

660
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Oh, don't.

661
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Oh, no.

662
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,600
No, no, no.

663
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,000
Please.

664
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
Please, no.

665
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
No.

666
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,800
No!

667
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,600
No!

668
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,240
Damn, this girl looks rough.

669
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,200
You tell people she's dead.

670
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
Well, that's a lie.

671
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,920
I heard the suit
she was wearing melted to her.

672
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,600
Say she's fireproof.

673
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,680
- Come on.
- Yeah man, fireproof.

674
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,600
That's why they send her down here
with the rest of the monsters.

675
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
For testing.
