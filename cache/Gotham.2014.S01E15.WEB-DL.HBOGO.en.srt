1
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
Hello?

2
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,080
Who are you?

3
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,520
- I'm dreaming, right?
- Oh, I hope so lady.

4
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,000
I sure hope so.

5
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,880
She's nice.

6
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,120
Hell.

7
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,960
What's up with them?

8
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,440
What are they waiting for?

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,240
First man that comes at a new girl

10
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,760
nearly always gets jumped
by the second man.

11
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,000
Is that right?

12
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,160
Here's a promise, boys.

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,520
The first of you to come at me
will die like that.

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,200
The second will die slow.

15
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
So, boys...

16
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
who's first?

17
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,760
- Thank you. That was wonderful.
- Yeah. Taxi.

18
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,760
And no case files.
We didn't mention work once.

19
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
- There's hope for us yet.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,840
So, what is this? Our third date?

21
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,080
I believe that's correct.

22
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,520
Three dates and I still
haven't been to your apartment.

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,280
What particular room of my apartment
are you interested in?

24
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
- I don't know. How's the kitchen?
- Small.

25
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,240
- Living room?
- Dark.

26
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,280
- What about the bedroom?
- The bedroom, I think you'd like.

27
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,240
Yeah? Taxi.

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,680
- But not tonight.
- No?

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,520
I have to get a good night's sleep.
I start a new job in the morning.

30
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,320
A new job? Congratulations.
Since when?

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,280
I heard this morning.

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,680
I didn't wanna spoil dinner
with a big discussion about it.

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,480
Why would it spoil dinner?

34
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,080
I'm coming to work at the GCPD.

35
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,080
I'm you're new medical examiner.

36
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
You're kidding.

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,920
- Wow, that's great.
- Is it?

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,560
Of course. I mean, I was the one
that suggested you work there.

39
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,760
- Yes, but now it's real.
- So? Good.

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,480
We'll see, won't we?

41
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,080
Good night.

42
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,680
Hey. Gennaro Marx, single, 63.
High-school English teacher.

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,560
Same exact surgical incisions
as our last victim.

44
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,480
What are the odds
he's got no adrenal glands?

45
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,640
So, what's he doing with them?

46
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,680
Why?

47
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,080
Help.

48
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,000
- What's the matter with you?
- Help me.

49
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,960
Why won't you help me, Gerald?

50
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Help me.

51
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
Do you have everything you need,
Master Bruce?

52
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,600
Yes.

53
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,240
{\an5}I can still come with you,
if you want me to.

54
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,720
{\an5}No.

55
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,400
{\an5}- It wouldn't be right.
- No, of course.

56
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
{\an5}I'll be fine, Alfred.

57
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,200
{\an5}- You don't have to worry.
- Who said I was worried?

58
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,640
{\an5}I'll be back before dark.

59
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,760
{\an5}I've been on this hike before,
you know?

60
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,080
{\an5}Not without your father.

61
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,520
{\an5}Come here.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
{\an5}He would've approved, you know?

63
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,440
{\an5}Carrying on the tradition like this.

64
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
{\an5}My father and I stayed overnight.

65
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,360
{\an5}We woke up early
to watch the sunrise.

66
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,160
It's not the same.

67
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,680
{\an5}Well, maybe next year then.

68
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,760
Well, off you go then.

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,920
And then, the worst of it.

70
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,960
{\an5}Maroni had me locked inside a sedan
and tried to crush me alive.

71
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,600
{\an5}So, well, you can imagine my concern.

72
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
{\an5}Maroni's not a man to let things go

73
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,200
{\an5}and I fear he will come
after me in retaliation.

74
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,120
{\an5}Were you planning
to clean up the place?

75
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
{\an5}What?

76
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,960
- I can. If you like.
- It needs it.

77
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
Is that blood?

78
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
Perhaps.

79
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,080
{\an5}But Don Falcone...

80
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,840
{\an5}While you're at it, maybe you could
do something about the design.

81
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,640
{\an5}The design?

82
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,840
{\an5}It reeks of Fish Mooney.

83
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,480
{\an5}What do you think about the lamps?

84
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,440
{\an5}Don Falcone,
maybe you didn't hear me.

85
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,320
{\an5}I need your protection.

86
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,440
{\an5}- Maroni will surely try and kill me.
- Yes

87
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,000
{\an5}the lamps should go.

88
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,360
{\an5}Don Falcone, please.

89
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,320
{\an5}Maroni wants my scalp
and you'd have me redecorate.

90
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,040
This nightclub makes a lot of money.

91
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,400
Without money, we lose influence.
Without influence, we lose control.

92
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,320
And without control,
Maroni killing you is no longer

93
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,600
a hypothetical,
it's a foregone conclusion.

94
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,600
That's why I wanna reopen it.

95
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,360
Under your care.

96
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,320
I can have the club?

97
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,960
- It's mine?
- You've earned it.

98
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,680
Your days of sneaking around
spying on Maroni are over.

99
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,600
You're with me now. Publicly.

100
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,040
Things are gonna be much different.
So, spruce up the place. Get it open.

101
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,400
As for Maroni, leave him to me.

102
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
What do you got?

103
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,400
Yearbook
where the victim taught English.

104
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,760
I'll tell you one thing.

105
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,360
Girls didn't look like this
when I was back in high school.

106
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,360
- Easy.
- I'm just saying.

107
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,680
- Hi, Jim.
- Lee. You remember Harvey, right?

108
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,440
- Hi, Lee.
- Hi.

109
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
She's our new ME.

110
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,080
You're joking.

111
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,280
- No.
- Oh, good. You've met.

112
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,160
Detective Gordon
and I know each other.

113
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,760
- Oh, right. From Arkham?
- Right. Arkham.

114
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,840
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

115
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,720
You can fill her in
on your cases later.

116
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,560
Dr. Thompkins, will you follow me?
Lots to get you up to speed on.

117
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,560
It was good to see you again,
detective.

118
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,760
It was really good to see you,
doctor.

119
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,840
You have no luck at all.
Do you, brother?

120
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,400
What do you mean?

121
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,560
You find a fine lady

122
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,200
like that and she comes to work
with you in the same building?

123
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,320
- It's a damn shame.
- Why?

124
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,360
Office romance always
ends in tears. Tears.

125
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,360
- It's not gonna be like that.
- Trust me. I know.

126
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,400
There.

127
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,000
Holy Mother Mary.

128
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,280
- You got him?
- Staring right back at me.

129
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,440
That's him. That's him.
That's the guy from the pool.

130
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,960
His name is Gerald Crane.
He's a biology teacher.

131
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,640
School doesn't let out for hours.
Let's go.

132
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,040
- I'm Kelly.
- Fish.

133
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
- Fish?
- That's what I said. Fish.

134
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,120
So where are we? What is this place?

135
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,320
Some people think it's a prison.
Some think it's hell.

136
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,120
I just think it's cold, mostly.

137
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,080
Breakfast.

138
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,520
No.

139
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,520
You gotta let the boss eat first.

140
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,640
People call him Mace.

141
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,080
He's the one in charge?

142
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,400
Okay. Okay.

143
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,800
Get another one. Get another one.
Go on.

144
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,520
Gerald called in one day
and said he wasn't coming in.

145
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,680
- And that's the last I heard of him.
- Let me guess.

146
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,040
- That was three weeks ago?
- Yeah.

147
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
So the neighbors said
he up and moved out.

148
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Unis searched the place. Nothing.

149
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,240
So, what can you tell us about Crane?

150
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,480
He was a good teacher.

151
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,000
Focused. And a good father.

152
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,120
He was very protective of his son,
Jonathan.

153
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,840
But he could be quiet too. Somber.

154
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,840
Think it had to do with his wife.
She died six or seven years ago.

155
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,880
- She died? How?
- Car accident.

156
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,560
Did Crane ever talk about
fear or phobias?

157
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Why?

158
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,440
Is someone targeting phobics?

159
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,600
Yeah.

160
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,880
- Killing them?
- Does this mean something to you?

161
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,840
These victims, were they missing
their adrenal glands?

162
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,280
How'd you know that?

163
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,520
This was an academic paper
that Gerald wrote a few months ago.

164
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,680
He asked me to proof it for him.

165
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,040
See, Gerald had a theory that fear
was an evolutionary flaw in humans.

166
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,000
That war, rape, theft, murder,
it was all caused by fear.

167
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,160
He was obsessed with it.

168
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,680
So, Crane killed these people and
took their glands to test a theory?

169
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,240
No. Gerald wasn't trying to prove
he was right about fear.

170
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,600
He was trying to cure himself of it.

171
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,680
Crane's idea of curing fear
was to inoculate himself against it.

172
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
- Like a disease?
- Exactly. But in order to do so,

173
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,160
he needed a condensed source
of the hormones that cause fear.

174
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,920
- Phobics.
- Crane's preying on them?

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
Spiking their fear by scaring them
and then killing them in order

176
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
to harvest the hormones?

177
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,040
Damn.

178
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,800
How much of this stuff does he need?

179
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,040
What do you mean?

180
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,280
How many more people
is he gonna kill?

181
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
Oh. Of course. Good question.

182
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,080
Depends on how scared he is, I guess.
What's he scared of?

183
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,520
In Scottie's phobia support group,
he said he was afraid of failure.

184
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Who isn't?
It's gotta be something else.

185
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,040
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

186
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,480
That we got a new medical examiner?
Much better than the old one.

187
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,360
And she smells nice.

188
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
See, Jim? Competition already.

189
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,120
Look at this. Crane developed
protocols for two inoculations.

190
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,560
Himself and somebody else. Subject B.

191
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,600
I wonder who that is.

192
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,960
Dad.

193
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,520
Dad?

194
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,400
You okay?

195
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
I'm glorious.

196
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,080
It's working, Jonathan.

197
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,840
I said it would.

198
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,280
And it's almost your turn.

199
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,000
You will be free of fear forever.

200
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,560
You'll be cured.

201
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Are you ready, Jonathan?
Are you ready, son?

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,440
- Thank you for having me.
- My pleasure.

203
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,840
- We're friends, right?
- Of course.

204
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,480
Well, let me talk to you as a friend.

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,240
You wanna have lunch?
Take a walk? I'm happy to.

206
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,720
But a sandwich and a stroll

207
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,480
ain't gonna keep me
from killing Penguin.

208
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,800
That little rat is dead.

209
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
So be it.

210
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,840
- Mr. Cobblepot, will this do?
- We will not be serving that.

211
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,880
No, no, no.

212
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,480
I said lose the drapes,
not tie them back.

213
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,120
We're opening in ten hours.

214
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,960
- Sorry.
- Hey, boss.

215
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
They're ready.

216
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,800
Still warm from the printer.

217
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,280
Nothing can go wrong tonight, Gabe.

218
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,720
This is more than an opening.
It's my moment.

219
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,280
They're perfect.
Take these to everybody on the list.

220
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,840
But not this one.

221
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,080
This one I wanna deliver in person.

222
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,440
I just want a word. I mean, no harm.

223
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,600
That's close enough.

224
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
No harm?

225
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,720
- So you're the boss in here?
- I am.

226
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,480
Why you?

227
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,520
I see a lot of tough guys
around here.

228
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,800
This is the only blade in the place
and I'm holding it.

229
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,720
Fair enough.

230
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,040
- I wanna make a deal with you.
- A deal?

231
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,200
Yeah.

232
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,000
I think I might have skills
that could be useful to you.

233
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,960
Really?

234
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,320
What skills, exactly?

235
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,400
All kinds.

236
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,560
You protect me from these animals
and I'll show you.

237
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,520
You think you're worth protecting?

238
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,560
You have no idea.

239
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,560
- Can I help you?
- I don't think so. Can you?

240
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,640
What do you want?

241
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,360
What I want, the poor have,

242
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,120
the rich need,
and if you eat it you'll die.

243
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,240
Is this...?
Are you asking me a riddle?

244
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
- Do you like riddles?
- No.

245
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
So, do you give up?

246
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
- Friend, look...
- Nothing.

247
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,920
The answer is nothing.

248
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,200
The poor have it,
the rich need it and if you eat it...

249
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,120
- Who are you?
- Edward Nygma.

250
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,840
I know who you are.

251
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,560
Then you know
that you're standing too close.

252
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Did you know male emperor
penguins keep their eggs warm

253
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,440
by balancing them on their feet?

254
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,080
Isn't that neat?

255
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,520
Nice to meet you, sir.

256
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Keep moving.

257
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,760
Will do.

258
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,920
Cellphone records?
And credit card statements.

259
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,320
- Give me a hand.
- Yeah, sure.

260
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,720
- Give me a minute?
- Take your time.

261
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
- It's good to see you, old friend.
- What are you doing here?

262
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,920
I wanted to invite you to a party
I'm hosting.

263
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,160
No, thanks.

264
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,040
I hear you. Too busy, I suppose.

265
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,480
Are you on a tricky case?
Anything I can help you with?

266
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,120
It worked so well the last time.

267
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,480
I don't want your help.

268
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,200
It was a mistake to ask.

269
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,720
I don't want you coming here.

270
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,320
You shouldn't treat me this way, Jim.

271
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,160
One day soon, you'll need my help.

272
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,680
You'll come to me.

273
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,160
And walking with a friend in the dark

274
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,560
is better than walking
alone in the light.

275
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,440
Good luck with your police work.

276
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,160
And please reconsider my invitation.

277
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,120
It won't be the same without you.

278
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,360
Do you trust me?

279
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,000
Of course.

280
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,880
I love you, son.

281
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,440
I wouldn't do anything to harm you.

282
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,240
Just go. Go ahead.

283
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,080
You're being a very good boy.

284
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,080
Yes, don't struggle. Look at me.
Look in my eyes.

285
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,320
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

286
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,720
- How's your first day going?
- Busy.

287
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Good, good.
I've gotta get back, so...

288
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,440
- Yeah, hey.
- Lee.

289
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,840
- We can't do that here.
- Why?

290
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,280
Last time you kissed me
in the bull pen.

291
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,480
- You weren't working here then.
- That makes a difference to you?

292
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,120
- It's not professional.
- Well, I should hope not.

293
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Lee.

294
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,960
- Hey, Bullock.
- Sorry to interrupt.

295
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,560
What's up?

296
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,120
Nothing that can't wait
on your love life. Just business.

297
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,960
How does a cigar sound?

298
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,640
I've got some beautiful Castros
I've been waiting to try.

299
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,840
Carmine, talk straight with me.

300
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,400
Why you doing this?

301
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,920
Granted, Penguin is a money-maker.

302
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,240
How come you laying all this grease
on me to keep him alive?

303
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,200
- What's your angle?
- He's clever.

304
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,160
And I like to have a clever
man beside me

305
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,480
who knows his place in life.

306
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,640
- You know how that goes.
- Yeah, all day.

307
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,880
He's clever enough to know

308
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,960
that a freakish little man like him
is never going to be the boss.

309
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,560
True enough.

310
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,360
So I'm supposed to give you
a prime asset like that

311
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,200
and you're gonna bring out
some nice old cigars?

312
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,080
Of course, I'll show my gratitude
to you in a more formal way.

313
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,840
This is not a money thing.

314
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,880
- This is personal.
- I understand.

315
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,200
Do you know Chief Judge
Stanley Turnbull?

316
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,400
Of course.

317
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,160
He's the meanest son-of-a-mother
bitch in the courthouse.

318
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,840
Yes. A hard and righteous man.

319
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,360
- Powerful too.
- Put down some good friends of mine.

320
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,560
You bring me his ugly head and say,

321
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,640
200 grand and you got a deal.

322
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,480
Oh, I'll give you a better deal
than his head.

323
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,080
On my mother's life.

324
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,840
Judge Turnbull.

325
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,760
He was out with the young man.

326
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,680
- I had him drugged and brought here.
- Now he's all yours.

327
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,400
Mine?

328
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,360
I mean, we'll share him, of course.

329
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,400
But in spirit, he's yours.

330
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
Now smile for the camera.

331
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,960
It's beautiful.

332
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,360
We must be missing something.

333
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,880
What about your pal, Penguin?

334
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
What about him?

335
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,600
He helped us with Flass.
Maybe he'll help us with Crane.

336
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,080
- No. I'm not going back to him.
- It's worth a try.

337
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
No, it's not.

338
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,760
Then we wait for another
body to drop.

339
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,600
Because we're not gonna
find him here.

340
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,880
Yeah, you're right.

341
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,000
We're never gonna be
able to track Crane.

342
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,200
We gotta get ahead of him
by finding out what's driving him.

343
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,800
We know what's driving him.

344
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,760
- He's obsessed with fear.
- Yeah, but why?

345
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
What's he afraid of?

346
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,320
What happened to him
that made him this way?

347
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,760
His wife was killed in a car crash.

348
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,920
Yeah. Let's check that out.

349
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,600
- Got it. Karen Crane.
- Yeah.

350
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,800
Says here she died in a house fire,
not a car accident.

351
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,760
You think the coworker was lying?

352
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,560
Three other people
said the same thing.

353
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,320
Crane must've lied about it
for some reason.

354
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,560
What happened in the fire?

355
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,160
Article says she was sleeping
upstairs when the fire broke out.

356
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,000
Her husband, Gerald, and son,
Jonathan, eight, were downstairs.

357
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,360
Crane was in the house
when his wife died?

358
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,200
And didn't save her.
No wonder he lied.

359
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,720
He's ashamed.

360
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,840
His fear is the reason his wife died.
That's why he's doing this.

361
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Address for the old Crane house.
Let's go.

362
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,400
KILLED IN LATE NIGHT

363
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,280
Jonathan.

364
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Jonathan.

365
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,720
Stop, Johnny. Stop! Stop there!

366
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,160
We've started the protocol.

367
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,040
It must be completed.
It will be harmful for you otherwise.

368
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,840
- I can't... I can't do it again.
- Think of it, Johnny. No more fear.

369
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,560
- I'm not even afraid like you.
- We're all afraid.

370
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,400
Every man and woman on the planet.

371
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,920
We're all standing at the edge
of the abyss, paralyzed by fear.

372
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,680
Now, come on, son. Trust me.
I just want to help you. And mankind.

373
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,920
Mankind, Johnny.
Now, you must be brave.

374
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,800
Come on, son. Are you with me?

375
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,080
Then let's go back to the house.

376
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,400
It'll all be over before you know it.
I promise.

377
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,720
Come on.

378
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,800
What's up, doc?

379
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,680
The name's Mace.

380
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,480
That's cute but I like to give
my friends nicknames.

381
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,280
And yours is "doc"

382
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,200
because you have such a wise look
in your eyes for such a big man.

383
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,640
A real little firecracker?

384
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,360
A firecracker goes off once
and then just lies there.

385
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,600
What you're looking at
is the Fourth of July.

386
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,960
Come sit by me.

387
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,800
- Does that mean we have a deal?
- Sure, baby.

388
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,920
While I have a couple of riders
I would like to talk to...

389
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,960
Hush now, baby.

390
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,440
You talk too much
and you'll make me mad.

391
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,640
Let's see.

392
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,240
That's rider number one.

393
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,200
Don't call me baby.

394
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,320
My name is Fish Mooney.

395
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,760
I'm in charge now.

396
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,600
- GCPD.
- No, no, no.

397
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,960
Dad, come on, we have to go now.

398
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,120
GCPD.

399
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,440
Dad, they're going to arrest you
once they come in. We have to go.

400
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,760
There's time.
We can complete the protocol.

401
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Coming in.

402
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
- What are you doing?
- We have to finish the protocol.

403
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,480
- It's the only way.
- Dad, that's too much.

404
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,120
It's the only way.

405
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,200
No, Dad.

406
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,160
There's not enough time.

407
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,800
It'll be fine.

408
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,080
- I love you, son.
- Stop.

409
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,720
Hands where we can see them!

410
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,000
Hands in the air or we'll shoot.

411
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,000
- You think I'm afraid of you?
- Not another step.

412
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,680
Afraid of your guns?

413
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,720
I have no fear.

414
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,520
You take him. I get the kid.

415
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,080
Call an ambulance.

416
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,440
Call an ambulance.

417
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,320
It's all right, son. It's all right!

418
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,600
Hello there, Master Bruce.

419
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
Well, you certainly took your time.

420
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,960
What, you stop off for a pie
and a pint on the way up, did you?

421
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,720
How long have you been there?

422
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,680
I don't know. About an hour.

423
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,360
Just when you were started
climbing up that really nasty hill.

424
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,280
Well, thanks for your help.

425
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,960
Yeah, I never got you down there,
did I?

426
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,440
Are you all right?

427
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,000
Come here.

428
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,920
I'm cold, I'm tired
and my ankle's sprained.

429
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,640
I just wanna go home.

430
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,040
You wanna go home?

431
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,200
Or do you wanna wait
and watch the sunrise?

432
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,760
Like you did with your dad?

433
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,360
Well, Alfred, you can only stay
if you think you can handle it.

434
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,040
If I can handle it?

435
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,520
Mate, this place is positively
cushy compared

436
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,280
to some of the places I've slept at.

437
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,120
Cup of tea, you cheeky monkey?

438
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,880
<i>No more heroes anymore
No more heroes anymore</i>

439
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,040
<i>No more heroes anymore
No more heroes anymore</i>

440
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,200
<i>No more heroes anymore
No more heroes anymore</i>

441
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,680
<i>No more heroes anymore
No more heroes anymore</i>

442
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Penguin.

443
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,800
Where you going?

444
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,080
Don Maroni.

445
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,120
It's such a pleasure to see you.

446
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,920
Look at you.

447
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,320
From the trunk of my car
to running your own club.

448
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,760
The place looks good, Penguin.

449
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,120
- Hell of a turnout.
- Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,200
How about a table? Drinks?
My compliments, of course.

451
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,320
Expensive stuff. Let me see.

452
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,360
I had a little chat with Falcone.

453
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,600
I came here to let you know
that all is kosher between us.

454
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,320
As long as you don't go giving
Falcone any more of my secrets.

455
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,640
No.

456
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Nothing like that.

457
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,400
Of course not. Grab a glass.

458
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,880
You better hope that old man
Falcone lives a long life.

459
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,680
Because the second
he's out of the picture, so are you.

460
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,840
Master B.

461
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,040
Sunrise.

462
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,520
Oh, hey. How are you?
I heard your suspect was killed.

463
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,920
He came after Harvey
and me with a gun.

464
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,120
- We didn't have a choice.
- I'm so sorry. What about his son?

465
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,440
Paramedics were able
to stabilize him.

466
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,120
I'm heading to the hospital
to check in on him.

467
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,360
- Well, let me know how he is.
- I will.

468
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,360
So settled in here?

469
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,680
Almost.

470
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,280
- Think you're gonna like it here?
- I do, so far.

471
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,960
Good.

472
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,040
I have tickets to the circus.
Do you wanna come with me?

473
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,800
- The circus?
- Yeah, they're good.

474
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,280
No sad elephants.

475
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,960
Circus, sure. Why not? Look, Lee...

476
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,880
No kissing here on the job, okay?
I'm serious.

477
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,760
- Okay.
- Okay?

478
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,400
If your hard-ass reputation
is worth that much to you.

479
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,960
- This is a place of work.
- Cops have feelings too.

480
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
It's not unprofessional
to show your feelings.

481
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,960
Yeah, it is.
Those kinds of feelings. Yeah.

482
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,440
- Fine. Be that way.
- Hey.

483
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm just joking. I'll be discreet.

484
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,840
All right, everyone, gather around.

485
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,920
Up until now,
there's been no order in here.

486
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,480
No structure.

487
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,360
Things are gonna change.

488
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,920
She's back.

489
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,520
My eyes.

490
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,040
They took my eyes.

491
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,080
The boy received a massive dose
of condensed hormones.

492
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,120
Cortisol, adrenalin
and another compound

493
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,680
we're still trying to identify.

494
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,360
The combination nearly killed him.

495
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,680
But he's gonna live?

496
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,120
Yes.

497
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,120
But we ran a CAT scan
in order to determine

498
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,720
if he suffered any brain damage.

499
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,760
The results, we've never seen
anything like them before.

500
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
The hormones themselves
have long since worn off.

501
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,440
But the effects,
they seem to be lingering.

502
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,800
What are you saying?
That he's still in fear?

503
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,280
Well, not just fear.

504
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,280
Jonathan's brain activity shows

505
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,640
he's in a constant state
of intense terror.

506
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,920
How long until this goes away?

507
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,200
Well, that's just the thing,
detective.

508
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,000
We can't be certain it ever will.

509
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,680
Imagine the thing you fear
most in the world.

510
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,840
Imagine that's all you see.

511
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,080
Every waking hour.

512
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,760
No. No. No!
