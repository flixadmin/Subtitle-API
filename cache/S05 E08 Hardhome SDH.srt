1
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,630
Your grace, I want to say...

2
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,089
You will not speak.

3
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,677
How do I know you are who you say you are?

4
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,305
If only I were otherwise.

5
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,308
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

6
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,977
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

7
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,563
You want revenge against the lannisters?

8
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,150
I killed my mother, Joanna Lannister,
on the day I was born.

9
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,820
I killed my father, tywin Lannister,
with a bolt to the heart.

10
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,740
I am the greatest
Lannister killer of our time.

11
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,992
So I should welcome you into my service

12
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,203
because you murdered members
of your own family?

13
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,456
Into your service?

14
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,584
We have only just met.

15
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,379
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

16
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,466
If you'd rather return to the
fighting pits, just say the word.

17
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,055
When I was a young man, I heard a story

18
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,974
about a baby born
during the worst storm in living memory.

19
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,479
She had no wealth, no lands, no army,
only a name

20
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,065
and a handful of supporters,
most of whom probably thought

21
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,859
they could use that name
to benefit themselves.

22
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,445
They kept her alive,
moving her from place to place,

23
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,407
often hours ahead
of the men who'd been sent to kill her.

24
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,785
She was eventually sold off to some warlord
on the edge of the world

25
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,662
and that appeared to be that.

26
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:28,333
Then, a few years later,
the most well-informed person I knew

27
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,253
told me that this girl
without wealth, lands, or armies

28
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,715
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

29
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,550
along with three dragons.

30
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,846
He thought she was our best,
last chance to build a better world.

31
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,642
I thought you were worth meeting,
at the very least.

32
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,394
And why are you worth meeting?

33
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,396
Why should I spend
my time listening to you?

34
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,149
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

35
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,069
You have no one at your side
who understands the land you want to rule,

36
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,132
the strengths and weaknesses of the houses
that will eitherjoin or oppose you.

37
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,324
I will have a very large army.

38
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,577
And very large dragons.

39
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,163
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

40
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,417
When I served as hand of the king,
I did quite well with the latter,

41
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,793
considering the king in question

42
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,172
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

43
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,176
I could do an even betterjob
advising a ruler worth the name.

44
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,636
If that is indeed what you are.

45
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,306
So you want to advise me?

46
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,185
Very well.

47
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,521
What would you have me do with him?

48
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,401
I swore I would kill
him if he ever returned.

49
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,779
I know.

50
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,952
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

51
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,250
Whomever ser jorah was
when he started informing on you,

52
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,169
he is no longer that man.

53
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,774
I can't remember ever seeing a sane man
as devoted to anything

54
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,508
as he is to serving you.

55
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,594
He claims he would kill for you
and die for you

56
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,680
and nothing I have witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.

57
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,561
And yet he did betray you.

58
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,827
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

59
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,245
Yes.

60
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,081
Many opportunities.

61
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,751
Tyrion: And did he?
Daenerys: No.

62
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,088
Not until forced to do so.

63
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,178
He worships you.

64
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,542
He is in love with you, I think.

65
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,016
But he did not trust you with the truth.

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,436
An unpleasant truth to be sure,
but one of great significance to you.

67
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,524
He did not trust that you
would be wise enough to forgive him.

68
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,485
So I should kill him?

69
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:05,824
A ruler who kills those devoted to her
is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

70
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,661
And you're going to need
to inspire devotion, a lot of it,

71
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,706
if you're ever going to rule
across the narrow sea.

72
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,502
But you cannot have him by your side
when you do.

73
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,801
Remove ser jorah from the city.

74
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,319
(Door slams)

75
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,707
Confess.

76
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,085
My son...

77
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,338
Let me speak to...

78
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,548
Confess.

79
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,841
I meant it.

80
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,928
My face will be the last thing you see...

81
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,478
(Door opens)

82
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,732
(Sobbing)

83
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,486
(Screams)

84
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,740
My name is lanna. I'm an orphan.

85
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,871
When I was eight, I begged enough money
to buy my first bucket of oysters.

86
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,833
I sold that bucket and made enough money
to buy two more.

87
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,294
(People chattering)

88
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,088
Arya: It took a while,

89
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,591
but I finally saved enough
to buy myself an oyster cart.

90
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,846
Now every morning,
I make my way down to the canals.

91
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,851
I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.

92
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,607
I usually see lhara,

93
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,318
my first customer of the day,
on her way home.

94
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,574
Then I turn left onto moonsinger Lane...

95
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:59,581
Turn left onto ragman Lane,
where I do most of my trade.

96
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,958
Lanna is very impressive.

97
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,793
Very industrious.

98
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,297
She will make a fine servant
for the many-faced god.

99
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,466
How will she serve him?

100
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,302
She will no longer
turn left onto ragman Lane.

101
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,722
She will turn right and
go to ragman harbor.

102
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,015
What will she do there?

103
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,725
She will see.

104
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,478
- (People chattering)
- Arya: See what?

105
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,564
Jaqen: How can a man tell a girl this?

106
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,901
If he knew what she would see,
there would be no reason to send her.

107
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,987
Oysters, clams and cookies!

108
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,493
(Laughs)

109
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,341
Oysters, clams and cookies!

110
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,601
Oysters, clams and cookies!

111
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,270
Your oysters fresh?

112
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,524
Best in the city.

113
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,484
You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you?

114
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,706
Mmm.

115
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,253
Very nice. Give me four with vinegar.

116
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,133
It's my 18th voyage.

117
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,761
Returned from all of them
without a scratch on me.

118
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,561
Can't do it.

119
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,398
Captain: Please, I've three children.
Without me...

120
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,235
Here, take it. You have
to. I've three children.

121
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,653
- What will they do?
- Come on.

122
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,488
Captain: They've nothing without me.

123
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,198
Please, you have to!

124
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,492
Please, you don't understand!

125
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,627
Jaqen: The man is a gambler.

126
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,507
He wagers that a sailor's ship
will make it to its destination.

127
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,344
It is a strange wager for the captain.

128
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,513
He only wins if he loses his life.

129
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,852
So why would a captain
make the wager in the first place?

130
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,606
A girl tells a man that she has seen.

131
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,236
If the captain dies,

132
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,322
the thin man pays his
family a lot of money.

133
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,827
But perhaps the gambler loses his bet

134
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,079
and decides he does
not have to pay after all.

135
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:49,125
A destitute woman and her small child,
what can they do to such a man

136
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,711
if he keeps their money for himself?

137
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,049
To whom can they turn for recourse?

138
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,467
(Whispering prayer)

139
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,473
The many-faced god.

140
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,828
You said you didn't know
what I would see at the docks.

141
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,481
A man had no idea what a girl would see
and what she would not.

142
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,402
A girl named lanna
will return to the docks.

143
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,862
She will watch the gambler.

144
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,115
She will come to know as much about him
as she knows about herself.

145
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,450
And then what?

146
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,913
A gift for the thin man.

147
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,643
She's not ready.

148
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,021
Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.

149
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,856
And if she's not?

150
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,694
It is all the same to the many-faced god.

151
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,454
(Door u n locks)

152
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,880
(Door locks)

153
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,552
The trial will take place soon.

154
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,848
The high sparrow will be presenting
a substantial case against you.

155
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,016
The charges?

156
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,936
Fornication, treason, incest,
the murder of king Robert.

157
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,647
- All lies.
- Of course.

158
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:43,406
My concern is that the
faith does not adhere

159
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,160
to the same standards
of proof as the crown.

160
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:51,664
I hope you'll excuse me for saying it,
but belief is so often the death of reason.

161
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,791
I wish you had said it sooner.

162
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,670
Is there any word from Jaime?

163
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,006
No, I'm afraid not.

164
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,474
Grand maester pycelle

165
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,187
has summoned your uncle kevan
back from casterly rock

166
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,938
to serve as hand of the king.

167
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,566
He now presides over the small council.

168
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,362
Tell him I need to speak to him.

169
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,739
I implored him to visit
you, but he would not.

170
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,120
What about my son, the king?

171
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,374
If you can visit me,
then surely the king...

172
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,709
Your arrest and queen margaery's arrest...

173
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,211
The king has not taken them well.

174
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,046
He remains in his chambers.

175
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,257
His servants often find his food
in the hall, left untouched.

176
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,551
You need to talk to him.

177
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,780
You need to talk to my son
and tell him to come and see me,

178
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,971
come and see his mother.

179
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,725
He... I tried. He wouldn't see me.

180
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,519
He won't see anyone.

181
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,271
I can't stay here.

182
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,609
There is a way.

183
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,948
A way out.

184
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,618
Confess?

185
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,206
To the high sparrow? I won't.

186
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,084
I made him.

187
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,254
I Rose him up from nothing.

188
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,006
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

189
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,716
and beg his forgiveness.

190
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,351
Good bye.

191
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,521
The work continues.

192
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,896
Why, theon?

193
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,232
Not theon. There is no theon.

194
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,650
- Reek.
- Reek.

195
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,986
Why did you tell him, reek?

196
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,072
I was helping you.

197
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,033
You wanted to escape.

198
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,743
There is no escape.

199
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,370
Not ever.

200
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,582
Theon greyjoy tried to escape.

201
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,919
The master knew.

202
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,421
He knows everything.

203
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,426
He hunted him and caught him
and strapped him to a cross

204
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,598
and cutaway piece after piece
until there was no theon left.

205
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,521
Good.

206
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,944
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

207
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,696
If I could do what ramsay did to you

208
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,950
right here, right now, I would.

209
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,498
I deserved everything.

210
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,460
I deserve to be reek.

211
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,797
I did terrible things.

212
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,634
Turned on robb.

213
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,262
Captured winterfell.

214
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,765
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

215
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,101
They were bran and rickon.
They were your brothers.

216
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,727
You'd known them since they were born.

217
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,187
They weren't. They were only...

218
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,313
Only what?

219
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,024
- I can't.
- Tell me.

220
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,568
I can't, not unless the master says.

221
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,878
- Tell me. They weren't what?
- They weren't...

222
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,282
Tell me why bran and rickon should be gone
while you still breathe the air.

223
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,410
Tell me to my face, theon.
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

224
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,995
They weren't bran and rickon!

225
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,957
I couldn't find them.

226
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,674
It was two farm boys.

227
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,806
I killed them and burned them
so no one would know.

228
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,895
You didn't...

229
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,616
Do you know where they went,
bran and rickon?

230
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,710
I can't talk to you anymore.

231
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,111
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where...

232
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,363
Not theon! Reek!

233
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,658
(Door slams)

234
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,164
Our scouts tell us
he's got no more than 6,000 men.

235
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,166
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

236
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,460
And how high do Stannis' horses jump?

237
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,381
Our walls have been fully repaired.
The gates have been reinforced.

238
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,676
We have enough food for six months.

239
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,804
We are more prepared for a siege
than they could ever be.

240
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:05,227
All we have to do is wait for them
to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

241
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,649
You disagree?

242
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,194
Stannis isn't from the
north. You are, father.

243
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:17,156
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the north

244
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,950
how house Bolton treats southern invaders.

245
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,160
And what do you recommend?

246
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,971
That we not sit and
wait for Stannis to decide

247
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,122
what sort of fight this is going to be.

248
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:29,335
That we hit first and hit hard
and leave a feast for the crows.

249
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,463
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

250
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,175
As long as we stay behind these walls,
they can't touch us.

251
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,927
Not to mention that the snow is so deep,

252
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,097
we couldn't get an army through
to engage them even if we wanted to.

253
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,015
I don't need an army.

254
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,976
I need 20 good men.

255
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,861
So, have you decided yet?

256
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,114
Whether I'm worthy of your service?

257
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,869
Have you decided yet
whether you're going to have me killed?

258
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,871
It's probably my safest option.

259
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,793
I could see why you would think so.

260
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,295
It's what your father would have done.

261
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,860
And what would your father have done?

262
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:22,096
My father, who publically
sentenced me to death?

263
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,599
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

264
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,809
Is that why you killed him?

265
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,274
Someday, if you decide not to execute me,

266
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,026
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

267
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,529
And on that day, should it ever come,

268
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,449
we'll need more wine than this.

269
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,244
I know what my father was.

270
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,788
What he did.

271
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,875
I know the mad king earned his name.

272
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,380
So, here we sit.

273
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,842
Two terrible children
of two terrible fathers.

274
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,594
I'm terrible?

275
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,012
I've heard stories.

276
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,240
Why did you travel to
the far side of the world

277
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,099
to meet someone terrible?

278
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,101
To see if you were
the right kind of terrible.

279
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,269
Which kind is that?

280
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,314
The kind that prevents your people
from being even more so.

281
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,026
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

282
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,904
Under my rule, murder will once again
become entertainment.

283
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,822
Yes, that was wise.

284
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,075
And you agreed to marry someone you loathe
for the greater good.

285
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,243
Very impressive.

286
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,831
My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,

287
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,082
though not by choice,

288
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,294
and certainly not for the greater good,
gods forbid.

289
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,754
She ended up having him killed.

290
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,217
Perhaps it won't come to that.

291
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,727
It's not impossible that varys was right
about you after all.

292
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,814
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

293
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,399
Yes, he's the one who convinced me
to come find you.

294
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,488
He was my traveling companion, before
ser jorah seized that role for himself.

295
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,698
Jorah sent my secrets to varys.

296
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,078
For 20 years, the spider
oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

297
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,831
He did what he had to do to survive.

298
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,000
He did a lot of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

299
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,712
I suspect he's the main reason
you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

300
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,132
- But you trust him?
- Yes, oddly.

301
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,094
He may be the only
person in the world I trust.

302
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,471
Except my brother.

303
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,849
The brother who killed my father?

304
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,559
That's the one.

305
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,519
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

306
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,104
Your queenly prerogative.

307
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,775
I had given up on life

308
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,279
until varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

309
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:48,033
You chop off my head, well,
my final days were interesting.

310
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,417
I'm not going to kill you.

311
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,464
- Banish me?
- No.

312
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,010
So if I'm not going to be murdered
and I'm not going to be banished...

313
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,595
You're going to advise me.

314
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,724
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

315
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,647
- Advise you on what?
- How to get what I want.

316
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,482
The iron throne.

317
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,236
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

318
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,906
If I wantjokes, I'll get
myself a proper fool.

319
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,991
I'm not entirelyjoking.

320
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,827
There's more to the world than Westeros.

321
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:36,040
How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

322
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,585
Perhaps this is where you belong,
where you can do the most good.

323
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,715
I fought so that no child
born into slaver's bay

324
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,843
would ever know what it meant
to be bought or sold.

325
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,804
I will continue that fight here and beyond.

326
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,307
But this is not my home.

327
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,101
When you get back to your home,
who supports you?

328
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,686
The common people.

329
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,397
Let's be generous
and assume that's going to happen.

330
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,667
Here in slaver's bay,
you had the support of the common people

331
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,902
and only the common people.

332
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,028
What was that like?

333
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,614
Ruling without the rich?

334
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,492
House Targaryen is gone.

335
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,495
Not a single person who shares your blood
is alive to support you.

336
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:18,290
The starks are gone as well.
Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

337
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:22,086
The remaining members of house Lannister
will never back you, not ever.

338
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,755
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

339
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,050
His entire claim to the throne rests on
the illegitimacy of yours.

340
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,969
That leaves the tyrells.

341
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,387
Not impossible.

342
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,638
Not enough.

343
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,183
Lannister, Targaryen,
Baratheon, stark, Tyrell.

344
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,269
They're all just spokes on a wheel.

345
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,188
This one's on top, then that one's on top.

346
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:45,526
And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

347
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,570
It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.

348
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,241
You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

349
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,244
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

350
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,039
I'm going to break the wheel.

351
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,837
(Grunting)

352
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,096
(Whistles)

353
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:25,607
You said whoever wins will fight
at the great pit in front of the queen.

354
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,942
I won.

355
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,527
You struck me.

356
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,863
Have me flogged if it makes you happy.

357
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,157
But I'm the best you've got.

358
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,243
If I win at the great pit,

359
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,787
how much can you sell me for?

360
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,877
You're a free man.
You could have gone anywhere.

361
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,212
Why did you come back?

362
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,721
Let me fight for her and I belong to you.

363
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,103
Woman: Thirsty?

364
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,856
Confess.

365
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,988
I'll get out of here before long.

366
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,073
Confess.

367
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,492
I can make you a wealthy woman.

368
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,244
A lady of the court.

369
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,662
Confess.

370
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,254
Or I can make sure you die
in the most hideous way imaginable.

371
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:33,967
And all I do is sit here
imagining hideous ways for you to die.

372
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,355
(Door opens)

373
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,233
- (Door closes)
- (Latch locks)

374
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,286
(Slurping)

375
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,390
Does it hurt?

376
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,562
Good.

377
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,067
How are you?

378
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,446
I'm not the one who got punched
and kicked in the face.

379
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,408
You know what I mean.

380
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,245
I'm good.

381
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,289
Are you scared?

382
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,749
- A little.
- Me, too.

383
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,587
(Knocks on door)

384
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,339
- Who's there?
- Olly.

385
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,051
Come in.

386
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,764
I heard what happened.

387
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,601
Oh, not to worry.

388
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,937
Men brawl from time
to time. It's only natural.

389
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,983
Figured you were hungry.

390
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,361
Oh, you're a good lad.

391
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:22,075
Wanted to ask you something
if you've got the time.

392
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,453
I need to check on baby Sam.

393
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,044
(Door closes)

394
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,047
Samwell: Now then, how can I help?

395
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,759
- It's about the lord commander.
- Yes?

396
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,054
He's going up to hardhome
to save all them wildlings.

397
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,391
Wildlings killed my mum and dad.

398
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,437
- They killed everyone in my village.
- We've been fighting them for years.

399
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,189
This wasn't a fight.

400
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,024
We were farmers.

401
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,651
They slaughtered us.

402
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,528
So why is he saving them?

403
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,114
Wildlings are people.

404
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,618
Just like us, there are good ones
and bad ones.

405
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,038
The one he's traveling with,
with the red beard,

406
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,582
he led the raid on my village.

407
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,334
- Oh, olly...
- How can he trust him?

408
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,505
I've seen the army of the dead.

409
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,883
I've seen the white walkers.

410
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,928
And they're coming
for us, for all the living.

411
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,682
And when it's time,

412
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,519
we'll need every last man we can find.

413
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,772
But what if we let the wildlings
through the gates

414
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,649
and they cut our throats while we sleep?

415
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,527
Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.

416
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,821
We don't stand a chance othennise.

417
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,741
Sometimes, a man has to make hard choices,

418
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,660
choices that might look wrong to others,

419
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,538
but you know are right in the long run.

420
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,456
You believe that?

421
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,375
With all my heart.

422
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,301
Try not to worry.

423
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,678
I've been worrying about Jon for years.

424
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,264
He always comes back.

425
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,396
(Wind howling)

426
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,124
(Men grunting)

427
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,433
Ranger: Watch your bow!

428
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,051
You trust me, Jon snow?

429
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,346
Does that make me a fool?

430
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,473
We're fools together now.

431
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,148
(Man whistles)

432
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,241
Lord of bones.

433
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,161
Been a long time.

434
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,123
Last time I saw you,
the little crow was your prisoner.

435
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,542
The other way around now. What happened?

436
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,252
War.

437
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,921
You call that a war?

438
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,298
The greatest army the north has ever seen

439
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,260
cut to pieces by some southern king.

440
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,095
We should gather the elders,

441
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,514
find somewhere quiet to talk.

442
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,224
You don't give the orders here.

443
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,268
I'm not giving an order.

444
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,855
Why aren't you in chains?

445
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,607
He's not my prisoner.

446
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,445
What is he?

447
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,071
We're allies.

448
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,242
You fucking traitor.

449
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,706
You fight for the crows now?

450
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,043
I don't fight for the crows.

451
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,965
We're not here to
fight. We're here to talk.

452
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,384
Is that right?

453
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,971
You and the pretty crow
do a lot of talking, tormund?

454
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,931
And when you're done talking,

455
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,684
do you get down on your knees
and suck his cock?

456
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,769
(Grunting)

457
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,161
Gather the elders, and let's talk.

458
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,020
(Man coughs)

459
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,105
My name's Jon snow.

460
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,318
I'm lord commander of the night's watch.

461
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,490
We're not friends.

462
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,159
We've never been friends.

463
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,454
We won't become friends today.

464
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,874
This isn't about friendship.

465
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,045
This is about survival.

466
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,005
This is about putting a 700-foot wall

467
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,216
between you and what's out there.

468
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,385
You built that wall to keep us out.

469
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,388
Since when do the crows give two shits
if we live?

470
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,558
Jon: In normal times we wouldn't,
but these aren't normal times.

471
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,894
The white walkers don't care
if a man's free folk or crow.

472
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,064
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

473
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,275
But together, we can beat them.

474
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,985
Beat the white walkers?

475
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,154
Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.

476
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,833
It's not a trick.

477
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,839
It's a gift, for those who join us.

478
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,345
Dragonglass.

479
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,473
A man of the night's watch

480
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,226
used one of these daggers to kill a Walker.

481
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,812
- You saw this?
- Jon: No.

482
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,939
But I trust the man.

483
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,525
There are old stories about dragonglass.

484
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,195
There are old stories
about ice spiders big as hounds.

485
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,489
And with the things we've seen,
you don't believe them?

486
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,200
Jon: Come with me
and I'll share these weapons.

487
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,785
Come with you where?

488
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,629
Jon: There are good
lands south of the wall.

489
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,515
The night's watch
will let you through the tunnel

490
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,916
and allow your people to farm those lands.

491
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,835
(Murmuring)

492
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,047
I knew mance rayder.

493
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,150
He never wanted a war
with the night's watch.

494
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,760
He wanted a new life
for his people, for you.

495
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,262
We're prepared to give you that new life.

496
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,721
If?

497
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,725
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

498
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,229
Where is mance?

499
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,902
- He died.
- How?

500
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,019
I put an arrow through his heart.

501
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,744
(Wildlings shouting)

502
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,953
Tormund: Hey.

503
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,914
Hey.

504
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,542
Hey.

505
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:13,046
Loboda: I say we send the lord commander
back to castle black.

506
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,506
With no eyes.

507
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,094
Hey, none of you saw mance die.

508
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,054
I did.

509
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,307
The southern king,
who broke our army, Stannis,

510
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,185
wanted to burn him alive to
send us a message.

511
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,729
Jon snow defied that cunt's orders.

512
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,149
His arrow was mercy.

513
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,777
What he did took courage.

514
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,362
And that's what we need today,

515
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,950
the courage to make peace with
men we've been killing for generations.

516
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,913
I lost my father, my uncle, and
two brothers fighting the damn crows.

517
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,790
I'm not asking you to forget your dead.

518
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,293
I'll never forget mine.

519
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,924
I lost 50 brothers the night that mance
attacked the wall.

520
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,719
But I'm asking you

521
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,680
to think about your children now.

522
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:09,310
They'll never have children of their own
if we don't band together.

523
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,689
The long night is coming,

524
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,607
and the dead come with it.

525
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,360
No clan can stop them.

526
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,070
The free folk can't stop them.

527
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,530
The night's watch can't stop them.

528
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,950
And all the southern kings can't stop them.

529
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,161
Only together...

530
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,912
All of us.

531
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,436
And even then, it may not be enough.

532
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,167
But at least we'll give
the fuckers a fight.

533
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,350
You vouch for this man, tormund?

534
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,647
He's prettier than both my daughters,

535
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,942
but he knows how to fight.

536
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,653
He's young, but he knows how to lead.

537
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,782
He didn't have to come to hardhome.

538
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,534
He came because he needs us.

539
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,205
And we need him.

540
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,170
My ancestors would spit on me
if I broke bread with a crow.

541
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,757
So would mine, but fuck 'em. They're dead.

542
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,265
(Sighs)

543
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,061
I'll never trust a man in black.

544
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,150
But I trust you, tormund.

545
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,319
If you say this is the way,

546
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,531
we're with you.

547
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,452
This is the way.

548
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,246
(Murmuring)

549
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,248
Elder: I'm with tormund.

550
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,500
We stay here, we're dead men.

551
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,338
At least with king crow, there's a chance.

552
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,923
(Giant growls)

553
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,010
Tormund.

554
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,850
Keep that new life you want to give us.

555
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,188
And keep your glass, king crow.

556
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:23,194
As soon as you get on his ships,
they're gonna slit your throats,

557
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,614
and dump your bodies
to the bottom of the shivering sea.

558
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,993
That's our enemy.

559
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,080
That has always been our enemy.

560
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,639
I fucking hate thenns.

561
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,817
(Chatter)

562
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,828
Man 1: Move it.
Woman: Be careful.

563
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,432
Man 2: Move 'em along, now.
Man 3: We'll catch the tides.

564
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,166
That's it, come on!

565
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,463
How many are with us? Five thousand?

566
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,340
I'm not good at counting.

567
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,343
We're leaving too many behind.

568
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,761
The free folk are stubborn.

569
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,639
You know how long it took mance
to band them together?

570
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,974
Twenty fucking years.

571
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,352
And he knew them better than I ever will.

572
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:42,398
They're running out of food,
and there's nothing to hunt.

573
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,983
They'll come around.

574
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,863
Jon: Get yourselves ready.
Man 4: Aye!

575
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,115
Johnna is gonna look after you.

576
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,785
She's in charge. You listen to her.

577
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,537
Man 5: Take her.

578
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,123
I want to go with you.

579
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,876
I need to get the old folks on the boats.

580
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,920
I'm right behind you. I promise.

581
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,217
Go on.

582
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,720
Man 6: Another one.

583
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,640
Man 7: Keep moving.
We'll meet you out there.

584
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,604
Man 8: Won't be able to take
that on the boat. It's too big.

585
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,857
Man 9: That's the last one!
Man 8: Three more! Move on!

586
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,443
Man 10: There's more
dragonglass everywhere.

587
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,245
Man 11: I've got some more daggers
over here.

588
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,747
Man 12: Put that dagger in his bag.

589
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:44,836
(Speaks old tongue)

590
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,921
The fuck you looking at?

591
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,470
(Dogs barking and howling)

592
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,938
- (Wind gusting)
- (Barking continues)

593
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,113
(Thunder rumbling)

594
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,783
(Murmuring)

595
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,460
(Whining)

596
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,264
- Man: Steady!
- (Rumbling)

597
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,353
- (Wind howling)
- (People shouting)

598
00:42:58,451 --> 00:42:59,911
Shut the gate.

599
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,662
Man: Shut the gate!

600
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:03,915
(Screaming)

601
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,668
Shut the gate!

602
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,676
- Open the gate!
- Letusin!

603
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,678
(All shouting)

604
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,567
(People screaming)

605
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,694
- (Pounding)
- Man: Open the gate!

606
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,535
(Shouting stops)

607
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,393
(Distant screams echoing)

608
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,068
(Screams)

609
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,404
(Roaring)

610
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,448
(People screaming)

611
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:22,076
Tormund: Ready your arrows!

612
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,082
(Snarling)

613
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,056
- Tormund: Wait!
- Keep in line! Get in line!

614
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,225
Get in line!

615
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,122
(Growls)

616
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,124
- (Thumping)
- (Snarling)

617
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,759
(Growling)

618
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,472
(Yells)

619
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,496
Man 1: Get to the front!

620
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,957
Man 2: Go on, shoot it!

621
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:01,342
Karsi: Wait!
Jon: Duncan, hold the line!

622
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,182
Lord commander!

623
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,643
Get them to the ship and come back for me!

624
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,645
- But you'll never make...
- Now!

625
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,317
- Let me on!
- Let me on!

626
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,194
- Bloody fucking move!
- Let go!

627
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,215
Jon: You should be on one of those boats.

628
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,158
So should you. My little girls got on.

629
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,470
They're gonna let them pass the wall
even if you're not there?

630
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,830
You have my word. I've given orders.

631
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:34,417
Don't think you're gonna be there
to enforce those orders.

632
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,835
(Thunder rumbles)

633
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,212
If they get through, everyone dies!

634
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,509
Night's watch!

635
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,679
With me! Move!

636
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,807

The dragonglass.

641
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,646
You and me, then!

Come on!

657
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,369
- The dragonglass.
- Fuck the glass!

658
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,995
We are gonna die here!

659
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,456
(Screeching)

660
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,987
Oh, fuck!

661
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,078
Man: Here they come!

662
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,621
(Wood creaking)

663
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,465
Wun wun, to the sea!

664
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:20,632
(Roaring)

665
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,760
Man: In the boats! Quickly!

666
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,095
- Faster, faster!
- Run!

667
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,639
Quickly!

668
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,894
- Go! Row!
- Go, come on!

669
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,112
(Wildlings screaming)

670
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,759
Let's go! Now!

671
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,603
(Screaming)

672
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,737
