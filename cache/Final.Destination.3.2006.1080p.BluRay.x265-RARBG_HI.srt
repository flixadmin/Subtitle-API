Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

921
01:04:12,987 --> 01:04:19,711
So that means that if death
has taken action, so can we.

922
01:04:20,036 --> 01:04:22,789
And that action we take
might have an opposite reaction...

923
01:04:22,955 --> 01:04:24,548
...that thwarts death's intent.
