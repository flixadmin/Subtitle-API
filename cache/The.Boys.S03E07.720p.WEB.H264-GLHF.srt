1
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:14,890
Do it!

2
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,886
I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny.

3
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:22,395
You're the fucking reason he's dead.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,735
You're the one who abandoned him.

5
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,488
You're a fucking monster.

6
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,864
It takes one to know one.

7
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,449
Hughie, you shot up

8
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:31,576
an untested drug from Vought.

9
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,411
That was stupid and dangerous.

10
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,746
Annie.

11
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:36,873
I thought the drugs had fucked you up,

12
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:38,124
but this is all you.

13
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,256
My powers are gone!

14
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:42,384
Kimiko! No!

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,758
Nate!

16
00:00:46,763 --> 00:00:48,923
You hurt my brother. You're not
gonna get away with it.

17
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:53,665
You think that Soldier Boy
is going after

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,977
- the rest of Payback?
- Why would he kill Crimson Countess?

19
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,061
He was your team leader.
Do you have any idea?

20
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:59,860
Anything?

21
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,899
You help me find the rest of my team,

22
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:05,198
and I'll help you with this Homelander.

23
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,362
This is a bad idea.

24
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,865
Homelander helped make me
America's sweetheart.

25
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,867
Homelander is the worst of them.

26
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,498
He's gonna regret that.

27
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:18,215
A VNN special report.

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,458
A nation betrayed.

29
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:24,838
It's been five days, and still
nothing but lies from Vought.

30
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:27,407
Soldier Boy is still out there
and Maeve is still missing.

31
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:29,009
Ms. Barrett, your reaction?

32
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,927
Once again, Maeve is in rehab.

33
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,837
And the Soldier Boy thing
really takes the cake.

34
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,641
He died in '84.
She is trying to incite a panic.

35
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:38,003
I wonder if Starlight's actions
could be considered treason.

36
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:40,937
- Me, too.
- So, is Starlight just hysterical?

37
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:43,398
Another woman scorned,
after Homelander jilted her?

38
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,650
Or is she trying to change the subject?

39
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:47,694
- From what?
- Her ties with this woman,

40
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:50,822
a known terrorist with the
Shining Light Liberation Army,

41
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:52,699
a notorious human trafficking ring.

42
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:53,867

Between you and me,
Soldier Boy did to singing

what pantyhose did to finger-fucking.

56
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,817
Yeah.

57
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:30,362
- What'd he want?
- Um, well...

58
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:33,657
he wanted me to tell you
that you're out of Astroglide.

59
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:35,900
Jesus Christ. You know,
I would say you fucks

60
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,478
are overstaying your welcome,
but what welcome?

61
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:40,014
I thought you
and Soldier Boy were friends.

62
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:42,540
Why, 'cause he forced
his way into my home?

63
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:44,000
Let me tell you something, kid.

64
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:46,002
I don't make friends with talent.

65
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,462
They're all the same.

66
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,297
I mean, they're not all the same.

67
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,050
- Eh.
- Come on, Soldier Boy was a hero, right?

68
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,928
I mean, he stormed Normandy.

69
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:57,806
Yeah, he did. Two weeks after D-Day.

70
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,432
For the photo op.

71
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:01,768
- So he didn't see any action?
- Not in Germany.

72
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:04,270
Sprayed a fire hose in Birmingham.

73
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,439
Some target practice at Kent State.

74
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:09,526
- There were rumors about Dealey Plaza.
- Wait, what?

75
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:11,653
Yeah, and they call 'em
the "good old days".

76
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,114
The thing is, to be American

77
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:17,168
means knowing you're the hero.

78
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:22,539
So what do we do? We sweep all
our filthy shit under the rug

79
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:26,710
and we tell ourselves
a myth like Soldier Boy.

80
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:30,463
And I get stinking rich selling it.

81
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,638
There you are.

82
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:41,399

Oh, good. Lube? Huh?

87
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:51,735
Come on, I can't go in raw.

88
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,086
Please don't make eye contact.

89
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,114
Hughie, listen, these women,
they're like fine wine.

90
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:57,824
Okay, the older they get, the
more delicious, but the drier.

91
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,701
Mary, Lucille, come on, chop-chop.

92
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,074
Break time's over. That shag's
not gonna vacuum itself.

93
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,079
Come on.

94
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:05,040
- Okay.
- What's the problem?

95
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,883
What's the problem? First of all,

96
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:09,044
I can never fire those
girls now, thank you.

97
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,121
And second of all,
this bed has seen two Jaclyns.

98
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,966
You know that? Smith and Bisset.

99
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,635
Y-You're treating it
like a Reno cathouse.

100
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,262
- Jesus.
- The problem

101
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,806
is you gave me 11
of Mindstorm's last-knowns.

102
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:25,226
So far, I've had a look at three
and found fuck all.

103
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,320
I-I'm chasing me
fucking tail here, mate.

104
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,991
Sounds like that's three down
and eight to go.

105
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:31,067
Yeah, and that's gonna take
weeks, and weeks I don't got.

106
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,443
Egyptian cotton sheets and now
I got to fucking burn 'em.

107
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:36,321
The deal was, we get
the rest of my team,

108
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:38,490
- then we get Homelander.
- And what I'm saying

109
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,200
is I could use an hand figuring it out.

110
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:43,620
I told you. Mindstorm's a paranoid fuck.

111
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,368
But, hell, if you could hear
everybody's shitty thoughts,

112
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,372
you'd be, too.

113
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:47,933
Look, he bought up
all these run-down cabins

114
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,042
all over the place.

115
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:52,504
He's Howard Hughes
without the piss jars.

116
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,047
He's batshit crazy.

117
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:57,258
Mindstorm's not crazy. He's bipolar.

118
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,302
- He's bipolar?
- Yeah.

119
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:00,720
Does he take meds for it?

120
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,664
I believe so. At least he did.

121
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,033
Girls, it smells like sex
and Bengay in here.

122
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,935
Lithium prescriptions
aren't that common.

123
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,553
I mean, I doubt he's making it.

124
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,656
Maybe... i-if we look
at the cabins and we...

125
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:13,275
And then check the local pharmacies.

126
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,484
Yeah.

127
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:15,907
See who's handing out lithium.

128
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:20,248

I wish I could say you get
used to it, but you never do.

136
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:53,236
So, where are they hiding?

137
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:59,328
Butcher and Soldier Boy.

138
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,960
Where are they?

139
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,611
Wait, is...

140
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,025
is that concealer?

141
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,957
Do you have a bruise?

142
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:13,918
Yeah...

143
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:17,130
Do you have any idea
what you've set loose?

144
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:20,717
Butcher has powers.
I assume thanks to you.

145
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,427
They've killed Crimson Countess

146
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:26,639
and seven other heroes, Maeve, seven.

147
00:06:26,644 --> 00:06:31,436
The ones that-that survived
are done, they're powerless.

148
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:34,655
Soldier Boy fried the V right
out of their blood somehow.

149
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,358
Maeve, do you understand,

150
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,569
that could happen to any one of us.

151
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:42,197
Yeah.

152
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:46,292
That's the difference
between you and me.

153
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:49,050
You need to be a Supe.

154
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:52,415
I can't wait till it's over.

155
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:56,961
Maeve...

156
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,885
Why are you letting me live?

157
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,019
Maeve.

158
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,225
You know,

159
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,478
back when things were, uh,

160
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:16,147
better between us...

161
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,984
... I used to dream
of having kids with you.

162
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,736
No, I did.

163
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,614
A family. Nesting, you know.

164
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:28,493
I-I mean, can you imagine
how perfect our kids would be?

165
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,286
Sublime.

166
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,163
Twice as strong as Ryan.

167
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,499
No kid of mine would
ever know a room like this,

168
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,750
I'll tell you that.

169
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,711
Just so you know,

170
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:41,664
I'll fucking shatter whatever
you try to stick up there.

171
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,709
Maeve! Don't be so crass.
We're not savages.

172
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,428
I respect what you are,
even if you don't.

173
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,097
I would never force myself on you.

174
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:54,524
But I am gonna harvest your eggs.

175
00:07:57,402 --> 00:08:02,694
That way,
if... God forbid... you do die,

176
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,496
whether by accident or choice,
you'll die knowing

177
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:08,199
that the very best of you carries on.

178
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:10,034
With me.

179
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,956
See, Maeve, I'm not letting you live.

180
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,796
I'm keeping you alive.

181
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:23,720
This is still a top-three
day in my life.

182
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,925
Because today is the day
I saw you scared.

183
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,573
The hell happened to you two?

184
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,374
It is but trivial.

185
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,617
Trivial, my ass.

186
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:52,368
Y'all look like y'all got
hit by a truck.

187
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:54,409
Oh, my God, you
shouldn't even be on your feet.

188
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:55,413
Come here, come here.

189
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:56,873
Come on.

190
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:58,834
Yeah, um, we're just gonna
go lie down for a minute.

191
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,293
Okay? Come on.

192
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,633
She insisted when you called, right?

193
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:07,592
Butcher is everyone's problem now.

194
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,427
We're here to help.

195
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,059
Oh.

196
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,433
Frenchie, are you high?

197
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:17,273
Well, that goes without saying.

198
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:22,531
Okay, satellite view
has Mindstorm's place

199
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:26,069
about two miles in, due west.

200
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:28,613
Two miles?

201
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,615
Fuck me.

202
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,117
We could've parked closer.

203
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:38,247
So, do you mind telling us
what we're walking into here?

204
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:39,832
All you got to know is,

205
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:43,461
if he tries to make eye contact
with you, close your eyes.

206
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,180
Or what?

207
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,799
Just don't make eye contact with him,

208
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,343
then you got nothing to worry about.

209
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:57,433
Hey, why do you keep buying him,
like, Hefty bags full of weed?

210
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:59,556
Better high than mental.

211
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,397
Takes the edge off his PTSD.

212
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,773
Wait, he has PTSD?

213
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:06,067
Yeah, I saw it at Herogasm.

214
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,449
It's why he keeps blowing
the fuck out of everything.

215
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,853
We got to keep that cunt dozy as a lamb.

216
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:18,371
So, just to recap, uh, he's radioactive,

217
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:21,499
highly traumatized and
heavily self-medicated.

218
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,960
Feels good, feels right.

219
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,878
Tell me about it.

220
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:29,303
I mean, what sad bastard
self-medicates like that, eh?

221
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,642
Earving,

222
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:26,527
sooner or later, you're gonna
have to t-t-talk about it.

223
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:29,942
Remember when you were nine,

224
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:32,612
a-and you hid in that
ball pit right over there,

225
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:37,158
after you p-p-p-paralyzed Lewis Frankel?

226
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,911
This is just like that.

227
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,206
You can't hide from Soldier Boy.

228
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:46,834
We're your best pals, aren't we?

229
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,921
We got you through that erection
in the seventh grade,

230
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,674
that Hard Rock Cafe
m-m-massacre in Lagos.

231
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,511
And by golly, we'll get
you through this, too.

232
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,560
- You got that...
- That's right. - You're our friend.

233
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,865
What'd you say?

234
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,664
- What?
- What?

235
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,793
Nothing, mate. No one said nothing.

236
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:34,445
Hey, hey. Uh, your...
your brain's leaking.

237
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:42,937
Oh, fuck.

238
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,783
Oh, shit.

239
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:08,104
What the fuck is this shite?

240
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,461
Mum.

241
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,885
Oi, Mum.

242
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:19,481
Fucking Mindstorm.

243
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,765
Knock it off, you little fucking freak.

244
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,226
- Come on.
- Butcher, wake up.

245
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,992
- Wake up!
- Fucking freak

246
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:29,688
- slipped away. He's gonna pick us off...
- Butcher, wake up.

247
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:31,649
- ... one by one.
- Come on, wake up, Butcher. Butcher!

248
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,751
- Wake up.
- No, you're wasting your time, he's gone.

249
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:36,360
- What did Mindstorm do?
- Well, if it's his usual MO,

250
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,945
trapped him in an endless nightmare

251
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,206
till he dies of terminal dehydration.

252
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,768
No, there's got to be
a way we can wake him up.

253
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:44,493
Mindstorm put him into this.
He can snap him out.

254
00:13:44,498 --> 00:13:46,405
- Okay, great, great. Uh...
- But he's about to be dead.

255
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,927
Wait, wait, just hang on. If we,
if we, if we grab Mindstorm,

256
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:49,933
we make him help Butcher...

257
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:51,410
- No way.
- And then, and then you can kill him,

258
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,734
then you can go to town on him, man.

259
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,590
- I don't give a fuck.
- Hey. If you're gonna act hysterical,

260
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:56,756
I'm gonna slap you like I'm Connery.

261
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:59,717
Now, unless you want to end up
like your friend there,

262
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,140
it ain't worth the risk.

263
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:05,973
Look, chin up, okay? Deal's a deal.

264
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,309
You help me finish this,
I'll kill Homelander.

265
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,354
Butcher would have given up his
life for that in a heartbeat.

266
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:14,236
So, we doing this or not?

267
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,408
Leave it. We got to move fast.

268
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,574
Ah.

269
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,035
Do you hear that?

270
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,638
Uh... You might
want to lay off the weed, huh?

271
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:31,045
And you might want
to gargle my ball sack.

272
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:53,818
Where is she?

273
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,028
Lenny! Where the fuck's Lenny?

274
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,814
Shit. Come on.

275
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,908
Left his bloody bike
in the garden again.

276
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:08,416
Lenny! Lenny?

277
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,355
Billy?

278
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,911
Leave off 'em, you cunt.

279
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:20,715
Gotcha.

280
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,258
Come here. Come here.

281
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:24,051
Come here.

282
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,095
Where is he?

283
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,518
Who?

284
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:30,850
Don't fuck me about.

285
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:32,064
Where is he?

286
00:15:46,287 --> 00:15:48,497
Fucking snotty little cunt.

287
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,966
Lenny, i-it's okay.

288
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,940
Jesus. I thought you quit.

289
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,997
The Lord hates quitters.

290
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:34,914
Is that halothane?

291
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,540
I chucked some at him at Herogasm.

292
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,009
The motherfucker didn't even flinch.

293
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,977
It will be the greatest
sorrow of my life

294
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,129
that I missed Herogasm.

295
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,859
But no, this is not halothane.

296
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:45,402
- You see the texture?
- Mm.

297
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:46,408
It's all wrong.

298
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:48,052
What is it, then?

299
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,092
Well, let's find out.

300
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:56,143
Okay.

301
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,150
Okay.

302
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:04,151
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

303
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,071
It's just, uh, un peu kétamine.

304
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:10,120
It's okay. You know, the...

305
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,542
Frenchie, you're a fucking mess.

306
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,592
Well, that makes two of us.

307
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:29,593
- ♪ Will and what will be ♪
- Okay, sorry.

308
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:31,595
♪ She's a maniac ♪

309
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,227

310
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,724
Okay.

311
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:36,892
Should be good.

312
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:38,811
Is there anything else that you need?

313
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,067
Are you hungry?

314
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:44,280
♪ She's a maniac, maniac ♪

315
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:50,931
Oh. Kirkland.

316
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,139
A fine choice. Yeah.

317
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:07,381
Oh. When you grow up in Iowa,
there is not much else to do.

318
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,671
Here.

319
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:16,056
Mmm.

320
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,157
Oh.

321
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,851
Ooh.

322
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:20,436
When did you have your first drink?

323
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,021
Right now?

324
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:25,057
Oh, my God, wow.

325
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,860
Okay, um...

326
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:30,392
Okay, well, cheers to that.

327
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,859
I tried.

328
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:43,180
He doesn't want to be saved.

329
00:18:47,718 --> 00:18:48,928
With what?

330
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,645
What about it?

331
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:03,587
You want me to...

332
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:04,897
Kimiko,

333
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:07,524
uh, hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on. Hang on.

334
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:08,739
The...

335
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:13,806
You know that I can't go to the Tower.

336
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:16,805
Even if I could, this would
be such a bad idea.

337
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:20,871
No, but you don't know
if it'll do that again.

338
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:23,207
I mean, you could get yourself killed.

339
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:25,042
I won't do it. I'm sorry, I can't.

340
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,507
I can't.

341
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,523
Still can't believe this shit is legal.

342
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:50,531
I locked up so many assholes
for it back in the day.

343
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:55,698
What the fuck did you say?

344
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:58,575
Uh, uh, literally nothing.

345
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,370
Jesus. How hard?

346
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,746
- What?
- How hard did Butcher

347
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:04,790
suck your dick that
you miss him that much?

348
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:06,265
Hmm? His mouth must feel

349
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,144
- like a Hoover Deluxe.
- God, every single thing

350
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:09,712
you say is so gross.

351
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,839
He saved me, okay?

352
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,465
More than once.

353
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,884
- So I owe him.
- Oh, bullshit.

354

Yes, Father. You folks need some help?

- Yes. Yes, please.
- Okay, well,

519
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:44,992
it's not safe. There's
a fugitive in the area.

520

521

Uh, well, we can't.

522

00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,648
This is Mindstorm's MO.
He brainwashed them.

531
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,851
That priest was gonna shank us.
And she will, too.

532
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,596
- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Father Wallace, no!

533
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,789
Hey, hey, she doesn't
look brainwashed to me.

534
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:17,028
Take my word for it.
Everyone's coming for us.

535
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:18,634
- Everyone, every day.
- Whoa, no!

536
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:20,327
No, no! You have PTSD!

537
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,770
You have PTSD,

538
00:28:21,774 --> 00:28:23,196
and you are super fucking stoned.

539
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,331
All right? Maybe this isn't

540
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,500
- what you think it is.
- Move.

541
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,875
- Move!
- She's a human being.

542
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,260
A nun. And if there's
one thing I know...

543
00:28:29,265 --> 00:28:32,555
Die, you fucking cocksuckers!

544
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,090
Oh, my God! Do something!

545
00:28:34,095 --> 00:28:36,927
- If you stay still, I...
- Fuck you! Get her off me!

546
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:39,679
Oh! Fuck me!

547
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,390
No! Hard pass on this Exorcist shit!

548
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:44,814
What's black and white and red all over?

549
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:47,354
Okay, first off,

550
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,439
I don't have shell shock. Fuck you.

551
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:51,316
Second, this is what I'm talking about.

552
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:53,824
This is being a soldier.

553
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:00,288
Come on.

554
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,160
It's been five days, and still nothing

555
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,711
but lies from Vought.

556
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,405
Soldier Boy is still out there,

557
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,282
and Maeve is still missing.
And you know what?

558
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,133
More people are just going to die

559
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:19,208
until they admit to what's going on.

560
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,171
So, I guess you've
all heard about Starlight's

561
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:23,148
"alleged" involvement...

562
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:24,350
... with a human trafficking ring?

563
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:25,417
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

564
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:27,527
And I suppose it's "pure coincidence"

565
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,355
that, uh, she opened Starlight
House for runaway teens.

566
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,265
Huh? Come on,

567
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,277
we can put two and two together, can't we?

568
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:36,861
What the holy fuck does
he think he's doing?

569
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:38,363
Those poor kids.

570
00:29:38,368 --> 00:29:40,991
They pass through her doors,
they disappear.

571
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:43,702
They are never seen again.
It's horrific.

572
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:44,995
But we got to face the truth,

573
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,930
people, no matter how ugly it is.

574
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,624
Starlight is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

575
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:51,877
Plain and simple. She fooled me.

576
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:53,254
She fooled you. She fooled all of us.

577
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,172
Right? Now she wants
to take me down. Why?

578
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:57,665
Because with me out of the way,

579
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,834
there is no one who can stop her.

580
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,344
No one, and she knows it.

581
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:02,846
Exactly.

582
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:05,257
Do you think the media, our buddies over here...

583
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,351
Do you think the media
is gonna report on that?

584
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,758
No, no, no, no, no. Of course not.

585
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:25,368
Ah. Tell you what. You guys,

586
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:26,786
love you!

587
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:29,172
All right!

588
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:32,881
And vote for Bob Singer.
He's, uh, he's... great.

589
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:36,921
Let's hear it for Homelander.

590
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:02,160

00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:08,583

Skip breakfast, did we?

597
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,565
No.

598
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,317
No. Uh...

599
00:31:39,322 --> 00:31:41,736
- She's in pain, so I tried to help.
- Look, I'm gonna

600
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:43,439
tell you the truth here
because no one else will.

601
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,906
Pull your shit together,

602
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:46,491
admit it's Soldier Boy

603
00:31:46,496 --> 00:31:48,451
and take control of the situation.

604
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:52,414
You think, uh, I'm not in control?

605
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:54,874
No. I think you just spent
the last 20 minutes

606
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,918
ranting about Starlight
instead of talking up

607
00:31:56,923 --> 00:31:59,008
the next president of the United States.

608
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:01,715
You're Homelander.

609
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,565
Button your shit up. You're flailing.

610
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,052
This whole fucking scene
right here. Jesus Christ.

611
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,679
Oh, I'm sorry.

612
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:08,805
Go on, please.

613
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,474
You need someone you can trust.

614
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,685
- Someone like you?
- I got rid of Edgar for you.

615
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,562
That cost me a lot.

616
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:19,357
I'm proposing a strictly
transactional relationship.

617
00:32:19,362 --> 00:32:23,445
You help me out with one small favor,

618
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,488
and I help you.

619
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,088
Where did you get this?

620
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:57,729
You're awake. Fantastic.

621
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,444
What happened?

622
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:02,567
Pretty fucking nuts, man.

623
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:06,801
I mean, how Soldier Boy attacked
you and Blue Hawk at Herogasm.

624
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:10,750
- Yeah.
- Soldier Boy

625
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,620
murdered Blue Hawk
right in front of you.

626
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:17,332
You tried to save Blue Hawk, of course,

627
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:19,292
but...

628
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,674
Must've been awful for you.

629
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:26,691
- Yeah.
- It seemed

630
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:29,260
like you two were on your way
to a healing place,

631
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:31,179
which is why you're gonna love this.

632
00:33:31,184 --> 00:33:32,889
Blue Hawk will live on

633
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:35,146
because we gave you his heart.

634
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,440
A super-abled heart.

635
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:44,183
No more heart disease.

636
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,810
You're gonna get to run again.

637
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,570
Can I get a "what-what"?

638
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:49,256
Look, you'll need
insane amounts of rehab,

639
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,590
but luckily, you heal fast,

640
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,200
- bro.
- That's...

641
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,828
We're gonna get you back
in your old suit. We're gonna

642
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,629
get you out there ASAP.

643
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,414
You're okay talking shit
about Starlight?

644
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:01,008
- Yeah, sure. Why?
- Oh, amazing.

645
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:02,435
Oh, my God, I almost forgot.

646
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,671
We are already
working on your new movie.

647
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,130
Training A-Train.

648
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:08,008
Gritty biopic.

649
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,276
You're a roughneck gangbanger
from the South Side

650
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,853
slanging that yayo

651
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:14,355
when a track coach...
we're thinking Tom Hanks...

652
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,099
teaches you a more civilized way.

653
00:34:16,104 --> 00:34:20,144
That's not at all how that happened.

654
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:21,488
My brother's my coach.

655
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,440
- We're out to Sir Julian Fellowes to write, so...
- No.

656
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:25,192
- I'm not doing that.
- You're gonna love it.

657
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,378
Anyway, I got to bounce.
But the A-Train's back, baby!

658
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:29,879
- Right?
- Uh...

659
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:31,239
That's your...

660
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:32,662
Okay.

661
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:38,914
Senator Bishop, will you confirm

662
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:39,999
you're about to join the ticket

663
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:41,125
as the vice presidential candidate?

664
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:42,609
Well, if I was lucky enough

665
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,586
to be so honored,
you'll be the first to know.

666
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:46,880
And now, if you will all excuse us,

667
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:48,631
I want to get a deep-fried Twinkie

668
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:49,857
before my wife finds out.

669
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:06,566
It's not a gas.

670
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,309
- What?
- It's vapor.

671
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,234
Vapor. Vapor. Just a delivery system.

672
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:17,578
- This.
- You think I can read

673
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,412
- this shit?
- Novichok.

674
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,247
Russian nerve agent.

675
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,017
Expose you or moi to Novichok,
our nervous system shuts down.

676
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:26,127
Multiple organs fail. Painful death.

677
00:35:26,132 --> 00:35:28,463
But for Soldier Boy, it's a nap.

678
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:30,214
All right. So where can we get some?

679
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:32,180
Another vacation to Russia?

680
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,758
Motherfucker.

681
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,328
Huh? Qu'est-ce que c'est ?

682
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:51,282
What got into him?

683
00:35:52,325 --> 00:35:54,238
No clue.

684
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:57,408
Dance with me?

685
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:58,910
You're still hurt.

686
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:00,745
I'm still high.

687
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,169

711
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:21,117
Why? This is everything
you said you did not want.

712
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,870
No. Listen to me. Listen to me.

713
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,113
You can walk away. You and me.

714
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,416
We go together to Marseille.

715
00:37:28,421 --> 00:37:30,793
Your freedom, your humanité.

716
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:32,879
You have it. Mon cœur, please.

717
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,802
S'il te plaît, don't do this.

718
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:49,317
"Annie.

719
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:53,154
I know I'm asking a lot.

720
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:56,736
At first I hated the V

721
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,322
because I didn't choose it.

722
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:01,741
But now it's my choice.

723
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,165
I think that matters.

724
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,334
I blamed my powers for my problems.

725
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:18,257
But it's not true.

726
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,084
The V isn't good or bad.

727
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,762
It just depends on the person using it.

728
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,770
I wanted to use my powers to do good.

729
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,191
To fight for the ones I love.

730
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:37,782
I almost lost Frenchie
because I couldn't fight.

731
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,786
I can't risk that again".

732
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:56,711
When we kissed, it was weird.

733
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,090
Oui.

734
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:03,302
Not because it felt bad.

735
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,054
It didn't.

736
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:10,857
But because we're more than that.

737
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:18,906
You are my family now.

738
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,330
I want to protect my family.

739
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,245
Oh, my God.

740
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,166
Jesus Christ.

741
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,151
By 1984,

742
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:19,629
things had gotten so bad.

743
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,563
There was only so much m-m-more

744
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:23,634
of Soldier Boy's abuse you could take.

745
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:28,162
So when St-St-Stan Edgar
made you an offer in Nicaragua,

746
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,622
you jumped at it.

747
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,016
- Vought's really okay with this?
- Sometimes,

748
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:34,602
old soldiers just fade away.

749
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:36,270
I don't want the details.

750
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,272
- Just do what you need to do.
- Why now?

751
00:40:38,277 --> 00:40:40,458
Vogelbaum has a replacement.

752
00:40:40,463 --> 00:40:41,984
Just a child,

753
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:44,570
but they're convinced he'll be
stronger than Soldier Boy.

754
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,906
And he can fly.

755
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,933
- Will the others go along?
- Everyone but Gunpowder.

756
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:51,619
Good luck, Earving.

757
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:55,344
Can you please stop eating those
in front of me? I'm allergic.

758
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:12,556
- What the fuck is this?
- Something we should've done a long time ago,

759
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:14,058
you piece of shit.

760
00:41:14,063 --> 00:41:16,227
- TNT detonate!
- TNT detonate!

761
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:24,657
Hold him down.

762
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:30,142
Fucking piece of shit.

763
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:44,839
Get him, Mindstorm.

764
00:41:44,844 --> 00:41:47,425
- Scramble his fucking brains.
- No!

765
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,509
No!

766
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,230
Fuck you, motherfucker.

767
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,817
This is some tough stuff, I know.

768
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,710
But when you gave him to the Russians,

769
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:09,488
you knew Soldier Boy
would come back one day.

770
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,121
You need to f-f-f-face him.

771
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,536
No one really knows you.

772
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:19,165
But we know how s-sensitive

773
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,313
- and s-s-scared you are.
- Yes.

774
00:42:21,314 --> 00:42:22,314
We're here for you.

775
00:42:22,315 --> 00:42:23,761
- Hey, we got your back.
- We're here for you.

776
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:25,338
It's okay.

777
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,798
Bravery isn't having no fear.

778
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:30,267
Bravery is having fear,

779
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:33,137
but you d-d-d-do it anyway.

780
00:42:33,142 --> 00:42:37,664
Time to finish what you started.

781
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,214
Get the fuck out the car.

782
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:00,923
- What's wrong?
- You heard me.

783
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:02,434
- Daddy?
- Hey, baby.

784
00:43:02,438 --> 00:43:04,368
I need you to go inside
the house with your mama.

785
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,537
Daddy needs to talk to Todd alone.

786
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,302
- Okay.
- All right.

787
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:12,009
- Marvin, what are you doing here?
- You're okay with this?

788
00:43:12,014 --> 00:43:13,303
- What?
- He took her

789
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:15,679
- to a Homelander rally.
- Yeah, so?

790
00:43:15,684 --> 00:43:18,557
Excuse me. You took her where?

791
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,357
- It's fine.
- No, it is not fine. You didn't ask me.

792
00:43:22,775 --> 00:43:26,107
Janine. Come on. Inside, honey.

793
00:43:26,112 --> 00:43:28,442
Everything's fine. Just relax.

794
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:29,986
Don't tell me to relax, Todd.

795
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,454
Soldier Boy is out there
gunning for Homelander.

796
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:34,015
Do you have any idea

797
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,000
what kind of danger
you put my baby girl in?

798
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:37,827
There's no danger.

799
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:40,079
Starlight is making all that up.

800
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,823
Read any news outside
the establishment media.

801
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,418
Todd, Todd, they're lying.

802
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:47,578
- Really? All of them?
- All of them.

803
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,830
Homelander is lying to you.

804
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,925
- He's a fucking psychopath.
- Worse than Starlight?

805
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,012
She's trafficking kids
the same age as Janine,

806
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:58,848
as the... as the kids in my classroom.

807
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:01,183
Homelander is the only one
protecting them.

808
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:02,987
- Okay, you guys. That's enough.
- Homelander

809
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:04,895
ain't protecting shit, all right?

810
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,881
He's feeding you this insane fairy tale,

811
00:44:06,886 --> 00:44:08,848
and you're too fucking stupid
and-and brainwashed

812
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:09,901
- to fucking see it!
- Hey,

813
00:44:09,905 --> 00:44:12,533
- fuck you.
- Both of you, stop.

814
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:17,700
You know what?

815
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:20,369
If you want to risk your life, fine.

816
00:44:20,374 --> 00:44:21,662
Have at it.

817
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:23,497
But not with my baby girl.

818
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:25,124
You're not her father.

819
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,422
Someone's got to be.

820
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:30,404
Marvin!

821
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,715
Oh, my God, Todd.

822
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:33,841
Todd. Oh, my God, Todd.

823
00:44:33,846 --> 00:44:35,801
Todd. Todd. Open your eyes.

824
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:36,807
Wake up.

825
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:57,205
Here she is.

826
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,782
Did you think I wouldn't know

827
00:44:58,787 --> 00:45:01,243
the second you walked through the door?

828
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:03,496
Well, we broke up.

829
00:45:04,752 --> 00:45:07,958
It was time to pack my shit and go.

830
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,621
Okay.

831
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,507
So, here's what happens now.

832
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:16,475
You're gonna march into VNN studios,

833
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,153
and you're gonna recant
everything you said.

834
00:45:19,158 --> 00:45:20,954
It was a tragic cocktail

835
00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:23,240
of heartbreak, Zoloft and despair.

836
00:45:23,245 --> 00:45:24,683
You regret any harm

837
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,811
that your lies have caused Vought or me,

838
00:45:27,816 --> 00:45:30,523
but me in particular.

839
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:31,607
- Mm.
- Good.

840
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:33,016
Okay. But, um,

841
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,528
you want to hear my counter?

842
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:38,531
I stop Soldier Boy before
he murders more people,

843
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:41,158
and I find Maeve.

844
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:43,285
If she's still alive.

845
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,788
Maeve's just learning her manners.

846
00:45:45,793 --> 00:45:48,499
And you should do the same.

847
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:50,893
Seriously, before you throw away

848
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:52,461
everything you've worked so hard for.

849
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:54,763
- Hmm?
- You know what? I could give a shit.

850
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:56,507
Really? You sure about that?

851
00:45:56,512 --> 00:46:00,140
Your fame is the only thing
protecting you.

852
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,888
Here's the thing.

853
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,808
I'm not scared of you anymore.

854
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:08,477
I'm not. I see who you are.

855
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:10,484
I see how small you are.

856
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:14,071
I saw it.

857
00:46:16,865 --> 00:46:20,155
I saw it the night that
you killed Supersonic.

858
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,580
You know what I remember
from that night?

859
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:27,126
I remember what I told you
would happen to Hughie.

860
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:29,164
You walk,

861
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:31,005
that's next.

862
00:46:34,466 --> 00:46:36,105
Good luck with that.

863
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,606
Now that you've told

864
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:41,218
my 190 million followers.

865
00:46:41,223 --> 00:46:43,270
I'm still pretty famous.

866
00:46:43,275 --> 00:46:45,497
Hey, everybody!

867
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,599
Oh, that's me.

868
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,500
- I got to go.
- Starlight,

869
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,752
uh, wait.

870
00:46:49,757 --> 00:46:51,178
You're not supposed to record us

871
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,860
when we're running lines.

872
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:07,930
Shit!

873
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:11,393
- What the hell?!
- Okay, wait! Wait.

874
00:48:11,397 --> 00:48:12,711
- Wait.
- Why the fuck am I naked?!

875
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:13,877
I can explain, okay?

876
00:48:13,882 --> 00:48:15,337
You're with Soldier Boy.

877
00:48:15,342 --> 00:48:16,964
- You're trying to fucking kill me.
- No!

878
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,959
- No. No, I just saved your life.
- Leave me alone!

879
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:21,318
Please, calm down. I only want
to talk, okay? Just talk.

880
00:48:21,323 --> 00:48:22,737
I'm not bothering
anyone. I'm just trying

881
00:48:22,741 --> 00:48:24,197
to get away from all the fucking voices.

882
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,590
I'm just trying to get away
from the voices.

883
00:48:25,594 --> 00:48:27,324
I'm just trying to get away
from the voices!

884
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:29,743
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
open my eyes, all right?

885
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:31,750
Please don't coma me.

886
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,459
Okay. Hey. We're cool.

887
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:39,066
Very chill. Very cool.

888
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,007
Also, we-we don't have to do this naked.

889
00:48:44,012 --> 00:48:45,175
All right?

890
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,136
Just-just clothes. They're clothes.

891
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:48,887
I'm gonna reach in.
I'm gonna grab you some,

892
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,477
okay?

893
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:58,188
Look. Look, hey,
I don't want to be here.

894
00:48:58,193 --> 00:49:00,149
I-I was pretending
to be someone I'm not.

895
00:49:00,154 --> 00:49:03,068
I'm not like Soldier Boy.
That guy's full of shit.

896
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,762
I mean, no one is that tough,
and then...

897
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,363
And the people who say they are?

898
00:49:06,368 --> 00:49:07,781
They're lying.

899
00:49:07,786 --> 00:49:09,742
And I'm... I'm done.

900
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:11,034
I want to go home.

901
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:13,036
So, I'm just...

902
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,164
I'm begging you...

903
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:17,254
to please wake up my friend.

904
00:49:18,338 --> 00:49:20,177
I've been inside his head.

905
00:49:20,182 --> 00:49:22,255
- That guy's a piece of shit.
- It doesn't matter.

906
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,698
I-I don't want to be someone
who leaves people behind.

907
00:49:24,703 --> 00:49:26,467
I want to be someone
who saves his family.

908
00:49:26,472 --> 00:49:27,973
And for better or worse...

909
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:30,596
... he's family.

910
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:31,764
- Please wake him up.
- No.

911
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:33,766
- No way.
- I can get you out of here.

912
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:35,684
If you just please,

913
00:49:35,689 --> 00:49:37,227
please wake him up,

914
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:39,229
I'll teleport you away.

915
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:40,731
You'll be safe

916
00:49:40,736 --> 00:49:43,358
away from everyone,
including Soldier Boy.

917
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:45,819
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

918
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:49,698
And I will never tell
a soul where that is.

919
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:51,196
Hand to God.

920
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,000
No.

921
00:50:00,005 --> 00:50:01,460
Not here.

922
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,171
So, that's it then, Billy?

923
00:50:04,176 --> 00:50:06,548
Jesus, Lenny.

924
00:50:06,553 --> 00:50:07,716
Just gonna piss off,

925
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:09,518
no goodbye or nothing like that?

926
00:50:09,523 --> 00:50:11,679
I'll be back
Christmas, once I got everything

927
00:50:11,683 --> 00:50:13,964
sorted at the barracks, you can
maybe come out and see me.

928
00:50:14,853 --> 00:50:16,517
Billy.

929
00:50:16,522 --> 00:50:18,310
Please don't leave me alone with him.

930
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,359
I can't hack it.

931
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,320
You'll be all right.

932
00:50:25,113 --> 00:50:27,194
No, he won't.

933
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,863
- Fucking listen to him.
- If I stay,

934
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:29,906
I'm gonna end up killing him,

935
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,782
get sent off to Borstal, or prison,

936
00:50:31,787 --> 00:50:34,701
and what's that gonna do to Mum, hmm?

937
00:50:34,706 --> 00:50:36,620
Break her bloody heart, is what it'd do.

938
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:38,413
Besides,

939
00:50:38,418 --> 00:50:41,625
the old cunt hates me the most,

940
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,128
so maybe if I'm gone,
he'll leave you be.

941
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:46,710
You stupid fucking twat.
Don't you leave him.

942
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,884
I got to go, Len.

943
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:52,928
- Billy, please.
- Leave off.

944
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:54,304
For fuck's sake, Lenny,

945
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:56,515
it ain't my job to look after you.

946
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,439
Don't be such a fucking
poof all your life.

947
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:11,985
Right.

948
00:51:15,998 --> 00:51:17,536
Please,

949
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,959
don't go.

950
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,947
You served me up to him on a plate.

951
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,486
No, I...

952
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:52,988
I didn't.

953
00:51:52,993 --> 00:51:54,244
I-I wouldn't.

954
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,118
It's been six months, and you
come home to check on me

955
00:51:58,123 --> 00:51:59,411
not once.

956
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,996
Len, I-I'm sorry, but they...

957
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:03,795
they just wouldn't let me
out of the barracks.

958
00:52:11,178 --> 00:52:13,175
Oh, Jesus, please.

959
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,928
- Please, fuck, no.
- He's beating the living shit

960
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:16,028
out of me, Billy.

961
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:17,804
Day in and day out.

962
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:20,390
- I can't take no more.
- Please, Len, don't.

963
00:52:20,395 --> 00:52:23,518
You fucking knew what he'd do.
It's your fault.

964
00:52:23,523 --> 00:52:25,854
No, don't say that.
That's... that's not true.

965
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:27,272
I... I'm not that bastard.

966
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:30,692
Come off it, Billy.
You always have been.

967
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:33,445
'Cause anyone who's ever loved you,

968
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,694
you end up getting
them killed, don't you?

969
00:52:37,746 --> 00:52:40,202
Me. Becca.

970
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:41,787
Now, Hughie,

971
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,497
the last person on God's green earth

972
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:45,949
trying to stop you from being
a monster, and what do you do?

973
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,669
Drag him down to your level.

974
00:52:48,674 --> 00:52:50,796
When he dies,

975
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,923
and he will,

976
00:52:52,928 --> 00:52:54,346
then no one can stop you.

977
00:52:56,682 --> 00:52:58,537
Can they?

978
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,638
No!

979
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:00,847
Lenny, no!

980
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,981
I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry!

981
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:09,987
Sorry for what?

982
00:53:13,198 --> 00:53:15,320
- Hughie.
- It's okay, Butcher.

983
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,531
It's okay. You're all right.

984
00:53:17,536 --> 00:53:19,191
Here. You're okay.

985
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,864
Hey, kid.

986
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,371
Right, right, yeah.

987
00:53:24,376 --> 00:53:26,681
Okay. Deal's a deal.

988
00:53:26,686 --> 00:53:28,730
Where we headed?

989
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,436
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

990
00:54:00,996 --> 00:54:02,951
Hiya, Dan.

991
00:54:02,956 --> 00:54:05,328
It's-it's not what you think.
It wasn't my idea.

992
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,122
Oh, I know. It was Noir's,

993
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:08,874
but how does that work, huh?
'Cause no way

994
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:10,759
he makes a fucking move without Vought.

995
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:13,253
- They gave him the green light.
- Why would they do that?

996
00:54:18,764 --> 00:54:21,049
What? That's impossible.

997
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,166
What'd he say?

998
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:33,625
Hello?

999
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,293
I need to talk to Hughie. Where is he?

1000
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:36,298
Oh, Starlight.

1001
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,796
How delightful.

1002
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,414
He's just popped out for a bit.

1003
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,609
- Okay, well, he's not answering his phone.
- Bit hard to keep

1004
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:44,010
a phone when you're teleporting
all day, innit, love.

1005
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:47,114
- How can I help?
- Temp V is gonna kill you both.

1006
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,991
Well, it's gonna have to join the queue.

1007
00:55:48,996 --> 00:55:51,560
I was just in the lab.
It causes lesions.

1008
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:54,513
Okay? It turns your brain
into fucking Swiss cheese,

1009
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,223
so, please, be honest with me,

1010
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,780
and tell me how many
doses have you taken?

1011
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,029
- Just a couple.
- Jesus Christ.

1012
00:56:03,034 --> 00:56:06,283
Butcher, three to five doses kills you.

1013
00:56:06,288 --> 00:56:08,790
You need to tell Hughie.

1014
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:13,373
Yeah, yeah. I will, I will. I promise.

1015
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:16,293
Okay, but I'm calling back
every five minutes until...

1016
00:56:16,298 --> 00:56:19,212
Butcher?

1017
00:56:19,217 --> 00:56:20,964
Goddamn it.

1018
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,826
Okay.

1019
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,094
Hi.

1020
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:27,971
Only thing open was Long John Silver's,

1021
00:56:27,976 --> 00:56:31,850
so... I guess that's kind of
fish and chips, right?

1022
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,310
Yeah.

1023
00:56:33,315 --> 00:56:36,067
- Nice one.
- Everything all right?

1024
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:41,948
It's, uh...

1025
00:56:46,011 --> 00:56:48,638
- It's the Temp V.
- What about it?

1026
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:02,510
We got to swing by the office
and get some more.

1027
00:57:09,142 --> 00:57:11,723
And then you, me,

1028
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:15,523
and granny fucker are gonna
finish this fucking job.

1029
00:57:19,444 --> 00:57:20,654
Yeah, fuck yeah.

1030
00:57:32,667 --> 00:57:34,791
- Your call has been forwarded...
- Fuck.

1031
00:57:34,795 --> 00:57:37,140
Do you think Monsieur
Charcutier will tell Hughie?

1032
00:57:37,141 --> 00:57:38,141
Do you?

1033
00:57:49,264 --> 00:57:52,264
I'm gonna save Hughie,

1034
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,271
even if he doesn't want me to.

1035
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:20,255
Ready, mon cœur ?

1036
00:58:24,242 --> 00:58:25,338
Oh.

1037
00:58:25,343 --> 00:58:28,383
Enjoy them

1038
00:58:28,388 --> 00:58:30,849
before they feel like
bendy straws again.

1039
00:58:47,198 --> 00:58:49,321
Mon cœur ?

1040
00:59:27,914 --> 00:59:29,703
Obviously, I didn't realize

1041
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,654
the little bitch was
recording me, did I?

1042
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:33,239
No, no. A...

1043
00:59:33,244 --> 00:59:35,492
Ashley, I don't fucking care.

1044
00:59:35,497 --> 00:59:37,660
You're the spin doctor,
go fucking spin it.

1045
00:59:37,665 --> 00:59:39,329
- What?
- Sir,

1046
00:59:39,334 --> 00:59:41,414
I apologize for disturbing you...

1047
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:43,241
... but you have a call.

1048
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,374
He says he's... Well, he's
claiming to be Soldier Boy.

1049
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:52,197
Put him through.

1050
00:59:55,934 --> 00:59:57,389
This really you?

1051
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:58,957
The situation's changed.

1052
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,559
I thought we should have a conversation.

1053
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,261
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are,

1054
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,505
but you got lucky once because
you fucking ambushed me.

1055
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:06,606
Fall 1980,

1056
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:09,442
I get called into Vogelbaum's
lab for an experiment,

1057
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:11,611
some shit about genetics.

1058
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:14,072
I still remember the Penthouse I used.

1059
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:16,616
June. Danielle Deneux,

1060
01:00:16,621 --> 01:00:18,243
bush like a Pomeranian.

1061
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:20,203
- What?
- I beat my meat into a cup.

1062
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:23,748
Turns out...

1063
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:25,417
Vogelbaum made a kid.

1064
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:28,753
Born spring 1981.

1065
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,339
A boy.

1066
01:00:31,344 --> 01:00:33,925
You know what the bitch of it is?

1067
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,177
If they'd have just kept me around,

1068
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:38,888
I'd have let you take the spotlight.

1069
01:00:38,893 --> 01:00:42,163
What father wouldn't
want that for his son?
