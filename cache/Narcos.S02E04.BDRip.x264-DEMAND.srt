1
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,427
Tata.

2
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,387
Tata. Where is everyone?

3
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,565
Pablo.

4
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,306
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

5
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,880
I'm all right.

6
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,474
Go back to bed.

7
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,361
Do you know why they brought you there?

8
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,573
He said they were going to send a message
to other kids.

9
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,540
Who is he? Do you remember his name?

10
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,270
Colonel Carrillo.

11
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,281
I know this is difficult...

12
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,849
but tell me what happened
when they brought you there.

13
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,248
They killed my friend.

14
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,690
- I'm very sorry...
- This is a farce.

15
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,197
- Escobar trained this kid very well.
- I'll speak with Carrillo.

16
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,790
Whether he did or didn't do it
is beside the point.

17
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,392
Colombia is tired of Escobar.

18
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,029
Besides, Valeria Velez?

19
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,437
My God, she has no credibility
in this country.

20
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,942
I need to know if Carrillo
killed that boy.

21
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:43,210
If we say that she's doing this
to discredit Carrillo, they'll believe us.

22
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,777
But if the press finds out
that you spoke to Carrillo about this...

23
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,720
They'll assume it's the truth.

24
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,788
Exactly.

25
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,768
What do you propose?

26
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,497
That we don't play Escobar's game.

27
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:08,006
And that we leave things as they are
for the time being.

28
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,971
I think we're going to need
more than an interview.

29
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:19,109
- No, no, no. No violence.
- That's not what I mean. I suggest...

30
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,518
Now we need to have the people
on our side.

31
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:27,185
Yes, of course. It's just the president
has denied it ever happened,

32
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,195
and the American news
hasn't even picked up the story.

33
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,787
Of course.

34
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:36,769
If David were the son
of an important politician, but...

35
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:42,367
the men of always aren't interested
in the children of never.

36
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,305
- Of course.
- Right?

37
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:01,824
I'm writing a letter to the editors
of the most important newspapers

38
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:06,389
to tell them how that boy came to me,
scared for his life.

39
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:11,130
The world has to know what sort of monster
that son of a bitch Carrillo is.

40
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,504
Don Pablo, that's excellent.

41
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,575
Give me that pencil.

42
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,375
<i>When Pablo Escobar starts believing</i>

43
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:29,683
<i>the pen's mightier than the sword,
you know you're getting to him.</i>

44
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,855
<i>Carrillo's attacks on Pablo's facilities
in Medellín were putting him</i>

45
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,060
- <i>under more and more pressure.</i>
- Burn everything.

46
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,534
<i>The way Carrillo saw it...</i>

47
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:50,270
<i>each sicario we took out
got us one step closer to Escobar.</i>

48
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,080
Don't move! Felix, take this one.

49
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,514
Don't even think about it.
Up against the wall.

50
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,791
<i>While everyone could agree
it felt good emptying Pablo's pockets...</i>

51
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,122
We don't know yet. We're working on it.

52
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,296
<i>they weren't all sold on the method.</i>

53
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,393
Is it true?

54
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,130
- Not to my knowledge.
- Don't play word games with me.

55
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,233
If that kid's telling the truth,
Peña and Murphy were there.

56
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,643
They're the only Americans
that asshole trusts.

57
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:30,444
I find it hard to believe that Colonel
Carrillo would want American witnesses.

58
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,143
Exactly what he wants.

59
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,779
Guarantees they won't say shit if people
start asking questions. And guess what?

60
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,085
People are asking questions.

61
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,286
Look, if Carrillo wants
to walk out in the streets

62
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,924
and gun down every sicario in Medellín,
God bless him.

63
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:53,162
But our guys can't be there
when he does it. Understood?

64
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,798
Understood.

65
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,844
It's been quiet for about a week.
Nothing of significance.

66
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,609
But a phone we connected to Edgar Prisco
popped up three times last night.

67
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,583
All within Manrique,
the same three block vicinity here.

68
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,451
They just can't fucking help themselves,
can they?

69
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,287
My men did a drive-by early this morning
and identified a potential location.

70
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,828
Right here. The pool hall.

71
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,147
Are we having a good time?

72
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,962
That's a very pretty girl. But you're
paying for those lines, asshole.

73
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,662
Clean this shit up!

74
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,133
Who taught you to live like this?
Not from our mother!

75
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,345
Wake up, asshole! And you, Edgar!

76
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:14,979
Call Pablo and ask him
where he wants us to take his half.

77
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,251
All right. All right.

78
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,725
What are you doing calling
from that phone? Use the pay phone!

79
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,057
- Relax, brother.
- Edgar...

80
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,529
What?

81
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,533
- Have you been calling from this phone?
- No.

82
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,099
Son of a...

83
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,090
Move it, faggot!

84
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,638
Where you going?

85
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,620
Hey, there.

86
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,631
Murphy! Not a good neighborhood
to get yourself lost in, eh?

87
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,341
Fuck.

88
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,074
Dad.

89
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,813
- Quickly, inside.
- Friend.

90
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,490
Calm down, friend.

91
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,726
Everything is all right.

92
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,591
Fuck.

93
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,392
Murphy! Gavera 37!
You need to get up here!

94
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,607
Murphy, get in the car.

95
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,775
The fuck were you thinking?

96
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,185
This fucking close.

97
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:42,453
<i>We were definitely getting closer.</i>

98
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,429
<i>And so who could blame
the Gentlemen of Cali</i>

99
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,399
<i>for starting to think about a future
without Pablo Escobar?</i>

100
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,631
I can't believe it. You son of a bitch.

101
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,232
It's carbon rock.

102
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,910
The cocaine is dissolved and mixed in.

103
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,110
Did you think I bought chemistry labs
because I enjoyed the class in school?

104
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,949
You're going
to put chemists out of business.

105
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm more interested
in putting Pablo out of business.

106
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,325
Now's the time to move in on Miami.

107
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,160
It won't be hard for us
to take that business.

108
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,227
- But don't you think it's too early?
- Pablo's in hiding.

109
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:29,139
The Search Bloc is killing his men.
Soon they'll catch him,

110
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,576
and I want us to be in an advantageous
position when that happens.

111
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,678
Could you take care of that?

112
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,312
Yes, of course.

113
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,612
But don't make it too obvious.

114
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:47,590
I don't want Judy Moncada asking fucking
questions and negotiating for a piece.

115
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,186
Then you should call Pablo

116
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:55,700
and tell him we'd be happy
to turn Judy over to him.

117
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,669
We'll dump her in the same ditch
we'll be dumping him in.

118
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,844
Guys.

119
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,559
The Search Bloc took another Moncada lab.

120
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,289
The sons of bitches killed
three of the Prisco brothers.

121
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,854
Ricardo got away.

122
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,797
- When was this?
- Last night.

123
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,737
It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.
He's telling the cops everything.

124
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,399
Let's hide out on the coast.
I'll convince Don Pablo.

125
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,409
Since when do we hide, brother? Huh?

126
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,845
Let's trust the boss.

127
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,350
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

128
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,989
- Hello? Who is this?
- Get me Don Pablo. Fernando Duque.

129
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,392
- Fernando.
- Get him now.

130
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,932
Yes, sir, right away. Limón, please.

131
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,069
Boss?

132
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,909
Your lawyer, Mr. Duque.

133
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,178
- How many were published?
- Don Pablo,

134
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,881
we sent all of them to the newspapers.

135
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,753
How many of my letters were published,
Fernando?

136
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,227
Yes. None.

137
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,788
They're very, very well written.

138
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:39,271
It's not about how well written they were,
Fernando. It was the fucking truth!

139
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:57,417
<i>If it seemed like Escobar's world
was crashing down around him,</i>

140
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,549
<i>it was actually about to get worse.</i>

141
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,253
<i>Remember when Pablo collaborated
with M-19 communists</i>

142
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,560
<i>during the Palace of Justice siege?</i>

143
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,793
<i>By doing that,
he pissed off the Autodefensas...</i>

144
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,931
<i>an extreme right-wing
paramilitary group</i>

145
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,771
<i>that was in direct conflict
with the communist guerrillas.</i>

146
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:21,110
This is why we saw ourselves
forced to take up arms

147
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,670
and defend ourselves...

148
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:26,184
<i>The leaders of the Autodefensas
were the Castaño brothers.</i>

149
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,844
<i>Fidel and Carlos.</i>

150
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,355
<i>Carlos is the one
barking orders at people.</i>

151
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,516
<i>In the late 70s, their father, Jesus,</i>

152
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:37,085
<i>a prominent landowner,
was kidnapped by the FARC guerrillas</i>

153
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,292
<i>who demanded 50 million pesos
for his ransom.</i>

154
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,358
<i>But his sons were
only able to come up with 16.</i>

155
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,867
<i>Well, that didn't cut it.</i>

156
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,635
<i>So the guerrillas
beat the elder Castaño to death.</i>

157
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,376
<i>From that day forward,
the right-wing,</i>

158
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,110
<i>psychopathic, commie-killing
Castaño brothers</i>

159
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,983
<i>swore never to rest
until their father was avenged...</i>

160
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:07,657
<i>and every last guerrilla
driven from the countryside was killed.</i>

161
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,062
Move it, you sons of bitches!

162
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:17,634
<i>Even innocent villagers
who simply lived in guerrilla strongholds</i>

163
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,162
<i>were put to death because
they lived under communist subjugation.</i>

164
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,740
<i>And in their efforts to wipe out
the communist guerrillas...</i>

165
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:34,651
<i>the Castaños caught the attention
of some like-minded friends.</i>

166
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,687
- Mr. Stechner.
- Good to see you, my friend.

167
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,921
- Welcome. Have a nice trip?
- Thank you. As always, as always.

168
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,887
All right. Very good.

169
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,369
These weapons
are better than the last ones.

170
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,267
They should be.

171
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,567
Thank you, Mr. Green,
for the continued support of your country.

172
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,275
I haven't used that name
since the School of the Americas.

173
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,438
I know you're waging a great war
against communism in these jungles.

174
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,075
We will not stop
until the last communist is dead.

175
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,778
Another struggle is emerging.

176
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:14,225
One that is essential to our
shared cause.

177
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,392
Escobar.

178
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,794
Escobar deserves to die.

179
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:23,529
But our fight is here in the jungle,
against the guerrilla.

180
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,971
Yes, and Pablo's still strong in Medellín.

181
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:30,236
Yeah, strength is exceedingly relative.

182
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:41,586
An alliance is forming
with the objective of taking out Escobar.

183
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,780
Who?

184
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,220
Rival elements from the trafficking world.

185
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:50,426
Look, what matters most is that
when Escobar's taken off the board,

186
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,455
the right parties are in a position
to make sure order is maintained.

187
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:58,265
And that strategic Colombian resources
and revenue streams...

188
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,263
don't fall into the wrong hands.

189
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,144
Guys.

190
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,814
Ms. Judy.

191
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:58,697
All right, now... I would like
to know the reason for this meeting.

192
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,530
- You don't see this every day.
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.

193
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,660
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.

194
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,903
We know you all joined forces against him.

195
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,912
And we want to know if it's possible
for my brother and I to join the cause.

196
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:18,575
Why? What do you want out of this?

197
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,710
- We want what's best for Colombia.
- That's it?

198
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,189
Pablo Escobar,
aside from being a terrorist,

199
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:30,661
is also allied with the guerrillas,
whom he has helped on many occasions.

200
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,765
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar
is a patriotic act.

201
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,826
Imagine, Pacho, your financial resources

202
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:44,343
combined with all of the information
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation

203
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,211
- with our military experience...
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.

204
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:55,448
No, no, no, Mrs. Moncada. No.
A death squad? No. An army.

205
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,716
And when this army gets to Medellín,

206
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,691
Pablo Escobar's death
won't be a matter of months.

207
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,127
It'll be a matter of weeks.

208
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,698
What do you say, Pacho?

209
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:09,224
Can we count on the support
of you and your partners?

210
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,102
All of this sounds interesting.

211
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,147
With all due respect, gentlemen,

212
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:28,449
our organization already
has a strategy in place, and it's working.

213
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,251
It doesn't seem to me like it's working.

214
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,623
Because, to this day,
Pablo Escobar is still alive.

215
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:38,322
- That's right.
- At this rate, not for long.

216
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,997
Look, I'll share this conversation
with our partners.

217
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:50,838
But I think that, for now,
our answer is no.

218
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,106
Excuse me.

219
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,102
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
- How did you find me?

220
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,036
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

221
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,472
- And La Quica?
- He's not here.

222
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,705
He's back there, looking for you.

223
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:33,517
If he finds out I'm here, he'll want to
kill me too. Let's talk. Relax.

224
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:38,517
Because of you,
I'll never be able to go back to Medellín.

225
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:39,955
- Maritza!
- Because of you,

226
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,120
- my daughter and I have to live in hiding.
- Relax, relax, relax!

227
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,962
I really am sorry,
and I'm here because I want to help you.

228
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,696
Like you helped the girls
you used to drive around in your taxi?

229
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,865
- I had nothing to do with that.
- And why would I believe you?

230
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:58,035
Because you know me,
and I wouldn't do something like that.

231
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,240
You killed me, Jhon.

232
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,339
You killed me by putting me
in your fucking taxi.

233
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,910
You knew how badly I needed that money
and you took advantage of that.

234
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,589
I really am sorry, Maritza.

235
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,682
Believe me, I think I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

236
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,750
What is it?

237
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,593
We'll give them what they want.
We'll give them Escobar.

238
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,169
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Believe me, Maritza.

239
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:32,109
I'm the one who drives Escobar.
I know when his sicarios aren't with him.

240
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,942
- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on here?

241
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,848
Mom, go back inside. Go inside.

242
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,785
Doña Liliana.

243
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,047
- I don't trust the police.
- Listen to me.

244
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,584
This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

245
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,720
so you can leave with your daughter.

246
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:01,100
And you?
What do you get out of this?

247
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:05,074
Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.
They're killing all of his men.

248
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,475
I'm afraid.

249
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:12,984
I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

250
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,858
All right. My turn.

251
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,462
You both look beautiful.

252
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:14,040
All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

253
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,026
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

254
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,163
Velasco told me.

255
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,998
There are 20 men out there, Tata.

256
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:13,335
Yes, Pablo, 20 strangers.

257
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,736
Let's see.

258
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,769
How do you hold it?

259
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:37,386
What? Are you sure you want to laugh
at your wife while she's holding a gun?

260
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:42,296
- It's not a joke, Pablo.
- Tata.

261
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:46,065
Those 20 men out there
don't care what happens to us.

262
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,808
When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

263
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,039
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

264
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:07,116
All right.

265
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,954
But I think you need
more practice with that.

266
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,149
- Javi, it's Gabriela.
- What's up?

267
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,749
- It's been a while and I want to see you.
- Now?

268
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,960
I can't right now. I'm working.

269
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,855
Don't be like that.

270
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:58,370
All right. Give me...
20 minutes, all right?

271
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,140
Get the lecture from Messina
about not leaving base?

272
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,204
Yeah.

273
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,680
Crosby must've really laid into her
on that one.

274
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:20,331
- Where you going?
- Out. Off base.

275
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,659
Okay, I guess it means fuck that.

276
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,496
Hello.

277
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,502
- I've got half an hour.
- Wait.

278
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:36,572
- Javi, Javi, Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

279
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,044
Hello.

280
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,087
Hi.

281
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,986
She's a friend of a friend.

282
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,250
Maritza, meet Javier.

283
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,420
And...

284
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,832
why are you introducing me
to a friend of a friend?

285
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,670
She's in trouble.

286
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,400
Just hear her out.

287
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,703
Goddammit, Gabby.
You could have told me over the phone, no?

288
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,835
- I knew you wouldn't come.
- Well, I'm leaving.

289
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,744
- Bye!
- No, no, no.

290
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,612
Wait. It's important.

291
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,017
Please.

292
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,419
Hear her out.

293
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,365
What's your name? Maritza?

294
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,431
What kind of trouble are you in?

295
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,475
Who are you in trouble with?

296
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:45,244
- La Quica.
- La Quica. You know La Quica?

297
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,317
- He wants to kill me.
- Well...

298
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,653
La Quica wants to kill a lot of people.

299
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,593
Why does he want to kill you?

300
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,590
Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

301
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,735
And how are you going to do that?

302
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,115
I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

303
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,680
Her name is Maritza Rincón.

304
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,954
She works at the market across from
the brothel where the girls were killed.

305
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,325
Where we almost had La Quica
and the other guy...

306
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,031
Jhon Burgos. Goes by Limón.

307
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:39,092
He used to drive the girls around until
La Quica made him Escobar's chauffeur.

308
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:43,039
This girl Maritza was actually
in the back seat serving as a cover

309
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,041
while Escobar was in the fucking trunk.

310
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,874
- And he knows her how?
- They grew up together here.

311
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,018
So this guy Limón,
there's no record of him.

312
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,953
There's no known connection
between him and Escobar,

313
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,991
yet somehow he ends up the driver.

314
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,289
Makes sense for La Quica to hire someone
the police didn't know about.

315
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,660
What does she want out of this?
A ticket to Disneyland?

316
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,200
She knows she doesn't get shit
if it doesn't pan out.

317
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:13,704
If this is true, she can tell
us when Limón and Escobar go somewhere.

318
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,902
You were there. You trust her?

319
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:23,847
Yeah.

320
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,473
Yeah, I do.

321
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,086
When we get the location, I want
Centra Spike up in the air to confirm.

322
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,357
Let's go.

323
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,235
- All right. This is good.
- Let's go.

324
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,737
Can you explain this?

325
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,883
A subpoena.

326
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:01,908
You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

327
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,086
You mean your witch hunt.

328
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,860
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

329
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,456
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

330
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:19,230
How many times do I have to tell you
that I don't know how Escobar escaped?

331
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,574
He must have paid someone off.

332
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:26,600
I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

333
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:34,242
This is about transparency, truth, law.

334
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,656
And I sense from your reluctance to speak

335
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:44,628
that the truth will not be kind to you
or our esteemed president.

336
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:52,666
Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

337
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:56,401
I must confess that we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

338
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,740
but we're talking about a national crisis.

339
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:06,274
So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you?

340
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:12,120
Look, sir...
I ask you to please trust me.

341
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,456
All you're doing by making
this investigation public

342
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:23,161
is destroying the life of a very good
human being, our president.

343
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:28,206
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

344
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:43,552
Hello?

345
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,521
Hello, Maritza. It's me.

346
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:49,889
- I spoke with Peña.
- Pay attention.

347
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:54,464
In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant.

348
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:00,862
He lives in the south. I need you to give
the Americans the address. Understand?

349
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,169
Are we really going to turn in
Pablo Escobar?

350
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:10,741
Yes, Maritza.
We're going to do this together.

351
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,185
But I need you to trust me.

352
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:17,847
Give me the address.

353
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,721
Write it down.

354
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:25,060
9th street with 98-3. Got it?

355
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,863
Got it.

356
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:45,581
My love. Do it again.

357
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:49,044
I'm sorry, boss.
You'll be late to your appointment.

358
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,179
Thank you, Limón. A kiss.

359
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:55,591
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and...

360
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,525
Everything all right, boss?

361
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:26,648
Peña.

362
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:31,319
9th Street. 98-3.

363
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,551
Okay. Got it.

364
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,056
I need to know
if there's activity around this address.

365
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,532
You get a match on a voice,
you find me immediately.

366
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,124
Okay. You got it.

367
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,421
- This was recorded about five minutes ago.
- You can barely hear it.

368
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,516
Let me clean it up.

369
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:17,660
All right.
Now turn off the satellite phones.

370
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,431
- That's Pablo.
- We have to move now.

371
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,665
- Yeah.
- You two are staying here.

372
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,671
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

373
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,541
Crosby finds out you went on another raid,
we all get a ticket home.

374
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,205
Crosby doesn't have to know shit.

375
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,611
It's not negotiable.

376
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,353
We'll be in radio contact.

377
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,186
Jesus.

378
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:54,195
We'll be out in 20 minutes.
So be on alert.

379
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,603
Yes, Colonel.

380
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,940
Attention! We're headed out!

381
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,301
We're on San Juan.

382
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,001
Copy that. Watch your six, guys.

383
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,670
How's it looking out there?

384
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:39,341
Everything's calm.
Murphy, you're buying the drinks tonight.

385
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,248
Cheap bastards.

386
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,016
Don't forget to pick me and Peña up
some cigars on the way.

387
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,284
Of course, blondie.

388
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,705
Reverse!

389
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,276
Look above!

390
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,440
It's an ambush!

391
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:14,716
Sabada!

392
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,221
Carrillo, respond!
Carrillo! Trujillo! Do you copy?

393
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,385
Son of a bitch!

394
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,124
Goddamn it, speak to me!
We need people there.

395
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,189
Carrillo!

396
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,229
Go, go, go! Come on!

397
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:47,982
Fuck!

398
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,049
Look at me.

399
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,022
Look at me.

400
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:48,205
You asked a child to give me this.

401
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,893
You can have it back.

402
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,430
And this...

403
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,935
is for my cousin, Gustavo.

404
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,606
Coward.

405
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,166
Son of a bitch.

406
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,517
Don't worry. It's going to heal well.

407
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,354
I'll go back to Bogotá
with the body until the funeral.

408
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,022
They call his wife?

409
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,155
Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.

410
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,561
This ain't on you, Javi.
It's on Escobar.

411
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,002
And one way or another, he pays.

412
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,767
We all do. Right?

413
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:52,323
This isn't your fault, Peña.

414
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,797
- No?
- No.

415
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,099
- I got played.
- We all got played.

416
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:06,109
We all had the information,
it was backed up by Centra Spike...

417
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:07,235
Stop.

418
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:10,942
Just...

419
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,344
You know, you coming here...

420
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,458
you say all the right things.

421
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,828
Doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

422
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:37,605
Colonel Carrillo's funeral
will be tomorrow.

423
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:43,605
I don't do funerals.

424
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,295
They're saying
that Pablo himself killed Carrillo.

425
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,368
Next, he'll come after the two of you.

426
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:16,968
Or me, or you, Pacho.

427
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:20,066
No, no.
We've got to come up with another plan.

428
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,444
Another approach.
Another way to achieve our goals.

429
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:28,708
Pacho, we need to call the Castaños.

430
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:33,617
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

431
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:10,917
Carrillo hasn't been buried yet
and they're already asking for my head.

432
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,788
They want a scapegoat.

433
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,295
And we have to give them one.

434
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:31,444
That's why we're going to say that you
were poorly advised by your vice minister.

435
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:37,849
- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

436
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:41,892
We're going to say that I acted alone
and without authorization

437
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,017
when I entered La Catedral.

438
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:48,891
And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

439
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,833
I don't accept your resignation.

440
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:02,402
Now, more than ever, the country
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.

441
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:05,005
We have to do it, César.

442
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:11,752
You know it. The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

443
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:14,826
everyone's looking for someone to blame.
All of them.

444
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,421
And it's not going to be you.

445
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:29,103
It's been my honor serving you
and the people of Colombia.

446
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,522
Good luck.

447
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:02,629
Limón told me you have a daughter.

448
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,597
How old?

449
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:13,299
- Two.
- And what's her name?

450
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:19,141
- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

451
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:30,522
This is the second time
that I've felt indebted to you.

452
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:40,335
Now, Maritza,
our daughters will be safe.

453
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,569
Thank you.

454
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:50,412
Know that you have a friend in me.

455
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,864
What did you do?

456
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:11,493
I took care of it.

457
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,497
You're safe now.

458
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,540
Limón.

459
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,798
Hey.

460
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:18,762
What are you doing here?

461
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,106
Where's Olivia?

462
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:28,145
She's at home. With my sister.

463
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:40,412
Hey, you okay?

464
00:52:48,432 --> 00:52:50,423
Hey.

465
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:19,985
What now?

466
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:22,460
What the fuck do you want?

467
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,997
I want to help you.

468
