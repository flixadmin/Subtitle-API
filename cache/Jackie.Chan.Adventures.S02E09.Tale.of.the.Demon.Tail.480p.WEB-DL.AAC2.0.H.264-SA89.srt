1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,204
Jade, captain black
pulled strings

2
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:06,939
to get you a seat
in the dugout.

3
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:08,707
Why aren't you
watching the game?

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,909
T'ch, and miss
the real excitement?

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:14,013
You mean danger. The dark hand
is here somewhere

6
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,914
looking for a demon portal.

7
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,717
So, if they open,
you just toot the flute

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,120
and high-fly the demon
out of the park,

9
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,288
back where he belongs.

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,792
Do you have everything you
need for the sky demon
chi spell, uncle?

11
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,862
Bat wing dust,
lotus oil,

12
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:32,431
hummingbird saliva,
root beer.

13
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,299
Root beer?

14
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:35,434
Sorry. Mine.

15
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,471
Oh, that's
your fifth soda.

16
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,373
One for every Fenway frank.

17
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,275
Had to wash 'em down
with something.

18
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,978
I do not know
where she puts it all.

19
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,980
Ooh, pit stop.

20
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:50,015
You have to do this now?

21
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,418
Hello...
5 sodas.

22
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:09,601
Whoa, boss. We can't go
where no man has gone
before.

23
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,571
We are not going in, fool.

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,409
Hsi wu, the sky demon,
is coming out.

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,058
Jade.

26
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,612
Jade.

27
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,786
Tohru, we must prepare
the chi spell.

28
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,395
Jade!

29
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,331
¶ Ta-da-da-da-da-da ¶

30
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,399
charge!

31
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,906
I'm sorry. I'll pay for these
later. Thank you.

32
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,981
Get your programs?

33
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,490
Foul!

34
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,725
Uncle.

35
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,028
Hold your horses!

36
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,900
Welcome back, hsi wu.

37
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,769
(Bat hits ball,
crowd cheers)

38
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,705
The crowd roars for me?

39
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,607
Uncle...

40
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,109
Hehhhhh...

41
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,377
Hyahhhh! Hyah!

42
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,780
Ahh...

43
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,915
Get...Back...In.

44
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,517
Come on, come on, come on.

45
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,086
About time.

46
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,227
(Chi chanting)

47
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,528
The old man.

48
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,396
(Uncle continues
chanting)

49
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,165
Add these to our bill.

50
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,973
(Humming)

51
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:04,176
I am never going back,
mortal.

52
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,144
(Uncle still chanting)

53
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,586
It appears
I am here to stay.

54
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,289
Jade's been in the dugout,
but she's back in the game.

55
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,291
Aah!

56
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,392
Ow.

57
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,795
(Hissing)

58
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,298
Jade, don't open the door.

59
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,399
Duh!

60
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,500
Now?

61
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,169
Please.

62
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,237
(Plays)

63
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,773
(Grunts)

64
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,709
Ewww...

65
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,412
Retrieve my tail.

66
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,951
It didn't work.

67
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:50,722
Of course it did not work.
The demon is out of range.

68
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,391
The tail.

69
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,127
I don't care if you are
wearing a dress, valmont.

70
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,230
You are not going in
the little girls' room.

71
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:01,333
Ach...Ahh...

72
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,075
Captain black,
aren't you out of
your jurisdiction?

73
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:13,245
Let's just say
we love the Red Sox.

74
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,680
Jackie...

75
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:17,215
Check it out.

76
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,650
(Gremlin sounds)

77
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,788
Aiyaaaa!

78
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,291
Jackie,
restrain the tail.

79
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,361
Ooh, I'm trying, uncle.

80
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,731
Aiy, aiy, aiy!

81
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,233
I don't think it
likes you, Jackie.

82
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,135
Oh.

83
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,838
Ooh-hoo, get it off.
Get it off of me.

84
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,810
The tail seeks its owner:
Hsi wu, the sky demon.

85
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,879
Hotcha.

86
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,381
(Gremlin sounds cease)

87
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,123
This box is now protected
by a chi spell.

88
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,659
Bad magic cannot touch it.

89
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:05,464
Until we devise a way to use
the tail to our advantage...

90
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,433
We must be very cautious.

91
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:13,472
This chi powder will also keep
any demon from entering...

92
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,808
Unless they are invited.

93
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,584
Ow. (Hisses)

94
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:32,457
So, I need
an invitation, do I?

95
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,662
Hey, Jade, you going
to the spring dance
Friday night?

96
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,097
Was thinking about it.

97
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,434
Well, who you gonna
go with, a ninja?

98
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:46,238
Or do you only fight 'em?
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

99
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,876
T'ch, you're a riot, drew.

100
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,451
(Laughter)

101
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:03,188
Hey, drew, who you gonna with,
your mother?

102
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,324
(Stammers) N-no.
I--I--I...

103
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,661
Mama's boy.

104
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,830
Thanks, uh...

105
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:15,901
I'm hsi w...S-s-Seymour
wu...Jahoositz.

106
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,370
Jade chan.
You must be new.

107
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:23,008
Yeah, I just flew into town.
So, Jade, is it true?

108
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,210
Of course. What?

109
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,913
Do you really fight ninjas?

110
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,714
You bet.

111
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:33,618
And Jackie
was knocking them off
the roller-coaster tracks.

112
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,353
That is so awesome.

113
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,988
T'ch, that was nothing.

114
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,358
Lately, Jackie's been taking
on way worse than ninjas.

115
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
Like what?

116
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:44,029
Well, you probably
won't believe this,

117
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,498
but yesterday,
we captured
part of a demon.

118
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,833
No way.

119
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,468
Way. Wanna see it?

120
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,369
You bet.

121
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,639
(Dings)

122
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,746
Uh, maybe we shouldn't.

123
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,849
I wouldn't wanna get you
into trouble.

124
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,251
T'ch, trouble follows me.
Come on in.

125
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,386
Ok.

126
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,726
I guarantee you've never
seen anything like this.

127
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,862
You'd be surprised, Jade.

128
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,311
Freaky, huh?

129
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,281
Jade, what are you doing?

130
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,883
(Gasps)

131
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,285
And who are you?

132
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,753
Uncle, what's going on?

133
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,423
Jade opened the box with
the "you know what" inside.

134
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,126
Jade, you know
you're not supposed
to open the box

135
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,028
with the
"you know what" inside.

136
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,631
Jade, didn't open it.
I did.

137
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:57,035
Hmm, bad magic
cannot touch good.

138
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,438
Show me your burn marks,
demon boy.

139
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,275
I didn't mean to cause
any trouble, sir.

140
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:07,112
I just wanted to see
the "you know what"
inside.

141
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,416
(Grumbles)

142
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,218
This is Seymour.

143
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,886
Hi.
Hello.

144
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,290
Well, it was nice
meeting everybody.

145
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:27,432
This friend of Jade's
is too polite.

146
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,902
Uncle, Jade finally has
a friend her own age.

147
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,839
This could keep her away
from portals and demons.

148
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,375
Seymour, thanks
for taking the hit.

149
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,444
Nobody's ever
done that for me.

150
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,580
Hey, what are friends for?

151
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,315
Well, see you tomorrow?

152
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:44,416
Probably.

153
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,284
(Sighs)

154
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:51,590
Ow. Until tomorrow, then.

155
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,201
Seymour's
loads more fun than any
of the other kids at school.

156
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,671
We like the same things,
and he actually listens
to me.

157
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,777
We're like yin and Yang,
Yang and yin.

158
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,079
Good and evil?

159
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,382
Left and right. 2 parts
of the same whole. Duh.

160
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,951
I'm just not sure
if Seymour knows it.

161
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,887
Why don't you ask him
to the school dance?

162
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,625
Eww...Like on a date?
We're friends.

163
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,894
Besides, what if he says no?

164
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,734
Since the tail
wants to find its owner,

165
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:39,137
I will coat it with the proper
chi spell ingredients...

166
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,208
Then release it and let it
lead us to hsi wu...

167
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,178
Where it will reattach,
infusing the demon with
the chi spell...

168
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,482
Which I will activate
by blowing the flute.

169
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,984
Aiyaah!

170
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,921
Blow only once
the tail attaches.

171
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,594
What's all that, uncle?

172
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,096
Mung bean sandwiches
for the trip.

173
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,631
Trip?

174
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,467
The sky demon could
be halfway around
the globe by now.

175
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,706
So, we going inside to study?

176
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,074
Maybe later.

177
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,144
I--I have something
I wanna give you first.

178
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,448
See? It's
a friendship medallion.

179
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,351
You know, 2 halves
of the same coin.

180
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:32,457
Gee, I'd love to see how I--
how we look in them.

181
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,225
Do you have a mirror inside?

182
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,760
You really like it?

183
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,662
You can wear it
to the spring dance.

184
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,866
I'd wear mine, but I don't
know if I'm going. Are you?

185
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,804
Me? Why would I--
well, actually,

186
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,572
I was thinking
about going,

187
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,675
but I need
to call my mother first
and get her permission.

188
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,211
I guess I'll have to go
inside to use your phone.

189
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,847
No prob.

190
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,185
We got a dog?

191
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,954
Interesting camouflage,
uncle.

192
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,028
I smell a spell.

193
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,232
Strike.

194
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,970
Ahh, hsi wu. I told you
I did not like him.

195
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,572
You're...You're...

196
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:25,009
A demon? Still wanna go
to the dance with me?

197
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,378
Not. Unh.

198
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,716
No! After the tail
attaches.

199
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,251
Ohh!

200
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,755
Yeee!

201
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:40,191
You will remove the spell
from my tail, dear uncle,

202
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,760
or perish.

203
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,828
Jackie: Uncle!

204
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,342
Jade, go back
to section 13.

205
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,910
But this is personal.

206
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,545
All the more reason.

207
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,846
Promise me.

208
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,948
Grrr...Promise.

209
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,993
What have you done
to my tail, sly uncle?

210
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,229
Ancient proverb--
none of your beeswax.

211
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,732
I am in no mood for games.

212
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,034
Now remove your spell
from my tail,

213
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,637
or you will wish
you had wings.

214
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,139
What is hexed
cannot be unhexed.

215
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,642
Then cast
another spell. Ow!

216
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:34,045
How can I cast a spell
without my spell books?

217
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,047
Ohh...

218
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,049
Hsi wu went this way.

219
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,753
We need wings to find uncle.

220
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,924
The sky demon.

221
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,533
My mistake.

222
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,137
Shoo.

223
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,710
Mung bean.

224
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,412
From uncle's sandwich?

225
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,648
A trail of mung beans.

226
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,836
Fight fire with fire.

227
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,973
Find yin with Yang.

228
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,252
Greetings, brother wu.

229
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,453
Did you bring them?

230
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,723
The geezer's books.
Right here.

231
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,292
Nosebleed city.

232
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:06,504
Well, you have your texts.
Seek a spell.

233
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,677
These are not
my reading glasses.

234
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,346
Grrr...

235
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,514
Gaah!

236
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,317
Uncle, run.

237
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,954
Where to?

238
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,389
Get chan!

239
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:34,599
(Grunts)

240
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,570
Huh? What the--

241
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:43,374
hey, friend.
Wanna dance?

242
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,276
Let's.

243
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,989
Hyah!

244
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,290
Ohh!

245
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,292
You! But how?

246
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,860
Talisman math:

247
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,831
Levitation plus speed
equals flight.

248
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,367
Ahh...Jade!
What are you--

249
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,869
how did you--
where did you--

250
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,504
talk later.

251
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,546
Gaah! Unh!

252
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,316
Owwwww...

253
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,987
Unh. Jackie...
Zipper is stuck!

254
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,722
My tail.

255
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,794
Aiyeeeaaahhh!

256
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,663
Ahh, uncle!

257
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,700
Ah, thank you.

258
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,870
Jade, you must release
hsi wu's tail.

259
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,605
You got it.

260
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,614
Uncle's cool.

261
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,285
I'll find my own spell.

262
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,021
Mine.

263
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,555
Grrr...

264
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,848
Ha ha. Nougat.

265
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,728
Unh. It won't open.

266
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,229
Aah!

267
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,957
The choice is yours,
Jackie chan.

268
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,960
Crash or burn.

269
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,382
(Strains)

270
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,718
Yes.

271
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,124
Jackie, time to toot.

272
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,732
I want my tail.

273
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,068
All yours.

274
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,837
No, wait.

275
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,575
Aah!

276
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,445
(Uncle chanting)

277
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,016
Tails...You lose.

278
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,086
(Chanting chi)

279
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,522
Once more
with feeling.

280
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,824
(Really blows)

281
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,372
So long, Seymour.

282
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,377
I told you that boy
was too polite.

283
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,647
Uncle, shh, shh.
I'm sorry, Jade.

284
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,116
I know you wanted to go
to the dance tonight.

285
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,919
T'ch, so I could do
the funky chicken
with a demon?

286
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,153
Dream on.

287
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,928
(Sighs) You were right about
the good and evil thing, t.

288
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,063
There will be
other dances, Jade.

289
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,300
Dance schmance.
I am so over Seymour.

290
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:05,236
I just miss having
someone around who listens.

291
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,737
Hmm...

292
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,574
Someone like you.

293
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,151
Yin and Yang.
Big and small.

294
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,953
You and me.

295
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,127
-Hey, Jackie,
-yes

296
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,430
what do you like
to put on your pizza?

297
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,933
One--only one kind--
pepperoni.

298
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,803
Double pepperoni.
Very thin one.

299
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:42,139
And well, well done.
And very hot.

300
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,976
That's all. Yeah.
