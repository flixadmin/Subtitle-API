1
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,916
I remember.

2
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,416
I remember everything.

3
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,458
CROSSROADS

4
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,666
What are you doing here?

5
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,583
The boy we found in the forest.

6
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,666
What’s going to happen to him now?

7
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,416
If you don’t figure out who he is

8
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,000
he’ll be cremated
and buried in an anonymous grave.

9
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,291
How long
has he been dead?

10
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,750
It’s all in my report.

11
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,791
When you found him,
ten hours, more or less.

12
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,625
Is it possible that he...

13
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,833
Purely hypothetically,

14
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,666
is it possible he’s been dead for longer,
and was somehow preserved?

15
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,166
Preserved?

16
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,541
You mean, like frozen?

17
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,875
If so, there would be traces in the tissue.
I would’ve noticed.

18
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,791
Frozen steak isn’t like fresh steak.

19
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,583
- So that’s a no.
- Nope. Not that I’m aware of.

20
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,416
How long of a preservation period
are we talking about?

21
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,375
- Thirty-three years.
- Thirty-three years?

22
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,291
The way he looks?
That’s pretty much impossible.

23
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,916
MISSING

24
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,083
What day is it today?

25
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,666
- Pardon?
- What day is it today?

26
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,583
November 9th.

27
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,875
I know this sounds crazy...

28
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:20,958
but what year?

29
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,125
’86.

30
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,041
Thanks.

31
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,458
Wait.

32
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,666
Are you looking for someone?

33
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,833
Yes.

34
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,583
A friend.

35
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,791
Michael Kahnwald.

36
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,375
Never heard of him.

37
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,583
- Ines Kahnwald’s son?
- The nurse?

38
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,000
She doesn’t have any kids.

39
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,041
Do you know where I can find Ines?

40
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,875
At the hospital maybe.

41
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,625
Well, see you.

42
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,291
Regina, you stupid four-eyes!

43
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,708
We got the power plant shift schedule
for the night Mads disappeared.

44
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,125
I want you to interview them
so we can check their routes and times.

45
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,541
- Maybe we’ll find something.
- Can’t someone else do that?

46
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,708
I’m working on the case with his brother.

47
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,000
A rape charge.

48
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,250
I mean, we never did consider

49
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,833
whether he may be involved
in his brother’s disappearance.

50
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,750
Yes.

51
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,375
Egon.

52
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,500
This isn’t the 1950s.

53
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,791
We don’t base investigations on hunches,
but on evidence.

54
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,125
You have three months until retirement.

55
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,458
Then you can do whatever you want.
Until then, you do what I want.

56
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,500
33 YEARS?

57
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,708
’86.

58
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,708
’86. ’86.

59
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,541
<i>I’m just saying</i>

60
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,083
the ground shook yesterday.

61
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,250
I know this isn’t an earthquake zone,
but the ground shook.

62
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,166
- The search warrant for the power plant.
- I have to go.

63
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,041
You have my number
in case you think of anything.

64
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,000
Should I tell Ulrich?

65
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,208
No. Why would anyone talk to me?

66
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,750
Egon.

67
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,375
Helge. You’re the one I wanted to see.

68
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,208
Can I help you?

69
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,625
It’s about the missing Nielsen boy.

70
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,541
The night he disappeared,
you were on your shift, right?

71
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,208
Yes.

72
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,750
Martin wants to document and corroborate
the routes and times

73
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,208
of everyone who was near here that night.

74
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,791
I have to do my rounds
and check the blocks now.

75
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,791
Okay.

76
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,666
Let’s arrange a time
for you to come to the station.

77
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,833
- Day after tomorrow.
- Tuesday.

78
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,541
Is 10:30 okay?

79
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,083
That works.

80
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,166
Sorry for the trouble.

81
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,875
It’s no trouble.

82
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,958
I just didn’t see anything.
What I mean is...

83
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,291
Everything was totally normal.

84
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,458
Your shift ended at six?

85
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,375
Yes, that’s when the night shift starts.

86
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,625
Did you take your car?

87
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,041
I took the state road.

88
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,000
Were you heading somewhere else?
Because you took the state road instead.

89
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,875
Isn’t the forest road shorter?

90
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,125
Yeah.

91
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,833
I just picked something up for my father.

92
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,875
See you Tuesday.

93
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,208
Helge?

94
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,333
One more question.

95
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,208
Did you see his brother anywhere that day?

96
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,083
The older Nielsen boy, Ulrich.

97
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,291
Nope.

98
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,875
Till Tuesday.

99
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,666

INTERVIEW: HELGE DOPPLER
WHY NOT FOREST ROAD?

102
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,625
“10:30, interview with Helge Doppler.
Why not forest road?”

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,458
SEARCH WARRANT

104
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,583
Can I help you?

105
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,416
Shouldn’t you be in school?

106
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,666
I’m sick.

107
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,583
Well, you look just fine to me.

108
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,458
I hurt my arm. I’m headed to the hospital.

109
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,833
Get in. I’ll drive you there.

110
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,958
“Bosch, Teller, Voigt,
Fleischer, Brandt... Doppler, Helge.

111
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,541
“27.”

CASE: NIELSEN, MADS
STATEMENT: FUCHS, DOREEN

113
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,916
CASE: NIELSEN, MADS
STATEMENT: DOPPLER, HELGE

114
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,250
Yes?

115
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,791
Did you know
that in 1986 your father-in-law

116
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,958
<i>was to be interviewed
in my brother’s case?</i>

117
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:37,875
No.

118
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,291
I went through all the files.

119
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,666
<i>Helge was supposed to be questioned
on Tuesday, November 11, 1986.</i>

120
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,375
<i>Exactly 33 years ago,
from the day after tomorrow.</i>

121
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,833
But there is no statement. He didn’t show.

122
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,375
There’s just a note.

123
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:56,541
- “Why not forest road?”
- So you think Helge abducted Mads in 1986?

124
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,000
And now Mikkel and the other boys
33 years later?

125
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,375
- Where is he now?
<i>- In the nursing home. Ulrich!</i>

126
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,083
He’s 75 years old. He has dementia.

127
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,541
And the evening Mikkel disappeared,

128
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,208
<i>Helge was with me.</i>

129
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,750
But the evening before Yasin vanished,
Wöller found Helge in the forest.

130
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,458
And took him back to the nursing home.

131
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,500
<i>Somehow this all has to do with Mads.</i>

132
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,666
- You’re barking up the wrong tree.
<i>- Maybe.</i>

133
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,166
But maybe not.

134
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,541
What’s your name?

135
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,000
Jonas.

136
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,750
And why didn’t you have
your parents drive you?

137
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,666
My mom is at work.

138
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,250
My dad’s dead.

139
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,958
Where does your mother work?

140
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,416
At the power plant.

141
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,208
The power plant has changed Winden.

142
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,791
This place used to look different.

143
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,500
What’s that there?

144
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,833
Earphones.

145
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,041
Those aren’t earphones.

146
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,708
You just put them in your ears.

147
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,875
Now I’ve seen it all.

148
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,750
It’s a shortcut.

149
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,583
Well, here we are.

150
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,125
Wait.

151
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,250
Among you teenagers,

152
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,500
is...

153
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,125
Is Satanism a thing right now?

154
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,458
No idea.

155
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,916
No, I don’t know. I don’t think so.

156
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Call your mom to pick you up.

157
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,666
It’s best not to walk
through the forest alone right now.

158
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,625
Thanks.

159
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,583
I’m looking for Ines Kahnwald.

160
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,583
- She was just outside with the boy.
- What boy?

161
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,083
What do you want Ines for?

162
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,666
I’m visiting and I locked myself out.

163
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,041
Ines didn’t mention a visitor.

164
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,416
Are you related?

165
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,791
Yes, you could say that.

166
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,000
Maybe she’s still out back.

167
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:08,375
- Otherwise, I’ll tell her when I see her.
- No, I don’t want to be any trouble.

168
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,625
Mr. Doppler?

169
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,708
Mr. Doppler?

170
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,875
My name is Ulrich Nielsen.
I’m a police officer.

171
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,416
Don’t be scared.
I just want to ask you a few questions.

172
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,833
In 1986, a boy from Winden vanished,
Mads Nielsen.

173
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,375
Do you remember?

174
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,875
You were summoned to the station for
questioning, but there’s no transcript.

175
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,916
What does
“why not forest road” mean?

176
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,833
- He is...
- What does “why not forest road” mean?

177
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,250
- It’s him!
- What does it mean?

178
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,791
- What are you doing here?
- It was him!

179
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,375
- I’m a cop. I want to ask a few questions.
- I know you!

180
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,708
What? What did you say?

181
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,375
- You have to go!
- What? Why were you summoned?

182
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,375
- I can change it. I can change the past.
- I need help!

183
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,958
And the future.

184
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,458
What did you say?

185
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,375
- What did you say? Where is Mikkel?
- Let him go!

186
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,125
Where is my son? Where is Mikkel?

187
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,166
Let me go! Tell me where my son is!

188
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,208
Where is my son? Where is Mikkel?

189
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,083
Let me go!

190
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,541
- Let me go! Don’t touch me!
- I can change it.

191
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,541
I can change the past.

192
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>And the future.</i>

193
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,083
<i>Tick-tock.</i>

194
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,125
<i>Tick-tock.</i>

195
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,791
<i>Tick-tock.</i>

196
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,625
<i>Tick-tock.</i>

197
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,458
Look! I managed to find another one.

198
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,000
How little we understand of the world.

199
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:51,625
Is this real?

200
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,541
Or am I crazy, just like my father?

201
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:59,750
Do you even exist?
Or are you the hallucination of a lunatic?

202
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,541
You’re not crazy, neither was your father.

203
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,416
Sometimes it’s hard for us
to grasp things that go against

204
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,333
all we are conditioned to believe.

205
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,666
How did people feel the first time
they were told the Earth was round?

206
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,583
- Yes, it is. It’s totally insane.
- And if it’s not?

207
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,500
How can that be?
Is there a breach in time in the cave?

208
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,333
So Mikkel hangs out here
until he becomes my father?

209
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,583
Even if you don’t want to believe it,
that is your father.

210
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,166
That means...

211
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,416
that Ulrich is my grandfather and...

212
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,166
Martha is your aunt.

213
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,833
That’s bullshit.

214
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,041
I’m taking him back
and putting this right.

215
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,791
Don’t you get it?

216
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,916
If you take Mikkel back, you’ll be
meddling in the course of events.

217
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:03,708
Your father will never meet your mother,
they won’t fall in love or get married.

218
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,958
And you won’t be born!

219
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,500
If you take him back now,

220
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,916
you’ll be erasing your own existence.

221
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,375
The role you play in all of this
is much bigger than you think.

222
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:24,291
But every decision for something
is a decision against something else.

223
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,625
A life for a life.

224
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,041
What will you decide?

225
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,208
What’s the big idea?
First the power plant, now this.

226
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:06,291
- You know that I have to suspend you.
- Things are going on that make no sense.

227
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,750
Maybe I’m going crazy.

228
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,291
The dead boy.

229
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,583
The boy we found in the forest.

230
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,666
Helge has something to do with it all.

231
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,750
I know you want
to find Mikkel at all costs.

232
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,625
But the end doesn’t justify all means.

233
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,833
I should have taken you off this
on day one.

234
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,666
Helge said he can change
the past and the future.

235
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,958
- What’s that mean? Why did he say that?
- Helge has dementia.

236
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:38,125
He can’t even tie his own shoes anymore.

237
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:41,375
He’s surely not responsible
for the disappearance of three children.

238
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,166
- He doesn’t have the strength.
- Maybe he’s not alone.

239
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,333
Go home.

240
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,333
“Why not forest road?”

241
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,166
What does that mean?

242
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,208
Egon Tiedemann wanted to ask him that.

243
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,916
“Why not forest road?”

244
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,125
<i>I don’t know who said it,
but Ulrich didn’t rape me.</i>

245
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,041
<i>- You don’t have to lie for him.
- But I’m not lying.</i>

246
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,458
I wanted it.

247
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,458
We both wanted it. He didn’t force me.

248
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,333
And your face? What happened there?

249
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:20,416
I fell down.

250
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:22,500
It has nothing to do with it.

251
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,583
Someone saw you.

252
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:31,291
- Saw how he hurt you.
- That can’t be.

253
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:33,375
Then that person’s lying.

254
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:38,041
- Who said that anyway?
- I’m not allowed to say that.

255
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,583
The only important thing is

256
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,291
that you know
that Ulrich can’t harm you right now.

257
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,666
And that he will be punished
for what he did to you.

258
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,666
Ulrich didn’t do anything.

259
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,041
If anything, I pressured him into it.

260
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,541
I asked him to get condoms.

261
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,291
But he’d never hurt me.

262
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,625
He would never do that.

263
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,208
Never.

264
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,583
I’ve been suspended.

265
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,833
Where are the kids?

266
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,291
No idea.

267
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,083
I’m sorry, Katharina.

268
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:47,916
I’m here now.

269
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,833
You haven’t been here for a long time now.

270
00:28:58,875 --> 00:28:59,875
What do you mean?

271
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,833
As long as I’ve known you,
you’ve wanted out of Winden.

272
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,500
Were you ever really happy?

273
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,083
What are you talking about?

274
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,625
Of course I was happy.

275
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:38,958
Weren’t you?

276
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,833
I know, Ulrich.

277
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,541
What do you know?

278
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,375
About Hannah and you.

279
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,291
Did she tell you?

280
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,125
Does that matter?

281
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:23,791
Katharina.

282
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,708
I think I’ve known it all along.

283
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,958
I just didn’t want to see it.

284
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,500
I can explain.

285
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,000
Please don’t, Ulrich.

286
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,583
Oh, yeah.

287
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:03,625
Your mother called a while ago.

288
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:07,916
Our son has disappeared
and all she talks about is Mads.

289
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:12,375
And I thought my family
was the one full of assholes.

290
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,041
Hello.

291
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,125
Hello.

292
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,958
<i>If you take him back now,</i>

293
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:20,666
<i>you’ll be erasing your own existence.</i>

294
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,166
<i>But every decision for something</i>

295
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:28,916
<i>is a decision against something else.</i>

296
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,125
FOR MOTHER’S DAY 1986

297
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,416
Would you want to know,
after all these years?

298
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,666
What?

299
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:05,750
If he’s dead.

300
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:10,500
No.

301
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,666
I have always held on
to the hope that he’s alive.

302
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,666
Your father wanted the grave.

303
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,708
He thought it would help me
find some closure.

304
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,541
But there’s no body in it.

305
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:33,708
For 33 years
I’ve been imagining that he’s alive.

306
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:36,458
Free.

307
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,833
And happy.

308
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,375
You can never give up hope.

309
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:01,666
There’s as much light out there
as there is darkness.

310
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,541
Don’t forget that.

311
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:15,250
Katharina said
you wanted to tell me something.

312
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,708
One week before Mads--

313
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:29,208
I didn’t tell the police this back then.
I didn’t even remember.

314
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,791
I saw something.

315
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:36,833
In front of the house, across the way,
a priest was arguing with a man.

316
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,333
I don’t know what about.

317
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:41,875
But I found it odd that a priest
would be arguing like that.

318
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:46,166
And this morning, I saw the same man.

319
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,500
The priest?

320
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:51,583
No, not the priest. The other man.

321
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,416
It was the same man.

322
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:56,666
<i>I...</i>

323
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,041
<i>I know that because he had something
on his ear, it was...</i>

324
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,791
<i>It was scarred or disfigured.</i>

325
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,250
<i>But he wasn’t a single day older.</i>

326
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,916
<i>He looked exactly like he did
33 years ago.</i>

327
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,000
<i>I know that sounds crazy.</i>

328
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,875
<i>But it was the same man.</i>

329
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,500
Am I interrupting?

330
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:55,541
You wanted to know if the cave system
goes under the forest road by your cabin.

331
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,916
Not all of it is mapped out.

332
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,833
But at least parts of it extend
under the south part of the forest road.

333
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:10,625
What’s with the cabin?
Is there anything in particular there?

334
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,750
No. Nothing.

335
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:17,958
Thanks.

336
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,416
Sure thing.

337
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,083
<i>Charlotte?</i>

338
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:02,416
<i>Did you know that your father was supposed
to be questioned by the police in 1986?</i>

339
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,666
No, I...

340
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:07,750
- Why do you ask?
- The cabin on the forest road.

341
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,916
Why did Helge keep it

342
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,791
<i>after all that happened to him there?</i>

343
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,500
<i>Did he even use it?</i>

344
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,916
<i>Did he rent it out?</i>

345
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:17,666
Why are you asking?

346
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,541
<i>When was the first time you were there?</i>

347
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,500
Was it already in 1986?

348
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,875
I don’t know why you want to know that.

349
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,458
<i>Did your father live in the cabin in ’86?</i>

350
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:28,666
I don’t know.

351
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,583
<i>Maybe.</i>

352
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,541
<i>I came to Winden in 1987.
I didn’t know about the cabin then.</i>

353
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:37,208
<i>- That was after Helge’s accident.</i>
- When was that?

354
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,333
<i>- Where are you now?</i>
- When was the accident?

355
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,958
November 12th, 1986.

356
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,708
So three days from today.

357
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,250
<i>Come home.</i>

358
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,458
The kids have barely seen you in days.

359
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,208
They’re worried.

360
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,291
<i>And so am I.</i>

361
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,916
- I have to go.
<i>- Charlotte...</i>

362
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:37,708
<i>Dad, the question isn’t how,
the question is when.</i>

363
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,125
Boy, you startled me.

364
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,041
Where were you?

365
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:53,750
What’s wrong?

366
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,416
Do you believe in fate?

367
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,916
I... I don’t know.

368
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,875
Maybe it’s my fate that men leave me.

369
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,083
I think Dad loved you very much.

370
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,833
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 P.M.

371
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:47,541
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

372
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:38,333
<i>This is Charlotte Doppler. I’ll call back.</i>

373
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,458
Charlotte,

374
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:43,416
the question isn’t
who abducted the children, but when.

375
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,875
I was right, Helge Doppler.
Not now, but in 1986.

376
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:50,750
Call me back immediately
when you get this.

377
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:19,750
NOVEMBER 5, 1953
NOVEMBER 9, 1953

378
00:51:07,916 --> 00:51:11,916
