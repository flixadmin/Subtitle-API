1
00:00:01,772 --> 00:00:03,038
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,808
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,844
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:11,880
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:15,484
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,486 --> 00:00:17,386
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:20,756
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:24,126
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:27,897
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:29,099
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:31,578
His name is Geomancer.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,413
I'm waiting on the man in red.

13
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:35,215
The Velocity-7's wearing off.

14
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:37,784
- You hurt?
- Only my pride.

15
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:39,753
Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her.

16
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:41,088
Daddy, please help me.

17
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,389
Don't let him take me, Daddy.

18
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:43,657
I told you we're a team.

19
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:44,958
Now you're a part of it.

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,426
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

21
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:47,527
We're not sending you through alone.

22
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:48,829
We're going to Earth-2.

23
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,297
Just remember what Jay said, okay?

24
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,431
Things here are all sorts of trippy.

25
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,466
Caitlin...

26
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:53,900
If you knew me at all,

27
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:55,535
you would know that I hate the name Caitlin.

28
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:57,904
I'm Killer Frost.

29
00:00:57,906 --> 00:00:59,106
Look out!

30
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:01,641
Dad!

31
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:03,443
You killed my father, you evil bitch.

32
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:05,245
You shouldn't have
palled around with a breacher.

33
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:07,180
- Flash, save us!
- No!

34
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:08,815
Zoom wanted him alive.

35
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:12,753
You know what Zoom will do
if you don't obey him.

36
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,721
No!

37
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:16,656
Argh!

38
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,825
Look around, Flash.

39
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:23,597
This is the last place you'll ever see.

40
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:29,603
I know you're here, Harrison Wells,

41
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:33,273
and you did not come alone.

42
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,844
You can try to hide...

43
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:45,318
But I'm the fastest man alive.

44
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:50,824
I will scour this city

45
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:53,994
until I hunt you down.

46
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,962
And when I do,

47
00:01:55,964 --> 00:02:00,434
all of you will feel my wrath.

48
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,407
CCPN is reporting that Dr. Harrison Wells,

49
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,075
the infamous founder of S.T.A.R. Labs

50
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:10,777
who uncharacteristically has gone unseen

51
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:13,513
for nearly four months is now a wanted man.

52
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:15,348
These images and messages
went up moments ago

53
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,585
throughout Central City by Zoom.

54
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,320
Have you seen channel 52?

55
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,322
You're not safe here, Dr. Wells.
Zoom's looking for you.

56
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:23,857
I know what he's doing. Alert security.

57
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:24,858
Evacuate S.T.A.R. Labs.

58
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,460
Lock down the facility.

59
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:28,261
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me, Henry.

60
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:29,563
Just get everyone out of here now.

61
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:31,832
Now! Go!

62
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:33,066
Harry!

63
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:34,501
Don't shoot!

64
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:36,403
Damn it, Ramon.

65
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:39,306
Where's Allen?

66
00:02:39,308 --> 00:02:40,674
- Zoom took him.
- What?

67
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:42,375
We tracked down Deathstorm and Killer Frost,

68
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:43,944
met my doppelganger, Reverb...

69
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,012
super evil guy, super evil powers.

70
00:02:46,014 --> 00:02:48,148
The three of them almost
took down Barry until

71
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,817
Zoom showed up, killed Cisco-2,

72
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,652
killed Deathstorm for hurting a speedster.

73
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:54,588
But then he left Killer Frost alive

74
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,755
and then took off with Barry.

75
00:02:55,757 --> 00:02:57,190
How are you still alive?

76
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:58,458
Looks like he cares even less about me

77
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,426
than you do, Harry.

78
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:01,061
No, no.

79
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:02,662
Zoom doesn't do anything by accident.

80
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:03,864
Did he follow you here?

81
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,098
I've seen “Heat” like 50 times, okay?

82
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,099
I know how to shake a tail.

83
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:07,100
He didn't follow me.

84
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:08,235
But check this out.

85
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:09,402
I jacked these from my dead ringer.

86
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:10,470
I think we can tweak these puppies...

87
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:12,038
use them to find Zoom.

88
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,607
Damn it, Ramon, we don't have time for this.

89
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,041
Zoom is hunting us...

90
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:16,476
Zoom is hunting us!

91
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:17,677
We need to make an alternate plan,

92
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,079
because if we don't, Zoom...

93
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:20,847
Stop thinking like that, okay?

94
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:23,316
We're gonna find Jesse,
and we're gonna find Barry.

95
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:24,417
I know we will.

96
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:26,253
Hello? Is anyone there?

97
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:28,755
Okay, whoever's responsible for this,

98
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:30,690
oh, ho, ho...

99
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,325
boy, we're gonna have words,

100
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,660
the two of us, okay?

101
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:35,662
This is... this is not okay.

102
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:36,830
Barry-2.

104
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:41,601
Dr. Wells,

105
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:43,370
this is very disappointing.

106
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,572
I mean, the two of you
should be ashamed of yourselves.

107
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:48,074
You can't just lock someone
in a room like this.

108
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:49,776
How long was I in here for?

109
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,580
Barely a day.

110
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:54,915
One day?

111
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,349
One day?

112
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,051
Oh, jeez, my wife's gonna be worried sick.

113
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,719
- Dr. Wells.
- Yeah?

114
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:01,454
Doctor, I'm not sure
if you're aware of this,

115
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:04,658
but my wife is
a very well-respected detective

116
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,092
in the Central City Police Department.

117
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:08,495
She's got to be very upset.

118
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:10,530
Whoa, this is heavy.

119
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:11,531
It certainly is.

120
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,266
And I'm sorry, fellas,

121
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:15,769
but I demand to know what the heck

122
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,203
is going on here this instant.

123
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:18,838
Barry, this is a very long story.

124
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,273
One that we don't have time
to tell right now.

125
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:21,741
We're sorry we locked you in that room

126
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:23,810
for a day, but right now, you need to leave.

127
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:26,846
You need to gather...

128
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:27,914
He's here.

129
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,321
Do not move.

130
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,897
Ugh!

131
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,601
Where are Wells and his friends?

132
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,139
Dr. Wells, hey, what the heck is going on?

133
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:54,574
Oh, Zoom's after us.

134
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:56,576
Zoom? What do...
Why would Zoom be after you?

135
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:57,644
That's part of that long story

136
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:58,712
I was telling you about.

137
00:04:58,714 --> 00:04:59,713
I don't know if I can

138
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:00,947
deal with something like this.

139
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:02,582
- You have a time vault?
- Yeah.

140
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:04,417
I'm an enemy of Zoom,
and I need a place to hide

141
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,518
when something like this happens.

142
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
- Get in!
- Yes, sir.

143
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,895
That's Zoom! That's Zoom!

144
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:17,931
Ramon...

145
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,366
Shut him up.

146
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:38,451
Okay.

147
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,387
Breathe, breathe, breath, breath...

148
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:41,721
Fake wall.

149
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,356
He's not gonna fall for another fake wall.

150
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:44,591
We need to move.

151
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:45,892
We need to find a different place to hide

152
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:47,093
and make a plan.

153
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:48,495
Wait, wait... hey, hey, hey, hey.

154
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:49,596
No.

155
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:50,997
I think before we do anything,

156
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,899
you have to explain to me everything

157
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:54,401
that is going on here.

158
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:06,713
You're wasting your time.

159
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,081
I used to think I could escape too

160
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,816
when I first got here.

161
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:12,385
There's no way out.

162
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,425
Who is that?

163
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,160
I don't know.

164
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:24,130
He's been here since Zoom
brought me to this place.

165
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:28,802
Stop, okay?

166
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:31,304
Just... just please stop.

167
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:34,240
Jesse, I think he might
be trying to help us.

168
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:37,277
Nothing is gonna help us.

169
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:39,913
That's not true.

170
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:41,247
We're gonna get out of here.

171
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,450
Your dad's gonna find us, I promise.

172
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:44,751
You sure have a lot of faith

173
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:47,387
in a man who only cares about himself.

174
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,893
You know, I actually thought that

175
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:56,429
at first too.

176
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:58,865
It's not true.

177
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,468
Every decision that he's made...

178
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,572
every action he's taken since we've met...

179
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:07,440
has been to save you.

180
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,344
Your dad hasn't given up on you, Jesse.

181
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:14,681
Don't give up on him.

182
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,619
Believe what you want,

183
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:23,323
but the only reason that you're still alive

184
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,525
is so I can kill you

185
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:27,193
in front of your father.

186
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:30,663
And the only reason
your father's still alive...

187
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:36,569
Is to get me your speed.

188
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,974
Once he does that,

189
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:43,676
he will die too.

190
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:50,714
Up after the break,

191
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:52,016
earthquake-causing meta-human

192
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:53,784
leaves citizens shaken and wondering,

193
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:55,719
where is The Flash?

194
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:56,820
It's finished.

195
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:58,656
Breach stabilized again.

196
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:01,379
Barry, Cisco, and Wells
have 20 hours to get back.

197
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:02,408
You're amazing.

198
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
When it comes to
stabilizing breaches, maybe...

199
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,109
not so much when it comes
to fighting meta-humans.

200
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,744
You were a little rusty.

201
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:10,179
I was too slow.

202
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:13,983
Geomancer's still out there, Caitlin.

203
00:08:13,985 --> 00:08:15,417
He has to be stopped.

204
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,986
I have to be ready in case he attacks again.

205
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:18,554
How much longer till the Velocity...

206
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:19,521
8.

207
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:21,490
Velocity-8 is ready?

208
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:23,158
I need to finalize the compound...

209
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,594
make sure the extracellular
matrix stays intact

210
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:28,330
so you don't lose your speed as fast.

211
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:31,400
Okay, great.

212
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:34,770
What is it?

213
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,905
After your last encounter with Geomancer,

214
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:38,941
I ran some tests.

215
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:41,510
The Velocity-7 is reacting

216
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:43,512
with the damaged cells in your body.

217
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:45,748
It's causing more cellular degeneration.

218
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,750
Well, I have faith that the next batch

219
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:48,984
won't do the same thing.

220
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,653
Jay, I can't keep giving this to you

221
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,488
if it's hurting you.

222
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,356
If it'll help me defeat Geomancer,

223
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:56,358
you might have to.

224
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,593
Till Barry gets back,

225
00:08:57,595 --> 00:09:00,195
I may be the only chance this city has.

226
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:05,567
I don't know how this is possible,

227
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:06,902
but you somehow made basketball

228
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:08,203
sound more boring than baseball.

229
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:09,538
Fix this.

230
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,073
Scott Evans, your new editor.

231
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:13,542
- Oh, Iris...
- West, I know.

232
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:15,477
You wrote the story about
the recent Geomancer attack.

233
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,112
- Yeah, I did.
- I'm not running that.

234
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:18,814
What, why?

235
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:21,083
It's a fluff piece to try
to make people feel good.

236
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:23,285
What they need to know is the truth;

237
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:26,922
The Flash might not always
be there to save them.

238
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:28,390
You disagree?

239
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:30,492
I think that he's saved a lot of people

240
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:31,827
in this city.

241
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:32,895
But where is he now?

242
00:09:32,897 --> 00:09:35,631
I need to run a real story.

243
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,066
Okay, uh...

244
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,600
what if I could get you an exclusive

245
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:41,236
with the meta-human that fought Geomancer?

246
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:44,440
This... this other Flash.

247
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:47,509
What, you friends with him too?

248
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:50,846
Just, um, give me a little time.

249
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:52,781
Fine, but if it's the same

250
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:54,216
as the other crap that you wrote,

251
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,118
I'm gonna run something about how The Flash

252
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,754
may not be the hero we all dreamed he was.

253
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:10,733
Iris... Hey, Iris.

254
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,835
Barry, where were you last night?

255
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:13,969
Oh, my God.

256
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:15,304
My father died yesterday,

257
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,039
and you never even came home.

258
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,974
I know, I know. I heard.

259
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:19,975
I'm so, so sorry.

260
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,043
You... you heard?

261
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,644
You were there, Barry.

262
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:24,213
I actually was not there.

263
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:25,714
I'm... I'm gonna... yeah, okay.

264
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:26,982
Okay, look.

265
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:28,350
Come to my lab. Just come up to my lab.

266
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:29,651
I'm gonna explain everything, okay?

267
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:31,653
I'm gonna explain it.

268
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:34,890
So the Barry from yesterday was not you?

269
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:36,558
No.

270
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,026
No, look, I... I know

271
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:40,362
that this is hard to believe,

272
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:42,898
but I mean, it is just like
that sci-fi series,

273
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
“Commander Carl, Space
Marshal of the Galaxy, ”

274
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:46,902
where Carl gets sucked into a black hole

275
00:10:46,904 --> 00:10:48,103
and ends up on another planet

276
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,405
that he thinks is Earth,

277
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,240
but really it's Earth...

278
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:54,410
of another universe.

279
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:56,278
Have... have you guys not s...

280
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,312
oh, it's a seminal episode.

281
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:59,114
You should check it out.

282
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,482
So that's why you weren't wearing

283
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:02,050
your wedding ring yesterday.

284
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,385
Well...

285
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:05,754
And... and that...
that kiss was... was so...

286
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:07,689
I'm... I'm sorry. He got frisky with you?

287
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,025
No, no, no, no, no.

288
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:11,326
Okay, I'm gonna have to find this guy

289
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:12,594
and give him a piece of my mind.

290
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:14,062
Don't give him too much.

291
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:15,831
Your husband tells us
you've been tracking Zoom.

292
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,566
Yeah, I've been trying to. Why?

293
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:19,301
- We need to find his lair.
- Lair?

294
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,869
He's a bad guy; I'm calling it a lair.

295
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:22,304
Zoom is looking for you.

296
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,639
Why are you going after him?

297
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,340
Zoom has my daughter

298
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:28,110
and our Barry, and we need
to rescue them both.

299
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:30,078
Look, I want to find Zoom

300
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,915
just as much as anybody,
but no one can track him.

301
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:36,185
The only person who would know
where he would be hiding someone

302
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:38,454
would be a meta that's worked with him.

303
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:40,722
A meta like Killer Frost?

304
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:41,990
Yeah, maybe.

305
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,393
But Zoom kept her alive yesterday

306
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:46,161
because she always obeys him.

307
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,464
There is no way that she's
gonna tell you where he is.

308
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,098
I'm not so sure about that.

309
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,602
If she loved Deathstorm as much
as my Caitlin loved Ronnie,

310
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:57,573
I think she'd be more than upset
at Zoom for killing him.

311
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:01,176
Look, finding her is gonna be
just as hard as finding Zoom.

312
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:05,581
But if anyone can do it...

313
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,952
My husband can.

314
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:11,253
Right, yes.

315
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,255
I can, actually.

316
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:15,724
Um, all right.

317
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:22,231
Okay, well it looks like
Patty Spivot was a CSI tech

318
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,966
on most of the Killer Frost cases.

319
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,567
She's pretty thorough, so...

320
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:26,835
What's that?

321
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:28,437
Oh, this is Killer Frost meta-data

322
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:30,305
collected from numerous crime scenes...

323
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:32,708
DNA trace movements, facial recognition,

324
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,977
temperature fluctuations specific to her.

325
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:37,279
My algorithm compiles all the data

326
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,014
and gives us an approximate location.

327
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:41,483
It works on most metas,
except for Zoom, of course.

328
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:44,453
He's too fast... never leaves a trace.

329
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:46,054
Okay.

330
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,458
Looks like the best bet's the woodlands.

331
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,126
Best CSI in Central City.

332
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:52,361
You know where that is, right?

333
00:12:52,363 --> 00:12:54,463
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

334
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:55,797
Wait, I'm going with you guys.

335
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,132
You're gonna need some help. Okay.

336
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:58,433
Iris, I...

337
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:00,002
Barry, Zoom and his followers

338
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,437
are the reason that my father is dead.

339
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:05,173
If I can stop him from killing anyone else,

340
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,209
I'm gonna try.

341
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:10,078
Okay, then I'm coming too.

342
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,981
- No.
- No.

343
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:17,519
Barry, this is not what you do.

344
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:19,688
I know that.

345
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,190
But I also know Joseph
didn't like me too much,

346
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,393
but he was my father-in-law.

347
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:26,461
If you're going,

348
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:27,963
I am coming with you.

349
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:32,834
All right.

350
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:35,637
You can come, but you stay out of our way.

351
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:45,113
That's not Morse code.

352
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:49,685
I know he's trying to tell us something.

353
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:52,621
We just have to find the pattern.

354
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,829
There's no pattern, Barry.

355
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,036
You know, your dad, who I'm pretty sure

356
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:11,440
is one of the smartest people
to live on either of our Earths,

357
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:15,143
told me the only person smarter than him

358
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,680
was you.

359
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:19,881
He said that?

360
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:23,585
If that's true,

361
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:26,121
we work together...

362
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:28,190
I know we can figure this out.

363
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:33,996
Worth a shot?

364
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:39,468
Okay.

365
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,045
Well, he never goes past five.

366
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:51,813
What?

367
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:54,116
He never goes past five knocks
without pausing.

368
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:56,118
Right? Listen.

369
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:06,728
Hey, you're right.

370
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,034
I think...

371
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,568
I think I know what that is.

372
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,938
It's a five-by-five tap code used by POWs.

373
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,974
That would only get us to 25 letters,

374
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:20,442
and there's 26 in the alphabet.

375
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:21,977
Not if you combine C and K.

376
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:24,946
They sound the same.

377
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:26,081
Let's try it out.

378
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:32,688
- Worth a shot.
- All right.

379
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,224
There it is.

380
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,793
Looks different than before.

381
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:39,061
That's because I realized
that there was a flaw

382
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,562
with Velocity-8,

383
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,899
so I reformulated
the extracellular matrix, and...

384
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,333
Velocity-9.

385
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:46,501
You know what they say,

386
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:47,736
ninth time's the charm.

387
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,971
Hey.

388
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:52,140
Hey, Iris. You okay?

389
00:15:52,142 --> 00:15:55,043
Yeah, I'm just a little
worried about the time.

390
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,812
Well, don't worry.

391
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:59,214
They'll make it back before
we close the breach.

392
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:01,516
Um, actually I was here

393
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:03,185
to talk to you about something else.

394
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:04,653
Oh. Yeah, sure.

395
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:05,854
What is it?

396
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:07,923
Well, my new editor

397
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,392
wants me to write a scathing article

398
00:16:10,394 --> 00:16:13,261
on The Flash not being able
to protect Central City

399
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,563
from Geomancer.

400
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:15,797
Really?

401
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,265
Yeah.

402
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:22,104
I was hoping to write
an article about you instead...

403
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,939
something that would calm people

404
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,208
until Barry got back.

405
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,709
You know, Iris,

406
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:29,745
I don't know if that's the best idea.

407
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:31,546
Well, I think that if people

408
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:33,915
knew that there was someone
that could protect them,

409
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,283
it would...

410
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,652
it would really help.

411
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:40,956
Would you just think about it?

412
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,329
Some crazy alarm's going off.

413
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:49,131
Yeah.

414
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,600
Don't even think about running.

415
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:53,502
There's a new Flash in town.

416
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:56,505
You know, the one with the shiny helmet.

417
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:59,174
Not the speedster I was hoping to crack,

418
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,743
but let's see just how fast he is,

419
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:03,745
Central City.

420
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:11,887
Give me the Velocity-9.

421
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:13,555
Jay, we have no idea how long it will last.

422
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:14,723
We don't have time to
figure that out, Caitlin.

423
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:05,843
Jay?

424
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:07,178
I'm okay.

425
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,379
That just took a lot out of me.

426
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,448
But it sure felt good.

427
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:15,753
That was amazing, Jay.

428
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:17,588
Thanks. I kind of surprised myself,

429
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,557
to be honest.

430
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,192
Caitlin deserves all the credit.

431
00:18:21,194 --> 00:18:23,260
Looks like your Velocity-9's a winner.

432
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,062
I still need to run some tests.

433
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,265
Iris, about the interview, um...

434
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:31,669
I think that I have everything that I need.

435
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,983
Great.

436
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:36,686
'Cause I could really use a nap.

437
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,654
I'll, uh, be downstairs.

438
00:18:47,232 --> 00:18:49,332
Two down, five across.

439
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:51,601
- It's J.
- J?

440
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:54,837
That's what you're tapping... the letter J?

441
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,739
All right, what's next?

442
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:01,377
A.

443
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:02,578
All right.

444
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:06,015
Five down...

445
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:10,953
Four across. Y.

446
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:12,755
J-A-Y?

447
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:15,191
You're spelling “Jay.”

448
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,760
As in Jay Garrick?

449
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:20,229
He's... he's alive.

450
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:21,998
But he's on my Earth.

451
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:25,368
Hey, hey...

452
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,303
Stop, stop... hey...

453
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:28,238
Stop... look, I'm sorry.

454
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:29,876
I don't know what you mean.

455
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,979
Jay Garrick didn't come with us.

456
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:35,248
Look, just keep tapping, please.

457
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,617
We don't understand.

458
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,553
Please.

459
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,525
Don't talk to them again.

460
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:07,647
I'm gonna get out of here.

461
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,249
And I'm gonna destroy you.

462
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,488
All I need from you is your speed, Flash.

463
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,857
And you only need to be barely alive

464
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:20,360
for me to get it.

465
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,065
Stop!

466
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:34,341
Stop!

467
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,251
Barry...

468
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:47,954
Barry, are you okay?

469
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,356
Yeah.

470
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:52,692
I'm okay.

471
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:02,001
Zoom just showed me how to
get out of this thing.

472
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:12,712
You're sure this is the place?

473
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,985
This is definitely the place.

474
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,954
You lost?

475
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:23,189
Or just back for more fun?

476
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:24,724
We just came here to talk.

477
00:21:24,726 --> 00:21:26,726
Oh, really?

478
00:21:26,728 --> 00:21:28,995
Do you bring your little toys

479
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,131
to every conversation you have?

480
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:34,200
Or do you just want to see me burn again?

481
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:36,736
Considering you killed my father,

482
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:38,238
the thought has crossed my mind.

483
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,039
Tell us...

484
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,208
where does Zoom keep his prisoners?

485
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,377
You really don't know
how to use your abilities,

486
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:45,578
do you, breacher?

487
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,348
It's a work in progress, Elsa.

488
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:55,155
Zoom killed the love of your life.

489
00:21:55,157 --> 00:21:57,023
This hurts,

490
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,426
even for somebody with
a heart as cold as yours.

491
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:02,295
And you think that would
make me turn on Zoom?

492
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:04,264
Enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?

493
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,635
What... don't tell me it doesn't
work like that over here.

494
00:22:08,637 --> 00:22:10,270
If I tell you,

495
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:12,539
he'll kill me.

496
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,574
But if I kill you

497
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:17,410
and take you to him,

498
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:20,847
I bet he'd be pretty pleased with me.

499
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:25,151
Maybe even let me off my leash.

500
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:27,220
So take a wild guess.

501
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,289
What do you think I'm gonna choose?

502
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,557
Move!

503
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,328
Argh! That did not go as planned!

504
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,596
Her name starts with Killer.

505
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:38,832
This comes as a shock to you?

506
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,769
- We got to move now!
- Yeah, yeah.

507
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:44,404
- I will cover you.
- Okay.

508
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,939
No, no, no, hey, that's a horrible idea.

509
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:47,807
Hey, no! Hey, hey, no!

510
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,642
Hey, guys...

511
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:50,743
Where are we going?

512
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,212
Where are we going? Oh, God.

513
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:59,686
Argh!

514
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:06,793
Argh!

515
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:08,928
Stop...

516
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,130
or you'll never make another icicle again.

517
00:23:26,653 --> 00:23:29,120
I can't believe it.

518
00:23:29,122 --> 00:23:31,456
What is it?

519
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,292
I think I figured out
how to save Jay's life.

520
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:37,629
Hey, Jay... uh, wake up.

521
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:40,398
Come to the cortex. It's important.

522
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,001
It certainly is.

523
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:47,505
What do you want?

524
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:51,209
I like to watch heroes fall

525
00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:52,977
and never get back up.

526
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:54,679
He always gets back up.

527
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:57,682
Hard to do that when the Earth
swallows you whole.

528
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:13,798
Where is it?

529
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,100
Aw, don't go.

530
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:19,204
We're having so much fun.

531
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:24,142
Oh, my God! Caitlin!

532
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:28,246
Caitlin, are you okay?

533
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:33,751
Looks like this new Flash

534
00:24:33,753 --> 00:24:35,553
isn't much of a hero after all.

535
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:41,993
Let's see what a seven
will do to S.T.A.R. Labs.

536
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:54,973
Nice shot.

537
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:56,908
I was aiming for his leg.

538
00:24:59,646 --> 00:25:02,380
Where is Zoom's lair?

539
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:05,850
Where is it?

540
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,685
If I tell you,

541
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:09,354
he will kill me.

542
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:11,422
He'll kill you anyway, Caitlin.

543
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,993
Stop calling me that. It's not my name.

544
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:16,728
Yes, it is.

545
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,329
You just don't want to hear it
because it reminds you

546
00:25:18,331 --> 00:25:20,465
of someone you used to be.

547
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:23,101
Trust me, I know that person very well.

548
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:25,370
You don't know anything about me.

549
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:28,406
I know the Caitlin Snow on my Earth.

550
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:30,541
I know that when she loves someone,

551
00:25:30,543 --> 00:25:31,809
that person is her world.

552
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:34,145
That person was Ronnie Raymond.

553
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:35,713
And he died too.

554
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:37,048
It devastated her,

555
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,983
and I can see it's doing the same to you.

556
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:44,822
Zoom took that.

557
00:25:44,824 --> 00:25:47,992
His daughter... my friend...

558
00:25:47,994 --> 00:25:50,395
he's gonna take them away from us,

559
00:25:50,397 --> 00:25:52,864
just like he took Ronnie from you.

560
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:58,536
Caitlin...

561
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:01,472
all you have to do is tell us
where he's keeping them.

562
00:26:01,474 --> 00:26:03,174
And then you'll never hear from us again,

563
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:05,109
and you can go.

564
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,783
Please.

565
00:26:14,054 --> 00:26:16,087
Fine.

566
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:18,489
I'll show you where it is.

567
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:21,059
But that's it.

568
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:23,661
Uh, where are we going?

569
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:25,563
Ascension Cliffs.

570
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:33,404
Argh!

571
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:34,839
Gah!

572
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:36,874
Look, are you sure you
want to keep doing that?

573
00:26:36,876 --> 00:26:37,875
You know, if Zoom catches you,

574
00:26:37,877 --> 00:26:39,544
he's gonna hurt you again.

575
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:42,347
I don't understand why
I can't phase through this.

576
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:44,649
Well, your body would need
to have the same resonance

577
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:47,185
as the glass walls.

578
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,853
I should be going more than fast enough.

579
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:51,589
It's something else.

580
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:53,424
Maybe you're resonating
at a different frequency.

581
00:26:56,996 --> 00:27:00,231
Yeah, your Earth vibrates at
a different frequency than mine.

582
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:04,102
Same reason Cisco can't vibe.

583
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:07,472
Is there any way to make up the difference?

584
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:11,109
Only if I can go faster.

585
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:25,757
Wow, wow, wow.

586
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,625
We're going up there?

587
00:27:27,627 --> 00:27:29,560
That's where Zoom's lair is.

588
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:31,729
A place only a speedster could get to.

589
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:33,498
There are like the Cliffs of Insanity.

590
00:27:35,235 --> 00:27:37,635
So how do we get up there?

591
00:27:37,637 --> 00:27:41,639
I can make you something
to climb on, darling.

592
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:43,040
Are you serious?

593
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,509
You want us to...

594
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:47,945
what, just climb to the top
of those cliffs...

595
00:27:47,947 --> 00:27:50,615
on ice?

596
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:53,451
Got any better ideas?

597
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:55,553
No, ma'am, I'm just, you know, I...

598
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:57,822
I've got... you know,
I'm wearing wingtips here.

599
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,057
They, um, don't have much tread.

600
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,292
Barry.

601
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:03,094
Barry, um, maybe you should stay behind.

602
00:28:03,096 --> 00:28:05,563
- Yeah?
- No... hey, no.

603
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,498
I'm not letting you go up there by yourself.

604
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,967
It is okay if you don't want to go...

605
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:12,136
if you don't want to do this.

606
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:14,472
You are my wife.

607
00:28:14,474 --> 00:28:17,475
I'm not leaving your side.

608
00:28:17,477 --> 00:28:18,776
- Okay.
- Can we go?

609
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:20,945
- Yeah.
- I'm ready.

610
00:28:20,947 --> 00:28:23,347
Let's go before I change my mind.

611
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:34,392
You really think handcuffs can stop me?

612
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:35,626
I know they can...

613
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:37,695
just like this boot on your neck.

614
00:28:37,697 --> 00:28:39,163
It dampens your power.

615
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:40,965
Same goes for the six-by-six cell

616
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,634
you'll be calling home at Iron Heights.

617
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:45,036
All right, let's go.

618
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,039
Caitlin.

619
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,707
So sorry I didn't come sooner.

620
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:51,976
That's okay, um...

621
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:53,411
can I show you something?

622
00:28:57,717 --> 00:28:59,984
My cells...

623
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:01,219
they've stopped degenerating?

624
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:03,221
How is this even possible?

625
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:05,056
It appears that when the Velocity-9

626
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:06,924
is in your system, it kick-starts

627
00:29:06,926 --> 00:29:09,560
your latent regenerative capabilities,

628
00:29:09,562 --> 00:29:12,129
and your cells repair themselves.

629
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:15,066
And do you think you can
get this to work permanently?

630
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:18,936
I don't know, but I think
we're on the right track.

631
00:29:18,938 --> 00:29:21,539
Caitlin, I don't know what to say.

632
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:25,009
This is... you are...

633
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:29,747
What was that?

634
00:29:29,749 --> 00:29:31,182
The speed cannon.

635
00:29:31,184 --> 00:29:32,917
Geomancer's tremors must have damaged it.

636
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:34,118
Okay, come on.

637
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,420
Come on!

638
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,032
The breach isn't stabilized.

639
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:49,734
We need to fix this fast.

640
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:52,470
Otherwise they're never
gonna be able to come back.

641
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:06,210
So that was the sound that we heard.

642
00:30:06,212 --> 00:30:08,879
Please tell me it's not as bad as it looks.

643
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:12,683
- Uh...
- Come on, seriously?

644
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,618
They still have an hour left.

645
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,354
What if they're trying to get
through the breach right now

646
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,655
and they can't?

647
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:19,523
Okay, the jolt disrupted the quark matter.

648
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:21,625
The electromagnetic insulators are failing.

649
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:23,561
How do we fix this in time?

650
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:25,596
I don't know if we can.

651
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:39,910
Barry?

652
00:30:43,182 --> 00:30:46,550
Barry?

653
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:51,422
Cisco?

654
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:53,391
Dude, we made it.

655
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,026
How did you find this place?

656
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:59,296
Had some help.

657
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:02,199
Don't even get me started on this guy.

658
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:03,300
Oh boy.

659
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,571
Dr. Wells...

660
00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:12,209
Stand back.

661
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,260
I'm here.

662
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,796
I'm here.

663
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:34,165
Come on, let's get you out of here.

664
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:36,167
Okay.

665
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:42,606
- Frost?
- A little help?

666
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:43,607
Not part of the deal.

667
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:45,342
- Frost!
- Hey, hey, hey.

668
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:46,777
Bringing us up here wasn't
part of the deal, either,

669
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,646
but here you are.

670
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:51,449
Something tells me you're not
as cold as I thought you were.

671
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,984
Maybe, maybe not.

672
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:13,637
What's going on?
Why... why isn't it working?

673
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:14,872
I don't know.

674
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:17,208
I've never had this problem before.

675
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:23,113
Dr. Wells...

676
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:24,815
Carbyne.

677
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,851
It's some form of carbyne.

678
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,452
This cell's made out of
some form of carbyne.

679
00:32:28,454 --> 00:32:30,421
You'll never be able to
freeze him out of there.

680
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:31,822
You can't phase out of there?

681
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:36,360
Just go, all right?

682
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:37,995
Before Zoom comes back.

683
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,864
We're not leaving you here.

684
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:41,832
I can't get out of this cell.

685
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,267
I've tried

686
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,735
a lot.

687
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:46,737
I'm not fast enough to phase through this.

688
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:48,105
You got...

689
00:32:48,107 --> 00:32:49,507
just leave, all right?

690
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,648
Just leave.

691
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:04,922
Do you know what we did

692
00:33:04,924 --> 00:33:07,658
to get here, Barry?

693
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,828
We convinced her...

694
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,329
Killer Frost...

695
00:33:12,331 --> 00:33:13,831
to show us the way.

696
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:17,034
Then we climbed some insanely steep cliffs

697
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,969
outside on footholds made of ice...

698
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:20,137
ice!

699
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:21,805
And all of us risked our lives,

700
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:24,742
knowing Zoom was after us,
to rescue Jesse...

701
00:33:24,744 --> 00:33:27,177
and you.

702
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,847
Now, I don't know you,

703
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:31,582
and you don't know me,

704
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:34,385
but I can tell you that today,

705
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:38,122
I... I did things that
I never thought possible,

706
00:33:38,124 --> 00:33:40,090
because I needed to prove to my wife

707
00:33:40,092 --> 00:33:42,593
and to myself that I could.

708
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:46,864
Now, if I can do the impossible today,

709
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,400
so can you.

710
00:33:51,837 --> 00:33:54,672
I'm just Barry Allen,

711
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:56,106
but you're The Flash.

712
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:05,082
If you tell yourself

713
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,184
you can phase out of there,

714
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:08,919
you'll do it.

715
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,364
Okay, let's go.

716
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:54,865
Go, come on. Wait, wait!

717
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:56,266
Hey, hey, hey! We're not leaving him.

718
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:57,701
Barry, there's no time.

719
00:34:57,703 --> 00:35:00,437
He's not going anywhere,

720
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:04,408
and neither are any of you.

721
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,743
Thank you

722
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:08,412
for bringing them to me.

723
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:10,414
You double-crossed us?

724
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,149
He killed Ronnie!

725
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,753
Guess my heart is as cold
as you thought after all.

726
00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:17,855
I can't believe you.

727
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:20,090
Just so you know,
you would be very disappointed

728
00:35:20,092 --> 00:35:22,359
in you right now.

729
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:23,961
Zoom.

730
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:26,530
Let them go.

731
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:28,866
All you need is me and Barry.

732
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:30,601
You're right.

733
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:34,538
I may not be able to kill you yet,

734
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,074
but I can kill them.

735
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:42,579
No, no! No...

736
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:45,916
I told you I'd kill you
in front of your father.

737
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:47,484
No! No!

738
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:52,690
No...

739
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,060
Get out of here.

740
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:01,498
Caitlin.

741
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,167
You were right.

742
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:05,169
He killed Ronnie.

743
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:06,537
Thank you.

744
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:11,475
I'm not leaving without him.

745
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:13,177
Barry, there's no time.

746
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:14,978
There's no time!

747
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,914
I can't hold him forever.

748
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:19,850
Hey, I'm coming back for you
when this is over, all right?

749
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:21,018
Go!

750
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,186
I'm coming back!

751
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:31,411
Jay, we need to do something.

752
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:33,706
Our only chance is to reboot
the electromagnetic insulators

753
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:36,316
and hope the quark matter
redistributes equally.

754
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:37,317
How do we do that?

755
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:38,785
We have to do it manually.

756
00:36:38,787 --> 00:36:40,120
But you can't be near the stabilizer rings

757
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:41,188
when they power on, or you'll get

758
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,456
sucked into the breach.

759
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:43,490
Not if I create a vortex

760
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,858
to counteract the pull.

761
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,359
You can't do both at the same time.

762
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:48,395
Cait...

763
00:36:48,397 --> 00:36:50,097
I have to try.

764
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,434
I'll help you.

765
00:36:54,436 --> 00:36:55,635
What? Dad, no.

766
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:56,837
Look, if it brings Barry

767
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,838
back to this Earth, I'm doing it.

768
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,839
Are you sure?

769
00:36:58,877 --> 00:37:00,410
The more we talk about it,
the less sure I'll be,

770
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:01,198
so let's just do it.

771
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:02,938
Okay.

772
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,006
There's an override switch
on every stabilizer ring.

773
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,666
- I'll create the vortex.
- Yeah.

774
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:09,100
And you flip all of them.
They should all reboot.

775
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,535
Got it.

776
00:37:10,537 --> 00:37:11,504
Once that's done, you power up the cannon.

777
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:13,385
- The breach should stabilize.
- And what if it doesn't?

778
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,975
We're all out of luck.

779
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,390
The Velocity-9 is running out!

780
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:01,720
Jay!

781
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:03,154
I guess now we know how long

782
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,690
the Velocity-9 lasts.

783
00:38:05,692 --> 00:38:07,626
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

784
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:09,027
Yeah.

785
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:10,595
I just hope they are.

786
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:18,169
I'm fine. I'm just a mess.

787
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,205
You need to get out
of Central City, all right?

788
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:22,507
Any place you think
you'll be safe from Zoom.

789
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,042
Yeah, we, um... we have some family

790
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:25,176
in Atlantis that can help us.

791
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,544
Yeah, okay, good.

792
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:27,812
You may not have been struck by lightning

793
00:38:27,814 --> 00:38:29,047
over here like I was,

794
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:30,515
but today, you risked your life

795
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,584
to save somebody you didn't even know.

796
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:35,153
That's a hero, Barry.

797
00:38:35,155 --> 00:38:37,555
Thank you both.

798
00:38:37,557 --> 00:38:39,257
Barry...

799
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:42,927
is my father still alive on your Earth?

800
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:46,164
Yeah, he is.

801
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:49,000
Give him a hug for me, will you?

802
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:50,035
I will.

803
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:58,643
Hey.

804
00:38:58,645 --> 00:39:00,211
You guys need to get someplace safe too.

805
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,680
Where are you going?

806
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:03,581
The only place we can.

807
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:09,688
- Dad, we can't just leave.
- We have to, honey.

808
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,023
What, you want me to leave
everything I have here?

809
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:13,458
My friends, my family...

810
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,859
I mean, my life.

811
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:16,261
You don't have a life here anymore.

812
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:17,495
Either do I.

813
00:39:17,497 --> 00:39:19,030
Zoom is too powerful.

814
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:20,265
I can't stop him.

815
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,367
And as long as he is here,

816
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:23,668
he's gonna hunt us down

817
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,936
until we're dead.

818
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:30,208
Wells, if you're coming
with us, we have to go.

819
00:39:36,383 --> 00:39:38,550
It's almost time.

820
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,018
I don't care what time it is.

821
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,387
After all we did to stabilize this breach,

822
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:45,156
we're not closing until they show up.

823
00:39:45,158 --> 00:39:46,591
Y'all hear me?

824
00:39:49,629 --> 00:39:51,496
Cisco!

825
00:39:51,498 --> 00:39:53,298
Get ready to close the breach for good...

826
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,466
Zoom's coming!

827
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:01,973
Forgetting someone, Flash?

828
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:03,208
Let him go.

829
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,977
Close the breach.

830
00:40:05,979 --> 00:40:08,446
Tell Jesse I love her.

831
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,914
Tell her yourself.

832
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:12,083
Argh!

833
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,189
It shouldn't be taking this long.

834
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,096
