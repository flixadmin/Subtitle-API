1
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:28,929
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

2
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:32,766
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

3
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:36,019
- What?
- Just take the rest of the week.

4
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:38,939
Please. You've earned it.

5
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:40,857
Don't push it.

6
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:44,194
Besides, I want you well for the weekend.

7
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:48,949
Mom wants to party.

8
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:52,828
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

9
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:55,372
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

10
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,458
Just family and a few friends.

11
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,920
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

12
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:06,466
Sounds good.

13
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:19,855
Oh, thank you.

14
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:21,690
Now

15
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:24,776
what are you supposed to do today?

16
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:28,321
- Nothing.
- Excellent.

17
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:34,786
Brownie points for taking a nap.

18
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,423
Can you meet?

19
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:17,722
I thought maybe you might have, you know

20
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,391
kicked.

21
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,935
Signed... Signed off.

22
00:05:22,143 --> 00:05:24,729
I was even checking the obits.

23
00:05:25,313 --> 00:05:26,940
No such luck.

24
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,986
So where does it stand?

25
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:35,448
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

26
00:05:35,657 --> 00:05:38,535
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

27
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:40,453
What's the upshot?

28
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:42,789
The upshot.

29
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:50,130
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

30
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,301
Damn.

31
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,889
Actually, it's not as bad as it sounds.

32
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:04,477
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

33
00:06:05,437 --> 00:06:07,314
In fact

34
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,484
the news is all good.

35
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:13,236
What do you mean, good?

36
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,865
You mean, like, "good" good?

37
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,300
What, you mean, like, remission good?

38
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:26,917
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

39
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:30,626
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumours.

40
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:33,089
How significant?

41
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:35,467
Eighty percent.

42
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:37,844
Dude. No way.

43
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:41,139
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch,

44
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:46,353
but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

45
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:49,523
That's awesome. Serious?

46
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:52,442
That's... That's great, man.

47
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:56,196
I mean, my aunt, she never...
I mean, you know, at your stage

48
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:58,615
I didn't think that could happen.

49
00:06:58,824 --> 00:07:00,283
Yeah.

50
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:02,994
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

51
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,997
No. You must be so psyched.

52
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:09,042
Of course. I am.

53
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,629
Okay, now we...

54
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:17,050
I mean, what do we...?

55
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,220
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

56
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:28,562
So how do you want to

57
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,815
you know, proceed

58
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:34,693
in light of this kick-ass news?

59
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:42,075
We'll take our time and stay cautious.

60
00:07:42,284 --> 00:07:44,286
Sell off what we have.

61
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:46,121
And then...

62
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,919
Well, then I guess

63
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:55,755
I'm done.

64
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:18,945
- Batter up.
- Everyone?

65
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:22,407
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast

66
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:27,579
- with my non-alcoholic beverage.
- Somebody kill the music.

67
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:31,625
I know one party can't begin to repay

68
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:37,047
all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

69
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:39,549
But then again

70
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:44,304
Hank does make one mean margarita.

71
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:49,684
We really do want to thank you.

72
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:53,313
These last few months have been

73
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,652
wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

74
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,446
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

75
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,658
- All right.
- Honey, I'm so proud of you.

76
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:06,535
We all are.

77
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:13,166
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

78
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,335
But it's true. It really is.

79
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:19,005
And for the first time in a long time

80
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:22,175
we are so excited about the future.

81
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,805
Okay, anyway

82
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,683
I want to also express my gratitude

83
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:34,855
to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

84
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:38,024
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

85
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,985
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz,

86
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:43,196
for those of you
who don't know them, are...

87
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:47,159
Well, they're heroes.

88
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:51,288
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer

89
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:54,291
to pay for Walt's treatment.

90
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,044
And they did.

91
00:09:58,378 --> 00:09:59,838
So

92
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,048
To Gretchen and Elliott.

93
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:05,969
- To Gretchen and Elliot.
- Cheers.

94
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:09,055
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

95
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:10,640
- Speech.
- Yes.

96
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,350
- Speech.
- Yeah, Dad.

97
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,936
Come on, Walt. Speech.

98
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:18,899
Well, it's...

99
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:20,650
It's kind of funny.

100
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:26,323
When I got my diagnosis, cancer

101
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:30,702
I said to myself, you know:

102
00:10:30,952 --> 00:10:32,162
"Why me?"

103
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,916
And then

104
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:40,420
the other day,
when I got the good news...

105
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,967
I said the same thing.

106
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:56,770
Anyway.

107
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,981
Thank you for coming.

108
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:03,777
And enjoy.

109
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:07,614
- All right, cheers.
- Yeah.

110
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:09,157
Cheers.

111
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,576
Inspirational.

112
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:15,163
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

113
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:16,414
I'll tell you that much.

114
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:20,085
A little mercury switch, 9-volt battery

115
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:24,422
five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

116
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:27,425
Yeah, but why a turtle?

117
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:30,303
Oh, that's the best part. It was a...

118
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:33,112
It was a... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

119
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:36,810
Not a metaphor, not an analogy, it's a...

120
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:39,521
Walt, what's the word I'm looking for?

121
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:42,858
Anyway

122
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:46,820
Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

123
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:49,322
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

124
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:54,244
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

125
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,830
Hey, top me off there, will you, buddy?

126
00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:58,707
Anyway.

127
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,750
Poetic.

128
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,963
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

129
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:07,090
I guess that's the word.

130
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,153
Go ahead.

131
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,701
Better not let your mom see.

132
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:54,054
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
Maybe two.

133
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:58,514
- There's no worm in this, right?
- No, that would be mescal.

134
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,894
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

135
00:13:01,102 --> 00:13:04,313
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

136
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:07,776
Had this firearm instructor who was...

137
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:10,778
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

138
00:13:10,862 --> 00:13:14,241
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

139
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:17,077
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

140
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:19,246
We were drinking mescal stupid.

141
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:21,581
But... Hey, hey.

142
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,753
Walt, what you doing there?

143
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,820
What does it look like I'm doing?

144
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:31,925
The kid's 16.

145
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,567
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

146
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:38,348
What are you looking at him for?

147
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:47,399
We're celebrating. Come on.

148
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,196
That's all right.

149
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,292
No.

150
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:13,133
Jesus.

151
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:22,851
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

152
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:26,229
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

153
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:28,815
Hey.

154
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:34,571
Bring the bottle back.

155
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:39,618
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

156
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:43,663
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

157
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,545
- It's all right.
- What are you waiting for?

158
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:51,963
Bring it back.

159
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:01,681
Why don't we just call it a day?

160
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:04,518
All right, pal?

161
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:10,232
- We good?
- The bottle.

162
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:13,360
Now.

163
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:22,661
What's going on?

164
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,501
Jesus.

165
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:35,966
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

166
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:37,843
Oh, my God.

167
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,055
Okay. Okay.

168
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,603
There you go. Okay. That's it.

169
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:51,106
Just get it out. That's okay.

170
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,123
This is your brain.

171
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,838
This is your brain on drugs.

172
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,727
You weren't supposed to wake up.

173
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:25,146
Ever or...?

174
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:30,985
No, I was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

175
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,696
You want me to go back to bed?

176
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:36,491
No, I guess that'd be kind of...

177
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,036
No.

178
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:44,165
Need some help?

179
00:16:44,373 --> 00:16:46,292
No, I got it.

180
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:50,588
Just have a seat.

181
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,632
Is there any coffee?

182
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:56,052
Yeah, shit. One second.

183
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,221
Well, at least let me do that.

184
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,599
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

185
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:13,194
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

186
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,406
It's huevos rancheros.

187
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:19,534
- I can tell.
- Yeah?

188
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:24,580
- Fork.
- Oh, yeah.

189
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:35,800
There you go.

190
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:40,555
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

191
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:44,267
- Whatever that means.
- No.

192
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:48,938
I'm all yours.

193
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:50,356
Really?

194
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:35,902
<i>Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

195
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:39,447
Hi.

196
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,910
I just wanted to say that...

197
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:45,328
No.

198
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:49,373
We'll talk tonight,

199
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,377
but I wanted to say that

200
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:58,382
I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday,

201
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:00,510
but it wasn't me.

202
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:04,889
And I'm sorry.

203
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,893
Love you.

204
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,884
Oh, boy.

205
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:03,823
<i>I just wanted to say that...</i>

206
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:05,241
<i>No.</i>

207
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:10,163
<i>We'll talk tonight,
but I wanted to say that...</i>

208
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:11,748
Hey there.

209
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:15,877
- Wow, who brought the churros?
- That would be me.

210
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:19,635
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so...

211
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:25,762
They're actually... They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

212
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,889
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

213
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:30,975
Actually

214
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:32,810
Walt's got...

215
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:38,941
He's been battling cancer.

216
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:42,653
- Skyler...
- And last week we got good news.

217
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:46,991
- I'm so sorry.
- But we're really optimistic.

218
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,534
Great.

219
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:51,370
- Great. Good news is great.
- Yeah.

220
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:54,040
Yeah, it is. It really is.

221
00:20:58,211 --> 00:20:59,712
Well

222
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:02,799
feel free to bring these any time.

223
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:04,550
Yeah.

224
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:17,980
Got some real beauts.

225
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:24,779
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

226
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:26,531
Yeah?

227
00:21:27,573 --> 00:21:30,660
Then again, what about tankless?

228
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:33,996
Sure. We got them.

229
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,833
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

230
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,128
Set you back about 1200.

231
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,548
It's not an issue.

232
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:47,760
You want installation, right?

233
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:52,473
- No. I'm gonna do it myself.
- That's what I like to hear.

234
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:07,238
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

235
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:10,491
That's Hover Man.

236
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,578
He can surf, skate, glide

237
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:18,332
whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

238
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,043
That's cool. Great lines.

239
00:22:25,673 --> 00:22:27,842
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

240
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:31,053
That's Kanga-man.

241
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,848
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

242
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:38,352
- And who's this in his pouch?
- His sidekick, Joey.

243
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:42,148
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know

244
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:43,941
fights crime.

245
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,111
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:49,739
You know that, right?

247
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:52,533
Only female kangaroos have pouches.

248
00:22:52,742 --> 00:22:54,202
Yeah, yeah, I know.

249
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,871
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

250
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,373
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,543
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

252
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:09,133
- And this is?
- It's Backwardo.

253
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:13,054
Wait, no. I actually...
I changed it to Rewindo.

254
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:15,348
Anyways, he goes backwards.

255
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:17,349
He can make everything go in reverse.

256
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,477
Time and stuff? Like time travelling?

257
00:23:19,685 --> 00:23:22,230
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,233
He walks backwards?

259
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:28,611
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

260
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,197
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

261
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:34,356
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

262
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:37,884
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

263
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,705
Okay.

264
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:42,417
Yo, I was a kid

265
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,168
when I drew all these.

266
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,921
It was like four years ago.

267
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:50,883
- They all look like you.
- What?

268
00:23:51,634 --> 00:23:53,928
It's you in all of these.

269
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:56,264
No.

270
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:59,475
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

271
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:01,853
Oh, shut up.

272
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:04,105
Like you never wanted a superpower.

273
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,867
- Is that your door or mine?
- I don't know.

274
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:19,078
It sounds like mine.

275
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,297
- I gotta go.
- Where?

276
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,468
Hey, where?

277
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,639
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

278
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,609
Jane.

279
00:25:01,621 --> 00:25:03,039
Jane.

280
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:18,805
- Hey, Dad.
- There you are.

281
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:21,265
Hi, honey.

282
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:24,435
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

283
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:27,772
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

284
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,230
Finally realised that
I wasn't the drum track?

285
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,945
- Exactly.
- Well, I was in the neighbourhood.

286
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:36,906
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

287
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:38,366
Sure. Yeah.

288
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:43,287
Hey, this your dad?

289
00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:46,249
- Yes.
- Hello.

290
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:47,708
Hi.

291
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:49,627
This is the new tenant.

292
00:25:49,836 --> 00:25:52,463
- Donald.
- Jesse.

293
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:58,136
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

294
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,891
- No.
- Dad, why don't you come in?

295
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,685
It was nice seeing you.

296
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:08,855
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

297
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:39,661
Hey, Dad.

298
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:44,833
- Hey, son. Are you home early?
- No.

299
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:47,669
Oh, man.

300
00:26:48,962 --> 00:26:51,298
It was a good day?

301
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:55,511
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

302
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:57,721
Yes. Yes, indeed.

303
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,433
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

304
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:03,018
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

305
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:07,314
- Hey, want to take her for a spin?
- Oh, yeah.

306
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:10,192
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

307
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,612
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

308
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:15,405
Okay.

309
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:19,368
Pilot in.

310
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:22,246
Ignition. Bingo.

311
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:24,039
Okay.

312
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:27,626
- Ready.
- All right. Let her rip.

313
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:37,719
Hundred and seventeen thousand BTUs.

314
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,930
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

315
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:42,558
Built-in corrosion-resistant
draught reducer

316
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:45,227
safety thermocouple
with the pilot burner.

317
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:47,521
Sounds really good, Dad.

318
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:49,898
And the energy savings. I mean...

319
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:52,234
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

320
00:27:52,442 --> 00:27:55,342
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

321
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:58,073
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.

322
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:02,786
Son

323
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:07,416
- about yesterday...
- I'm sorry about the pool.

324
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:12,921
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

325
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:15,841
See, your...

326
00:28:16,425 --> 00:28:18,635
Your old man embarrassed himself,

327
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:21,096
and I'm not very proud of my behaviour.

328
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:25,100
I have to say I feel very foolish.

329
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:31,815
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

330
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:35,360
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

331
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:39,448
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

332
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:45,954
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

333
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:49,833
I should have used
better judgment all around.

334
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:54,046
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right,

335
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:56,423
and for that I'm very sorry.

336
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,884
But I kept up, right?

337
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:04,973
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

338
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,566
I have some tools to put away.

339
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:18,130
Hey.

340
00:30:20,507 --> 00:30:21,508
Yo.

341
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,886
You want to catch a movie later?

342
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:28,765
Yo.

343
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:33,353
- What?
- What was that all about?

344
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:35,647
What?

345
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:38,275
Before. With your dad.

346
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:41,028
It wasn't about anything.

347
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:46,283
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

348
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:48,744
If anything, I was doing you a favour.

349
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:50,537
A favour?

350
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:53,457
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

351
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:56,376
- He seemed cool to me.
- Yeah, well.

352
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:59,922
- So, what's the deal?
- There's no deal.

353
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,467
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

354
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:06,220
- How's that?
- I mean

355
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:10,516
I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

356
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:12,768
I bought a filter.

357
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:15,354
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

358
00:31:16,146 --> 00:31:18,607
You acted like you didn't even know me.

359
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:20,275
So?

360
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:23,946
- So?
- You think I'm gonna be all like:

361
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:26,322
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

362
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,867
And by the way, I'm sleeping with him"?

363
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:31,735
That's all you think you're doing?

364
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:34,504
- Why do you even care about my dad?
- I don't.

365
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:37,083
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

366
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:40,796
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

367
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:43,423
- Us.
- Yeah.

368
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:45,634
You and me.

369
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:49,638
Who's you and me?

370
00:31:57,563 --> 00:31:59,148
I'm out of here.

371
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,501
Oh, boy.

372
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:54,221
Dad?

373
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:02,020
Dad? Hello?

374
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:04,439
What? Oh, hey.

375
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:08,569
- What are you doing?
- We've got rot.

376
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:11,405
- Rot?
- Yeah. Here.

377
00:34:11,613 --> 00:34:14,032
I'll show you. Here.

378
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,284
Take a look at that.

379
00:34:17,744 --> 00:34:20,747
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like it?

380
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:24,710
- It's wood.
- It's wood

381
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:26,628
that contains fruiting bodies.

382
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:28,547
Fruity what?

383
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:32,009
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

384
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,261
I don't really see anything.

385
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,931
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

386
00:34:38,682 --> 00:34:40,767
Then you cut it all out.

387
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:43,395
You just cut it out and start fresh.

388
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:47,191
Well, better get to it.

389
00:34:47,566 --> 00:34:50,486
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

390
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:53,155
Not if I can help it.

391
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:23,185
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

392
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:27,272
- Go home already.
- I will. I will.

393
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:32,027
Hey, can I just ask

394
00:35:33,028 --> 00:35:35,739
- the Keller account?
- The Keller account?

395
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:39,618
It's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet,

396
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:43,872
but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so...

397
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:45,123
Oh, God.

398
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:48,544
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

399
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:52,152
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships

400
00:35:52,256 --> 00:35:54,258
with these little companies.

401
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:58,053
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

402
00:35:59,138 --> 00:36:00,556
Right.

403
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:04,268
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

404
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:06,436
Sky?

405
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:09,690
Skyler?

406
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:12,568
Jesus.

407
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,030
No, I'm fine.

408
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:22,327
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

409
00:36:23,537 --> 00:36:25,372
I'll see you tomorrow.

410
00:36:32,546 --> 00:36:33,922
What's wrong?

411
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:39,386
I guess it just...

412
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:45,601
doesn't feel any different.

413
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:53,108
The good news?

414
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:58,447
I mean, nothing's really changed.

415
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,284
It's just postponed.

416
00:37:04,203 --> 00:37:07,289
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

417
00:37:11,668 --> 00:37:13,962
But lately, it just feels like...

418
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,549
More tunnel.

419
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,802
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:28,560
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

421
00:37:29,353 --> 00:37:31,355
I don't know.

422
00:37:32,189 --> 00:37:33,941
For me, it was the flu.

423
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:37,820
- What?
- My dad rallied at the end.

424
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:40,528
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got

425
00:37:40,614 --> 00:37:43,158
different circumstances,
but we were happy

426
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:44,993
we were over the moon.

427
00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:48,455
And right then, I got sick.

428
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:51,667
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

429
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,753
Couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't move.

430
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:57,840
- Great timing, huh?
- Yeah.

431
00:37:59,216 --> 00:38:02,886
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

432
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:04,680
"Why now?"

433
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:09,726
Being that rock.

434
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:12,354
You know

435
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:17,276
being that rock takes everything you got.

436
00:38:23,657 --> 00:38:25,117
Yeah.

437
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:23,383
<i>Causing the housing prices to trend.</i>

438
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:27,095
<i>Foreclosures are being fuelled
by a spike in...</i>

439
00:39:30,098 --> 00:39:34,311
<i>The economy is rapidly deteriorating
and unemployment is climbing.</i>

440
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,273
<i>With Americans losing money over
rising inflation and tight spending</i>

441
00:39:38,482 --> 00:39:40,943
<i>the housing market is unlikely to rebound</i>

442
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:43,821
<i>spelling more pain for the economy.</i>

443
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:53,542
Yeah.

444
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:14,313
Are you going to work today?

445
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:18,859
Skyler, there's rot.

446
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,411
I'm going back.

447
00:42:01,879 --> 00:42:05,716
All right. We'll take care of that
tomorrow. Okay, good night.

448
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,183
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night.

449
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:18,604
Oh, damn.

450
00:42:20,898 --> 00:42:22,566
- Clumsy.
- I got it.

451
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:25,027
No, no, Ted.
You don't have to do that.

452
00:42:54,056 --> 00:42:57,643
<i>Get organised. Storage containers
to meet every need</i>

453
00:42:57,851 --> 00:43:00,437
<i>big or small, on Aisle 3.</i>

454
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:04,316
<i>Stashing your stuff
has never been so easy.</i>

455
00:43:16,286 --> 00:43:19,540
<i>Get a thicker, fuller lawn
in less than six weeks.</i>

456
00:43:19,748 --> 00:43:22,918
<i>Why can't the grass
always be greener on your side?</i>

457
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,754
<i>Go to Aisle 10 to go green.</i>

458
00:43:31,385 --> 00:43:33,219
<i>Get a manager on Check out 4, please.</i>

459
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:35,431
<i>Manager to Check out 4.</i>

460
00:43:45,065 --> 00:43:47,025
<i>Pest problems? No problem.</i>

461
00:43:47,234 --> 00:43:51,029
<i>Your extermination destination
is Aisle 6.</i>

462
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:53,449
You're buying the wrong matches.

463
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:56,118
- What?
- Those matches.

464
00:43:56,326 --> 00:43:57,578
They're the wrong kind.

465
00:43:58,537 --> 00:44:00,956
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips

466
00:44:01,165 --> 00:44:03,042
not the matches themselves.

467
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,962
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

468
00:44:11,425 --> 00:44:13,225
More striker strips. You understand?

469
00:44:13,969 --> 00:44:16,096
Those only have the one.

470
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,807
And don't buy everything in one place.

471
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:20,267
Do it piecemeal.

472
00:44:20,476 --> 00:44:23,937
Different items, different stores.
Attracts less attention.

473
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:29,401
Are you following me here?

474
00:44:34,281 --> 00:44:37,659
<i>You've been putting off
refinishing that deck long enough.</i>

475
00:44:37,868 --> 00:44:40,412
<i>We have everything you need
to do the job right.</i>

476
00:44:45,501 --> 00:44:47,086
- Thanks.
- Sure.

477
00:44:47,294 --> 00:44:49,338
- Next.
- Hi. Here you go.

478
00:45:19,576 --> 00:45:21,703
- You didn't buy my stuff?
- No, I didn't.

479
00:45:21,912 --> 00:45:23,497
We don't have time for this.

480
00:45:31,088 --> 00:45:33,215
Hey, there he is. That's the guy.

481
00:45:51,024 --> 00:45:54,361
Stay out of my territory.
