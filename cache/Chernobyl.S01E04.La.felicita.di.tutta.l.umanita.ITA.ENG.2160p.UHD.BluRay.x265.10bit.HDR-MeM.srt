1
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,399
It's time to go.

2
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,679
Did you hear me?

3
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,639
This is an evacuation. You understand?

4
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,239
You have to come with me.

5
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:50,959
Why?

6
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,479
Because they told me,
so now I'm telling you.

7
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,319
Everyone in this village, everyone.

8
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:58,999
It's not safe here.
There's radiation in the air.

9
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,039
What's wrong with you?

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,399
Do you know how old I am?

11
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,119
I don't know. Old.

12
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,119
I'm 82.

13
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,838
I've lived here my whole life.

14
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,279
Right here, that house, this place.

15
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:17,039
<i>What do I care about safe?</i>

16
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,799
<i>I have a job.</i>

17
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:21,519
<i>Don't cause trouble.</i>

18
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,279
<i>WOMAN“. Trouble?</i>

19
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:27,279
<i>You're not the first soldier
to stand here with a gun.</i>

20
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,599
<i>When I was 12, the revolution came.</i>

21
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,959
<i>Czar's men. Then Bolsheviks.</i>

22
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:36,919
<i>Boys like you marching in lines.</i>

23
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,679
<i>They told us to leave. No.</i>

24
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,719
<i>Then there was Stalin and his famine,</i>

25
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,438
<i>the Holodomor.</i>

26
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,519
<i>My parents died.
Two of my sisters died.</i>

27
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,199
<i>They told the rest of us to leave.</i>

28
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:52,959
No.

29
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,959
Then the Great War.

30
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,839
German boys. Russian boys.

31
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,679
More soldiers,
more famine, more bodies.

32
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,679
My brothers never came home.

33
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:07,959
But I stayed, and I'm still here.

34
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:10,839
After all that I have seen,

35
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,879
so I should leave now,

36
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,559
because of something
I cannot see at all?

37
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,599
No.

38
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,719
Just one moment!

39
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,279
It's time to go.

40
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,719
Please stand up now.

41
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,559
This is your last warning.

42
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,079
It's time to go.

43
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,239
Come on.

44
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,839
Point four.

45
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:50,238
Point six.

46
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:57,078
Fifteen.

47
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:53,558
Legasov.

48
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,039
I'll meet him there.

49
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,598
The atom
is a humbling thing.

50
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,798
It's not humbling, it's humiliating.

51
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,479
Why is the core still exposed
to the air?

52
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,079
Why have we not already covered it up?

53
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,839
We want to,
but we can't get close enough.

54
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:12,639
The debris on the roof is graphite
from the core itself.

55
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,759
Until we can push it off the roof
back into the reactor,

56
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:18,998
it'll kill anyone who gets near it.

57
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:23,278
You can see
the roof is in three levels.

58
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:26,119
We've named them.
The small one here is Katya.

59
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:28,559
1,000 roentgen per hour.

60
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,518
Presume two hours of exposure
is fatal.

61
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,199
The one on the side, Nina.

62
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:35,518
2,000 roentgen. One hour, fatal.

63
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,518
We used remote-control bulldozers
in Afghanistan.

64
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,799
Too heavy. They'd fall right through.

65
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,719
So then...

66
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:44,398
Moon rovers.

67
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,158
Lunokhod STR-1's. They're light.

68
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:49,799
And if we line them with lead,
they can withstand the radiation.

69
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,479
We couldn't put a man on the moon.

70
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,158
At least we can keep a man off a roof.

71
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,559
That is the most
important thing, General.

72
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:59,358
Under no circumstances
can men go up there.

73
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,199
Robots only.

74
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:03,878
What about this large section here?

75
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:06,399
Masha.

76
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,279
12,000 roentgen.

77
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:13,198
If you were to stand there
in full protective gear

78
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,958
head-to-toe for two minutes,

79
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,758
your life expectancy
would be cut in half.

80
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,879
By three minutes,
you're dead within months.

81
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:21,919
Even our lunar rovers
won't work on Masha.

82
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:25,079
That amount of gamma radiation
penetrates everything.

83
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:28,838
The particles literally shred
the circuits in microchips apart.

84
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,119
If it's more complicated
than a light switch,

85
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,838
Masha will destroy it.

86
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:34,438
It would be fair to say that

87
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,119
that piece of roof
is the most dangerous place on Earth.

88
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,878
So, what do we do?

89
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:50,638
That's what we wanted to ask you.

90
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:04,238
<i>Tent 181?</i>

91
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,918
It's all right. It's free.

92
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,238
It's a little early.

93
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:36,278
Bacho.

94
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:39,518
PaveL

95
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:41,998
-Yeah?
-Mmm.

96
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:47,919
What unit were you in?

97
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,638
They had me in motor pool in Kiev,
but then they...

98
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:54,718
Not this bullshit. In Afghanistan.

99
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:56,118
Oh. Oh, I am...

100
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:57,799
I wasn't in Afghanistan.

101
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:01,598
I'm not in the military.

102
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:06,559
They're running out of men.

103
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:19,438
Showers. Food.

104
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,079
Those guys, they dig up the ground.

105
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:23,999
Those guys, they cut down trees.

106
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:29,358
Those guys, they evacuate people,
I think, like villagers.

107
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:32,158
What about them?

108
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:34,758
I don't know them. Fuck them.

109
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,119
Janek!

110
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,318
-What do you want?
-Give me an egg basket.

111
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:44,678
-No. I've only got the one...
-Give me the fucking basket!

112
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,118
He's with me. You understand?
Nobody fucks with him.

113
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,518
We make these from lead scrap.

114
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,118
-Put it on under your balls.
-Now?

115
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,839
No, no. You can wait
until the radiation gives you a cunt.

116
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:03,518
Yes, now.

117
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:08,038
Over your clothes. Fucking shit.

118
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:18,078
-You ever go hunting?
-No.

119
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,078
Well, today's your lucky day.

120
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:27,158
You, me, that ugly Armenian
in the tent, Garo,

121
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:28,478
we do animal control.

122
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:30,878
Animal control?

123
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:34,118
Yeah, they're radioactive,
so they have to go.

124
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:37,038
But it's not hard.
They're mostly pets.

125
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,478
They're happy to see you.
They run right up to you.

126
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:41,918
Bang!

127
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,438
You load the bodies on a truck,

128
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,838
dump them in a pit,
bury them in concrete,

129
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:46,959
and then we drink.

130
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:49,198
As much vodka as you want,

131
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:51,318
plus 1,000 rubles.

132
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:55,038
Let's go get you a gun.

133
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:02,758
Yes?

134
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,239
I need to see the following documents.
They're listed as "permission only."

135
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:13,558
I'm working for the Central Committee.

136
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,078
Comrade?

137
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:05,278
She can have that one.

138
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:14,878
Thank you, Comrade.

139
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:52,038
- All <i>clear.</i>
- Bring up the cameras.

140
00:18:57,878 --> 00:18:59,317
- Signal?
- Acceptable.

141
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:00,958
Running on board diagnostics.

142
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:02,998
Tell me when
we're ready to move it.

143
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:06,317
To think that's what we put
on the moon.

144
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:09,918
Well, not that one.

145
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:13,278
I know not that one.

146
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:16,278
This rover was in storage.
They can build two more.

147
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:18,678
That should cover Nina and Katya.

148
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:21,278
And Masha?

149
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:23,398
The Central Committee
have informed me

150
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,278
that they may have found something
that could work up there.

151
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:28,198
-From the outside.
-American?

152
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:30,317
Of course not.

153
00:19:31,078 --> 00:19:32,558
It's a German police robot.

154
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,198
But West German,
so, as you can imagine,

155
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:37,238
that wasn't
an easy conversation to have.

156
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:40,798
Diagnostics complete.
Ready to engage main power and motor.

157
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:42,958
Begin.

158
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:49,838
Can we move it?

159
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:05,198
Valery, what's that? A smile?

160
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:26,118
I see your condition
has improved, Comrade Dyatlov.

161
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:27,358
No. Leave.

162
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:36,277
I need your help.

163
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:46,918
Akimov initiated AZ-5.

164
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,277
-When you gave the order...
-Order? What order?

165
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,918
Toptunov called it out,
Akimov pressed it.

166
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:57,638
It was the only
good decision they made.

167
00:20:57,718 --> 00:20:58,678
Incompetent morons.

168
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,918
Can you confirm
that the reactor exploded

169
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:04,677
after they attempted to shut it down?

170
00:21:05,758 --> 00:21:07,598
How do I even know it exploded, huh?

171
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:29,318
I found this in the state archive.

172
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:32,998
Written in 1976.

173
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:34,837
It's about the operation

174
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,438
of RBMK reactors
under extreme conditions.

175
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:38,478
So?

176
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:40,877
The names of the authors
have been redacted,

177
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:42,918
and two pages have been removed.

178
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:46,797
Well, the State must protect
its secrets, Comrade.

179
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:48,878
Do you dare suggest otherwise?

180
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:51,717
They made a mistake.

181
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:56,237
They didn't redact
the table of contents.

182
00:22:06,878 --> 00:22:08,437
The missing pages apparently refer

183
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:11,918
to a positive void coefficient
and AZ-5.

184
00:22:13,117 --> 00:22:14,318
Does that mean anything to you?

185
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:16,918
What are you after here?
Why are you asking me this?

186
00:22:16,998 --> 00:22:19,118
You worked with this reactor.
You know it better than I do.

187
00:22:19,198 --> 00:22:21,077
So everything's my fault, then?

188
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:23,238
Is that what this is?

189
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:26,198
I'm not here to blame you.
I'm here to find out what happened.

190
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,558
And whether you realize it or not,

191
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:30,638
I'm your best chance
to avoid a bullet.

192
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,637
Can you help me or not?

193
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:45,438
I have no idea
what would have gone here.

194
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:48,318
Void coefficients
have nothing to do with AZ-5.

195
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:50,598
There. Now you can go.

196
00:22:51,397 --> 00:22:53,478
-You're not even curious?
-What for?

197
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:57,677
You think the right question
will get you the truth?

198
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:00,717
There's no truth.

199
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:04,397
Ask the bosses whatever you want
and you'll get the lie.

200
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:07,478
And I will get the bullet.

201
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:38,197
I only have two rules.

202
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:39,717
One.

203
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:42,997
Don't point this gun at me.
That's easy, right?

204
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:45,237
You can point it
at this piece of shit.

205
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,918
I don't give a fuck. Never me.

206
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:49,278
Two.

207
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:52,398
If you hit an animal
and it doesn't die,

208
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:54,117
keep shooting until it does.

209
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:56,678
Don't let them suffer,

210
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,958
or I'll kill you. Understand?

211
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:02,237
I mean it.

212
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:04,878
I've killed a lot of people.

213
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:12,558
Good. Then we're ready.

214
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:53,598
Once we start, they'll run inside
where they feel safe.

215
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,997
So we go door to door.

216
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:58,077
Okay?

217
00:25:58,678 --> 00:25:59,638
Good.

218
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:49,037
Hey!

219
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:51,878
Do your job. Door to door.

220
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:36,557
—{GUNSHOT)

221
00:27:43,757 --> 00:27:45,638
Go. Go.

222
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:47,637
Go away. Go!

223
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:43,157
Don't let them suffer.

224
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:44,878
Sorry. Sorry.

225
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:49,278
You're dragging that to the truck.

226
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:26,438
You gonna eat?

227
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:37,917
Drink.

228
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:42,757
Again.

229
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:55,637
Look”.

230
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:00,397
This happens to everyone
their first time.

231
00:30:01,477 --> 00:30:03,117
Normally when you kill a man.

232
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:06,517
But for you, a dog.

233
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:08,958
So What? There's no shame in it.

234
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:12,917
You remember your first time, Garo?

235
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:16,717
My first time, Afghanistan.

236
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,797
We were moving through a house,

237
00:30:21,718 --> 00:30:24,757
and suddenly a man was there
and I shot him in the stomach.

238
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:28,757
Yeah, that's a real war story.

239
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:32,877
There are never any good stories
like in the movies. They're shit.

240
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:37,717
A man was there, boom, stomach.

241
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,197
I was so scared,
I didn't pull the trigger again

242
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:43,637
for the rest of the day.

243
00:30:45,837 --> 00:30:48,317
I thought, "Well, that's it, Bacho.

244
00:30:49,957 --> 00:30:51,478
"You put a bullet in someone.

245
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:53,837
"You're not you anymore.

246
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,837
"You'll never be you again."

247
00:30:58,717 --> 00:31:01,918
But then you wake up the next morning,
and you're still you.

248
00:31:03,357 --> 00:31:04,477
And you realize

249
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:07,437
that was you all along.

250
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:09,998
You just didn't know.

251
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:22,597
"The happiness of all mankind."

252
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:27,157
What?

253
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:31,517
"Our goal is the happiness
of all mankind."

254
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:39,997
Yeah.

255
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:45,837
I'm happy.

256
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:47,718
I'm happy every day.

257
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:50,997
All right.

258
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:53,357
Back to work.

259
00:31:54,557 --> 00:31:55,517
Come on.

260
00:33:11,117 --> 00:33:12,157
It's here.

261
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:41,277
All right.

262
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,197
Get over. Right, hang on.

263
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:49,197
Easy now. Careful.

264
00:33:50,157 --> 00:33:51,117
Hold it!

265
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:00,277
Joker

266
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:04,197
It's what the Germans
named it. "Joker."

267
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:05,557
Is it ready?

268
00:34:06,197 --> 00:34:07,157
It's ready.

269
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,717
Good signal.

270
00:34:55,117 --> 00:34:56,077
Cameras.

271
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:58,477
Motors.

272
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:02,797
Motors, good. Signals, good.

273
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:05,797
All right, let's take this easy.

274
00:35:06,357 --> 00:35:08,477
Forward one meter, reverse one meter.

275
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:11,637
Forward one.

276
00:35:15,757 --> 00:35:16,997
Germans.

277
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,597
Reverse one.

278
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:33,237
Did you lose the signal?

279
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,437
It's not the signal. It's the vehicle.

280
00:35:42,277 --> 00:35:43,317
It's dead.

281
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:50,517
Shit.

282
00:35:55,317 --> 00:35:57,037
Of course, I know they're listening!

283
00:35:57,117 --> 00:35:59,157
I want them to hear!
I want them to hear it all!

284
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:00,837
Do you know what we're doing here?

285
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:03,557
Tell those idiots what they have done!

286
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:07,157
I don't give a fuck!

287
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,117
Tell them! Go tell them! Ryzhkov!

288
00:36:11,197 --> 00:36:12,357
Go tell them he's a joke!

289
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,317
Tell fucking Gorbachev!

290
00:36:14,397 --> 00:36:15,357
Tell them!

291
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:39,477
The official position of the State

292
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:44,437
is that a global nuclear catastrophe
is not possible in the Soviet Union.

293
00:36:45,397 --> 00:36:46,357
They told the Germans

294
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:50,877
that the highest detected level
of radiation was 2,000 roentgen.

295
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:54,277
They gave them the propaganda number.

296
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,636
That robot was never going to work.

297
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:04,357
We need a new phone.

298
00:37:44,517 --> 00:37:45,997
What if we don't clear it?

299
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:47,756
We have to clear it.

300
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:52,276
If we don't clear the roof,
we can't build a cover over it.

301
00:37:54,517 --> 00:37:57,037
If we can't cover it,
that's 12,000 roentgen.

302
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:01,196
Nearly twice the radiation
from the Hiroshima bomb.

303
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,837
- Every hour, hour after hour...
- I know, I know, I know.

304
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:06,877
What about lead?

305
00:38:08,596 --> 00:38:09,877
We could... I don't know.

306
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:13,077
We could melt it and pour it
from above, like a coating.

307
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,557
First of all, we've already used

308
00:38:14,636 --> 00:38:16,037
most of the lead we had...

309
00:38:16,116 --> 00:38:18,117
There's lead sheeting
around the instruments

310
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:19,917
in the other reactor buildings.

311
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:22,557
The soldiers are stripping it
for their armor.

312
00:38:22,637 --> 00:38:23,757
Are you serious?

313
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:30,877
Even if, we're still talking
about boiling metal in a helicopter.

314
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:33,237
And it's lead, Boris.
It'll weigh a ton.

315
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:38,957
What if we shoot the graphite
into the hole?

316
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,796
We've got high-caliber bullets,
exploding bullets.

317
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:43,877
They wouldn't just ricochet,
they'd push...

318
00:38:43,956 --> 00:38:47,917
You wanna shoot exploding bullets
at an exposed nuclear reactor?

319
00:38:47,997 --> 00:38:49,517
-Well...
-No,no.

320
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:51,877
Let's go light that roof back on fire.

321
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:54,357
It was so easy
to put out the first time.

322
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:57,997
What are we talking about here?

323
00:38:59,997 --> 00:39:01,477
We need another robot.

324
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:05,116
One that can withstand the radiation.

325
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:07,637
I've asked. There is nothing.

326
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:10,237
The Americans?

327
00:39:11,037 --> 00:39:12,796
If the Americans had
that kind of technology,

328
00:39:12,877 --> 00:39:14,397
do you really think
they'd give it to us?

329
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,437
And even if they would,

330
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:16,917
the Central Committee
would never stoop to ask.

331
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:18,556
You know it, I know it.

332
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:21,276
There are no robots.

333
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,157
<i>Wombats.</i>

334
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:31,397
What was that?

335
00:39:36,356 --> 00:39:39,396
We use bio robots.

336
00:39:42,437 --> 00:39:43,397
Men.

337
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:09,837
A lot today.

338
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,236
Where do they get their food?

339
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:20,277
They eat the chickens.

340
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:23,157
Then they eat each other.

341
00:41:33,597 --> 00:41:34,716
Door to door.

342
00:42:44,197 --> 00:42:45,157
Pavel?

343
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:51,317
Pave”

344
00:43:00,076 --> 00:43:02,437
You don't hear me? I'm talking to you.

345
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:05,877
Fuck.

346
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:12,116
Just go outside.

347
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:19,877
Go.

348
00:46:06,716 --> 00:46:07,877
<i>Comrade soldiers,</i>

349
00:46:08,396 --> 00:46:10,757
the Soviet people have had
enough of this accident.

350
00:46:11,276 --> 00:46:12,636
They want us to clean it up,

351
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:15,036
and we have entrusted you
with this serious task.

352
00:46:15,677 --> 00:46:17,076
<i>Because of the nature
of the working area,</i>

353
00:46:17,597 --> 00:46:20,836
<i>you will each have no more
than 90 seconds to solve this problem.</i>

354
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:24,116
<i>Listen carefully
to each of my instructions,</i>

355
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:26,676
<i>and do exactly as you have been told.</i>

356
00:46:26,756 --> 00:46:30,556
<i>This is for your own safety
and the safety of your comrades.</i>

357
00:46:31,276 --> 00:46:33,076
<i>You will enter Reactor Building Three.</i>

358
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:37,036
<i>Climb the stairs, but do not
immediately proceed to the roof.</i>

359
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:39,277
<i>When you get to the top, wait inside,</i>

360
00:46:39,356 --> 00:46:41,597
<i>behind the entrance to the roof
and catch your breath.</i>

361
00:46:42,116 --> 00:46:44,276
<i>You will need it for what comes next.</i>

362
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,716
<i>This is the working area.
We must clear the graphite.</i>

363
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:48,956
<i>Some of it is in blocks,</i>

364
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:51,077
weighing approximately
40 to 50 kilograms.

365
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:53,236
They all must be thrown
over the edge here.

366
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:56,837
Watch your comrades
moving fast from this opening,

367
00:46:56,916 --> 00:47:00,356
then turning to the left,
and entering the workspace here.

368
00:47:00,716 --> 00:47:02,236
<i>Take care not to stumble.</i>

369
00:47:02,877 --> 00:47:04,797
<i>There's a hole in the roof.
Take care not to fall.</i>

370
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:09,356
<i>You will need to move quickly,
and you will need to move carefully.</i>

371
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:12,836
<i>Do you understand your mission
as I have described it?</i>

372
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,517
<i>ALL“. Yes, Comrade General.</i>

373
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,836
<i>These are the most important
90 seconds of your lives.</i>

374
00:47:18,276 --> 00:47:21,356
<i>Commit your task to memory,
then do your job.</i>

375
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:05,516
It's time to go.
After 90 seconds, I will ring a bell.

376
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:08,276
When you hear it, return immediately,
drop your shovels in the bin,

377
00:48:08,756 --> 00:48:11,037
and proceed down the hallway
for decontamination.

378
00:48:11,596 --> 00:48:14,636
Above all, while on the roof,
throw your debris over the rail.

379
00:48:14,716 --> 00:48:16,276
Do not look over the rail.
Is that clear?

380
00:48:17,596 --> 00:48:21,396
Very well. On my mark. Ready. Go.

381
00:49:56,836 --> 00:49:58,596
Whoa!

382
00:50:28,956 --> 00:50:29,916
Comrade soldier.

383
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:32,676
You're done.

384
00:50:44,636 --> 00:50:45,676
Time to go.

385
00:50:58,276 --> 00:50:59,796
Oi! Your glove!

386
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:20,836
Mommy! Mommy!

387
00:52:23,036 --> 00:52:24,156
Sorry for all this.

388
00:52:25,356 --> 00:52:27,635
But we needed to speak to you
somewhere without...

389
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:31,196
They're going to put
Dyatlov on trial,

390
00:52:32,076 --> 00:52:33,796
and Bryukhanov and Fomin.

391
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:37,556
We're going to be asked
to give expert testimony,

392
00:52:37,756 --> 00:52:38,796
all three of us.

393
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,316
But that's...

394
00:52:40,636 --> 00:52:41,635
Before that happens...

395
00:52:41,996 --> 00:52:45,195
The Central Committee
is sending Legasov to Vienna.

396
00:52:45,276 --> 00:52:47,196
It's the headquarters
of the International Atomic...

397
00:52:47,276 --> 00:52:50,156
Atomic Energy Agency.
Yeah, I know what's in Vienna.

398
00:52:52,195 --> 00:52:53,796
What are they asking you to do?

399
00:52:54,556 --> 00:52:55,956
Tell the world what happened.

400
00:53:01,276 --> 00:53:02,676
Well, then you'd better
know what happened.

401
00:53:03,516 --> 00:53:06,476
I've constructed a time line,
minute by minute.

402
00:53:07,436 --> 00:53:09,195
Second by second in some places.

403
00:53:10,236 --> 00:53:13,276
Every decision, every button push,
every turn of a switch.

404
00:53:13,995 --> 00:53:15,915
And? Are they guilty?

405
00:53:16,756 --> 00:53:17,716
Yes.

406
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:22,036
Of gross incompetence,
violation of safety regulations,

407
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,676
recklessness beyond belief.

408
00:53:24,316 --> 00:53:26,796
But the explosion? I'm not sure.

409
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:28,395
What do you mean, you're not sure?

410
00:53:29,796 --> 00:53:31,356
I've analyzed the data.

411
00:53:31,996 --> 00:53:33,676
Toptunov was telling the truth.

412
00:53:34,316 --> 00:53:37,035
They shut the reactor down,
and then it exploded.

413
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,076
I think
this article may have the answer,

414
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:44,356
but two pages have been removed.

415
00:53:50,596 --> 00:53:51,956
You've seen this before.

416
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,076
Please, believe me when I tell you

417
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:57,556
that I had no idea
it could cause an explosion.

418
00:53:57,636 --> 00:54:00,516
-None of us knew.
-None of you knew what?

419
00:54:01,836 --> 00:54:04,595
In 1975, at an RBMK reactor
in Leningrad,

420
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,756
a fuel channel ruptured.
The operators pressed AZ-5,

421
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:11,236
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

422
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:14,156
for a brief moment, it went up.

423
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,076
How is that possible?

424
00:54:16,156 --> 00:54:19,476
Well, this was the very question posed
by a colleague of mine named Volkov.

425
00:54:19,555 --> 00:54:20,996
He's the one who wrote this article.

426
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:23,476
When an RBMK reactor runs
at low power,

427
00:54:23,556 --> 00:54:25,116
it's notoriously unstable.

428
00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:27,196
Prone to swings in reactivity.

429
00:54:28,356 --> 00:54:30,436
Under normal circumstances,
the control rods

430
00:54:30,515 --> 00:54:32,916
-can compensate for that.
-Under normal circumstances.

431
00:54:32,995 --> 00:54:36,275
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

432
00:54:36,676 --> 00:54:38,276
They pulled
almost all the control rods out

433
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:39,356
to bring the power back up.

434
00:54:39,435 --> 00:54:41,756
This is what Volkov learned
from Leningrad.

435
00:54:42,116 --> 00:54:44,836
If the boron control rods
are completely withdrawn

436
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,236
from the reactor,
when they're put back in,

437
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:50,476
the first thing
that enters the core isn't boron.

438
00:54:51,235 --> 00:54:52,436
It's graphite.

439
00:54:55,755 --> 00:54:59,755
The control rods have graphite tips
that displace water and steam.

440
00:55:00,356 --> 00:55:04,236
So the reactivity doesn't go down.
It goes up dramatically.

441
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:07,916
Why on earth
would they press that button?

442
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:09,556
They didn't know.

443
00:55:11,795 --> 00:55:13,356
Volkov warned the Kremlin,

444
00:55:14,316 --> 00:55:15,356
10 years ago.

445
00:55:17,516 --> 00:55:20,916
But there could be no doubt
about the supremacy

446
00:55:20,995 --> 00:55:22,996
of the Soviet nuclear industry.

447
00:55:23,676 --> 00:55:24,636
Oh.

448
00:55:24,956 --> 00:55:28,036
The KGB classified it
as a state secret.

449
00:55:30,636 --> 00:55:31,955
When I saw
the reactor blown open,

450
00:55:32,036 --> 00:55:34,756
I still didn't think
it could be this flaw in AZ-5.

451
00:55:35,555 --> 00:55:38,596
Because the flaw will not lead
to an explosion

452
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:43,276
unless the operators have pushed
the reactor to the edge of disaster.

453
00:55:43,596 --> 00:55:45,596
-So it is their fault?
-Yes.

454
00:55:46,316 --> 00:55:47,676
But not only their fault.

455
00:55:49,556 --> 00:55:50,516
No.

456
00:55:52,196 --> 00:55:54,116
Is that
what you're going to say in Vienna?

457
00:55:57,956 --> 00:56:00,116
You can't possibly be that naive.

458
00:56:00,915 --> 00:56:06,395
There are 16 RBMK reactors
running in the Soviet Union right now.

459
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:07,996
We have to fix them.

460
00:56:08,475 --> 00:56:11,156
The only way to do that
is to go public,

461
00:56:11,315 --> 00:56:13,196
force the Central Committee
to take action.

462
00:56:13,275 --> 00:56:16,076
What you're proposing
is that Legasov humiliate a nation

463
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:18,956
that is obsessed
with not being humiliated.

464
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:20,716
We can make a deal with the KGB.

465
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:23,636
You'll leave this information out
in Vienna,

466
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:26,476
and they quietly
let us fix the remaining reactors.

467
00:56:26,555 --> 00:56:29,995
A deal with the KGB? And I'm naive.

468
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:35,236
They'll go after your family,
they'll go after your friends.

469
00:56:35,315 --> 00:56:37,756
You have a chance
to talk to the world, Valery.

470
00:56:38,036 --> 00:56:39,836
If that chance was mine...

471
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:41,115
But it isn't, is it?

472
00:56:42,755 --> 00:56:45,036
I've known braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

473
00:56:45,796 --> 00:56:47,716
Men who had their moment
and did nothing.

474
00:56:47,955 --> 00:56:50,916
Because when it's your life
and the lives of everyone you love,

475
00:56:52,036 --> 00:56:53,995
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

476
00:56:54,436 --> 00:56:55,515
It leaves you.

477
00:56:56,836 --> 00:57:00,396
And all you want at that moment
is not to be shot.

478
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,155
Do you know the name Vasily Ignatenko?

479
00:57:08,036 --> 00:57:08,996
No.

480
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:11,076
He was a fireman.

481
00:57:12,755 --> 00:57:14,835
He died two weeks after the accident.

482
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:17,396
I've been looking in on his widow.

483
00:57:18,596 --> 00:57:20,836
She gave birth. A girl.

484
00:57:21,835 --> 00:57:23,516
The baby lived for four hours.

485
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:26,836
They said the radiation
would have killed the mother,

486
00:57:26,915 --> 00:57:28,675
but the baby absorbed it instead.

487
00:57:29,556 --> 00:57:30,516
