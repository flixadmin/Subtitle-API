1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,882
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,840
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,884
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,004
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,726
<i>After defeating Zoom
and saving the multi-verse,</i>

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,163
<i>I ran back in time and created
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.</i>

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,004
<i>I restored the timeline to how it was</i>

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,009
<i>only to find things
weren't as I left them.</i>

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,163
<i>I brought new threats to our world.</i>

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,721
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,923
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,925
IRIS: <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,724
We have to think about
getting back to our Earth.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,921
We've been here long enough.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,485
A whole multi-verse of
Harrison Wells out there.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,767
You want one? Let's go get one.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,406
Wells with a sense of humor.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,880
- Harrison.
- Call me H.R.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,605
Out with the old. In with the new.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,486
What are you doing here? "Julian Albert,
Meta-Human CSI specialist"?

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,727
I don't trust you.

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,002
And I don't like things
that I don't trust.

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,203
How have I worked with this guy
for the past year?

24
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,407
You say that all the time.

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,045
Do you maybe want to
grab some dinner tonight?

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,248
I got movie night with
my kids tonight, rain check?

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,680
You were the only one who wasn't affected

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,120
when I messed with the timeline.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,647
Yo!

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,127
You know you don't need
to do this every morning, right?

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,321
Come on, it's the least I can do.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,211
I mean, I love Joe, but at some point,
man needs his own space,

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,960
and until I find my own space,
that means your space.

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,804
So, as a token of my appreciation...

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,322
Two eggs over easy. Bacon, toast.

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,170
I can't remember,
do you like it buttered or not?

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,648
Barry, sometimes a man
just wants to butter his own bread.

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,851
Okay, sorry. I was just...
Yeah, no, you're right.

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,931
Look, don't... Don't get it twisted, okay?
I love having you here.

40
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,522
You're a great guest. Not sure how
I feel about our other visitor though.

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,968
- Wells?
- "Please, call me H.R."

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,201
So, you don't like him?

43
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,528
Well, it's not so much
that I don't like him. I just...

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,250
The way he says things,
there's something about him.

45
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,801
I don't know what it is.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,128
Dude, he's only been here a few days.
Let him settle in.

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,761
I know we've had
our Wells issues in the past,

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,849
but you can't just stop trusting everybody

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,008
or giving them chances, you know?
You can't live like that.

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,371
This is true. Wise words from a wise man.

51
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,607
Joe knowledge.

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,484
I'm gonna take this to go.

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,523
- Okay, all right.
- Yeah, I'll see you there.

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,801
Yeah, well, I can take you.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,006
No. No. I'm gonna drive myself today.

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,680
Yeah, cool. Cool.

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,960
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Dr. Tannhauser.

58
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,241
Do you have an appointment?

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,801
No, but I'm pretty sure she'll see me.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,525
You can just tell her
Caitlin Snow is here.

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,690
Dr. Tannhauser is a very busy woman.
I'm sure you can understand.

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,362
I appreciate the diligence, Jackie,
but Caitlin's always welcome here.

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,562
Even if I wish she'd call first.

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,769
Nice to see you, too, Mom.

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,964
So, what brings you here?

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,886
Well, I didn't forget your birthday,
did I? I'm pretty sure I sent a card.

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,248
You did. In April.

68
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,841
Thank you.

69
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,562
Look, I read your new paper
on applications in cryo-medicine,

70
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,882
and I think you might be able to help.

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,560
I had no idea you kept up on
the literature over at S.T.A.R. Labs.

72
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,285
That's still what it's called, right?

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,967
Yes, and I have a patient
who could use your help.

74
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,651
Well, if you want to send over the file,

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,444
I'll be happy to take a look
when I have a chance.

76
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,563
But right now, I have
a shareholder meeting to prepare for...

77
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,886
Mom!

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,564
I'm the patient.

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,086
Cancel my appointments.

80
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,170
<i>And have Nigel meet me in the biolab.</i>

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,806
We have work to do.

82
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,091
Sumptuous day!

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,480
Oh, no.
On this Earth, I believe you say...

84
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,410
- Good morning.
- H.R.: <i>Good morning.</i>

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,331
And it is. Isn't it? I mean...

86
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,328
The music on your Earth, well,
it strikes a chord, no pun intended.

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,124
Please, help yourself.

88
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,130
I find a crew works best
when it's well-fed and well-rested.

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,970
Are those coffees for us, too?

90
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,606
Yes indeed, Miss West.

91
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,963
I took the liberty of
reading through your ledgers last night.

92
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,527
A lot of information to absorb,
but let's see how I did.

93
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,808
Skim milk chai latte.

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,041
Okay!

95
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,009
Okay! And an iced Americano
with two... No, three

96
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,690
shots of espresso.

97
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,691
That happened, Walter.

98
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,161
- It's Wally.
- Wally!

99
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,880
Now, for my fleet of foot friend...

100
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,131
You'd best stick to decaf.

101
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,410
Probably for the best, yeah.

102
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,611
San Francisco.

103
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,883
I have prepared a French roast
with a touch of creamer.

104
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,563
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,083
Did you know on my Earth
coffee crop was wiped out by blight?

106
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,486
I mean, that's one more reason to
stay on this Earth, for the coffee alone.

107
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,971
Yeah, well, that's if you stay.

108
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,561
If I stay, time is of the essence.
Here's what I propose.

109
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,046
A series of team-building exercises.

110
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,164
Now, I've hidden a series of clues
all around the facility.

111
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,409
What I propose is,
we break into two groups, all right?

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,886
And you can pick a partner.
You know what...

113
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,529
Okay. I have to stop you, H.R.
I am not feeling this.

114
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,808
It's the roast, isn't it?
I should have gone with a dark...

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,480
No, it's not the roast, the roast is fine.

116
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,449
Our trust isn't something that
you can just build with games.

117
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,607
- Okay?
- No.

118
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,689
<i>This is something
that goes back three years.</i>

119
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,611
It's something that's been forged in fire.
Sometimes literally.

120
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,806
So, maybe you should just
step back and observe.

121
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,247
See what we do here, how we operate.
Did you get that?

122
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,805
Excellent note. I'm gonna run with that.

123
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,930
Where's Caitlin, by the way?
Have you seen...

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,406
- Yes, so she was here.
- She was?

125
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,961
- All right, yeah, you know, we talked...
- What?

126
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,362
And she knocked back
a triple-shot latte,

127
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,326
and she left you a message.
So, I'm gonna...

128
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,724
Yeah, let me just play it for you.
This is not the same as my Earth's.

129
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,611
This is a different... There it is.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,209
CAITLIN: <i>Hey, it's me. I've got
some things I need to take care of.</i>

131
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,129
<i>I shouldn't be gone more than a few days.</i>

132
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,965
<i>See if you can get along without me.</i>

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,567
<i>Make sure Cisco
doesn't touch my pizza pockets.</i>

134
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,207
Wasn't labeled.

135
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,608
Okay, you know what, guys?
I gotta go to work. I'm...

136
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,245
Ooh. Yeah. I gotta do that, too.

137
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,646
- Yeah, let's go.
- I gotta bail.

138
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,969
You know, we'll do
the team building exercises another...

139
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,366
I'll leave the clues
hidden in the facility.

140
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,244
Cool. How do you guys say
"see you later" over there?

141
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,085
Until next communion.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,650
- All right, see you later.
- See you later.

143
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,887
So weird.

144
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,887
CAPTAIN: Come.

145
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,765
Hey! Sorry I'm late.
I had to meet somebody and...

146
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,930
We can add tardiness to the list, Captain.

147
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,488
Allen, it's been brought to my attention

148
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,603
that you've been
giving yourself unauthorized access

149
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,847
to your colleagues' case files.

150
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,681
- Excuse me?
- JULIAN: <i>Along with multiple infractions.</i>

151
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,691
Repeated absences,
disappearing throughout the day,

152
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,769
<i>phone call interruptions,
guests in the lab.</i>

153
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
The list is pretty extensive, Captain.

154
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,043
I'm sorry.
With all due respect, I do my job here.

155
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,401
You do good work here, Allen.

156
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,125
Don't put that in jeopardy
by thinking the rules don't apply to you.

157
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,203
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

158
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,771
<i>Sorry, Captain, that's it?</i>

159
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,287
- Sir, I document eight different...
- Nine.

160
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,645
Nine different violations of regulations
and he gets a 15-second talking to?

161
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,447
Must be nice.

162
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,087
CAPTAIN: <i>We are done here.</i>

163
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,607
You can go.

164
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,201
Captain.

165
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,731
Were you really just being a tattletale?
That's bush league, man.

166
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,087
You know what? You're right.

167
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,170
It's silly of me to think the rules
actually apply to the golden boy

168
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,646
of C.C.P.D.'s crime lab.

169
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,087
Detective.

170
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,287
He's unbelievable.

171
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,245
You know what? I wish you two could
be a little less oil and water

172
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,885
and a little bit more oil and vinegar.

173
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,889
You guys have been
at each other's throats for a year now.

174
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,923
That's just it.
From my perspective, it's been two weeks.

175
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,043
So, you're saying that
before two weeks ago,

176
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,605
you weren't Julian's enemy?

177
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,770
I'm saying before two weeks ago,
Julian didn't even exist.

178
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,246
Because of your Flashpoint.

179
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,562
I know it's
because of the Flashpoint. I...

180
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,047
It's Cisco, hold on.

181
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,327
BARRY: <i>Hey, is this important?</i>

182
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,767
I don't know, does 30 hits downtown
on the meta-human app count?

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,047
What are we looking at?

184
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,601
Well, nothing really.
Every traffic camera in a 10-block radius

185
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,211
suddenly went down, so we're flying blind.

186
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,401
And the hits were all over the map.

187
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,126
All right, well, there's one way
to see what's going on. I gotta go.

188
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,966
<i>CISCO: Most of the chatter is
coming from the harbor district.</i>

189
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,281
All right, I'm here.
It's a bad scene, man.

190
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,082
<i>CISCO: You should be
right on top of it, Barry. What is it?</i>

191
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,647
It's a monster?

192
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,481
Guys, did you hear me?
There is a monster in Central City.

193
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,808
What are we talking? Yao Ming size?
Or Andre the Giant?

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,480
No, it's like an actual monster.

195
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,648
- What even makes that?
- I don't even know that.

196
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,281
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite,
show me something.

197
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,165
Whoa. Ever see anything like that
on Earth-19?

198
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,331
You want me to observe. I'll just observe.

199
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,207
WOMAN: We're in here!

200
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,926
Iris, what are you doing here?

201
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,724
Working on a story.
And last time I checked,

202
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,888
you don't need super-speed
and a red suit to help people.

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,001
All right, get out of here.
I'm gonna try to stop that thing.

204
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,526
Come on, come on!

205
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,800
- Cisco, where'd it go?
- CISCO: <i>Can't track it if I can't see it.</i>

206
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,122
You know what you could do?
You could use your ears.

207
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,731
- My ears?
- What's that sound?

208
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,041
It's a car alarm.

209
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,207
I could use the car alarms

210
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,970
to track the direction
the monster's heading in.

211
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,130
We got him. Head north three blocks.

212
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,127
I lost him.

213
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,567
Yeah, me, too.

214
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,801
I don't get it. I don't get it.

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,209
Every meta-human we've encountered
has been exactly that, meta-human.

216
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,970
So, where did this thing come from?

217
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,368
I don't know where it came from, man.
It just vanished.

218
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,607
That's all I know. It was gone.

219
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,491
Yeah, but in my experience,
things are always different.

220
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,365
- What?
- Than they appear.

221
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,086
There must be a reason the darn thing
can just disappear like that.

222
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,248
Maybe the darn thing's got
some kind of cloaking mechanism.

223
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,925
Uh, that's a good idea,

224
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,884
but right now I would settle for,
"How can we stop it?"

225
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,206
- Yes, obviously.
- How?

226
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,926
- I don't know.
- We don't have a magic monster lasso.

227
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,770
H.R.: <i>But you know what we could...</i>

228
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,084
Oh, sorry, I forgot. I'm just observing.

229
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,402
No, H.R., please,
we're open to any idea right now.

230
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,371
On my Earth, we have ropes
made out of carbon fiber.

231
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,763
They are ultralight,
but strong enough to pull a battleship.

232
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,486
We could restrain it with that.
Right? What do you think?

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,843
- Okay, I think it's...
- Okay.

234
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,003
I think it's worth a shot.
We can spin it down in my workshop.

235
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,241
Yes. Good.

236
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,681
Yeah, there was something else
that was weird, though.

237
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,770
I saw a transformer explode
as this thing passed by it.

238
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,570
- That is weird.
- What's weird about that?

239
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,604
Monster didn't even lay a finger on it.
It exploded before it got to it.

240
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,446
Kind of reminds me of that Hitchcock movie
where the extra covers his ears

241
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,687
before the gun goes off.

242
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,127
You have Hitchcock on this Earth?
Oh, brilliant.

243
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,370
Murder on the Titanic! "Who did it?"
"Who cares? We're drowning."

244
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,568
The beast must emit
some kind of electrical pulse.

245
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,643
Is there a way I could
get a look at that transformer?

246
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,805
No. The whole place is a crime scene now,
with Julian in charge of it.

247
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,122
Ah, Julian. Who's that?

248
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,965
That's the CSI guy you don't like, right?

249
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,641
I mean...

250
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,086
Yeah, all right.

251
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,961
He's great.

252
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,731
Sorry. Cold hands.

253
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,405
I didn't even notice.

254
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,761
- I'm Nigel, by the way.
- Nice to meet you.

255
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,648
We're gonna
help you figure this out, Caitlin.

256
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,651
Let's get you to the lab.

257
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,481
CAITLIN: <i>What's this?</i>

258
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,765
DR. TANNHAUSER: <i>It's to test how your
ability affects molecular motion.</i>

259
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,650
That shaft is solid tungsten,

260
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,763
and it's heated to
over 2,000 degrees centigrade.

261
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,291
<i>I want you to cool it down.</i>

262
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,329
And when we determine how you can do that,

263
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,290
<i>we can figure out
the best way to help you.</i>

264
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,363
Best we could do in such little time.

265
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,523
So, this is where
you've been for the last hour.

266
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,162
I had to
reschedule my day for this, Caitlin.

267
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,602
A lot of things around here
require my attention.

268
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,921
I remember.

269
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,371
Whenever you're ready.

270
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,207
<i>Don't hold back.</i>

271
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,571
Hey, Julian.

272
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,367
You seen this?

273
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,370
It's bad enough
we have the metas destroying the city.

274
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,971
- Now we have this thing to worry about.
- Mmm-hmm.

275
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,521
Is there any point in me asking
where you've been for the last hour?

276
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,882
Or should I just assume
the rules still don't apply to you?

277
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,566
I was, um...

278
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,721
Yes, okay.

279
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,570
Look. Hey, man, so I know that you and I,
we got off on the wrong foot.

280
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,247
We never managed to find the right one,
and I'll take that.

281
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,767
That's probably my fault,
but, um, I just...

282
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,924
I don't want things
to be like that anymore, you know?

283
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,571
I'd like it if things changed.

284
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,888
It's funny, 'cause I remember you
saying something similar to that

285
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,764
right before you stole
the case from underneath me.

286
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,568
Do you have any idea
what it's like to work side by side

287
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,683
with someone
with such little regard for the rules?

288
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,082
You may very well
be contaminating my work.

289
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,448
That's exactly why I wanna learn from you.

290
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,681
I don't follow.

291
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,566
You know, whenever I read your reports,

292
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,970
it's clear that
your evidence collection techniques are

293
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,770
far superior to mine.

294
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,401
Go on.

295
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,365
I don't know. I mean,
if I could just shadow you for a day,

296
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,961
maybe ask a few questions,

297
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,604
I think that you could really
help bring my skills up to snuff.

298
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,086
<i>What do you say?</i>

299
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,801
Sorry.

300
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,971
What if I gave up the lab?

301
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,885
There's a storeroom downstairs
that I could convert,

302
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,766
so if you let me
follow you on this case, lab's yours.

303
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,327
Lab's mine?

304
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,121
Okay. Deal.
You can't slow me down, though.

305
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,166
- I would never.
- All right. I'll call you.

306
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,483
How long have you had these abilities?

307
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,847
They started manifesting a few months ago,

308
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,004
but I'm assuming I got them when
the particle accelerator exploded,

309
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,321
just like all the other metas.

310
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,847
- And you haven't told anyone?
- Just you.

311
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,845
I told you, you never should have
taken that job at S.T.A.R. Labs.

312
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,244
You could've stayed here,
had access to world-class facilities.

313
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,081
And have all of my work
be in the shadow of your reputation.

314
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,529
Of course, the only time
you need your mother

315
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,841
is when you're in trouble.

316
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,167
What's that supposed to mean?

317
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,966
Oh, come on, darling.
You ran off to Central City

318
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,601
to play scientist
with that disgraced quack.

319
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,683
I was trying to make a name for myself.

320
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,288
For three years, barely a word,
until trouble hits,

321
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,046
and then here you come, walking through
the door and expecting Mommy

322
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,044
to drop everything in her life
to try to fix it.

323
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,801
You have no idea what I've been through.

324
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,883
Dr. Tannhauser, look at this.

325
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,571
She's absorbed all that energy? How?

326
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,042
I'm not sure yet,
but if we can figure that out,

327
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,322
this could
change everything we're doing here.

328
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,248
So then the Flash, my Flash again,
not your Flash, we hatched a plan

329
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,883
to gather all the remaining meta-humans
into one place for a final showdown.

330
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,242
They called it "World War M."
It was glorious.

331
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,241
Two forces on opposing sides
of the stadium. The tension built.

332
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,241
No. It was like that movie,
the gladiator was the lead gladiator.

333
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,766
<i>What was that called?</i>

334
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,401
<i>Gladiator.</i>

335
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,610
That's better. On my Earth, it was
called Sweaty Men. That didn't take.

336
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,411
<i>So, the two forces charge into battle,
and when they do...</i>

337
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,603
- I need to take a five.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

338
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,886
- Let's take a...
- By myself.

339
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,844
Yeah, you go ahead.
I'll keep working on this.

340
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,124
So, entry triple A, colon, two.
Plan is proceeding.

341
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,601
Characters are in place.

342
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,525
Nobody seems the wiser as to why I'm here.

343
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,367
Hey.

344
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,971
I had to give
a witness report on the attack,

345
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,804
and I thought I would
make it a lunch date.

346
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,963
Yeah, cool. I'll clear a spot.
Let's do this.

347
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,281
Yeah.

348
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,886
Are things any better with Julian?

349
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,811
Oh, my God, it's like every time
I try to get to know the guy,

350
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,042
he does something
that makes it really hard to.

351
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,487
All I know now is
that he dislikes meta-humans

352
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,085
about as much as he dislikes me.

353
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,647
Maybe you should try
and see things from his perspective.

354
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,404
He might have a reason
to dislike both of you

355
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,806
that you don't know anything about.

356
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,491
Did you just hit me with a Joe-ism?

357
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,966
Well, sometimes he's right.

358
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,446
- Sometimes he's not.
- Yeah.

359
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,961
Speaking of which,
I just saw him downstairs,

360
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,170
and he was talking to the DA.
He blew off a date with her.

361
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,004
I saw him do the same thing last week.

362
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,250
I don't know. Maybe he's not into her.

363
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,807
No, he's into her.
I mean, when I asked him about her,

364
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,081
he basically told me to buzz off.

365
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,645
You're not too good at buzzing off,
are you?

366
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,922
Nope. When it comes to my dad, no.

367
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,482
Well, look who it is.

368
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,966
Looks like I have an opportunity

369
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,686
to see things from Julian's perspective
right now.

370
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,849
Sorry about lunch. I gotta go.

371
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,170
See you later. I need that.

372
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,287
If you don't stop squirming,
I'll never find a vein.

373
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,648
What exactly are you testing for now?

374
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,162
Any polymorphism that could help us
understand how you're able to absorb

375
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,364
that much energy from molecules
to create gelid surroundings.

376
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,683
You realize
I've run all of these tests already?

377
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,524
Then, what was the point of coming here?

378
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,046
Seriously, Mom?

379
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,042
I'm terrified of what I'm becoming.

380
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,882
You realize you haven't
asked me once how I'm feeling?

381
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,327
I'm trying to keep emotion out of this.

382
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,966
Believe me, it's for your benefit
as much as it is mine.

383
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,964
Right, because that's your specialty,
isn't it?

384
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,889
Being cold, just like after...

385
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,326
After what?

386
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,565
After Dad died.

387
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,890
I did everything I could
to save your father.

388
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,050
Well, you lost your daughter
at the same time.

389
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,326
You're the one who went away, Caitlin.

390
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,567
Because I had to.

391
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,686
You realize you never acted
like my mother again after Dad got sick?

392
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,491
You barely even look at me.

393
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,050
I couldn't handle the pain.

394
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,411
My work got me through it.

395
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,925
Losing someone like that.
You have no idea what that feels like.

396
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,571
Actually, I do.

397
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,525
My husband died over a year ago.

398
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,561
I'm sorry.

399
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,041
What do you got?

400
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,242
I said get here quick,
but that was quicker than I expected.

401
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,569
No, yeah, it was a crazy Uber driver.

402
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,405
Well, the blast pattern
and the scoring on the insulation

403
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,841
suggests that
it was a power surge that blew it out.

404
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,441
So, it's a coincidence?

405
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,445
I highly doubt it. But I'll figure it out.

406
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,371
Someone in this city has to
do something about these metas.

407
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,767
What do you mean?

408
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,122
We have a whole police force
working to stop these metas.

409
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,811
No, you have the Flash.

410
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,361
So, it's not just bad metas
you don't like. It's all the metas.

411
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,207
I'm just saying that because of him,
the police department has got lethargic.

412
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,640
I mean, why do anything at all

413
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,450
if the Flash is gonna
save the day every time?

414
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,805
It's a bit like you with
the rule breaking. A momentary fix,

415
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,804
and now you're lazy, sloppy.

416
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,326
Cool. Thanks.

417
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,486
Uh, I think the Flash is actually
a source of inspiration for the city.

418
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,484
I think he kind of provides hope.

419
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,969
Yes, that's one of many things that
we'll have to disagree on, Allen.

420
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,323
What? Do you see something?

421
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,003
A pattern. The creature's movements,
they seemed random at first,

422
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,402
but they were contained
to a prescribed area.

423
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,127
You know, like the creature was
stuck in an invisible fence.

424
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,129
Traffic cameras were down, right?

425
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,325
Maybe it was being watched
or controlled by somebody that

426
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,648
needed to keep it
in visual range the entire time?

427
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,525
Constricting the creature's movements
to the line of sight.

428
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,841
That actually makes sense.

429
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,524
Maybe there is
a brain in there after all, Allen.

430
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,366
Dispatch, this is CSI.
I'm requesting immediate backup.

431
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,804
The monster has been sighted
by the harbor.

432
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,441
- Hey, maybe we should split up.
- No, that's a terrible idea.

433
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,369
Yeah, but we gotta do something, right?

434
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,121
Don't worry, I have
four years training in the military.

435
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,727
Even still, since when
does a CSI carry a gun?

436
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,530
Since there were monsters in our city.

437
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,006
All right...

438
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,120
Cheers.

439
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,371
NIGEL: You're leaving us?

440
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,088
Yeah, things between
my mother and me are...

441
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,324
- Complicated.
- We can help you.

442
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,361
I don't need your help with the science.
I can do that on my own.

443
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,007
I came here to get something
from my mother that I realize now.

444
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,046
<i>I'll never get.</i>

445
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,606
What are you doing?

446
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,243
Sorry, Frosty,
but you're not going anywhere.

447
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,764
Let me out of here. Open these doors.

448
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,251
I said no!

449
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,283
I am sick of working day after day,

450
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,769
night after night,
only to have my work benefit your mother.

451
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,929
With the information I can get from you,

452
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,561
I can finally get out of this place.

453
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,128
So, you're gonna stay here
until I get everything that I need.

454
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,441
You are not going to test me.

455
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,961
Yes, I am.

456
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,441
No, Nigel.

457
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,964
You are not going to test me, now or ever.

458
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,969
Wait, let go! Let go!

459
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,963
Caitlin! Don't do this!

460
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,601
This isn't you!

461
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,962
You don't know anything about me, Mother.

462
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,087
I know I wasn't much of a mother,

463
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,688
and I know I have a lot to make up for,

464
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,287
but I know I didn't raise a killer.

465
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,325
For whatever it's worth, I am so sorry.

466
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,845
It's worth a lot.

467
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,167
- Now go.
- What about...

468
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,484
I'll take care of him. No one will
ever know about this. I promise.

469
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,450
- Thank you.
- Just go.

470
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,569
<i>Every time there's been
a sighting of the monster,</i>

471
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,370
<i>multiple transformers have blown.</i>

472
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,648
Hmm. So, it's definitely
feeding off electricity.

473
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,003
And see, I mapped out all the streets
that it's been spotted around.

474
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,566
Never leaves a 10-block radius.

475
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,569
Yeah, this is exactly
what I was talking about.

476
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,201
Some meta's been gifted
this incredible power,

477
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,681
and this is the very best thing
they can do with it,

478
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,691
terrorize a city. It's pathetic.

479
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,686
But why exactly do you hate metas so much?

480
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,522
If you think I'm going to break down now
and tell you that one killed my parents

481
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,490
and that's why I have to do this job,

482
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,044
I'm not, okay? I don't need a deep,
personal reason to hate metas, Allen.

483
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,363
I just need to see
person after person transformed,

484
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,208
given these extraordinary abilities,
and watch them be squandered.

485
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,564
Robbing banks, hurting people,
spreading fear. It's just...

486
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,202
Well, it's not just a crime.
It's an absolute waste.

487
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,724
Can you imagine what it would be like
to have those powers?

488
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,045
I mean, I'd be helping people.
I would be improving the world.

489
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,206
I guess I wasn't
one of the chosen few, was I?

490
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,290
That's it? You're mad at them
because you weren't chosen?

491
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,090
<i>Sorry, I mean, I'm just saying,</i>

492
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,722
it can't be easy being a meta-human,

493
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,561
having your life,
their lives change in ways that,

494
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,924
you know, neither one of us
could possibly imagine.

495
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,048
It's got to take some adjusting.

496
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,766
Right. So, now you're defending them?

497
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,929
Well, no, I mean, I'm...
I don't think that...

498
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,602
This internship thing we're doing
is completely over.

499
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,606
Whatever.

500
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,602
- Transformers are the key...
- No, I agree.

501
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,406
Anytime the monster's shown up,
any nearby have exploded.

502
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,762
- Yeah, they blow up.
- Car alarms keep malfunctioning, too.

503
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,129
Car alarms, transformers.
What is the connection?

504
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,924
Yeah, we'll get there, fellas.
We'll get there.

505
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,121
We just got to keep trying.

506
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,483
Maybe someone's
pulling power out of the transformers

507
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,285
and using it to power the monster.

508
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,966
Power, yes, the monster. That's...

509
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,130
You just beat me to it, San Francisco.

510
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,961
- See, that can't be it, H.R.
- Can't be it.

511
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,804
'Cause we would've
detected a surge in the power grid.

512
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,968
- We did not.
- Not if it was broadcast power.

513
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,531
Something like a portable Tesla tower?

514
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,922
A portable Tesla power.

515
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,610
- Tower.
- Tower. That's what it is.

516
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,121
Nice... Mmm-mmm. Teamwork.

517
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,521
So, PS, where I'm from, on my Earth,
we call that a problem solved.

518
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,162
I'm gonna go for coffee.
On my Earth, the coffee was wiped out.

519
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,169
- Blight, yeah.
- By blight, can you imagine?

520
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,884
He didn't really do anything, did he?

521
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,888
Thank you. Took me a while to realize it,

522
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,681
but he's just resaying everything
that we're saying in a different way.

523
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,889
No, he did have the idea for the rope.

524
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,365
Reverse inception. He made you think
he had the idea for the rope,

525
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,801
but he didn't even tell us how to use it.

526
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,843
Yeah, well, we're not gonna be
caught off guard again.

527
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,206
We should vibe him.

528
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,285
It'd be my pleasure.

529
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,126
Hey-oh.

530
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,125
- Hey, baby girl.
- Hey.

531
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,204
You've been hanging out here a lot lately.

532
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,688
Yeah, well, there's a lot of scared people
with this monster running around the city.

533
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,371
We'll get him. We always do.

534
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,569
Yeah? Is that a quote
I can use for my article?

535
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,842
- No.
- All right. It was worth a try.

536
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,883
Dad, you know Wally and I
are all right, right?

537
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,010
What is that supposed to mean?

538
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,524
We just don't want you to
not do things because of us.

539
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,241
You know, we just want you
to find someone.

540
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,005
I'm not having this conversation with you.

541
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,046
Dad, that DA is totally into you.
You should go out with her.

542
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,926
Iris, I don't need you to be Cupid.

543
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,088
I got my job.
I got you, Barry, Wally. I'm good.

544
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,880
I know, Dad, and that, that's great.
I just...

545
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,445
Now that I'm falling in love with someone,
I just want you to have the same thing.

546
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,845
Joe? Alert every task force
and sniper unit. Tell 'em to load up.

547
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,244
- I should get to S.T.A.R. Labs.
- What's up?

548
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,284
Albert thinks he's figured out
the creature's next target.

549
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:39,087
If there's ever an opportunity for
a 40-foot monster to wreak havoc,

550
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,568
it's gonna be where people like to gather.
2nd Street Promenade.

551
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,041
Well, let's end this.

552
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,805
That's what I intend to do, Detective.

553
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,041
- Where'd he go?
- Doesn't matter. I don't need him.

554
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,448
What do you mean? What are you...
Hey, dude. Come on.

555
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,244
You can't just go through his stuff,
that's not...

556
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,130
I'm not going through his stuff.

557
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,081
See, this is what I'm talking about.
What even is this?

558
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,121
<i>Now I seem to have won most of
the team's trust, except Francisco's.</i>

559
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,643
Those are my things. What are you doing?

560
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,403
- What are you doing?
- What?

561
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,769
Who are you really?
We know you're hiding something.

562
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,483
You've been burned, twice,

563
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,164
by a man with the same face as me.

564
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,523
I imagine it's hard to trust
after something like that.

565
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,124
- You think?
- I do think. So play the rest of it.

566
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,206
<i>I've read his journals.</i>

567
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,644
<i>I've found nothing that can tell me
why Francisco feels the way he does,</i>

568
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,122
<i>but I do hope I can change
his opinion of Harrison Wells,</i>

569
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,124
<i>and the two of us
can rebuild that friendship.</i>

570
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,802
<i>What a fantastic C story
to weave within the narrative.</i>

571
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,801
What?

572
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,491
What narrative?

573
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,371
Narrative.

574
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,211
I'm writing a novel.

575
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,724
<i>The Tales of H. R. Wells.</i> Catchy, I know.

576
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,005
Wait, I'm sorry,
you're a scientist and a novelist?

577
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,487
- Yes.
- Wow. That's perfect.

578
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,531
Thank you. That's exactly right.
I'm a scientist and a novelist.

579
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,331
I run S.T.A.R. Labs, and also
I'm an author of a science romance.

580
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,369
That's my niche. Write what you know.
And I thought, "Well..."

581
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,161
"What better opportunity than to come
to another Earth and pen yet another"

582
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,046
"best seller about my adventures here?"

583
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,368
Why didn't you just
tell us this in the first place?

584
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,001
I guess it didn't seem relevant, and also,

585
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,449
I didn't think you guys were
gonna rifle through my belongings.

586
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,441
That's all it is.

587
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,605
I'm a scientist and a novelist.
Do you think you can trust me now,

588
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,561
or is that not something that
you have on this Earth? Trust?

589
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,081
- Trust?
- Oh!

590
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,806
You scared the dickens out of me.

591
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,121
Trust who?

592
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,768
- It's the app.
- It's the monster. It's back.

593
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,081
Monster?

594
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,248
Yeah, you've missed a lot.
I'll explain upstairs.

595
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,728
Well, I'll just stay here, then.

596
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,281
Come on. We need you.

597
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,726
All right, guys. I'm here.

598
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,161
Tell us everything that you see right now.

599
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,448
Mayhem. And the monster.

600
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,326
- Okay, so what's the plan?
- Great question, Miss West.

601
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,564
So we've fashioned
just a carbon fiber rope,

602
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,291
but correct me if I'm wrong,
we never actually discussed

603
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,926
how he was gonna use that rope, did we?

604
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,246
Guys.

605
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,924
- Barry, we're gonna do <i>Empire.</i>
- <i>Empire of the Sun,</i> Barry.

606
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,851
- What? <i>Empire Strikes Back.</i>
- <i>Empire Strikes Back,</i> Barry.</i>

607
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,600
- Just take it down like it was an AT-AT.
- Just like an AT-AT.

608
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,365
Bigger they are, the harder they fall.

609
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,767
Even I've seen <i>Empire.</i>

610
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,086
- I like that.
- I like you.

611
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,167
All right, here we go.
I've always wanted to be a Jedi.

612
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,326
Guys? Rope went right through it.
It's a hologram.

613
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,161
Well, that explains everything.

614
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,283
<i>The 10-block radius, the transformers.</i>

615
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,686
It takes that much power to render.

616
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,361
- Wait, C.C.P.D. sent snipers there.
- If it's not real...

617
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,051
Then the bullets
will pass right through it.

618
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,681
- BARRY: <i>Guys, it's gone. Where is it?</i>
- Hold on. Give me a sec, Barr.

619
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,530
Okay, we don't have a second!

620
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,643
H.R., triangulate the signal
being sent to the monster.

621
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,490
We have to disrupt it
before anyone gets hurt.

622
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,202
Okay, let's do that now.
Let's... Let's just triangulate.

623
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,488
The computer doesn't
triangulate the signal the way...

624
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,485
Not the way I'm used to.
This is a different size computer for...

625
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,882
- Oh, my God. I knew it.
- What?

626
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,801
You're a fake.

627
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,045
- What?
- What?

628
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,810
- What?
- This whole time, he's been acting

629
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,044
like he can help us, but he can't,
because he doesn't know how! Does he?

630
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,163
How? Triangulate!

631
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,486
- BARRY: <i>Guys, which way?</i>
- Get the...

632
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
All right, you take over.

633
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,886
CISCO: <i>Found it.
It's at Second and Fulton.</i>

634
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,404
OFFICER 1: <i>I have a lock on the target.</i>
OFFICER 2: <i>Fire when ready.</i>

635
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,605
Stop! Stop firing! It's a hologram!

636
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,371
OFFICER 2: <i>Hold your fire! Hold your fire!</i>

637
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,284
OFFICER 1: <i>A hologram?</i>
OFFICER 3: <i>Where'd it go?</i>

638
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,045
Detective West, where's Julian?

639
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,526
He was here!

640
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,371
Cisco, I need that location.

641
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,201
Hamilton Building, 25th floor.
There's more power going there

642
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,050
than anywhere else in
the building combined.

643
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,491
Line of sight to all the attacks.
That's where he is.

644
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,482
<i>JULIAN: I said put your hands up!</i>

645
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,451
<i>This is C.C.P.D.! Freeze!</i>

646
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,043
Stop what you're doing!
I said put your hands up!

647
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,446
You're just a kid.

648
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,244
Yeah, a kid you almost killed!

649
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,811
You're gonna pay for that one, buddy.
You're gonna...

650
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,570
Yeah, I don't think so, man.
I think you're the one

651
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,922
that's gonna be paying for
all the damage you did to this city.

652
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,924
For a very long time.

653
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,684
Hey, Flash.

654
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,286
Thank you.

655
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,525
You're welcome.

656
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,841
Come on.

657
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,371
Do you realize how many innocent people
could have been hurt, or worse?

658
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,365
What made you do something like this?

659
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,887
I just wanted
to feel powerful for a change.

660
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,361
And that did it? Scaring people?

661
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,047
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it did.

662
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,684
You know, the kids at my school,
they tease me every day.

663
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,284
I'm the weirdo there. And I'm just
sick of feeling scared all the time.

664
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,848
I just wanted someone else
to feel that way for a change.

665
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,005
Look...

666
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,291
I know sometimes
things are hard at your age.

667
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,164
But trust me, it does get better.

668
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,720
So, what happens now?

669
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,884
Well, there are severe consequences
for what you did,

670
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,321
and you're just gonna have to accept that.

671
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,722
But listen, you're young.

672
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,201
You can turn all of this around.

673
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,124
All right. Come on.

674
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,091
You were named
"Entrepreneur of the Decade"

675
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,288
- by <i>Tech Magazine?</i>
- That's right.

676
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,562
Is any of what's on here true?

677
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,371
- All of it.
- CISCO: <i>How?</i>

678
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,284
You can barely turn on a computer.

679
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,328
There are two parts to every idea.
There is the inception and the execution.

680
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,162
- I provide the former.
- So, you come up with the ideas?

681
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,767
Yeah, I don't know how to implement them.
I'm the idea man.

682
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,566
So you didn't actually solve
the cryptogram that we sent you?

683
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,929
No, that was my partner
at S.T.A.R. Labs on my Earth.

684
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,284
I'm the face of the company.
I'm more of the inspiration

685
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,601
behind the company.

686
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,490
Then I was exposed.
Well, people thought that I was

687
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,246
something that I guess I wasn't.
Anyway, it...

688
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,809
It kind of all fell apart for me.

689
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,371
But then I got your message.
My partner brought me your message.

690
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,927
I realized he's bringing me an opportunity

691
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,970
to come to this Earth to write this book.

692
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,767
So many planets in the multi-verse,
and we happen to pick

693
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,288
the one Wells who's not a scientist.

694
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,881
You're right.

695
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,281
I wasn't completely honest with you,
with all of you.

696
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,960
<i>I feel badly about that. I regret that.</i>

697
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,686
But let me ask you a question.
Has there been none

698
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,486
amongst you that has ever shaded the truth

699
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,331
<i>for what you believe
to be the greater good?</i>

700
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,611
- It sounds to me like you're a con man.
- Yeah.

701
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,089
Was I a con man when I showed
San Francisco here how to track the beast

702
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,164
using car alarms?
Was I a con man when I showed him how to

703
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,964
fashion a rope using carbon fiber?

704
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,488
- I came up with those ideas!
- You were prompted by my suggestions.

705
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,720
That is how ideas work!
People, you need a muse!

706
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,565
I can be your muse.

707
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,525
What about stopping
all the metas on your Earth?

708
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,281
More of an advisory role for me,
but I was there. I remembered how we...

709
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,960
You don't think that's something?
Let me present you with a scenario.

710
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,321
<i>You're confronted with something,</i>

711
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,841
a threat that you've never seen before.
You don't know how to stop it.

712
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,523
Who does? That's value to you.
Let me prove my worth to you.

713
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,963
If I fail, I will...
Right back to my Earth,

714
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,367
but if I succeed,
I will have succeeded not just

715
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,370
in redeeming myself, but also,

716
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,848
I will have done some good with my life.

717
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,004
You know, you're lucky we're pretty big on

718
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,767
redemption and doing good here,
so I think you can,

719
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,526
I don't know, stay for a few weeks,
try to prove yourself,

720
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,724
but if not...
Back to your Earth.

721
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,291
Thank you.

722
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,289
Hey, no more repackaging.

723
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,561
Word is bond.

724
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,485
That, just no more that.

725
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,567
- All right, H.R.
- Okay.

726
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,724
- Where you been?
- I actually went to visit my mother.

727
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,647
Your mother? Oh, boy. Why?

728
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,211
To see if we could work through
some of our issues.

729
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,806
And I think we might actually
be on the road to recovery.

730
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,689
When it comes to family,
you gotta do whatever it takes,

731
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,805
'cause one day,
you might not be able to do that anymore.

732
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,402
Glad you're back.

733
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,610
This is home.

734
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,204
JULIAN: <i>I nearly killed a kid tonight.</i>

735
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,643
The monster we were chasing,
it turns out it was just a hologram

736
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,207
<i>operated by a 15-year-old boy.</i>

737
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,283
Flash came to save the day.

738
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,687
And he saved me from doing something...

739
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,644
- I heard.
- You know what's sad?

740
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,930
That kid, he's just acting
'cause he's scared, you know?

741
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,727
He wants everyone to be terrified
and to run away from the monster

742
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,843
so he can feel powerful.

743
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,007
- I know what that's like.
- How do you mean?

744
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,121
I come from a pretty wealthy family
back in England.

745
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,370
It's a long line of generations of
old money, tradition, nonsense, really,

746
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,210
and I was the heir.

747
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,767
I was their firstborn son.
I was supposed to inherit the lot.

748
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,691
<i>But I was the odd duck</i>

749
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,125
who would rather go in the garden
and collect samples of insects

750
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,563
rather than learn how to tie

751
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,000
a Windsor knot.

752
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,170
Or which fork to use first at dinner.

753
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,761
Yeah. No, I wanted more.

754
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,644
You know?

755
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,970
I came here to do the one thing
that they couldn't stop me from doing:

756
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,562
becoming a scientist,
becoming a great scientist.

757
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,889
Then just as I got to
the top of my field, poof!

758
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,408
The world changes overnight.

759
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,246
Meta-humans. I don't know
a single thing about meta-humans.

760
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,841
I don't know how they talk.
I don't know how they walk.

761
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,050
I certainly don't know
the first thing about stopping them, so

762
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,450
rendered useless.
I suppose that's the monster

763
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,929
that I'm running from now.
Just feeling powerless.

764
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,091
Yeah, I feel the same way
some days, Julian.

765
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,847
I lost my mom when I was a kid.
Lost my dad recently.

766
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,849
<i>It's a scary world. People die.</i>

767
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,921
Trusts are betrayed. Things change.

768
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,841
Change can be a good thing, you know?
It can bring

769
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,771
<i>new experiences,
new opportunities, people.</i>

770
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,126
You can treat 'em like a potential enemy
or like a new friend.

771
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,847
Just trust that everything's
gonna be okay.

772
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,285
Yeah, maybe you're right.

773
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,325
You can stop.

774
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,325
<i>You can stay.</i>

775
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,808
I was really wrong about the Flash,

776
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,401
so I could be wrong about you, too.

777
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,763
Good night, mate.

778
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,486
Julian?

779
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,326
You want to get a drink?

780
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,003
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

781
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,531
All right.

782
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,090
Let's do it.

783
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,011
<i>Caitlin, I've been going over
the data we collected,</i>

784
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,362
<i>and I've found some disconcerting results.</i>

785
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,607
<i>Your body's chemistry is changing
in ways that I don't fully understand,</i>

786
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,490
<i>but one thing is clear.</i>

787
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,451
<i>These powers you have,
the more you use them,</i>

788
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,729
<i>the more difficult
they're going to be to reverse.</i>

789
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,808
<i>I'm sorry, honey, but listen to me.</i>

790
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,562
<i>You must not use these powers
under any circumstances.</i>
