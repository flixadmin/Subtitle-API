1
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:55,515
Allright, we're good to go

2
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:58,317
You got this?
You bet your ass, bubba.

3
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,659
let's make some money!

4
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:08,934
Everyone in position?

5
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,686
I thought that we would be robbing banks by now

6
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:15,005
not some gas truck
in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:18,129
Down here, gas is gold, bubba.

8
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,735
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

9
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:30,492
I wouldn’t piss them off guys

10
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:54,423
Ok guys we got to hit this hard fast
we got 14 left before they drive to bridge

11
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,734
Locked and loaded

12
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:43,813
This is all you, Han

13
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,742
Liquid gold
ha, ha

14
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,286
Were clear

15
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:01,280
Okay, T, you're up.

16
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:07,045
Let's see if you can get it under
6 tries this time, huh, T?


17
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:13,070
More like three come on Tego
keep it real

18
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,345
Just one K left. We're running
out of road. Get in there, brother.

19
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,911
I got it, I got it

20
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,547
Oh shit

21
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:52,228
Tear cut loose, un-Hitch... un-Hitch

22
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:39,157
Spray that hitch!
I don't have a hammer!

23
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:40,716
Just do it

24
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:57,609
Hold on, hold on

25
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,919
Oh shit

26
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,354
Hold on to something tight

27
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,030
give me your hand, I can't reach

28
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:29,945
you gotta jump

29
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,373
Jump

30
00:05:57,581 --> 00:05:59,077
Letty, jump!

31
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:04,931
I've got you!

32
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:36,116
Dom

33
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:46,445
Dom

34
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,510

Fixed by "StRiKer" ! Enjoy!

35
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,664
Cops just raided our garage in Baracoa.

36
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:21,762
They were real interested in you.

37
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,907
Heat's on and we just sent up a flare
that's gonna lead them right to us.

38
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:29,380
I say we move out first thing
in the morning.

39
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:32,979
Nah, it's me they want.

40
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:35,647
And if they catch me,

41
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:38,879
they're throwing big numbers
at anybody with me.

42
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:43,588
Han, we had a good run.

43
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:47,921
Time for you to go
do your own thing.

44
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:54,519
Heard they're doing
some crazy shit in Tokyo.

45
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:02,540
Have you seen Letty?

46
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,730
There she is.

47
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:25,369
I hear Rio is nice this time of year.

48
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:30,812
The cops are getting hungrier.

49
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,068
Then I guess we're doing our job.

50
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,362
I'm a walking target.

51
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,925
I don't want you around
when they catch up to me.

52
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:47,616
"Ride or die," remember?

53
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:51,797
Dom, how long have we
been doing this?


54
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,410
And now all of a sudden, out of
nowhere, it's too dangerous?


55
00:09:58,574 --> 00:09:59,621
Come on

56
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,544
We'll figure it out. We always do.

57
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:26,299
Move

58
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,063
Move out of my way

59
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:30,364
I got a gun.

60
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:29,290
I don't know shit!
Give me a name!

61
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:32,047
David Park! David Park's
the guy you want!

62
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:33,918
Please

63
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:42,225
Oh thank god.

64
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:46,389
Listen, he's in a mood
because yesterday was his cheat day,
and then today, some genius
brought in donuts.

65
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,579
Oh great

66
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,211
BRIAN: Sorry I'm late.

67
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,117
Complaints keep rolling in after your
little downtown Olympics, O'Conner.

68
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,108
Tell me that reinstating you
wasn't a mistake.

69
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,915
I got a name

70
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,135
David park
That's it?

71
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:04,195
Is that all you got
David park?

72
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:07,570
I could throw a fortune cookie out this window
and hit 50 David Parks right now.

73
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,576
It's Korean, not Chinese.
Whatever.

74
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,881
Park is a scout that recruits street racers
to be mules for the Braga cartel.

75
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:16,818
We find park,
and we bust the bad guys

76
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:42,520
Whats up

77
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,216
Mia, I told you not to call me here.

78
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,077
Dom its letty

79
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,918
She's been murdered

80
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:09,906
PRIEST: We have gathered here
to pay our final respects to...

81
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,966
Facial recognition software
matched Toretto

82
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,472
about 10 minutes after
he crossed the border.

83
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:48,465
I don't get it

84
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,309
I thought he'd show.

85
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:46,853
I told you not to come, they are staking the place out
what if they find you?

86
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,088
They won't

87
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,278
Come on

88
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:54,239
Look at you

89
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:20,962
Letty wouldn't let them junk it.

90
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,018
Even though it is a goddamn curse.

91
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,604
When she came back,
she was always in here

92
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,293
Working on it, day and night.

93
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,150
It was weird

94
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,089
It was like she knew you were coming back

95
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,941
I want to see the crash site

96
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:57,882
PENNING: I just got off the phone
with Deputy Director Lawson.

97
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:02,869
If we don't make serious inroads into
the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

98
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:04,184
There are going to shut us down

99
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,652
I know I'm a newbie here,
but why the clock now?

100
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:10,353
Because it’s been two years

101
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:14,427
And the last three agents We sent in for infiltrate
this organization have come back in body bags

102
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:19,019
He's moved more heroin across the border
than Escobar did in 10 years.

103
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:24,247
This guy is becoming one of our biggest national threats
and we don’t even have a picture of him

104
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:27,990
We don’t have prints, not even a god damn DOB

105
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,492
What's the status on David Park?

106
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:35,152
Isn't he our ticket into
the Braga organization?

107
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,768
Well, we are running the name through city
and county databases sorting the possibilities

108
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,962
We have got over 500 already

109
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,799
Parks is an insignificant,
sounds like another jerk off to me.

110
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,793
He's not, without Park, Braga would't
have drivers to move the shipment

111
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:49,897
Cross check traffic

112
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:53,772
Illegal modifications, Street racing. 
This guy will definitely
have a record. We'll find him.

113
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:56,924
We better

114
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:02,322
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle has
been spotted in his old neighborhood.

115
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,086
I'm going to bring his ass in.

116
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,906
Not in your car you're not.

117
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:16,691
Straight ahead

118
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:19,314
You found something back there

119
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:26,386
There were burn marks on the ground.

120
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:33,826
The kind that could only be
caused by nitrometh.

121
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,537
There's only one guy in all of L.A.
that sells that.


122
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,162
Nothing you can do is
gonna bring her back, Dom

123
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:50,818
If I were Letty, I would ask you..

124
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:54,453
No, I would beg you, please let this go

125
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,049
Before it’s too late

126
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:03,467
It’s already too late

127
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:10,387
I love you

128
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:16,099
Miss Toretto

129
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,116
I am Michel Stasiak, FBl

130
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:21,497
Let's you and I have a little chat.

131
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:45,697
Hi. This is Forsythe in Evidence.

132
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,835
I need Stasiak down here right away
to sign some greenies.

133
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:50,011
Thanks

134
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,657
I narrowed it down to 50 or so David Parks

135
00:23:55,231 --> 00:23:57,531
What I'd like you to do is run the make
and model on each one of them.

136
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:11,103
Hey, Tyler, we got a transfer.

137
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,848
You want to come with me?

138
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:37,280
What?

139
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:40,280
- Toreto, when did you get back in town?

140
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:42,706
I'm looking for a car
you did an engine mod on.

141
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:47,666
Nitromethane tank. Ford full-size.
Continental tires.

142
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:52,232
What.. What you doing? Coming here like this

143
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:54,855
This ain't your scene anymore boss

144
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,889
Don’t you put your hands on me again.. Okay?

145
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:00,208
Say hi to your sister for me

146
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:13,305
A Korean kid brought it in.

147
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:15,158
David park

148
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:19,196
It's a green Ford Torino.

149
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:20,897
Shit, Don’t drop this on me

150
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:27,441
Almost done

151
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,971
Why don't you tell me why
you dragged me here, Brian?

152
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,628
You know they're going to capture Dom.

153
00:25:41,488 --> 00:25:42,544
Maybe worse

154
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:46,860
I don't want you get tangled up in this
stay away from him

155
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:51,900
That's what you have to say to me after 5 years

156
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:55,856
All of the sudden you care what happens to me

157
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,631
What I did to you was wrong

158
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:05,364
I am sorry
it was, it was hardest thing I ever had to do

159
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,321
I’m sorry too Brian

160
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:14,675
I’m so sorry that you had to come
into my home and pretend to love me

161
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,351
I’m so sorry that you ripped my family apart

162
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:19,580
I’m very sorry that was hard for you

163
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,971
I lied to you

164
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:28,408
I lied to Dom, I lied to every body

165
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:31,407
That’s what I do best, that’s why the feds recruited me.

166
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:36,600
Maybe you're lying to yourself

167
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,057
If You’re not the good guy pretending to be a bad guy

168
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,968
Maybe you’re the bad guy pretending to be the good guy

169
00:26:45,194 --> 00:26:46,555
You ever think about that

170
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:49,965
Every day

171
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:03,591
How I always wondered

172
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,701
Why did you let my brother go that day?

173
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,093
I don't know

174
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,374
Oh shit..

175
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,510
BRIAN

176
00:27:26,555 --> 00:27:29,411
Brian, I got a crosschecks on
David park pack, I have a list of possibles

177
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,511
What do you got?

178
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:32,803
A 45 year old male, with three reckless driving tickets

179
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:33,958
No

180
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,830
One cherry taco, no

181
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:39,947
2 Mini Coopers, a '06 and a '07,
a Toyota hybrid, no

182
00:27:39,982 --> 00:27:40,664
No

183
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,400
A '98 Saturn,

184
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:44,960
a '95 Sebring. A '98 Nissan 240 with an illegal mod.

185
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:48,300
Wait. That's it.
The 240 with the illegal mod.

186
00:27:49,643 --> 00:27:51,568
- How do u know?
'Cause that's something I'd drive.

187
00:28:28,694 --> 00:28:32,534
Green Torino, running nitro, whose car?

188
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:34,906
I'm just the middleman. I swear!
I'm just the middleman!


189
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,408
Wait... wait, I don’t know shit man, I swear

190
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:49,258
I just run cars for Braga alright, all I
do is get you in the race that's all I can do

191
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:52,069
What race?

192
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:12,740
Come on man, I don't know shit, just let me up

193
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,879
Bring him up, Dom

194
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:22,256
Bring him up

195
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:23,984
Are you here to take me in, O'conner

196
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:26,035
Oh.. Shit

197
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:28,130
Shut up

198
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:31,397
Letty was my friend, too.

199
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:33,519
You weren't anyone's friend.

200
00:29:34,154 --> 00:29:36,616
Yo, can you guys talk about this later?
Now pull my ass up!

201
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,500
She was running for this guy Braga and the things went bad

202
00:29:39,553 --> 00:29:40,296
Please

203
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,212
I’m goanna get these guys, Dom

204
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:45,077
Now let me do my job, and bring him up

205
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:46,545
I'm going to kill this Braga.

206
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:52,793
And anyone else that gets in my way

207
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:00,610
Don’t let go

208
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:10,538
Conner

209
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:15,497
O'Conner! If you ever release
a witness of mine again...

210
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,854
That's enough!
STASIAK: Don't touch me.
I'm fine

211
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:23,447
PENNING: That's enough.

212
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:25,220
- You are through conner
- I said that’s enough

213
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:29,267
Stasiak, go and get yourself cleaned up

214
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:30,815
What? He hit me first

215
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,919
This isn't the Cub Scouts!

216
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:36,599
Now, go on!
You're bleeding on my floor.

217
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,040
O'Conner, do you know the difference
between a cop and a criminal?

218
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,502
- What?
- One bad judgment call

219
00:30:52,256 --> 00:30:54,002
Keep your shit on line son

220
00:30:58,353 --> 00:30:59,768
Have a good time

221
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:04,181
Take a seat

222
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:12,400
Good news. We have intel that
Braga's number 2, Ramon Campos,

223
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:16,357
will hold a street race
in Koreatown tomorrow night

224
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:20,054
They've already chosen
3 drivers from previous races.

225
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:26,088
Our newest informant,
Mr. David Park,
has been kind enough to get us into the race

226
00:31:27,806 --> 00:31:29,006
O'Conner

227
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:31,245
You’re up

228
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,196
Let me guess, winner gets the slot

229
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:41,916
All right, so these are all the imports
the city has in impound.

230
00:31:42,346 --> 00:31:43,912
- Okay nice
- Pick your poison

231
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:46,777
Alright 2206
I crashed one of those.

232
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:52,095
3418 and 2765.

233
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:54,593
Okay, so which one do you want

234
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:56,266
I want them all

235
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:27,045
Standard issue tracking device.

236
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:29,668
Boss wants to know where
you are at all times.

237
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:24,825
What are you looking at, nutsack?

238
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,920
I don’t know you tell me

239
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:32,175
The racer wants what Dwight's got.
See, but, ladies, Dwight's
already on the team.

240
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:34,073
You got to be fast if you want
to drive for Braga.

241
00:33:34,108 --> 00:33:35,586
Is there a problem here?

242
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:37,385
No

243
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:42,595
You one of Park's guys, blondie?
- Yeah.. Yeah I am

244
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:44,941
Follow me

245
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:49,426
See you later punk

246
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,494
You, too, punk.

247
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,827
FENIX: Bull's-eye, coño, come on!

248
00:34:10,814 --> 00:34:13,007
Ohm... it looks so thin.. Lama lama...

249
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:19,570
You all know why you're here

250
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:21,960
Good drivers

251
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:25,407
are a dime a dozen.

252
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:29,408
Man, every corner's got a chingadera
tuner racing for pinks.

253
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:33,035
That's not what Braga
has got me looking for.

254
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,887
Braga wants someone that would sell
their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

255
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:42,721
Someone that drives their 10-second cars
not in a straight line,


256
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:47,591
But to push it, and make it through
places that no one else would take it

257
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:50,366
Real drivers, you getting this

258
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,724
So, what are we hauling?

259
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:57,493
CAMPOS: For the money Braga's paying,
you don't need to know.

260
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:00,447
You just said you wanted real drivers

261
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,469
A real driver knows
exactly what's in his car.


262
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:12,703
Mira, real driver,

263
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:16,069
Nobody is forcing you to race?

264
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:17,671
You the boss?

265
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:22,380
Or am I talking to the boss?

266
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:26,732
Do I look like a boss?

267
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:31,923
My job is to find the best drivers, period

268
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,439
Whoever wins the race gets the info

269
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:36,194
Are we cool?

270
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:42,219
ARE WE COOL?

271
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,747
YEAH, we cool

272
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:47,805
Nah, we ain't cool, man

273
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:50,795
who's closing the streets?

274
00:35:53,257 --> 00:35:54,869
No one, thats the point

275
00:36:06,982 --> 00:36:09,918
AUTOMATED VOICE ON GPS:
Please wait while
directions are downloaded.

276
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:17,859
Proceed to the highlighted route.

277
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:32,863
You sure you want to do this?
A lot has changed.

278
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:35,907
You' re right.

279
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:45,970
GO

280
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:55,746
RIGHT, TURN AHEAD

281
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:01,762
YOU ARE NOW 5 MILES FROM YOUR DESTINATION

282
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:28,575
How's my ass look, Chia Pet?

283
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,437
Ghetto Smurf.

284
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:56,193
Dead man driving

285
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:00,849
Come on

286
00:38:02,442 --> 00:38:04,080
Right, turn ahead

287
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:23,284
Oh.. Shit!

288
00:38:28,494 --> 00:38:29,417
Yeah!

289
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:31,234
Rerouting.

290
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,487
Rerouting.

291
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,551
Proceed straight ahead

292
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:55,155
Rerouting.

293
00:39:07,169 --> 00:39:09,058
- Rerouting.
- Just Shut Up!

294
00:39:12,908 --> 00:39:15,978
You are 2.6 miles from destination

295
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:20,115
Oopse, I didn’t see you

296
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:26,891
You are now 4 and half miles from your destination

297
00:39:58,073 --> 00:40:00,481
U-turn, if possible.
Are you kidding me?

298
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:04,384
You are now 4.2 mile from your destination

299
00:40:06,524 --> 00:40:07,617
Sorry, car.

300
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,276
Your now 1 mile from your destination

301
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:18,959
Yeah, guess who's back, Dom?

302
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,158
Let’s go

303
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:29,335
Nice car baby

304
00:41:12,468 --> 00:41:13,426
Bitch

305
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,580
Your now one quater mile on your destination

306
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:36,649
To early Dom

307
00:41:57,285 --> 00:41:59,022
Still a buster.

308
00:42:02,674 --> 00:42:05,225
Your have reached your destination.
Goodbye.

309
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:19,012
At least we know you can't beat me
straight up.

310
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:20,785
I didn't know there were any rules

311
00:42:23,551 --> 00:42:25,700
Now that's what I call real driving.
No, that's bullshit, man!

312
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:27,849
Go cry to your mama, eh?

313
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:32,029
You work for Braga now

314
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:35,306
When the GPS calls, you follow

315
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:41,878
Driver's licence?

316
00:42:41,913 --> 00:42:43,712
What driver's license?

317
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,291
Thumb

318
00:42:51,072 --> 00:42:52,861
Cell phone number

319
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,741
The print is for Campos.

320
00:42:59,776 --> 00:43:01,993
The number is for me

321
00:43:05,476 --> 00:43:06,774
Yo, nutsack!

322
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:10,230
Let me tell you something, man,
muscle beats import every time.

323
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:12,924
You know what am saying
EVERY TIME!

324
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,576
Ladies, let's get on
back to Papa Dwight's.

325
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:25,690
DWIGHT: Papa Dwight wants you
to take off your shoes.

326
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:29,853
Dwight likes feet.
Take off your shoes.

327
00:43:29,888 --> 00:43:32,011
So beautiful

328
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:36,003
Dwight likes this foot a lot.

329
00:43:48,054 --> 00:43:49,397
- FBl
- Freeze

330
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:52,925
I didn't do nothing, man!
Dwight didn't do nothing!

331
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,082
Hey, no! Stay! Where you going?

332
00:43:55,117 --> 00:43:56,684
WOMAN: Bye, Dwight!
No, what did I do?

333
00:43:58,081 --> 00:44:00,471
BRIAN: You're under arrest
for distribution of meth.

334
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:02,861
Meth? Dwight's never
touched that shit, bro!

335
00:44:02,896 --> 00:44:04,383
Dwight has now.

336
00:44:04,418 --> 00:44:05,878
Yo, that ain't mine! No!

337
00:44:06,755 --> 00:44:08,787
- Get off
You know that's never
gonna stick, right?


338
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:10,417
Yeah, it's not supposed to.

339
00:45:09,191 --> 00:45:10,497
Yeah, Corona.

340
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,898
That's too bad about Dwight.
Having the Feds raid your house
the same night you make the team.

341
00:45:18,322 --> 00:45:19,154
So unfortunate.

342
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:22,897
I wish I could say I was a surprised to see you here

343
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,616
What's to stop someone
from telling them you're a cop?


344
00:45:27,651 --> 00:45:31,034
Probably the same thing that's keeping me
from telling them why you're really here.

345
00:45:31,043 --> 00:45:33,666
What up, fellows?
Hey, how you doing?

346
00:45:33,701 --> 00:45:36,289
Great. You having a good time?
Yeah, a great time.


347
00:45:36,324 --> 00:45:38,268
Yeah, great time

348
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,333
How's your car?
It took a nasty bump

349
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:43,846
BRIAN: lt'll be ready.

350
00:45:43,881 --> 00:45:47,033
I also heard you just
got out of County.

351
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:48,626
Yeah

352
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:51,151
You know a guy called Jim Garcia

353
00:45:51,186 --> 00:45:55,278
No, big place, there’s lots of names, lots of faces

354
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:59,297
And you, you're wanted by
a lot of people, homes.

355
00:45:59,332 --> 00:46:01,848
Well that kind of heat can't be good for business

356
00:46:01,883 --> 00:46:04,365
Yeah, well that depend on how you look at things

357
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,453
I go down, I do time

358
00:46:09,226 --> 00:46:10,094
I do REAL time

359
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:12,297
I don't know about your other drivers,

360
00:46:12,332 --> 00:46:14,937
but when I see flashing lights in my mirror,

361
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,826
I don’t stop

362
00:46:22,036 --> 00:46:23,505
Do you know each other?

363
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:30,166
He used to date my sister

364
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:31,992
I see

365
00:46:34,678 --> 00:46:36,970
- You're lucky man
- How's that?

366
00:46:38,097 --> 00:46:40,013
- You're still breathing

367
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:49,798
To the ladies we've loved
and the ladies we've lost.

368
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,625
Salute

369
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,977
So, what's Braga "about"?

370
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:03,515
You know, he's just one of us

371
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,593
You know, he's just one of us
Came up from the streets.
Down for el barrio.

372
00:47:06,628 --> 00:47:09,234
Now, he's shot caller

373
00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:11,922
Boss of bosses

374
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:14,149
See all these cats in here?

375
00:47:14,158 --> 00:47:17,578
Anyone of them will die for Braga

376
00:47:17,613 --> 00:47:19,011
Including you?

377
00:47:21,455 --> 00:47:22,959
Especially me

378
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:33,828
Enjoy the party fellas

379
00:47:33,863 --> 00:47:36,343
The clubs is yours, what ever you want

380
00:47:40,488 --> 00:47:41,705
Braga's mine

381
00:47:45,457 --> 00:47:47,193
I’m taking the whole house down

382
00:47:47,228 --> 00:47:49,798
Good luck

383
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:54,704
Something interest you about this car?

384
00:49:56,029 --> 00:49:57,990
Just admiring the body work

385
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:03,415
Are you one of those boys who prefers cars to women?

386
00:50:06,387 --> 00:50:08,625
I'm one of those boys who'd appreciates

387
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,863
The fine body  regardless of the make.

388
00:50:14,632 --> 00:50:16,019
Your car?

389
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:21,652
It's Fenix's car

390
00:50:21,687 --> 00:50:24,417
You'll meet him at the rendezvous.

391
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:26,575
He'll be leading you.

392
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:29,126
So now

393
00:50:30,505 --> 00:50:33,101
That I know your taste in cars

394
00:50:33,136 --> 00:50:35,697
Tell me, what about your women

395
00:50:37,693 --> 00:50:39,547
It all starts with the eyes.

396
00:50:41,785 --> 00:50:45,850
She has gotta have those kind of eyes that
can look right through the bullshit

397
00:50:45,885 --> 00:50:48,643
to the good in someone.

398
00:50:53,396 --> 00:50:56,583
20% angel, 80% devil

399
00:50:57,944 --> 00:50:59,726
Down to earth

400
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:05,241
Ain't afraid to get a little engine
grease under her fingernails.


401
00:51:12,313 --> 00:51:14,292
That doesn't sound anything like me.

402
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,786
It ain't

403
00:51:27,165 --> 00:51:28,473
- Hey - I got a gift
for you - Alright

404
00:51:30,235 --> 00:51:32,752
A dirty shot glass, just what I always wanted

405
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:34,086
I got these from the club last night

406
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:36,119
There's 2 sets of prints here.
Run them both.

407
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:39,340
I know one of these is Campos'.
I think the other might be Braga's.

408
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,472
And you're gonna have
to go beyond lnterpol.

409
00:51:41,507 --> 00:51:45,491
So, that means I have to contact
individual agencies,
and that could take weeks

410
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:47,568
Ok

411
00:51:52,286 --> 00:51:54,157
DOWNLOADING DATA COORDINATES

412
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:02,475
Yeah

413
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,491
That’s your third traffic violation in less than three blocks

414
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:07,075
Slow it down, O'Conner

415
00:52:08,464 --> 00:52:09,600
Sure thing, Dad.

416
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,027
He stopped

417
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,366
We lost him

418
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,256
- He killed the tracker
- We don’t know that

419
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:36,377
- I’m telling you he killed the tracker
- We don’t know that yet

420
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:37,925
Get the bird overhead

421
00:53:39,823 --> 00:53:42,285
PILOT ON RADIO : Right now,
I'm moving north, 33', 56'...

422
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,549
All clear

423
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,915
PILOT ON RADIO :
Base, flag nine, I'm at Angels 5.

424
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,887
I don 't have a tally on the target.
Repeat, I don't have a tally on the target.
They' re gone, there's no one
down there.


425
00:54:16,922 --> 00:54:18,256
- Damn it

426
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,449
TASH: This ain't right, bro. Nobody said
nothing about being locked in no truck.

427
00:54:33,484 --> 00:54:34,568
Tell me about it

428
00:54:41,157 --> 00:54:43,127
Yo!
Where do you think they're taking us?

429
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,750
Don’t matter

430
00:54:48,758 --> 00:54:51,524
We're all just along for the ride now

431
00:55:02,178 --> 00:55:04,112
Welcome to Mexico, boys

432
00:55:09,501 --> 00:55:13,789
There're helicopters and surveillance cameras
that scans for heat signature at the border

433
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:17,844
But there're blind spots that I
can guide you through via satellites

434
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:19,609
There can be no margin of error

435
00:55:19,644 --> 00:55:22,204
So you must follow my every direction

436
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:24,469
Any questions?

437
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:28,588
I thought Fenix was gonna be here

438
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:33,323
He will meet you out there

439
00:55:38,704 --> 00:55:40,638
Allright everybody, sync up

440
00:55:43,538 --> 00:55:45,194
Good luck gentlemen

441
00:55:58,346 --> 00:56:00,423
GISELE ON RADIO :
Satellite linkup engaged.

442
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,762
Keep proceeding northbound
at current speed.

443
00:56:07,934 --> 00:56:09,670
Stay close to Fenix

444
00:56:10,781 --> 00:56:12,302
He'll lead you across

445
00:56:25,776 --> 00:56:28,336
I got a heat signature northbound
along Legardo Ravine.


446
00:56:31,031 --> 00:56:35,203
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico
side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds.

447
00:56:35,238 --> 00:56:36,971
Get the camera on it.

448
00:56:37,006 --> 00:56:38,669
MAN: Manual override. 

449
00:56:38,704 --> 00:56:41,148
Rerouting camera
to designated coordinates.

450
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:46,466
GISELE: Hurry it up.
You guys have been tagged.

451
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:57,988
SHIT..

452
00:56:59,106 --> 00:57:01,031
Toretto, get back in formation.

453
00:57:04,352 --> 00:57:05,901
Reimaging commencing.

454
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:15,248
I don't see anything

455
00:57:15,283 --> 00:57:16,681
They're gone

456
00:57:18,927 --> 00:57:20,771
Get the helicopters to cover it

457
00:57:24,934 --> 00:57:27,504
PILOT ON RADIO : Base, we're 40 seconds
out from Legardo Ravine.


458
00:57:28,668 --> 00:57:30,064
GISELE: They're sending a helicopter.

459
00:57:31,873 --> 00:57:33,431
You have 30 seconds

00:57:41,971 --> 00:57:44,782
PILOT: North 32' 33', west 116' 49'.

461
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:52,751
GISELE: The window is closing fast.

462
00:57:52,786 --> 00:57:56,017
You need to get out of there before
they send ground support.

463
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:03,439
15 seconds

464
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:11,255
PILOT: Base, target is at 2 miles.

465
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:25,659
GISELE: You're running out of time.

466
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,440
You need to get out, NOW

467
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:46,160
PILOT: Base, we're at north 32' 33',
west 116' 49'

468
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:49,402
We have no visual contact.
Roll ground units for confirmation.

469
00:59:09,956 --> 00:59:11,102
Sloppy!

470
00:59:12,158 --> 00:59:13,394
Very sloppy!

471
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:20,207
What are you doing man?

472
00:59:23,054 --> 00:59:24,128
Come on

473
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:28,443
Get out.

474
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:34,836
Come on, today, man.
Come on, let's go.

475
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,020
MALIK: Hey, don't touch me.
Hey, don't touch me, man!


476
00:59:39,016 --> 00:59:40,261
Hey, I said don't touch me, man!

477
00:59:40,296 --> 00:59:42,982
Hey, look, dawg, don't put
your hands on me.
TASH: Hey, Malik, chill, bro.

478
00:59:42,991 --> 00:59:44,602
Yo, man, what's up
with your boy?

479
00:59:44,611 --> 00:59:46,357
DOM: Hey, boss man!

480
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:49,930
What did you say?

481
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:54,414
I said only pussies run nitrometh.

482
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:58,389
You looked under my hood?

483
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,671
I’m talking to you

484
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:08,837
You got something in your mind?

485
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:11,424
'70 Plymouth.

486
01:00:14,262 --> 01:00:15,972
Her name was Letty

487
01:00:18,487 --> 01:00:19,517
Yo

488
01:00:21,066 --> 01:00:22,480
Where’s my money?

489
01:00:24,405 --> 01:00:26,509
DOM: And somebody
wrecked her car.

490
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,569
I wrecked her car.

491
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,299
You remember her face?

492
01:00:47,906 --> 01:00:49,338
Because I don’t

493
01:00:49,373 --> 01:00:53,304
Last time I saw her
it was burning

494
01:01:06,653 --> 01:01:08,263
Now what?

495
01:01:09,821 --> 01:01:11,818
I'm going to enjoy
what happens next.

496
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:46,410
Come on, get in

497
01:01:47,646 --> 01:01:49,006
GET IN

498
01:01:51,092 --> 01:01:53,500
Come on, get in fucking car, let's go
hurry up

499
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:54,665
HURRY UP

500
01:02:20,725 --> 01:02:22,185
PENNING: What have you got, Trinh?

501
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,468
We contacted agencies in multiple countries

502
01:02:24,503 --> 01:02:28,755
Unfortunately most of them have to
manually scan their print for us to upload

503
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:32,287
O'Conner is online 5

504
01:02:32,322 --> 01:02:34,118
Sir you should see this

505
01:02:34,127 --> 01:02:35,712
Thank you

506
01:02:45,935 --> 01:02:47,234
Talk to me, O'Conner

507
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:49,383
- Where the hell have you been?

508
01:02:49,418 --> 01:02:53,285
- I got the shipment? or we got the shipment?

509
01:02:53,653 --> 01:02:55,300
What are you talking about?

510
01:02:55,335 --> 01:02:57,363
Traffic cams in the area picked up

511
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:59,391
pictures of you and Toretto together.

512
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:02,677
Listen to me O'Conner

513
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:05,480
Bring in the shipment and bring in Toretto

514
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:08,066
But I thought the point was to get Braga.
We got an opportunity here.

515
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:10,653
Brian, the clock stopped ticking

516
01:03:11,969 --> 01:03:14,216
Bring him in, are we clear?

517
01:03:18,397 --> 01:03:19,776
O'Conner?

518
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:32,041
So this is what $60 million looks like.

519
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:35,317
Yeah, we got to get you to a doctor.

520
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,958
We have to find a place to hide this

521
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:42,587
I got a spot

522
01:03:51,575 --> 01:03:54,914
502, wet reckless.
I need a 48-hour hold.

523
01:03:56,857 --> 01:03:59,158
Out back. Any spot you can find.

524
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,879
Are you sure about this?

525
01:04:06,087 --> 01:04:09,086
Yeah. The last place they'll check,
their own impound yard. 

526
01:04:09,121 --> 01:04:12,086
Trust me.

527
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:22,157
You know, I've been thinking, 
when you blew up your car back
there, you blew up mine, too.

528
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,456
Yeah?

529
01:04:24,467 --> 01:04:25,290
Yeah

530
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:27,063
So, now you owe me a 10 second car

531
01:04:28,934 --> 01:04:30,232
Is that right?

532
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:31,208
Yeah

533
01:04:42,264 --> 01:04:43,553
How are you?

534
01:04:58,513 --> 01:05:01,270
Is this your way of keeping me
away from him?

535
01:05:01,305 --> 01:05:04,028
You're the only one I could call.
He's my brother, of course.

536
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:13,858
The bullet's not in there.

537
01:05:21,897 --> 01:05:25,003
I'm gonna clean it and stitch it up.
It's going to hurt.

538
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:27,143
I bet your are gonna enjoy this

539
01:05:28,531 --> 01:05:29,265
A little

540
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,896
MIA: Want some of this?
DOM: Yeah.


541
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,188
MIA: It's spicy.

542
01:05:39,184 --> 01:05:40,429
I like it hot.

543
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:42,658
Dom, what are you doing?

544
01:05:43,714 --> 01:05:46,221
You reached first,
you have to say grace.

545
01:05:56,266 --> 01:05:58,263
Thank you lord

546
01:05:58,298 --> 01:06:00,598
For blessing this table

547
01:06:02,112 --> 01:06:04,430
With food and family

548
01:06:04,465 --> 01:06:06,194
And friendship

549
01:06:38,414 --> 01:06:40,491
You asked me why I let Dom go?

550
01:06:42,568 --> 01:06:44,913
I think it's because at that moment,

551
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:49,005
I respected him more than I did myself.

552
01:06:56,444 --> 01:06:58,128
One thing I learned from Dom is that 


553
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:01,798
nothing really matters unless you have a code.

554
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:06,453
And what’s your code, Brian?

555
01:07:08,834 --> 01:07:10,670
I’m working on it

556
01:07:43,937 --> 01:07:45,559
Oh, Shit

557
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,188
Hey Dom,
When were you gonna tell me?

558
01:07:47,223 --> 01:07:50,035
- Dom what you doing
- When were you gonna tell me that you were running Letty?

559
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:51,690
- Let me explain this - When were you gonna......

560
01:07:57,716 --> 01:07:58,862
Stop, Stop

561
01:07:58,897 --> 01:08:01,010
You don't understand.
I don't understand?

562
01:08:01,045 --> 01:08:02,129
Stop!

563
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:13,741
Stop, Stop it, please Stop!

564
01:08:23,168 --> 01:08:24,797
She did it for...

565
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:26,426
She did it for you, Dom!
She did it for you!

566
01:08:30,858 --> 01:08:33,722
Letty came to me to clear your name
in exchange for bringing down Braga.

567
01:08:37,885 --> 01:08:40,088
She just wanted you to come home

568
01:08:56,838 --> 01:08:59,882
I’m sorry Dom, I'm sorry

569
01:09:24,573 --> 01:09:27,295
You better have one hell of an explanation

570
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,792
You disobeyed a direct order.

571
01:09:29,827 --> 01:09:32,254
- Where’s the shipment?
- Its safe

572
01:09:32,289 --> 01:09:33,866
It’s safe

573
01:09:33,901 --> 01:09:36,233
Look, we could use the shipment
to parade in front of the media,

574
01:09:36,268 --> 01:09:38,565
get a few hundred pounds
of heroin off the street,

575
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:40,597
but Braga's just gonna send another shipment
next week and the week after that.

576
01:09:40,632 --> 01:09:41,941
And a week after that

577
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:46,238
Let's use the shipment to lure Braga out
and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.


578
01:09:46,273 --> 01:09:48,332
And how do you suggest we do that?

579
01:09:48,367 --> 01:09:50,391
A hand-to-hand exchange with Braga.

580
01:09:50,426 --> 01:09:51,824
He'll never show up

581
01:09:51,842 --> 01:09:53,669
He can't afford not to

582
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:04,295
You got a plan?

583
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:06,998
There’s a price

584
01:10:10,284 --> 01:10:12,791
We bag Braga, you let Toretto walk.

585
01:10:21,385 --> 01:10:23,131
- Yes
- Hey star

586
01:10:24,913 --> 01:10:26,319
I was just thinking about you

587
01:10:27,527 --> 01:10:29,944
You know when I gave you my number
l was hoping that you'll call

588
01:10:31,368 --> 01:10:33,892
But not under these circumstances

589
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:35,816
What circumstances?

590
01:10:35,851 --> 01:10:37,670
Me, being alive!

591
01:10:37,705 --> 01:10:39,925
Don’t take it personally

592
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,111
...it’s just business

593
01:10:42,146 --> 01:10:44,438
I got some business of my own

594
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:46,533
Get Campos

595
01:10:49,075 --> 01:10:50,302
It's them.

596
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:58,055
Was that how Braga inspires loyalty?

597
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:59,981
Killing his drivers?

598
01:11:00,016 --> 01:11:02,361
One can always find more drivers

599
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:04,106
Its just good for business

600
01:11:04,141 --> 01:11:05,942
I want to trade

601
01:11:05,977 --> 01:11:07,652
Braga doesn't negotiate.

602
01:11:07,687 --> 01:11:09,318
Fine

603
01:11:09,353 --> 01:11:13,794
You explain to him how all of a sudden
$60 million worth of product disappears.

604
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:16,784
I know that can't be good for business

605
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:18,888
What do you want?

606
01:11:18,923 --> 01:11:23,919
6 million cash, delivered by Braga himself

607
01:11:26,202 --> 01:11:28,010
I don’t like being shot at

608
01:11:28,019 --> 01:11:31,090
I ain't gonna put my neck out again
unless he's got something to lose, too.

609
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:32,899
He'll never go for it

610
01:11:32,934 --> 01:11:36,944
Either I deal with Braga or you do

611
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:41,948
When and where?

612
01:11:56,443 --> 01:12:00,015
Sir, players are onsite.
Holding positions at the perimeter.

613
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,755
All right. Listen up.
Everybody stay frosty.

614
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,583
We don't move a muscle until
O'Conner gives the signal.

615
01:12:05,618 --> 01:12:07,472
When he gets the money,
you know what to do.

616
01:12:08,995 --> 01:12:10,821
Well, the good news is,
when we get this guy,

617
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:12,782
You walk out here a free man

618
01:12:12,817 --> 01:12:16,528
- Is that what they told you?
- Yeah that’s the deal

619
01:12:16,563 --> 01:12:20,239
You still put milk and cookies out for Santa Claus?

620
01:12:20,274 --> 01:12:22,092
Yeah

621
01:12:27,186 --> 01:12:30,060
In case things go shitty.

622
01:12:35,181 --> 01:12:37,839
- Just like old times
- Yeah

623
01:12:41,985 --> 01:12:43,095
Oy, you dropped something

624
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:45,180
That's what you wanted, right?
Dom...

625
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:01,760
He's harmless don’t worry about him

626
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:06,308
And he's really sorry about, Letty

627
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:09,638
Where’s our stuff?

628
01:13:12,611 --> 01:13:15,172
You mean the stuff that used to be in here right?

629
01:13:17,106 --> 01:13:20,534
Well, you'll see it when we see Braga.
That was the deal.

630
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:22,800
No worries

631
01:13:22,835 --> 01:13:25,064
Braga keeps his word

632
01:14:07,436 --> 01:14:08,832
2 million

633
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:11,886
You get the rest when I get my property

634
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:18,350
Stasiak.
TRINH: We got a match.

635
01:14:18,385 --> 01:14:20,390
The fingerprint's Braga's 100%.

636
01:14:20,425 --> 01:14:22,396
Just waiting a facial confirmation via fax

637
01:14:22,431 --> 01:14:24,500
BRIAN: I got a question for you.

638
01:14:24,535 --> 01:14:28,000
I got a question for you.
You wearing pink when you were
clawing your way out of el barrio?

639
01:14:30,005 --> 01:14:31,161
Order all agents to move in.

640
01:14:31,196 --> 01:14:33,980
We got confirmation.
Primary suspect wearing gray suit.

641
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:35,333
Let's move

642
01:14:35,368 --> 01:14:37,060
- Sir, O'Conner hasn't given us the signal yet

643
01:14:37,095 --> 01:14:39,933
What part of that didn't you understand?
We just got confirmation. Do it!


644
01:14:39,968 --> 01:14:42,954
FBI AGENT: Secure primary suspect
in gray suit. Repeat!


645
01:14:42,989 --> 01:14:45,941
Secure primary suspect in gray suit.

646
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:01,195
You're thinking what I'm thinking, right?

647
01:15:04,401 --> 01:15:06,067
He ain’t Braga

648
01:15:10,766 --> 01:15:11,626
Oh shit

649
01:15:11,661 --> 01:15:13,443
SWAT AGENT 1: Drop your weapons!
SWAT AGENT 2: FBI!


650
01:15:14,454 --> 01:15:15,421
Look out

651
01:15:18,832 --> 01:15:20,005
Get out of here

652
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:25,789
Get out of here, Dom

653
01:15:30,184 --> 01:15:31,912
Run him down

654
01:15:34,338 --> 01:15:35,189
Campos is Braga

655
01:15:42,753 --> 01:15:43,818
Come on

656
01:15:50,962 --> 01:15:52,798
SWAT LEADER:
Approaching primary target.


657
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,161
SWAT AGENT ON RADIO :
Primary suspect is secure.

658
01:15:55,196 --> 01:15:56,611
Let’s go

659
01:15:56,646 --> 01:15:58,026
Get up

660
01:15:58,035 --> 01:16:00,210
INVESTIGATOR: He was under your nose
the whole time.

661
01:16:00,245 --> 01:16:01,698
Now Braga's escaped.

662
01:16:01,733 --> 01:16:04,616
Toretto's heading south, probably
long across the border by now.

663
01:16:04,651 --> 01:16:07,328
Do you have any idea the kind
of trouble you're in, O'Conner?

664
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:09,065
I was doing my job

665
01:16:09,646 --> 01:16:13,142
He ain't the first bad guy you
helped escape the law's grasp.


666
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:16,638
As of now, you're being taken off active duty, 
until this house can
mount a formal inquiry.


667
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:20,497
- What about Braga?

668
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,201
- That's no longer your concern

669
01:16:34,231 --> 01:16:35,484
- We now know where Braga is, right?

670
01:16:35,519 --> 01:16:38,564
Customs tracked him via satellite
to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

671
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,963
- Mexico is out of our jurisdiction

672
01:16:44,257 --> 01:16:45,126
...the fact is

673
01:16:45,161 --> 01:16:48,743
The press will be so busy
holding press conferences over the seizure

674
01:16:48,778 --> 01:16:51,187
we'll skate under the radar.

675
01:16:52,243 --> 01:16:53,747
I thought we signed on
to do the right thing.

676
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:33,380
- Everyone's looking for you

677
01:17:34,373 --> 01:17:35,475
I’m right here

678
01:17:37,095 --> 01:17:41,025
It's nice to see you've gone
with the times
and switched to electronic fuel injection.
- It looks good

679
01:17:42,789 --> 01:17:44,974
Buster became a gearhead.

680
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:50,076
I’m going with you

681
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:56,791
I don't plan on bringing anyone back

682
01:17:58,652 --> 01:17:59,888
I know

683
01:18:08,598 --> 01:18:10,586
Hit that throttle.

684
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:18,840
How do you say goodbye
to your only brother?

685
01:19:21,275 --> 01:19:22,484
You don’t.

686
01:20:28,769 --> 01:20:30,469
I thought you were't gonna show up.

687
01:20:30,504 --> 01:20:32,591
You saved my life

688
01:20:33,531 --> 01:20:35,357
I’m willing to return the favour

689
01:20:39,493 --> 01:20:42,000
This will help get you to Braga.

690
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,103
Dom

691
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,899
Going in there is suicide

692
01:20:58,714 --> 01:21:00,496
I have no choice

693
01:21:04,032 --> 01:21:06,127
You must have loved her very much

694
01:21:23,647 --> 01:21:25,724
So this's where my jurisdiction ends?

695
01:21:31,785 --> 01:21:34,130
This, is where mine begins

696
01:23:07,147 --> 01:23:09,054
Amen

697
01:23:38,964 --> 01:23:40,548
You ain't forgiven

698
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,840
You boys want to arrest me?

699
01:23:49,018 --> 01:23:50,826
No, we're beyond that.

700
01:23:52,428 --> 01:23:54,711
You can't buy your way out of this one

701
01:23:55,893 --> 01:23:57,290
You and me

702
01:23:59,026 --> 01:24:01,444
You and me, we are not so different

703
01:24:03,485 --> 01:24:04,308
You're no hero

704
01:24:15,249 --> 01:24:16,476
You're right

705
01:24:19,868 --> 01:24:22,795
And that's why you're going back across the border

706
01:24:28,472 --> 01:24:30,351
But Fenix's mine

707
01:24:30,386 --> 01:24:32,249
You got it

708
01:24:53,386 --> 01:24:54,685
Oh.. Shit

709
01:24:59,537 --> 01:25:02,670
You'll make it a couple of miles out,
if you're lucky.

710
01:25:53,404 --> 01:25:55,042
You know where you’re going?

711
01:25:56,394 --> 01:25:58,292
You want to borrow my GPS?

712
01:26:02,106 --> 01:26:05,042
Where are your boys at? 
Are they going to show up or what?

713
01:26:08,937 --> 01:26:10,521
Be careful what you ask for

714
01:26:26,206 --> 01:26:28,283
Just stop, just stop the car

715
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:49,080
Right behind you

716
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:05,687
Dom, head to the tunnel
let's use the tunnel

717
01:27:32,526 --> 01:27:34,173
Get out of here, Brian

718
01:27:41,971 --> 01:27:45,221
You sure you know where the tunnels are?

719
01:27:46,009 --> 01:27:46,832
Yeah, hold on

720
01:27:50,172 --> 01:27:51,684
This might hurt

721
01:28:04,898 --> 01:28:06,340
You're in my world now, baby!

722
01:28:34,298 --> 01:28:36,160
That’s it baby, end of the road

723
01:28:36,169 --> 01:28:37,790
Now what?

724
01:28:39,007 --> 01:28:40,440
- Ah game over
- No No No

725
01:29:10,189 --> 01:29:11,514
Come on

726
01:30:29,437 --> 01:30:31,084
Hey, get me out of here

727
01:31:57,789 --> 01:31:59,239
PUSSY

728
01:32:15,694 --> 01:32:17,233
Let me see that

729
01:32:19,929 --> 01:32:21,173
Hey, just keep the pressure there

730
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:24,046
You'll be alright

731
01:32:30,072 --> 01:32:31,934
You have to get out of here

732
01:32:34,853 --> 01:32:36,822
I ain't running anymore

733
01:32:42,328 --> 01:32:44,065
- Can I ask you something
- Yeah

734
01:32:46,786 --> 01:32:50,725
You know I would of won that race if you didn’t cheat, right?

735
01:32:53,402 --> 01:32:55,156
You did hit your head hard

736
01:33:00,134 --> 01:33:01,728
Don’t make me laugh

737
01:33:11,888 --> 01:33:13,411
All rise

738
01:33:18,317 --> 01:33:20,358
Please be seated

739
01:33:24,011 --> 01:33:25,774
Please rise, mr Toretto

740
01:33:28,263 --> 01:33:29,884
I've listened to the Testimony

741
01:33:29,919 --> 01:33:32,873
...and taking in to special consideration
Agent O'Conner's

742
01:33:32,908 --> 01:33:36,580
appeal of clemency
on behalf of Mr. Toretto.

743
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,833
That his actions directly resulted
in the apprehension
of known drug trafficker

744
01:33:40,868 --> 01:33:43,411
Arturo Braga

745
01:33:44,413 --> 01:33:45,363
However

746
01:33:46,616 --> 01:33:48,720
This Judiciary finds that

747
01:33:48,755 --> 01:33:53,581
One right does not make up for
a lifetime worth of wrongs

748
01:33:53,616 --> 01:33:55,247
...and as such

749
01:33:55,282 --> 01:34:00,134
I find that I'm forced to
level the maximum sentence under California law

750
01:34:02,927 --> 01:34:04,414
Dominic Toretto

751
01:34:04,449 --> 01:34:12,560
You are here by sentenced to serve 25 years to life
at the Lompoc maximum
security prison system

752
01:34:13,954 --> 01:34:16,752
without the possibility of early parole.

753
01:34:17,358 --> 01:34:19,189
This court is adjourned.
