Flash" and "Supergirl"...

00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:04,421
What just happened to him?

3
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:07,373
Wally has taken my
place in the Speed Force.

4
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,498
It's okay, we're going home.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,810
What Wally saw, it's gonna
haunt him for a while.

6
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:15,338
I proposed because I
thought it would save you.

7
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:18,385
- What does that mean?
- I think we need some space.

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,113
I owe you the truth. My name is Mon-El.

9
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:21,488
I'm the former Prince of Daxam.

10
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:23,699
I deserve better than being lied to.

11
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,013
I've been looking for you.

12
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,339

Everything's better in song.

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,651
When you speak, it's just words.

17
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:44,994
But when you sing, you open up your soul

18
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:47,389
and let who you really
are shine through.

19
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:48,526
Thanks, Mom.

20
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:50,759
Hmm. I love you, my beautiful boy.

sitting around on the couch? Come on.

29
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:11,204
You've been doing this for
days. Let's do something.

30
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:12,662
- Let's go out.
- No, man, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:13,955
I... I don't feel like going out.

32
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,923
What is it with you and
musicals these days anyhow?

Everything's better in song.

34
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:21,306
Listen, dude,

35
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,767
I know you've been going
through a tough time

36
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,282
since Iris broke off the engagement,

37
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:26,643
- or, I guess...
- What?

38
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,448
... technically, since you
broke off the engagement.

39
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,106
Whoever broke off the engagement,

40
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,699
it doesn't matter, I just...

41
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:33,334
I don't know, man. I want to help.

42
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:34,869
Nothing you can really do.

43
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:37,096
Really? I guess I'm
just gonna have to let...

44
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:39,040
Mr. Gene Kelly take over

45
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:41,642
'cause, Lord knows, I can't
do anything about that.

46
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:48,437
- It's H.R.
- Yeah.

47
00:01:56,893 --> 00:01:58,533
B.A.,

48
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:00,294
someone's coming through.

49
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,151
Could be Gypsy.

50
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,391
Could be, or it could be...

51
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,159
Supergirl?

52
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:10,798
Kara...

53
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,165
- What happened to her?
- We don't know,

54
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,055
but whoever did it
has come to this world.

56
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:25,652
Her vitals are low.

57
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:27,121
How long has she been like this?

58
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:29,163
A few hours.

59
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:32,224
Okay, we need to find
whoever did this to Kara

60
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:34,362
and punch him repeatedly
until he reverses

61
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:35,757
whatever spell he put on her,

62
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:37,045
and I get to punch him first.

63
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,432
Who are you exactly?

64
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:39,934
My name is Mon-El.

65
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,636
I'm... I'm Kara's...

66
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:43,256
friend.

67
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:46,014
We're more... more than friend.

68
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:48,528
We've been kissing a lot.

69
00:02:48,553 --> 00:02:50,765
Oh, she never mentioned
she had a boyfriend.

70
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,790
It's a recent thing, so...

71
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:54,885
I thought you two broke up.

72
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,315
Shh...

73
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,019
I tell you what, I know
enough not to mention

74
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,512
the break-up between Barry and... uh...

75
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,490
- H.R.
- Sorry.

76
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,114
Look, hey, whatever's going
on between me and Kara,

77
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,062
I cannot leave her like this, okay?

78
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:10,442
- I need to get her back.
- We will, I promise.

79
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,324
So what happened to her?

80
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,198
An alien prisoner escaped our custody.

81
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,557
He did something to her, put
her in some kind of a coma.

82
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,858
And then he disappeared.

83
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,326
We tracked him here and followed.

84
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:22,173
Okay, but why would
he come to this Earth?

85
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:24,743
Well, we believe... for you.

86
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:26,499
- Me? Why?
- We don't know.

87
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,081
But his last words before he disappeared

88
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:30,753
were about finding
the fastest man alive.

89
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:34,798
Okay, well, clearly, we're
talking about a breacher here.

90
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:36,808
And if there's one thing I can do,

91
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,549
it's find breachers.

92
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:44,493
So what else can you
tell us about this guy?

93
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:45,723
Not much.

94
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:47,968
It's like he just
materialized out of thin air.

95
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,323
You mean like this clown just did?

96
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:54,874
I'm gonna go.

97
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,894
Wallace...

98
00:04:01,894 --> 00:04:03,683
I understand what you've been through.

99
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:06,572
Stuck in the Speed Force,
things you saw... I get it.

100
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:09,471
I also know that sometimes,
the old adage is true.

101
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:10,924
When you get bucked from the horse,

102
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:12,692
best thing you can do...

103
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:14,527
get right back on the damn thing

104
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,296
and ride, Wallace.

105
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,691
Ride!

106
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,004
Hello, Barry Allen.

107
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,899
- How do you...
- Know your name?

108
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:29,777
I know a lot of things.

109
00:04:29,778 --> 00:04:32,278
And I can do a lot of things too.

110
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,913
Whoa-ho-ho!

111
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,561
Wally West made it here too.

112
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:37,017
This is exciting.

113
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,818
It's good of you to join
the party, Kid Flash.

114
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,216
I'm happy to have you.

115
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:41,521
What do you want with Supergirl?

116
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:44,178
Same thing that I want with both of you.

117
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,489
To teach you all a lesson.

118
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:54,934
Is that all you got, Kid Flash?

119
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:57,552
I mean, you look a little scared.

120
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:01,608
And you're too slow.

121
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:04,611
Ooh.

122
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,613

- Yeah.
- You know her?

147
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,030
Yeah, I do.

148
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,777
Ladies and gentlemen...

149
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:30,068
- Barry?
- Hey!

150
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,487
Barry! It's you, thank Rao!

151
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:34,347
Oh, wait, it's really you, right?

152
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,854
- Yeah, this is me, yeah.
- Good.

153
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,104
What is... where the hell
are we? What's going on?

154
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,819
I was hoping you could tell me

155
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:42,144
or maybe explain to me why I
just pulled an Audrey Hepburn

156
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,933
and sang in a nightclub.

157
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,083
- Maybe we're dreaming?
- The same dream?

158
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,784
Yeah, that's... What's
the last thing you remember

159
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:48,838
before you got here?

160
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:50,534
I was at the D.E.O.

161
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,426
They had just brought
in an alien prisoner.

162
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:54,520
He got loose, and...

163
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,818
it was really weird.
He had this, um, red...

164
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,615
- ... Pocket handkerchief?
- Yes!

165
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,889
I saw you on my Earth.
You were in a coma.

166
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,470
Your boyfriend brought you to us.

167
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:04,205
He is not my boyfriend.

168
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:05,974
He... he's just a boy.

169
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,031
Who is not my friend.

170
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:09,153
- He's my nothing.
- Okay.

171
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:11,037
All right, uh, well, whoever he is

172
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:12,748
said that this guy whammied you,

173
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:14,951
and then he escaped to my Earth,
he showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs,

174
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,871
I went after him to try to
get him to wake you up...

175
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,434
- And then you got whammied.
- Yeah.

176
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:19,936
- So where are we?
- I don't know.

177
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:22,038
I mean, it could be a
parallel dimension, or...

178
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,745
maybe just some elaborate illusion.

179
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,152
We just need to figure a way out.

180
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:28,844
I guess I could click my
heels together three times.

181
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,746
- Yeah...
- I was kidding.

182
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:33,174
Okay, all right, well...

183
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:34,783
Come on. Let's...

184
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,580
You're a really good singer, by the way.

185
00:08:37,605 --> 00:08:40,756
Hey, thanks. My sister says
I put the "Kara" in "karaoke."

186
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:42,619
There you are!

187
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:44,274
Merlyn...

188
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,477
- Who?
- Who?

189
00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:47,674
Malcolm Merlyn. Former head
of the League of Assassins.

190
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:48,963
The what of the what?

191
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:50,454
What the hell you talking about, kid?

192
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,267
My name's Cutter Moran, I own this club,

193
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:53,791
and both of you work for me.

194
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:54,932
We what now?

195
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:58,086
I pay you to sing, not
pepper me with questions.

196
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,742
And I hope you got something
better in your songbook

197
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:01,463
than what you were belting
out up there, blondie.

198
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:03,279
Hey! Don't call me blondie.

199
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:04,604
Hey, look, I don't know who you are...

200
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:06,029
obviously you're someone
who's quick with a knife.

201
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:08,688
You have to excuse my friend.
He doesn't think before he talks.

202
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,122
Yeah, I had a cousin like that.

203
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:11,735
I had to slit his throat too.

204
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,875
Oh.

205
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,836
Grady! Get these two set up.

206
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:16,028
And nothing I've heard before.

207
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,729
I want something original.

208
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,782
Barry, I don't have my powers.

209
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,338
Me neither.

210
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:24,874
Winn!

211
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,241
Winn, you're here too?

212
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,673
Ah! Who's Winn? The name is Grady.

213
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:29,141
I tickle the keys around here.

214
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:31,650
Say, you realize how he got the
nickname "Cutter," don't you?

215
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:33,879
- No.
- Because he likes to cut people.

216
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:36,476
You ask me, I think he's all talk.

217
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:39,235
Cisco... not Cisco. Hello.

218
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:41,102
I pray that, one day,
you do not find out

219
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,483
how very, very wrong you are, Pablo.

220
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:46,142
- Now go do your job.
- All right.

221
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,641
You see, Grady doesn't
know this, but one day,

222
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,376
I'm gonna be somebody.

223
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,024
I'm gonna be somebody,
and it's gonna happen

224
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:55,083
right there on that stage.

225
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,384
You'll see. I just need my one shot.

226
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:00,198
It's just curiouser and curiouser.

227
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,089
Yeah, yeah, it's like
"The Wizard of Oz."

228
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:03,785
- Yeah.
- "And you were there,

229
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,660
- "and you were there...."
- Except, it's not really them.

230
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:07,630
They're all playing characters in a...

231
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:09,449
... Musical.

232
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:12,316
Barry, where are we?

233
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:13,874
I don't know.

234
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,402
Well, you know what they say...

235
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:19,402
the show must go on!

236
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:20,582
Ah...

237
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:22,556
Supergirl, I loved your
rendition of "Moon River,"

238
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,722
such a beautiful song.

239
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:24,907
You were a little flat in places,

240
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:27,675
but I'm willing to let it slide
just because you're so cute.

241
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,282
- Hold on. What did you do to us?
- Oh, nothing much.

242
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:32,692
Just put a little song in your heart.

243
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,250
Put a little...

244
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:35,524
Why did you bring us here?

245
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:37,921
I didn't bring you anywhere.

246
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:39,696
We're inside your heads.

247
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,454
You created this world.

248
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,413
And we got lucky because it
could have been a war movie

249
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:44,852
or a... a space opera,

250
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,077
but thanks to your love of musicals,

251
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:50,570
with the countless times you
watched, um, "Wizard of Oz"

252
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:52,595
- with your adoptive parents...
- How did you know that?

253
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,119
And, you, all those rainy nights

254
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:56,611
watching Fred Astaire and
Frank Sinatra with Mom.

255
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:58,002
Well, where else would we be?

256
00:10:58,027 --> 00:10:59,594
All right, all right.

257
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:00,951
Whoo!

258
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:03,802
Ooh! Swing and a miss.

259
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:05,164
I didn't tell you.

260
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:06,795
I'm not really here.

261
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,287
See, I'm out there in the real world.

262
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,177
Central City's mine for the taking.

263
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,390
- Ah. We're gonna stop you.
- Yeah!

264
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,559
You're welcome to try that.

265
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:16,296
If you can get out of here.

266
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,234
How do we get out of here?

267
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:20,326
You're in a movie musical.

268
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:23,111
So all you have to do
is just follow the...

269
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:24,335
The Yellow Brick Road?

270
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,637
No, the... the script.

271
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,905
- Oh, yeah.
- Script...

272
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:28,473
Reach the end of the plot,

273
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:30,542
and, presto chango, you get to go home.

274
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:33,050
One little detail,
though, I should mention...

275
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:36,042
if you die in here, you die out there.

276
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,167
Lovely.

277
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:39,171
I've reached my limit
with magical creeps.

278
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:40,433
In the meantime, I
hope you're both ready

279
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,598
to get the rust off
those pipes of yours.

280
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:44,056
- We're not singing for you!
- No.

281
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:46,121
Uh, any... anymore, I mean.

282
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,360
Come on, now, maybe just one little

283
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,905

331
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:46,679
Where'd he go?

332
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,570
I don't know.

333
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,022
Come on, let's find him.

334
00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:56,929
- He's gone.
- Yup.

335
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,756
- So what do we do now?
- I don't know.

336
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:01,289
I mean, I guess we just...

337
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:02,781
we do what he says, right?

338
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:04,406
We have to figure out what
the plot of the musical is,

339
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:06,718
- and we follow the story.
- Okay, uh, so...

340
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:08,643
what do we know so far?

341
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:09,875
We're singers.

342
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,250
And apparently we work for a gangster.

343
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,672
Yes, who wants us to perform for him.

344
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:16,688
I mean, honestly, it's
pretty straightforward.

345
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:17,846
- Right?
- Yeah.

346
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,195
Hello.

347
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,620
Hi! I miss being bulletproof.

348
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,773
- You're coming with us.
- Says who?

349
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:27,992
Says me.

350
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:34,144
Barry, are you okay?

351
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:36,063
Oh, please stop yelling.

352
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:37,854
I'm not yelling.

353
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,549
Wait, where are we?

354
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:43,203
I don't know.

355
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:45,594
All right, well, I'm sure
everybody at S.T.A.R. Labs

356
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,322
is working on getting us out of this.

357
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:49,157
Yeah, I'm glad they
brought me to your Earth.

358
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:52,931
Mon-El seems like he
really cares about you.

359
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:56,298
Mon-El only cares about himself.

360
00:14:56,323 --> 00:14:58,543
He lied to me about who he really is

361
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:00,130
- for nine months.
- Hmm.

362
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:01,686
I can't shake it.

363
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:04,105
I thought it was gonna
be something special

364
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:05,840
like what you have with Iris.

365
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:07,409
That is...

366
00:15:07,411 --> 00:15:08,843
off track.

367
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,145
I'm sorry.

368
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:11,680
I asked her to marry me.

369
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,616
You did? That's great.

370
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:15,944
Did she not say yes?

371
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:18,700
Oh, she said yes, but I guess I did it

372
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:20,822
for the wrong reason,
and, I mean, I love her,

373
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:23,647
but I was trying to change the future.

374
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:27,139
Then I pushed her away so
I could focus on saving her,

375
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:28,991
and it's just a mess now.

376
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,900
Everything's so simple when I'm running.

377
00:15:31,902 --> 00:15:33,501
Or flying.

378
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:34,769
Shut up!

379
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:36,205
Both of you.

380
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:37,772
Stein?

381
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:39,941
Who... who's Stein?

382
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:41,744
Right.

383
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,351
- This them?
- Yeah.

384
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:50,743
Hmm.

385
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,729
Do you know who I am?

386
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:02,931
Not Joe West, I'm guessing.

387
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:05,272
Digsy. Digsy Foss.

388
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:07,233
I run this town.

389
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,928
So you're the mayor?

390
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,575
The mayor may have gotten the vote...

391
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:15,224
but I got the power.

392
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,133
I got a situation...

393
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:24,242
that you two are gonna help me with.

394
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,783
- We would love to help you with it.
- Really love to.

395
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:29,018
My daughter, Millie...

396
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,845
she's missing.

397
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,773
Last she was seen,

398
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:36,571
she was heading into
Cutter Moran's place.

399
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,791
Have you seen her in there?

400
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:46,775
- Millie, did you say?
- Yeah. Why?

401
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:48,995
We haven't seen her. I haven't seen her.

402
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,212
- I haven't seen her.
- Yeah, we...

403
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:53,558
She's the only thing
that is good and decent...

404
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,846
about my life.

405
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,239
If anything happened to her,

406
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:59,287
this town will run red with blood.

407
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:00,722
Starting with yours.

408
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:02,362
We wouldn't want that, now, right?

409
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:03,925
So, um, how can we help you?

410
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:05,260
You two sing for Cutter.

411
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:07,612
- We sure do.
- Yes, we do.

412
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:10,008
You could poke around and
see if you can find her.

413
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,057
Mm-hmm.

414
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:13,668
So are you gonna do this for me?

415
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:16,971
What do we do?

416
00:17:16,973 --> 00:17:18,540
Follow the script.

417
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:20,233
- Hey!
- Hey.

418
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,927
- We're gonna find her... sir.
- Mm-hmm.

419
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:25,920
Good.

420
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:31,886
Okay.

421
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:33,688
This is the place.

422
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,771
Apartment 4B.

423
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,832
This is where we can find Iris?

424
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,185
- Millie.
- Millie, right.

425
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,895
Yeah, she's in there, all right.

426
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,420
Now, you two listen to me.

427
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:44,689
Don't you go telling
anyone I showed you this.

428
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:45,943
Oh, yeah, we promise.

429
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:47,021
Word to the wise.

430
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,046
You go digging around in this dirt...

431
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:51,256
you might not like what you find.

432
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:53,693
Okay.

433
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:57,066
Okay, so remember, she
might look like Iris,

434
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,691
but she is not Iris.

435
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,415
I know. This is gonna be weird.

436
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,559
Yeah, tell me about it.

437
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:04,285
I'm glad we haven't seen
someone that looks like Mon-El.

438
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,129
I'd probably just punch him
in the face for the fun of it.

439
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,707
Oh, my God!

440
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:11,426
That's her.

441
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:12,651
Sounds like she's in trouble.

442
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:13,965
Here, stand back, I'm
gonna kick the door in.

443
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,623
You stand back, I'll kick the door in.

444
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:16,684
Well, I didn't mean,
like, a gender thing.

445
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,090
- I just wanted to kick it in...
- Barry!

446
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:19,394
All right, together. All right?

447
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,082
- One, two...
- Three!

448
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:26,707
What the hell is going on?

449
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,438
All right, you caught us.

450
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:34,929
We're in love.

451
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,298
Ugh, gross.

452
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:44,939
Guys, we have a problem.

453
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:46,479
Well, another problem.

454
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:47,948
The Speed Force levels in Barry's cells

455
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:49,338
have been severely depleted,

456
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,721
as has the amount of solar
radiation in Kara's body.

457
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,362
What exactly does that mean?

458
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:55,126
They're being drained.

459
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:56,809
The guy who did this to them...

460
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,001
I think he's stealing their powers.

461
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,859
Power up.

462
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:26,783
We gotta bring him in.

463
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:28,642
No, not we... me.

464
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,466
I'm the reason Barry got whammied.

465
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:32,114
We win and we lose as a team.

466
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:33,372
I'm coming with you.

467
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:34,996
I'm coming too.

468
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:36,614
Look, J'onn, uh,

469
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:39,505
I respect this whole special
agent situation you got going on,

470
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,099
but this problem right
here needs someone with...

471
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:47,933
green skin and sick-ass cape.

472
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,286
Call me the Martian Manhunter.

473
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:52,021
I think you'll find that
J'onn's a lot more than...

474
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,590
just a pretty face.

475
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,059
Guys!

476
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,434
Hello.

477
00:19:57,459 --> 00:20:00,669
Also, Barry and Kara's
vitals are all over the place.

478
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:02,192
Let's go.

479
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:09,804
All right.

480
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:11,329
Hello, friends!

481
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:12,844
Kid Flash.

482
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:14,602
Oh, I'm so glad you
could join the party.

483
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:17,508
I'm such a huge fan of your
work, but I have to say,

484
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:20,016
recently, your work's been a bit off.

485
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,188
You know what I'm talking about?

486
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:24,130
I think maybe it's just that
you're a little scared...

487
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:25,975
from what happened in the Speed Force.

488
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,490
Is that it?

489
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,914
No,

490
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,582
and I'm not afraid of anything.

491
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:33,479
Prove it.

492
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,746
Uh, Cisco, they're headed
towards 4th and Aspen.

493
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,944
Got it.

494
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,209
This way.

495
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,263
All right, J'onn,

496
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,132
how do you feel about
a little one-two combo?

497
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,767
I'm gonna open a breach,
you be ready to hit something

498
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,201
really hard on the B-side.

499
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:13,770
Hitting hard, I can do.

500
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,311
Wally, get ready to do the
same thing on the ground level.

501
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:17,851
Copy.

502
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,663
Now!

503
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,127
Ah...

504
00:21:46,152 --> 00:21:47,655
Nighty-night.

505
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,506
Hey, who are you?

506
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,243
Your names, now.

507
00:21:52,284 --> 00:21:53,719
I'm Kara. This is Barry.

508
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:56,702
We're singers at your dad's nightclub.

509
00:21:56,727 --> 00:22:00,446
Yeah, Millie, your dad
thinks you've been kidnapped.

510
00:22:00,471 --> 00:22:02,397
Well, clearly he's mistaken.

511
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,094
He really wants you to come home.

512
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,352
- Listen, I am never going back there.
- Mm-mm.

513
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:09,625
Why not? There's no place like home.

514
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,730
Tommy Moran...

515
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,421
is my home.

516
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:19,235
And besides, if our geezers
ever caught wind of this,

517
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:20,577
they'd go to war.

518
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:22,905
It'd be the end of
more than just us, huh?

519
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:24,674
Yeah, Tommy's right.

520
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,562
Our fathers hate each other.

521
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,773
Our love is forbidden.

522
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:31,013
This is just like "West Side Story."

523
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,570
I was thinking more
"Fantasticks," but...

524
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:34,629
Look, the point is...

525
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,187
we ain't telling nobody nothing.

526
00:22:37,212 --> 00:22:39,489
And neither are you, capisce?

527
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,984
"Capisce."

528
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,375
- Can you give us a second?
- Oh, uh...

529
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:45,482
Sure.

530
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:48,465
Okay, look, he says we
need to follow the script.

531
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,717
- Uh-huh.
- Right? We're in a musical.

532
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,108
So I think if we convince them

533
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,499
to tell their fathers
that they're in love,

534
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:53,703
maybe that'll get us out of here.

535
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,372
And back home to being...

536
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,341
single, yay...

537
00:22:58,366 --> 00:22:59,748
At least we'll be single together.

538
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,754
Has saying that ever
made anyone feel better?

539
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:03,212
Debatable.

540
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,209
Okay, so look...

541
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:06,759
your fathers aren't perfect, right?

542
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:08,784
Love isn't perfect.

543
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:12,088
No, but you can't let
your love for somebody

544
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,895
cause you to be afraid
of what might happen.

545
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,903
You gotta take the good
with the bad, no matter what.

546
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,239
- Right.
- And that includes...

547
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,059
telling your fathers how you
two feel about each other.

548
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,398
All right, you make
a convincing argument.

549
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:28,430
- You do.
- We'll do it.

550
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:29,594
We'll tell them about us, right?

551
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:30,758
Well, we should go now.

552
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:32,383
- Gee, thanks, kid.
- Okay.

553
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:34,609
- For you.
- Thank you.

554
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:36,742
Wow.

555
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:38,719
Okay, uh...

556
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:41,345
convincing people in musicals is...

557
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,127
- ... really easy.
- Yeah.

558
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:46,087
Let's hope getting out
of one is just as easy.

559
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:49,798
Digsy!

560
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:51,337
She's back!

561
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,730
- Oh...
- Hmm.

562
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,298
Thank God you're safe.

563
00:23:56,323 --> 00:23:58,916
Oh, of course I'm safe.

564
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:02,844
Barry and Kara told me that
you sent them to find me.

565
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:04,275
We were concerned.

566
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,555
Dads, there's no reason to be concerned.

567
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,045
"Dads"?

568
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,172
You got a problem with that?

569
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:12,455
No.

570
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:15,851
I love musicals, so...

571
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:17,353
Okay...

572
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:22,291
Look, Dads, there's something that...

573
00:24:22,316 --> 00:24:24,603
I need to tell you.

574
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,706
Mm-hmm.

575
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,197
I'm in love!

576
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:36,138
Who is the, uh... the lucky boy?

577
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:38,608
Um...

578
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:43,548
Tommy Moran.

579
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:46,226
You... you mean Cutter Moran's kid?

580
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,931
Dad, look, we're in love.

581
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:49,986
- The hell you are.
- He's a hooligan!

582
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:51,647
His father's a hooligan.

583
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:52,936
- His mother is...
- Hey!

584
00:24:52,961 --> 00:24:54,733
Not in front of the girl.

585
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:56,459
And you're not loving that boy.

586
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,762
Have you lost your mind?

587
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,298
She is the daughter of my enemy.

588
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,155
Digsy Foss is a dirty, rotten scoundrel,

589
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,769
and the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree...

590
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,237
Dad, if you just let me explain.

591
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,216
There's nothing to explain, Tommy.

592
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:14,206
I knew you were keeping
something from me.

593
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:18,058
I never imagined it
was something like this!

594
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,690
She isn't your little girl anymore.

595
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,975
Well, she isn't.

596
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,535
She's an incredibly brave, strong woman.

597
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,356
One look, and you can see that.

598
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,584
And she wants to be with him.

599
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:31,685
No matter how scared
she was to tell you,

600
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,389
no matter how dangerous
it is to be with him,

601
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,990
all that matters is, they're together.

602
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:39,468
And when you find a
love like that, well...

603
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,912
you gotta hold on to it.

604
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:43,200
No matter who's trying to stop you.

605
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:46,458
That's clear to me now.

606
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,278
I think you're being a
little tough on your son.

607
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,435
Excuse me?

608
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,755
Well, it's obvious why he
didn't tell you right away.

609
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,216
I mean, look at the way you're reacting.

610
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:59,355
Maybe if you just listen
and... and hear his reasons

611
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,693
and try to see things
from his point of view...

612
00:26:03,684 --> 00:26:06,095
maybe... maybe you'd understand why

613
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,264
he didn't tell you...

614
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,709
before now.

615
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:14,226
Baby doll, it's just...

616
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:16,742
you'll never understand
what it means to be a father.

617
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:19,435
Millie, my darling, we've
always taken care of you.

618
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:21,912
We just want you to be happy.

654
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:37,016
Thanks for telling us the truth, baby.

655
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,284
I love you both so much.

656
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:41,176
We love you.

657
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:49,745
Thanks.

658
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,127
Okay...

659
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,690
So what do you want to do?

660
00:28:58,412 --> 00:29:00,487
Gather up the boys.

661
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,639
- We're going to war.
- I had a feeling.

662
00:29:03,812 --> 00:29:06,139
I appreciate your honesty, son.

663
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,389
- Thanks, Dad.
- Come here.

664
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,407
Get the boys.

665
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:19,855
We are going to war.

666
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:29,373
Well, well, well...

667
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,967
if it isn't the two people

668
00:29:30,992 --> 00:29:33,777
I was hoping would visit me the most.

669
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,046
Fix them. Now.

670
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm sorry. I can't.

671
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:39,817
If you ever want to
get out of that cell,

672
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:41,600
that's exactly what you're gonna do.

673
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,273
You don't get it.

674
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:48,025
You don't understand, big guy.

675
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:49,260
That's just not how it works.

676
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:51,462
My powers don't work that way.

677
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:52,872
What do you mean? You're
the one who did this to them.

678
00:29:52,897 --> 00:29:54,430
Yes, but...

679
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:55,840
they are the only ones
that are in control

680
00:29:55,865 --> 00:29:57,568
of what happens to them now,

681
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,692
as are the two of you.

682
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,983
Us? What does that mean?

683
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,587
How much...

684
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:06,946
do you love him, Iris?

685
00:30:07,113 --> 00:30:11,087
And you, Mon-El, how
much do you love her?

686
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,929
So the question is:

687
00:30:12,954 --> 00:30:16,259
is that strong enough to save them?

688
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,036
You want Kara and Barry back
from the world they're in,

689
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:21,961
you can go get them yourselves.

690
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,086
You have that power.

691
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:25,619
How?

692
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,244
Ah, I can't tell you. Sorry,
you gotta figure it out yourself.

693
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:30,861
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna just chill

694
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:33,648
in this wonderfully decorated
little cell of yours.

695
00:30:33,673 --> 00:30:35,100
Bye, guys!

696
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,223
Good luck. Love will find a way.

697
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:40,082
You can do it. Power
of love and all that.

698
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,684
What do we do now? We got...

699
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,887
we got Millie and Tommy

700
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,365
to tell their fathers
that they're in love.

701
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,821
Which, I know we're in
a musical and everything,

702
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:53,301
but seeing Mon-El in love
with someone else was...

703
00:30:53,326 --> 00:30:55,659
It was hard to watch. I know.

704
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:57,628
Anyway, I mean, what are we...

705
00:30:57,653 --> 00:30:59,797
supposed to do? What
do you think this...

706
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,999
Music Meister needs us to do now?

707
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:03,434
Uh...

708
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:04,835
Ah, there you are!

709
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:06,003
You two ready?

710
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,639
Ready for...

711
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:10,223
For rehearsal, you dolt.

712
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:13,177
Mr. Moran told me that you got
more songs in your repertoire.

713
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:15,045
- Ah.
- We have to finish the musical.

714
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,814
- Yeah.
- Uh, do you...

715
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:18,981
do you happen to know anything original?

716
00:31:19,006 --> 00:31:20,848
As a matter of fact,

717
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:23,356
I've been working on something all day.

718
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,655
Wow.

719
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,990
- Things really are easier in musicals.
- Yeah.

720
00:31:31,615 --> 00:31:32,912

It will be a cold day in hell

768
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:40,787
before our daughter
marries any son of yours.

769
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:44,361
Like he said. A cold, cold day.

770
00:33:45,673 --> 00:33:48,008
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

771
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,398
Come on.

772
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,204
Stop!

773
00:33:58,654 --> 00:33:59,861
Agh!

774
00:34:07,202 --> 00:34:08,445
Barry!

775
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:10,554
Oh, my God.

776
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:11,788
Agh!

777
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:20,242
- What's wrong?
- I think we're losing them.

778
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:24,155
- Can you stop it?
- Not if I don't know why.

779
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,736
- What are we gonna do?
- Um...

780
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,747
We need to go to
whatever world they're in.

781
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:32,233
How are we gonna do that?

782
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:34,600
Look, he said, if we loved them enough

783
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,569
that we could save
them, wherever they are.

784
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:39,793
Cisco, you can vibe us there.

785
00:34:39,818 --> 00:34:41,256
I don't think it works that way.

786
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:42,350
You sent me into the Speed Force.

787
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,967
You sent Barry and
Wally into the future.

788
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:46,694
- You can do this too.
- What is she talking about?

789
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:49,059
- What's a vibe?
- I'll explain later.

790
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:51,835
Come on, just... grab
on to my shoulders.

791
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:54,381
Let's hope this works.

792
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:59,338
Barry, Barry...

793
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:04,308
Kara...

794
00:35:09,515 --> 00:35:10,609
Barry!

795
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:11,999
Kara!

796
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:13,663
- Oh, no.
- No.

797
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:14,804
Hey, it's me.

798
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:16,529
It's Iris, I'm here. Hi.

799
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:20,522
Stay with me. I'm gonna get you out.

800
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:23,772
There's no time.

801
00:35:24,062 --> 00:35:25,495
We have to go.

802
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,021
We have to get them out!

803
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:31,530
Come on, Barry. Barry!

804
00:35:32,237 --> 00:35:33,725
No!

805
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:36,514
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

806
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:38,796
I forgive you.

807
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:42,829
I love you.

808
00:35:42,854 --> 00:35:45,017
No, Barry, Barry, you're gonna be okay.

809
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:47,892
No.

810
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:51,188
I love you.

811
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:03,001
Iris?

812
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:12,531
Mon-El?

813
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:16,805
- Hey.
- Hi.

814
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,680
They're back!

815
00:36:25,794 --> 00:36:28,323
Bravo! Round of applause!

816
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:30,398
Standing O. That was so good!

817
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:32,409
I loved it. That was a hell of a show.

818
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:33,864
And you two...

819
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:36,400
I guess your love really
was strong enough after all.

820
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:37,880
Beautiful.

821
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,670
Man, how did you get out of the cell?

822
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:41,672
Cisco, do you really think that cell

823
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:43,941
is gonna just, like, hold me?

824
00:36:43,966 --> 00:36:45,074
No, I'm sorry... what's going on?

825
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:46,632
Why did you do this to us?

826
00:36:46,657 --> 00:36:49,625
I did it because I
believe in the good guys.

827
00:36:50,457 --> 00:36:52,115
I told you when we first met.

828
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:55,426
It was to teach all of you a lesson.

829
00:36:56,155 --> 00:36:58,121
'Cause I see everything,

830
00:36:58,146 --> 00:37:00,980
and I saw two people...

831
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:03,254
with two broken hearts.

832
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:06,411
So the lesson was...

833
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:09,299
Love, Supergirl.

834
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:11,262
Love is about...

835
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:13,567
letting yourself be saved.

836
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,631
It's not just about saving other people.

837
00:37:15,656 --> 00:37:17,207
Even if you are superheroes.

838
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:19,785
Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to,
like, mess with you a little bit.

839
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,661
I was just trying to
get you to play the game,

840
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:22,817
do the song and dance.

841
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:24,770
Are you, like, from another...

842
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:26,809
Earth-multi-verse...
universe, something?

843
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,520
Yeah, you...

844
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:31,052
you wouldn't even
understand where I come from.

845
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:33,215
Wait, I'm sorry, that's it?

846
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,083
You're just gonna teach
somebody else a lesson?

847
00:37:36,108 --> 00:37:37,338
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

848
00:37:37,363 --> 00:37:38,387
Oh.

849
00:37:38,412 --> 00:37:41,112
♪ Think of your fellow man ♪

850
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,177
♪ Lend him a helping hand ♪

851
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:46,347
♪ Put a little love in your heart ♪

852
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:03,416
Wait, so, let me get this straight.

853
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:06,142
You got whammied by some guy named...

854
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,533
Music Meister.

855
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,268
Damn, Barry, I'd have paid good money

856
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:10,651
to see you singing and dancing.

857
00:38:10,676 --> 00:38:11,698
No.

858
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:12,924
Well, he's holding out on you

859
00:38:12,949 --> 00:38:15,166
because Barry has an amazing voice.

860
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:16,436
- He does!
- Uh-uh.

861
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,894
I've actually seen him sing.

862
00:38:17,919 --> 00:38:19,002
What? You have?

863
00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:21,224
How have we not made a GIF of that?

864
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:24,745
Well, technically, I'm not even
the only one here who can sing.

865
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:26,175
Thank you, B.A.

866
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,565
What? I was talking about Kara.

867
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,599
Wait, shh... oh, you too?

868
00:38:29,624 --> 00:38:32,191
Kara. Of course Kara can sing.

869
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:33,726
Well, her name is Supergirl.

870
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,227
It's kind of implied, right?

871
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,807
Well, we better be getting going.

872
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:40,345
I promised Kara's sister we'd
get her back in one piece.

873
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,767
We couldn't have done this without you.

874
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:43,737
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

875
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,266
How are you guys doing?

876
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,058
Yeah, I think we'll be okay.

877
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,852
Although, if you lie to me again,

878
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:51,486
I will drop a mountain on you.

879
00:38:51,511 --> 00:38:53,238
Wow. You mean figuratively?

880
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:55,379
- No, I mean, geologically.
- Okay.

881
00:38:57,508 --> 00:38:59,089
What about you guys?

882
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,593
We'll see.

883
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:20,590
You didn't change anything
when I moved in with Cisco.

884
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:23,332
I, um, couldn't bring myself to do it.

885
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:26,979
You know, we've been through
a lot these last three years,

886
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:28,800
but, um...

887
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,998
getting stuck in a musical?

888
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:33,636
Music Meister...

889
00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:35,285
said that, you know, it
could've been anything,

890
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,840
that I created that world because...

891
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:39,664
You were watching them.

892
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,715
Because of us.

893
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:45,264
My mom used to always say
that musicals have the power

894
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,324
to make everything better.

895
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:50,277
Did it work?

896
00:39:52,006 --> 00:39:53,543

will you marry me?

Yes.

936
00:42:45,507 --> 00:42:46,764
Yes.
