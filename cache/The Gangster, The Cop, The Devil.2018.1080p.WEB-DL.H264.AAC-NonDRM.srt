00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,410
Later don't admit it

16

You have been accused of illegally trading Gift Certificates

74
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,190
You have the right to remain silent

75
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,290
The right to a lawyer

76
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,260

I sent him to the crime scene
What is he doing there ? ........Bastard.......

86
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,930
Go and ask the Bastard about that yourself

87
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,680
Tell Heo Sang-Do that I am going to pass

88
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,380
You cannot do this to me when  you take a share every month

89
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,630
Because you have pocketed too

90
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,970
Don't you thing your men shouldn't disturb my work

91
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,840
I told you not to deal in stocks

92
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,580
Open a currency exchange office in the name of someone else

93
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,750
Or share the Profits You know the rules of the game.

94
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,100
I don't do small business

95
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,000
I am busy making machines and opening new stores

96
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,630
Can't you stop him before he comes over?

97
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,720

104
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,700
I don't want a friend like you

105
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:22,950

106
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,870

115
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,420
Damn traffic jam

116
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,920
Where the hell have you been ??

117
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,240
There are a lot of people here

118
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,350
Tell them to go away

119
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,430
Reporters and gentlemen, please wait....

120
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,480
Sorry sorry...You can take pictures later

121
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,650
Later please.... Sorry..
Clear the path

122
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,440
Properly secure the scene, what are you doing?

123
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,970
hey..hey..hey ! Go away..go away..

124
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,070
You're too late

125
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,980
More and more people are gathering around there

126
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,540
People are crowding

127
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,480
Hello there

128
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,460
Have you checked his identity?

129
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,280
We are checking his license plate number, there will be news soon.

130
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,870
He just died a few hours ago

131
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,080
Between 3 am and 5 am in the morning.

132
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,130
The cause of death is excessive blood loss

133
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,730
Or  heart attack

134
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,400
This is my preliminary judgment

135
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,490
Newbie, come take a picture.

136
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,150
Cha Seo-Jin...come here

137
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,710
Also look at this

138
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,450
I told you not to call me by my name at the crime scene

139
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,620
Sorry Chief Ch. Loyal please have a look

140
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,580
what is it ?

141
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,700
This is beacause of accident..right ??

142
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,400
It seems like accident also
It doesnt look like accident also

143
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,530
I hope he didn't die because of this

144
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,490
I wish it is an accidental killing

145
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,220
A few days ago ,Thank you ,

146
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,640
You made my men become crippled

147
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,560
The existence of rules has its own causes

148
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,410
Anyway

149
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,630
Although we do business separately, machines and engineers are shared.

150
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,630
Okay Buddy

151
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,090
We still have to solve the matter of territory, right?

152
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,570
Be Flexible

153
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,140
Shan-do

154
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,700
Yeah, Dong-Soo

155
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,400
If you  eat sweets only , you will have toothache.

156
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,840
Don't stir up trouble

157
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,420
Manage the trade I assigned to you

158
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,200
Everyone has their own bottom line

159
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,550
If you crossed that line you're dead

160
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,180
I don’t even have a road.

161
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,210
Steve Jobs said

162
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,610
To stay very hungry

163
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,990
I have no capital or investors,

164
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,320
So I'm still very hungry

165
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,580
Brother

166
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,040
My boss is generous, because both of you are friends.

167
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,170
That's why he provides you with technology and engineers.

168
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,150
Slot machine business

169
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:51,820
It’s not the same as fighting for bars and clubs.

170
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,050
This bastard Are you shouting in front of the bosses?

171
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,560
Give us something, to make us comfortable bastards

172
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,640
I've had enough

173
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,310
Scoundrel

174
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,440
That's how you raised your guys

175
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,090
Look how he stares at me.

176
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,940
Dong-Soo

177
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,050
You're all-powerful now and You only gave me  breadcrumbs.

178
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,740
How do we coexist peacefully like this?

179
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,710
Come here

180
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:30,760
Yes boss

181
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,890
Don't you see that we are Talking

182
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,040
Come here

183
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,980
Look at this bastard

184
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,220
Now we can live together peacefully. Right ?

185
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,500
Drink up

186
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,450
It taste good

187
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,730
46-year-old Cui Zheng Liu

188
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,850
No enemies, debts, litigation, anything like that.

189
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,500
The autopsy report is clear.

190
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,270
He died beacuse of dozen stab wounds

191
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,070
It appears to be an amateur killer

192
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,420
He just crazy

193
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,860
But if it’s an amateur killer, it’s a bit strange.

194
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,850
Because there is no evidence left behind

195
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,970
No footprints, blood, hair, fingerprint, just nothing

196
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,100
The wallet is missing. It may be a robbery.

197
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,230
But the amount of money is not big, so maybe not

198
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,380
People will kill people even for a little bit of something

199
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,880
The briefing is over. Call the team captain.

200
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,440
Okay

201
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,180
Yes sir

202
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,810
This case is likely to be a robbery and murder case

203
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,040
Look for someone with a similar criminal record

204
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,770
Yes i understand

205
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,480
And you support your team

206
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,400
Three cases were committed by the same suspect

207
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,070
What case ?

208
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,510
Here, July 15 Western Hills reservoir

209
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,770
July 23 Boryeong Sunny Beach Motel

210
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,580
As well as last night's case

211
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,110
In these three cases, the tools for the crime are all knives.

212
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,800
From the point of view of the length and width of the knife

213
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,590
It maybe the same knife
No its the same knife

214
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,300
This is a serial killing case.

215
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,660
This is not the United States

216
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,520
Koreans can't get guns. Every murderer uses a knife to commit crimes.

217
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,580
There are more than 1,000 murders a year

218
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,440
According to your logic, half of the murders are committed by one guy

219
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,590
Are you crazy

220
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,550
What do you think you are mixing cases of other jurisdictions

221
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,780
Will the murderer care about the jurisdiction?

222
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,220
If we don’t catch him as soon as possible, more people will be killed.

223
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,140
He is too careful to kill people indiscriminately

224
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,130
He could attack again  anytime anywhere

225
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,810
You do this job too easy

226
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,770
The is not a case of homemade

227
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,340
You can not just mix them together

228
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,960
No

229
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,110
I am not mixing them together. Look

230
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,240
These cases occurred in the Chungnam area a week ago

231
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,060
Our informants have nothing to gain

232
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,210
This is instinct

233
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,980
To hell with your instinct

234
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,650
Did Your instinct  bring you to the gang in the arcade?

235
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,680
You got so much time ?!

236
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,490
Aren't they criminals?

237
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,310
Gangsters and murderers are the same asshole.

238
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,790
Jung Tae-Seok , what's wrong with you?

239
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,250
Are you so desperate for promotion?

240
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,050
Damn it.

241
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,690
Yeah, that's what I want

242
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,770
When I arrest the killer.

243
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,290
The discussion is over, Come out..

244
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,860
Lets catch the murderer

245
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,370
I am not drunk, I will drive myself.

246
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,450
But Brother

247
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,750
Go back with the brothers

248
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,680
Okay I understand

249
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,760
Yes, Mr. President

250
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,880
Shan-do is a bit reckless but he is a smart man

251
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,230
He won't get into trouble anymore

252
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,980
Yes, Don't worry

253
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,860
Good night

254
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,640
I am sorry

255
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,350
The road is very Slippery

256
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,320
It looks like its okay....... you can go...

257
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,490
what

258
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,200
But after all, I hit you

259
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,870
I'm okay you can go

260
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,000
Are you really all right

261
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,390
Yes, I'm all right

262
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,010
Asshole

263
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,670
hateful

264
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,320
what the..

265
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,930
Who are you ??

266
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,910
come here

267
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,690
Who is there ??

268
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,380
It's not Shan-do

269
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,510
I've Never seen him before

270
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,220
Its Shan-do boss

271
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,720
He is not a gangster

272
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,220
His attack is cold and without feeling

273
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,730
It was different

274
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,110
Who else wants to kill you in our business line ?

275
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,360
Give me that

276
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,610
It was too dark to see clearly
White sedan, License plate 23XX

277
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,890
Anyway try to find it

278
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,450
Be careful

279
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,160
We are friends

280
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,080
Sorry

281
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,520
The patient looks really comfortable.

282
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,880
What happened again ?

283
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,840
I brought you a box of Energy drink

284
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,510
I heard that you were stabbed

285
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,700
I received a call from the  hospital

286
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,390
You must have felt very shameful of it

287
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,910
After all, you're a gangster

288
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,250
Likewise, After all, you are a policeman.

289
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,530
The police too incompetent

290
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,740
So the model citizens are still being hurt.

291
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,320
seriously

292
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,450
Model citizen Jang Dong-Soo

293
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,210
So Tell me what happened last night clearly.

294
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,520
I'll help you catch him

295
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,860
Maybe I can catch him faster

296
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,590
Really ?

297
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,450
Want to bet on it ?

298
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,740
Well bastard

299
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,790
I'll help you catch him

300
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,600
Okay I bet you will...come closer..

301
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,630
Last night I stumbled and got hurt.

302
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,520
Sure, last night.

303
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,270
You have to watch where you step

304
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,170
Where did this unlucky bastard fell on to have so  many stab wounds ??

305
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,160
Jang Dong-Soo car is black Mercedes license plate 3849 right?

306
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,380
Call you later

307
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,340
Bastard

308
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,300
Rear-end

309
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,540
White car

310
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,350
I was right Dong-Soo

311
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,890
what to do with this ??

312
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,780
Are you ok ?

313
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,740
Sit down

314
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,700
No need

315
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,210
I feel so miserable, I can't even look at you.

316
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,880
What will happen next?

317
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,970
The ink is not dry on the contract and you suddenly attacked

318
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,390
what do you want me to do ?

319
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,370
I now have a lots of brother crippled

320
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,850
Pay the hospital bill and give compensation.

321
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,380
And Then hand over the flagship store and those in the province

322
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,030
I'll compensate your brothers properly

323
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,300
Those stores ??

324
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,820
That is what you plan to do ??

325
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,460
Dong-Soo

326
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,500
If I really do

327
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,340
would you be still alive?

328
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,840
Think about it

329
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,990
I am also very curious

330
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,790
Who would do this to you

331
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,890
I am leaving

332
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,380
Really embarrassing

333
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,920
A gangster was stabbed..... if it was me I would rather commit suicide

334
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,410
Trust me and give me two men for this case

335
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,140
I'll close them all at once

336
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,910
Why don't you ask for vacation ?

337
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,810
The staff in this department is not enough.

338
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,670
Why are you trying to clean up the mess of others?

339
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,670
Sir This is a big case

340
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,780
I'll close one and the next will follow.

341
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,740
Like a long train.

342
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,490
Get lost

343
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,140
I have a witness who survived the attack.

344
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,460
Did the witness come to us?

345
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,950
Jang Dong-Soo

346
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,910
What Jang Dong-Soo ??

347
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,850
A few days ago he was stabbed

348
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,060
He did two hours of surgery and barely survived

349
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,210
Listen to what you're saying

350
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,190
come on, Think about it please

351
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,530
What kind of fool will attack a gangster?

352
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,630
The killer is not a gangster.

353
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,180
I'm sure he's a serial killer

354
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,240
Shut up

355
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,690
This is a gang case, I will assign it to the other unit

356
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,290
I'm warning  you not to get involve

357
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,900
Get Out

358
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,190
Save it, don't cover  him

359
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,300
It's not the time now

360
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,240
What ? I cover him ?

361
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,350
What else is it ?

362
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,410
You bastard

363
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,630
Let's say you're right,

364
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,780
But Jang Dong-Soo is a victim.

365
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,680
Will you apply for an arrest warrant on a victim?

366
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,720
Or go directly to arrest him ??

367
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,430
How many crimes did he commit?

368
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,080
We have to catch him and pull him down.

369
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,460
He is searching for the person who stab him

370
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,400
If we don't do anything, he'll kill the murderer

371
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,420
and there will be three open cases.

372
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,240
How will Jang Dong-Soo find him?

373
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,400
He is a gangster, not a policeman.

374
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,350
It’s not a matter of letting his man find someone.

375
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,530
And Jang Dong-Soo...

376
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,440
Saw The murderer's face

377
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,300
Get Out

378
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,880
Your words are unreasonable

379
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,450
Get Out

380
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,900
Why don’t you tell the landlord?

381
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,100
Then what should I do ?

382
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,390
I have to work hard to make money

383
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,310
What ?  birthday ?

384
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,880
Why the are baby's birthday so important?

385
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,800
I'm exhausted

386
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,380
I haven't slept for two days. what baby's birthday are you talking about.

387
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,280
I think its your child's Birthday..

388
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,310
What?

389
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,430
The child you were talking about now.

390
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
show me

391
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,910
Sharp face

392
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,120
Cheeks are thin, chin's quite angular

393
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,910
Straight and long nose

394
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,470
His lips were bigger than his nose.

395
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,560
Quite accurate

396
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,400
You shouldn't have children.

397
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,640
It's not his fault

398
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,160
Find him before the police

399
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,190
Okay  boss

400
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,650
Where are we ??

401
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,540
who are you ?

402
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,150
Thank you for your cooperation

403
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,160
From now, We are seizing the illegal slot machine game room

404
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,640
Everyone should stay in place

405
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,890
Where is the boss ?

406
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,710
Its going down

407
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,650
Oh Really ? wait

408
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,910
Okay.. Continue..

409
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,890
Jang Dong-Soo crafty bastard.. you are quite something..

410
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,960
63 out of 97 machines are tampered with

411
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,090
Should I get an arrest warrant today?

412
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,780
Wait a minute, I'll ask him

413
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,130
So what? Should I obtain an arrest warrant ?

414
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,620
what do you want ?

415
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,200
The one who stabbed you

416
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,850
Tell me everything, I will look for another way.

417
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,960
What if I don't?

418
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,710
Since you bribe my boss, so I'm nothing for you, huh?

419
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,490
Listen Jang Dong-Soo

420
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,240
The one who stabbed you

421
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,870
Is a serial killer

422
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,060
He is a bit strange

423
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,420
He is different from other psychopath

424
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,360
You are a witnesses

425
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,820
What are you talking about ?

426
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,070
Otherwise, why do you think he wants to provoke you?

427
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,750
Most psychopath murder girls

428
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,000
Or people who are weaker than them

429
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,880
But this idiot kills indiscriminately

430
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,630
If we don’t find him as soon as possible, more people will be killed.

431
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,490
What is your problem?

432
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,660
Give me the information and continue your gangster stuff

433
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,080
This is a win-win situation

434
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,250
I'll catch him and bring him to justice

435
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,480
Let him sit in a hole

436
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,980
and then

437
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,970
Nothing. That is the end

438
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,870
that's all

439
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,060
The country's largest luxury casino is built in

440
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,190
the penthouse of this skyscraper

441
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,770
The entire area around our Zeus building

442
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,590
Will become the most popular place in town

443
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,820
Don’t talk nonsense, I heard that this place has been scrapped.

444
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,970
Its annoying

445
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,750
People who are interested before the construction are gone

446
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,770
Investors naturally delay and does not give money

447
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,630
After your accident Weird rumors are spreading .

448
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,820
Chungju area is another problem Boss..

449
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,220
Sang-Do men are entering our territory

450
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,370
Still haven't found him yet?

451
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,290
We found his car on the highway.

452
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,870
His car ?

453
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,210
The car stopped at the rest station for a few days.

454
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,670
My men found it

455
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,960
Where is the car now?

456
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,380
We brought it back

457
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,990
A few days ago there was a murder in Shaintajin

458
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,950
and this

459
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,200
Discarded or lost

460
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,620
They found this 3 kilometers away from the car.

461
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,940
Save it properly

462
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,090
Yes boss

463
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,870
Hello

464
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,450
I'm Jang Dong-Soo

465
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,650
What a surprise

466
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,270
You know the murder in Shintanjin right ?

467
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,780
But why ?

468
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,700
The bastard did it.

469
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,110
what ?

470
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,960
How did you know ?

471
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,500
We found his car there.

472
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,420
I'm the best in my game.

473
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,300
I risked my life to come here.

474
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,370
When someone came and grabbed my ankle

475
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,100
What can I do? I can only cut off his arm.

476
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,910
I can't cut off my ankle

477
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,460
But after the guy destroyed the reputation of a gangster

478
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,250
Disappeared without a trace

479
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,300
Hey

480
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,240
Whoever provoke me, must bear the consequences.

481
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,200
Reputation is everything for a gangster

482
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,790
I'll chop that Bastard

483
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,350
and then set an example for the public

484
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,730
Are you telling a policeman that you want to kill?

485
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,650
We do things for which the law is short.

486
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,990
Will a bad guy catch another bad guy?

487
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,220
No

488
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:01,410
Two bad guys will catch the worst person

489
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,920
This is the Bastard car keys

490
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,720
Don't you treat me as a policeman?

491
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,830
I can arrest you right away.

492
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,580
You cannot..Because..

493
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:25,350
You want to catch him more than I do.

494
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,410
I'll give you guys and I will take care of the expenses.

495
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,030
We will Share the Information

496
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,060
help each other

497
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,750
And at the end?

498
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,150
Divide him into two halves?

499
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,520
Whoever catches him will have him

500
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,510
So if I catch him first, it will be by law,

501
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,240
If you catch him than you bury him

502
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,010
If you have so much confidence, then......

503
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,050
Okay.. Call

504
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,490
You will regret this

505
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,330
This guy is quite handsome

506
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,120
how old is he ?

507
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,310
About 35-year-old

508
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,060
I can not see properly due to the rain and darkness

509
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,590
Use this to keep in touch

510
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,910
The gang and the police teamed up to catch the devil

511
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,780
This is exciting

512
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,630
The gang and the police teamed up to catch the devil

513
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,590
This is exciting

514
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,200
This Bastard

515
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,490
I'm in the same boat with you, I have to protect myself

516
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,270
We can't draft a contract again.

517
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,590
You bought a High tech and you recorded me?

518
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,760
..S..h..i..t...

519
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,040
This villain wants to use his brain

520
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,940
That's why I can't trust the cops.

521
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,730
I was too indulgent with you

522
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,250
Listen bastard

523
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,920
Once this is over, I will Beat you up..you bastard

524
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,280
He also stabbed Jang Dong-Soo

525
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,390
Then he committed a murder in Shintan. What does it mean?

526
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,480
If we act according to my way

527
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,790
We can solve 5 cases in one  swoop.

528
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,650
About 35-year-old male of average height

529
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,650
From his mode of crime, he only kills at night.

530
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,220
Not affected by location and only use one knife

531
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,030
This is one of the two knives

532
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,890
Stick to the knife or the face to catch the murderer

533
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,020
So far there are no other clues

534
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,570
I made a deal with the police

535
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,550
We will catch him

536
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,610
Of course, we will not tell the Secretary

537
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,390
How can we trust the police ?

538
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,120
How can we believe the gangs ?

539
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,510
Who believe ?

540
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:50,140
We need manpower to catch the murderer

541
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,540
This is not a case  we can handle Ourselves

542
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,080
Let’s tell the Secretary.

543
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,400
And then what?

544
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,110
The squad will intervene

545
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,550
Media will get  involved and take away all the honors

546
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,990
Not only that, the Secretary is protecting Jang Dong-Soo

547
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,590
This is the only way to solve the case

548
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:09,540
The Secretary is a mess

549
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,540
Jang Dong-Soo have seen his face , his car.

550
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,460
Only his portrait painting is not enough

551
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,750
We need his fingerprints and DNA.

552
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,960
We'll use gangsters to find the killer

553
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:23,070
and then we catch them.

554
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,930
I will use them first and then throw them away.

555
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,670
We are also citizens paying taxes

556
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,650
Let's use police help once

557
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,870
From the outside it looks like an abandoned warehouse,

558
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,930
But tens of thousands of gaming machines are manufactured here

559
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,750
And Then sent to all parts of the country

560
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:56,960
..son of a bitch..

561
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,180
We'll find some clues

562
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,930
Maybe  his hair, his fingerprint, or even his breath.

563
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,680
we must find something

564
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,750
We'll search every inch of the place

565
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,460
let's start

566
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,500
Leave all the dirty work  to Jang Dong-Soo

567
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,490
and let's go through all the cases again.

568
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,930
This is a security cameras record  from the murder in Shintanjin

569
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,240
His mode of operands is

570
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,700
that so far in all the cases of the murders he used a car.

571
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,310
He's always on the move, so it's harder to catch him.

572
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:41,690
We know about 4 open cases, but there must be more.

573
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,300
Don't forget to look at them from the perspective of a serial killer.

574
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,170
If you find any information, report it to me.

575
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,010
He is a ticking time bomb

576
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,910
It can appear anywhere. Go through the cases from other areas.

577
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,810
And don't be too noticeable

578
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,810
Okay ?

579
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,290
Okay

580
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,260
When we close the case, we'll catch those gangsters too.

581
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,280
Nice and clean.

582
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,720
Ultimately its up to us to catch this murderer

583
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,560
Before that, let's get rid of Shan-do

584
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,090
Bastard

585
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,350
Are you crazy ??

586
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,500
What are you doing here ??

587
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,080
What the hell do you think?

588
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,690
I'm waiting for you

589
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,050
I think you hurt my back

590
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,020
You should not scare me

591
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,490
I was shocked

592
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,640
I want to drink too

593
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,430
So Refreshing

594
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:42,850
Can you look at this ?

595
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,100
Its urgent

596
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,400
what is this ?

597
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,690
It is nothing special

598
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,920
I found some hair and blood

599
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,220
Help me find out who it is.

600
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,530
Jung Tae-Seok

601
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,620
What's wrong ?? It's not like you..

602
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,600
what happened ?

603
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,000
This is a dirty world

604
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,080
I want help too..

605
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,830
Right, It's a dirty world.

606
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,940
This murderer is very strange

607
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,060
He left the weapon to to be found

608
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,050
Murder and police disappearances at sea

609
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,820
Crying over spilled milk

610
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,780
Now a gangster boss is dead

611
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,160
What would you do ?

612
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,580
What would you do ?

613
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,400
If you have a mouth, Speak up.

614
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,400
Jang Dong-Soo case was handed over to the second team.

615
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,860
They will investigate

616
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,050
What are you doing ?

617
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,840
Don't stare at the computer.

618
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,010
Get Out

619
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:01,910
what are you still doing ?..Go out right away

620
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,500
Go out and Look for evidence to solve the case

621
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:11,770
At least pretend to care

622
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:12,710
Hurry

623
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,030
Well yes

624
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:14,820
Hey!

625
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,630
You want to die

626
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:17,490
what happened ?

627
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,010
This stuff is nothing special about it

628
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,970
I just got the results

629
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,640
I don't believe this

630
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,450
Come on tell me fast what is it ?

631
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,080
The DNA was identified as the last victims of the Chungnam murders.

632
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:29,690
Really ??

633
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,190
There are other people do

634
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,360
Was there any other in addition to that ?

635
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:36,070
No

636
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,780
It does not make any sense.

637
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,280
Did you check it properly?

638
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,410
There was no other DNA.

639
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,140
But that is not the problem

640
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,950
Something strange happened.

641
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,850
wait wait

642
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:49,500
go on

643
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,190
On the murder weapon that killed Heo Sang-Do

644
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,240
Heo Sang-Do DNA Truck drivers and Dog owner DNA were found

645
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,720
what ?

646
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,010
All this is done by one person.

647
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,010
This will be officially classified as a serial killer

648
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,250
I have to go

649
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,580
Jang Dong-Soo... is it you ?

650
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,920
It's you

651
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,920
brother. I call you back later

652
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,340
Answer me bastard

653
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,410
Are you crazy ?

654
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,120
Your idiot is back.

655
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,060
Here is here at home

656
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,120
Who else like that?

657
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,420
Let's talk later

658
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:58,920
A policeman and a gangster This is what you are doing

659
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,410
You're not a cop ?

660
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,310
Tell me bastard

661
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,640
You killed Heo Sang-Do right ?

662
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,130
Yes..I killed him

663
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,850
Its my fault believing a gangster

664
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,000
You believed in me

665
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,690
Even a fool would laugh at it.

666
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,020
Nothing has changed

667
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,460
We'll catch him together

668
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,690
do you understand ?

669
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,300
you

670
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,280
After this is all over

671
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:50,430
I'll investigate you nicely

672
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,460
Any time you want , asshole.

673
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,630
Since July this year, there has been murder in this region

674
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,410
It has been confirmed as a serial killer

675
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:12,180
The cases have been transferred to the police Crime Unit and the Cheonan police joint investigation

676
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,730
So that these cases are no longer stagnant

677
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:19,210
The murder case is handled by the regional police stations

678
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:22,220
But through a centralized investigation

679
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:27,930
There is new hope in solving the case

680
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:32,200
I hope this ordeal will end and let the residents return to a peaceful life.

681
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,140
Let's connect to the reporter on the spot

682
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,540
You come early

683
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:37,840
Dong-Chul

684
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,530
I was outside the hotel of the murder that took place on September 3rd.

685
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:47,090
It is said that the victim of this murder is Heo Sang-Do

686
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,510
This person is the leader of a violent gang in the Chungnam area.

687
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,560
It is said that he was involved in a dispute over.....

688
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:58,020
If you have given  the case to us from the start then

689
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,500
nothing would have develop to this point

690
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,940
Murder is not a child's play

691
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,590
You guys just destroy the investigation

692
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,220
Still say something nice to others here.

693
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:13,730
Bastard.. Do you have any problem?

694
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,080
Am I wrong ?

695
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,120
Bastard ?

696
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,170
I have a problem, you bastard!

697
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,300
Come here

698
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:31,760
In Heo Sang-Do murder scene a knife was found

699
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:36,210
There are other victims of DNA

700
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,880
The Ministry of Public Security has set up a special task force to investigate the case of Heo Sang-Do

701
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,550
And all the murders that have been committed may have been done by the same person

702
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,760
that's not done by me

703
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:53,200
The Task Force consist of the Regional Crime Unit and homicide team

704
00:53:53,330 --> 00:54:00,060
As well as the country's best  serial killer profilers

705
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,270
Will conduct a thorough investigation

706
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,320
There is also the help of a forensic doctor.

707
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,010
The police also expect a large number of gangs to attend Heo Sang-Do's funeral.

708
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,290
So they will be vigilant

709
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,130
I am surprised to see you here.

710
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,220
I will certainly come. He is my friend.

711
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:19,460
hello

712
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,020
come immediate now

713
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,690
Why should I ?

714
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,790
To clean up your mess. come fast

715
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:41,100
who are you ??

716
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:00,100
Someone used my knife to kill Heo Sang-Do

717
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,160
If you want to kill him yourself, you better find something.

718
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,350
If the Crime squad first catches him, you and I will be finished.

719
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,010
Is this how you spend your life?

720
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,380
I really sympathize with you poor police

721
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,600
So Don't commit any crime you idiot

722
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,180
If there is no one like me, you will be unemployed.

723
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,000
That is life, there are prey, there are predators.

724
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:28,350
of course.. There are also victims of stabbing

725
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,420
He attacked me from behind, I am unprepared

726
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,340
But I still stabbed him with his knife.

727
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,380
stop

728
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,490
what is it ??

729
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,340
You stabbed him right ??

730
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,090
Yes.. why ??

731
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:40,120
I seem to find something

732
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,320
what is this ??

733
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,630
Bastard

734
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,930
Jang Dong-Soo what  is going on ??

735
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,240
What is going on ??

736
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,590
A group of bastard

737
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,710
get out

738
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,220
bastard

739
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,200
Hey... hey... hey

740
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,690
Bastard

741
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:44,990
Its over.. stop

742
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,140
You go away fast.. I'll take care of it.

743
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,430
it's OKay

744
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,390
He is bleeding a lot

745
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,920
It's just blood

746
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,110
Go away fast..Bastard

747
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:16,370
The police claimed that there is sufficient evidence to arrest the perpetrators of the killing Heo Sang-Do

748
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,130
and that catching a killer is just a matter of time.

749
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:26,220
The suspect’s fixed killing method and his active area are...

750
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:33,470
Honey.. where are you ?

751
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:12,060
when there's such a mess, you are taking a nap.

752
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,980
What's with his face?

753
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:17,580
Wake up fool

754
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:22,270
What have you been doing ??

755
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:24,670
Bastard

756
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,740
Where are you going ??

757
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:30,640
Here..Take this

758
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,680
This is a case of abduction

759
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:34,080
Soon-Hois  already there, better go fast.

760
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:37,460
Kidnapping? Why is it so important now?

761
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:39,670
We have a serial killer to catch

762
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:40,900
This Bastard is at it again..

763
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:50,570
Can't you see the Crime Unit in the office  ??

764
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,310
They are working with a team, so deal with this kidnapping case.

765
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:01,690
I told you from the beginning that this is a serial killer.

766
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:05,480
Now a team of Crime Unit ?

767
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:07,550
What the hell do they know?

768
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,610
What the hell do they know?

769
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,640
Hey Bastard

770
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,200
What do you just say ?

771
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,410
Shut up

772
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:22,290
You did say it was a serial killer, but there was no evidence

773
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,210
Did you have any evidence or witness at that time?

774
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,920
If you are so powerful, why is he not in prison now? Bastard

775
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,450
shit

776
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:43,830
The victim is a venture capitalist

777
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:49,570
Brother

778
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,370
The attacker should be close to him. Hurry up and investigate.

779
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:01,190
By any chance Did you provoke Jang Dong-Soo?

780
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,000
What is wrong with you  face?

781
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:05,810
Certainly Something happened

782
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:09,550
Enough talk

783
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:13,970
Get infomation from your colleagues  about the woman's situation

784
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,450
How many times has it been?

785
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:20,040
Why have you been changing the meeting place?

786
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,080
Is he Really alive?

787
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,310
If you want money, let him answer the phone.

788
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:30,920
This is the last time come at Wal-Mung-du snack shop

789
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:32,300
Right now

790
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,980
What are you doing ? go inside.. please

791
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:45,750
Are you coming here to drop the bag?

792
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:45,880
Ah yes

793
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,400

794
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:52,380
what ? Why did she give the bag to the woman

795
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,350
Damn

796
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:02,560
Are you telling the world that you are working with the cops.

797
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,340
Who is on the roof?

798
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,450
He is on the roof

799
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:16,970
Dong-Chul he went to the north

800
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:17,780
Where ? where ?

801
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,620
Bae...lure him on the main road

802
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,350
Hey

01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,420
What are you doing?

804
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:27,880
Soon-Ho intercept him from the side

805
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,610

806
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,500
I cannot see him..I cannot see him

807
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,280
He is on  the Main Street

808
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:36,610
Bae...where are you Bastard ?

809
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,370
Stop there

810
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:47,480

01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:57,890
Quickly....Quickly

813
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:02,180
I do not see him here

814
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,430
He is fast... where did he went ?

815
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,960

816

01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,040
He is here

818
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,110
He just turned in the corner...blocked him from the front.

819
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:17,200
Which way does he go?

820
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,080
Over there..Over there

821
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,430
Go that way

822
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:39,490
Why are you holding the bag maam? You don’t know what is inside.

823
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,310
Why did you Yell at me?? what I did wrong ??

824
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,600
I was asked to take it

825
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,790
So Who is it ?

826
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:50,730
Tell us  fast otherwise you have to go to jail

827
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,560
I've never seen him before

828
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:56,320
He was eating alone and he asked me to take the bag.

829
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,880
He gave me $ 20

830
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,430
how does he look like

831
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:11,630
Just... He Looks very ordinary

832
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,940
Did he only eat ??

833
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,530
Ah.. he also drank a bottle of Soju

834
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:17,380
Chamisul brand

835
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,530
Where in the Soju bottle ?

836
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:25,330
Only the labels are different,

837
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,980
All bottles are the same.

838
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,640
I wish you have fun

839
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,790
Damn label

840
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:38,240
hey Dong-chul ?

841
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:38,780
Yes

842
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:40,200
Only Chamisul brand....

843
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,970
Find only Chamisul brand

844
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:43,320
I don't believe this

845
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,640
The bottles are the same

846
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,120
Don't work too hard

847
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:51,870
Are you serious ?

848
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,800
So what about the steering wheel cover ??

849
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,030
The results will not be available today.

850
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:06,060
So I charge $ 2000 per machine

851
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:07,830
Thank you

852
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,020
I will provide you with technical support if you need it.

853
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,060
That's not very cheap, Jang Dong-Soo

854
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,420
If Jang Dong-Soo fulfills his part

855
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,110
we'll all be happy, right?

856
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,570
I do not know whether I should accept such a bargain,

857
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,450
knowing how Heo Sang-Do ended up.

858
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:28,580
Be careful everyone

859
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:31,560
After Jang Dong-Soo was stabbed,  Heo Sang-Do was killed

860
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:34,460
His assistant also disappeared.

861
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,710
Stop it and continue with your food

862
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:03,260
What are you doing here ??

863
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:06,800
Find this person first

864
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:11,020
We found a strange fingerprint

865
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,910
It wasn't completely damaged

866
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:16,020
He could have completely erase it

867
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,310
I only identified him with a bad print he left

868
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:19,860
His whereabouts are unknown

869
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,940
His blood sample was also found on the steering wheel cover

870
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:27,180
He didn't come back for about 3 months

871
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,430
Did he say where he was going?

872
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,910
If he goes to work, he will go for one month.

873
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:33,870
This time he went for a long time.

874
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,330
I reported this incident, I thought that something had happened to him..

875
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:37,810
Were there any problems with him?

876
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,150
There is no problem at all

877
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,780
The rent is always paid on time

878
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:43,780
And he doesn't even drink.

879
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:46,570
He is a faithful Christian

880
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,660
He lives an orderly life, he's a good man.

881
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,090
We found a strange fingerprints

882
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:23,380
It wasn't completely damaged

883
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,800
He could have completely erase it

884
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:03,270
017-684-2784

885
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:05,610
Find all the information for this number

886
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,220
Do you have a recording of the kidnapper's voice?

887
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,610
Sent it directly to me right away

888
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,870
I heard that you spent a lot of money on his funeral

889
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:20,790
You're a loyal friend

890
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:23,250
Do me the same favor. okay ?

891
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:32,000
I told you to eat and stop taking, isn't it?

892
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:36,350
Why did you ruin this delicious lunch?

893
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,290
For your benefit, I am careful everywhere.

894
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,610
Eat your meal

895
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:51,800

01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:56,450

901
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,340
The road is very Slippery

902
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,390
But after all, I hit you

903
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:24,540
Kang Kyung-Ho..Age 35-year-old

904
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,550
His Father was abusing him, so he grew up in an orphanage.

905
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:29,860
No criminal record

906
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,570
He Call his 70-year-old mother every day

907
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:34,200
They Both use  disposable cell phone

908
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:37,790
Until August he called her only from Chungchong

909
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:41,850
But then he called from all over the country.

910
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:46,230
We tracked his phone call mainly from Anshan City.

911
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,630
But mostly from the region

912
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,420
Dekjung?

913
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,150
Yes

914
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,840
There are several universities there.

915
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:55,090
So there are  lots of cheap rooms and apartments

916
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,850
There are thousands of old houses

917
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,270

918
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,700

920
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:06,860

921
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,400
Where is your manners?

922
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,250
Jang Dong-Soo

923
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:10,730

930
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:44,140
If we do not catch him

931
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,310
We are all finished, don’t you know?

932
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,380
If we are in the same boat

933
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,300
In any case, we have to tide over the difficulties.

934
01:13:57,970 --> 01:13:59,140
Let's  just go

935
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,410
Do you have photos?

Yes

940
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,550
Be unobtrusive

941
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,140
and when you see someone who is similar to him,

942
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:42,620
Immediately Call one of us right away.

943
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,290
Create teams of 5 pairs

944
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:48,960
The person in charge of each group should report once every 8 hours 3 times a day.

945
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,790

01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:47,240
I have oil in my cup.

1007
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:50,680
Hey uh-dha-roo sing us a song, the mood is not very good.

1008
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,540

Turn that up

1014
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:10,030
A High school girl, while returning home alone,on the way

1015
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,950
She was murdered

1016
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:16,290
Because of her very young age,

1017
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,900
The police ruled out the possibility of revenge or retaliation

1018
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:25,420
And pointed out that the motive could be sexual assault or murder

1019
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,300
Oh-Sung....

1020
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:27,740

01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:09,910
No

1139
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:13,060
You convince the world that he was the murderer but now..

1140
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:14,830
There is no evidence ?

1141
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:17,690
Our evidence is circumstantial evidence

1142
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:20,210
There is no concrete evidence that he killed these people

1143
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:21,380
Even if I am a judge

1144
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,380
I Won't be able to sentence him to death

1145
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:29,620
what is this ??

1146
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:30,510
This is a knife

1147
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:34,440
The knife that you kill the people with ?
killer's knife

1148
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,630
What is your outlook on life?

1149
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:42,190
No matter what I think, I can't understand you
Do you know why ??

1150
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:45,720
Because you are not a person

1151
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,550
What is your outlook on life ??

1152
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:52,620
A good cop, or a model citizen?

1153
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,370
You can't answer me right ?

1154
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:58,810
Who will abide by aoutlook on life?

1155
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:02,860
We are alive because we have done So..

1156
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:07,780
I wore gloves when I first murder

1157
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,030
But they have been slipping and not moving as I thought.

1158
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,410
You have to stab him in one go

1159
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:16,920
The feeling of piercing

1160
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:19,630
You can feel it from your fingertips

1161
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:21,790
like this don't you think ??

1162
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:25,920
And these photos

1163
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:38,440
what ??

1164
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:41,540
The order is completely wrong

1165
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,340
Is there any evidence to proof that I did it?

1166
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:53,390
Even if I received the death penalty

1167
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:56,040
you know I won't die.

1168
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,140
Go to hell

1169
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,060
I'm going to kill you

1170
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,000
I'm gonna kill him..leave me alone

1171
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:12,740
If you get the death penalty without proof

1172
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,310
That is murder

1173
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:21,560
The real devils are the ones
who commit crimes with a kind face.

1174
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:24,880
Think about it as the creator and executor of  law

1175
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:27,260
Do you really have this right?

1176
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,320
If you're innocent

1177
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,100
Then I'm innocent too

1178
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:45,960
You said you don't know this knife right ?

1179
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:49,610
Yes I don't know

1180
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:56,060
This knife killed 5 victims between July and September 2005.

1181
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,560
Objection Your Honor

1182
01:36:57,930 --> 01:37:00,870
The prosecution did not provide any evidence in this trial.

1183
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:03,560
and there is no specific connection between the knife and my client.

1184
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,380
So we cannot assume that the knife belonged to him.

1185
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,250
Yes, you are right

1186
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,950
This knife has nothing to do with the defendant

1187
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,180
At least until now.

1188
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,680
Your Honor, we would like to summon a witness

1189
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:24,170
who is the only survivor under Kang Kyung-Ho sinful knife.
who defended himself and survive the attack of  Kang Kyung-Ho

1190
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:25,960
Witness, please step forward.

1191
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:56,450
You still have the courage to appear in front of me asshole

1192
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:58,680
Damn you look terrible.

1193
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:06,040
We  are paying  taxes to let you arrest and kill those shit

1194
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,400
This is the law

1195
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:12,470
Arrests Bad people and punishes them

1196
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,570
It also protects us because of that.

1197
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:19,100
Shut the fuck up you should have let me kill him!

1198
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,630
You're my last resort.

1199
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:29,380
Let us kill him with the law

1200
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:34,470
what did you say ??

1201
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:43,310
Surrender yourself

1202
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:46,480
Are you crazy ??

1203
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:51,730
You killed Heo Sang-Do right ??

1204
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:53,030
Yes I killed him

1205
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:55,820
Yes I killed him

1206
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,030
Asshole

1207
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,890
If it gets out we're both dead.

1208
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:04,540
Don't make me use this..

1209
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:07,650
Give up and come forward as a witness.

1210
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:09,540
You're the only witness

1211
01:39:09,770 --> 01:39:13,820
With you on the witness stand
I'll link him with all the murders.

1212
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,450
Let's just die together

1213
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:22,930
I swear to the Almighty God, to speak  the truth.

1214
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:26,790
The truth and the only truth

1215
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:32,020
Your Honor

1216
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:37,030
The witness of the prosecution is a wanted gang leader.

1217
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:39,720
Charged with several serious crimes

1218
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,970
He is a suspect in other cases

1219
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:45,080
It Does not affect his testimony in court

1220
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:46,080
I agree

1221
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:47,620
witness

1222
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:52,840
How do you prove that the person who stabbed you is the defendant??

1223
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:03,560
People like me who are often stabbed

1224
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:07,710
will not forget the face of the person who stabbed him
until he ends up in the underground.

1225
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:11,250
That is the  bastard who  stabbed me

1226
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:16,900
After I was stabbed

1227
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:19,910
I immediately found someone to draw this sketch.

1228
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:28,060
Your Honor, the portrait is just a simple drawing of Kang Kyung-Ho

1229
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:32,310
It has no substantive and scientific value as evidence..

1230
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:32,900
Your Honor

1231
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,530
This is the witness's ward record

1232
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:40,320
Just after the attack

1233
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,450
Witness is a gang boss

1234
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:45,490
who always stabbed while fighting during his Normal Business

1235
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,180
we don't know whether He is being treated
for being stabbed by someone else

1236
01:40:50,770 --> 01:40:53,610
He violated the rights of the defendant and slandered the authority of the law.

1237
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,300
Asshole you talk too much..

1238
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,260
Hey, lawyer.

1239
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:57,690
witness

1240
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:00,240
If your family is killed in the same way

1241
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,930
would you speak the same?

1242
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:03,910
Rights of the accused?

1243
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:05,890
How can he deserve to have rights?

1244
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:09,330
The asshole killed people for pleasure

1245
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:13,150
I am also a bad person, but he shouldn't be alive..

1246
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:14,840
Evidence ??

1247
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,420
I will show you

1248
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:33,060
That night, he bumped into my car and forced me to get off the car

1249
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:36,110
Suddenly He stabbed me twice in the side,

1250
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:39,650
After a struggle he stabbed me in the chest

1251
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,180
I tried to grab this bastard knife by hand
and got my hand cut..see...

1252
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,470
If I am an ordinary person, I would have died on the spot.

1253
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,020
And Take off his clothes

1254
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:53,810
I stabbed him in the left chest

1255
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:55,810
He should have a wound there

1256
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:06,430
And look at his hands,
you will find lots of scars.

1257
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:10,500
Those who use the knife,
they have small cuts from stabbing

1258
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,870
And damage fingernails

1259
01:42:13,410 --> 01:42:15,480
And lastly

1260
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:20,570
That bastard wrote this

1261
01:42:23,130 --> 01:42:25,280
Analyze his handwriting
and you will find that it's a match

1262
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:28,780
Heo Sang-Do is my friend

1263
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,890
Heo Sang-Do and his assistant died

1264
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:37,380
Although I feel sorry for Killing him

1265
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:39,570
But if Kang Kyung-Ho shakes everything..

1266
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:42,210
We can accused everything to him

1267
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:55,500
The Defendant has an extreme tendency to violence

1268
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:58,040
deliberate disrespect for human life

1269
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:00,590
and  for the pain

1270
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:02,760
that the victims had to endure

1271
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:08,050
All these Factor will be Taken into account while giving the  judgment

1272
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,930
Therefore, the defendant Kang Kyung-Ho

1273
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:16,600
Is Sentenced to death

1274
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:27,240
Thank you sir

1275
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:28,780
Turn back

1276
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:31,810
Salute

1277
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:52,990
Boss is coming, let's greet him

1278
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:55,500
Good afternoon Boss

1279
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:56,850
I have one condition

1280
01:44:57,790 --> 01:44:58,450
Say it

1281
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:01,670
Promise that you'll put me in the same prison with him

1282
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,820
We played this game with the lives of people.

1283
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:32,160
We have to end it

1284
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:45,900
The Gangster
The cop
The Devil
