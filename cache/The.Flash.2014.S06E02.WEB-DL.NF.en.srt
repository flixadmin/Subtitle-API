- Actually...

807
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,840
I've got one more piece
to add to the bunch.

808
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,176
From a very daring
young talent.

809
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,140
I think it ties the room
together quite nicely.

810
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,808
- [chuckles]

811
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,685
- Well, there's no accounting
for taste.

812
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,063
- You know,
my mom dated an artist once.

813
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,690
He was a trapeze artist,
though.

814
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,608
No-Net Nick, they called him.

and three bedtime songs...

818
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,372
but little Jenna
is finally asleep.

819
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,582
- She is persistent.

820
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,126
- She gets that
from her mother.

821
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:56,339
Look,
you stood up for Allegra...

822
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,300
when nobody else did,
including myself.

823
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,055
- Well, you are the badass
that charged

a light-wielding hit woman

825
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,017
in order to save
all of our butts.

830
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,531
I just keep thinking.

831
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,117
I'm not doing everything I can
to help the city

832
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,079
as the district attorney.

833
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,541
The justice system doesn't
always work for metas...

834
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,168
which is why I want to become

835
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,336
a defense attorney
for meta-humans.

836
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,464
I know. I know.
You can tell me that I'm crazy,

837
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,927
and we were not on the same
page about Allegra today...

838
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,262
- No, no, no, that's not crazy.

839
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,931
That is incredible.
- Really?

840
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,224
- Babe, do you know
how many people

841
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,059
you could help
in this city?

842
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,143
- Yeah.

843
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,231
And I know right
where I want to start.

- Um, hi.

846
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,487
I'm looking
for Iris West-Allen.

847
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,490
I'm here about the internship.

848
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,118
- Hi, yeah, Cecile Horton
told me to expect you.

849
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,536
Welcome to "The Citizen."

850
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,496
- Just don't touch
the vegan doughnuts.

right over there.

<i>- So what now?</i>

853
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,972
- We'll keep scanning
the Multiverse

854
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,348
for antimatter
from my lab, okay?

855
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,059
But I think, for now,
we should get going.

856
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,769
- Yes, we should.

857
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,439
Ah, the intrepid reporter.
[chuckles]

858
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,108
I thought you had a story
to put out.

859
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,652
- Well, I couldn't let you
leave without saying good-bye.

860
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,737
And I know it hasn't been under
the best of circumstances,

861
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,864
but I hope we will
see you guys again.

862
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,075
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

863
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,285
- Till next time, Flash.

864
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,410
- Yeah.

865
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,877
- It was a pleasure
to meet you, Barry Allen.

866
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,507
You keep being the hero
we know you are.

867
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,591
- I will.

868
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,219
- You ready?

869
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,470
- Yes.

870
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,234
- I know she's not
your mom, but...

871
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:24,612
- Still nice to have a little
hope on a not-so-great day.

872
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,697
- Yeah.

873
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,160
- I'm sorry about earlier.

874
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,537
- Don't be.

875
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:36,333
You were in pain
and shock, and...

876
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,917
I was scared too.

877
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,712
But seeing you at CCPD,

878
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,796
fighting with your all,

879
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,590
it reminded me that...

880
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,719
no matter what
this Crisis brings...

881
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,429
no matter what you choose...

882
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,473
I know that you're never
gonna give up.

883
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,811
- I'm not choosing to die.

884
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,107
I could never make the choice
to leave you.

885
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,902
But...

886
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,154
if my death is...

887
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,031
the only way
to save the universe,

888
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,490
to save you...

889
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,411
I'm willing to do that.

890
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:17,540
- Then...

891
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,709
whatever we do next,
let's make it count.

892
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:25,715
- We can start by preparing
the team for this Crisis.

893
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,553
Maybe even a world
without the Flash.

894
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,099
- So what do we tell them?

895
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,983
- Beginning biopsy examination
on Patient 1-A,

896
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,319
Mitch Romero,
male, 40s.

897
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,531
It is my hope
that this procedure

898
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,327
will help to illuminate
the effects of my cure...

899
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,371
when exposed
to another subject.

900
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,876
The body presents no obvious
signs of hemorrhaging.

901
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,170
But it appears
the victim's blood...

902
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,884
Has coagulated
with an unidentifiable

903
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,719
biological substance.

904
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,806
Will run analysis
on substance.

905
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,017
Substance could
have been absorbed

906
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,228
into victim's veins
prior to death.
