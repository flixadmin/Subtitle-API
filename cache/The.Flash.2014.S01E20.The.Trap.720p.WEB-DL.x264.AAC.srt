<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,539
<i>When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed</i>

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,540
<i>by something impossible.</i>

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,042
Run, Barry, run!

6
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,878
<i>My father went to prison
for her murder.</i>

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,815
<i>Then an accident made me
the impossible.</i>

8
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,418
<i>To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,488
<i>but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime</i>

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,189
<i>and find others like me.</i>

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,525
<i>And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...</i>

12
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,826
Mom!

13
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,061
<i>And get justice for my father.</i>

14
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:31,864
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

15
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,565
Previously on <i>the Flash...</i>

16
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,100
the night we trapped
the Reverse-Flash

17
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,735
In the force field,
there's no reason

18
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,570
That the containment system
should have failed.

19
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,272
- I've been having these dreams.
- What happens in the dream?

20
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,207
Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash,

21
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,376
And he kills me.

22
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,412
If this is Dr. Wells,

23
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,414
Then who have we been working
for this whole time?

24
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,616
A completely different person.

25
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:51,850
Oh, my god.

26
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,752
What the frack?

27
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,626
"Flash missing.
Vanishes in crisis."

28
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,195
"After an epic street battle
with the Reverse-Flash,

29
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,131
"our city's
very own scarlet speedster

30
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:10,035
disappeared in an explosion
of light."

31
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,004
Barry, look at the date.

32
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:16,642
April 25th, 2024.

33
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:20,045
Guys, when I fought
the Reverse-Flash at Christmas,

34
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,448
He said that we'd be fighting
for centuries.

35
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,019
Wait, you can't really think
that this is from...

36
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,621
The future.

37
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:32,891
That would mean Dr. Wells,
or whoever he is, is also...

38
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,693
From the future.

39
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,962
I have to say,
I'm really digging

40
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,664
the brighter red suit.

41
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,199
And the white on the symbol?

42
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,467
That's dope.

43
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,901
Wait a second.

44
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,003
Suppose we now change
the color on your suit.

45
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,906
Will it be because we got
the idea from this picture?

46
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,142
That would mean
we're living in a causal nexus.

47
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,376
This... wow.

48
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,678
This is so trippy.

49
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,881
Like, Marty and the Polaroid
trippy.

50
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:59,585
Not as trippy as the name
on the byline.

51
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:03,987
Iris West-Allen?

52
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,491
Mazel tov?

53
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:06,492
Hebrew.

54
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:09,094
Ancient language
of the Jewish people.

55
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,430
Uh-uh.
What the hell was that?

56
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:14,266
Is someone here?

57
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,801
Hello?

58
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,804
Good evening, Barry Allen.

59
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,273
Uh...

60
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,609
H-hi.

61
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,511
- You know who I am?
- Of course.

62
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,080
Barry Allen,
director of Central City police,

63
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,414
CSI division.

64
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,649
Director?

65
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,284
I guess you get a promotion.

66
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,186
Also known as the Flash.

67
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,187
Founding member of...

68
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,188
What are you?

69
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,623
I am Gideon,

70
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,358
An interactive
artificial consciousness.

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,793
AI.

72
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,997
Sick.

73
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,466
You know Dr. Wells?

74
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:51,336
Yes.

75
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,472
Do you know who he really is?

76
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,340
I don't understand the question.

77
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,709
I... I mean,
what is he doing here?

78
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,780
W-why did he come here?

79
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,881
To kill you.

80
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,058
Wells is in the building.

81
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,459
What?
How do you know that?

82
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,094
I put a tracker
on his wheelchair.

83
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,697
Which, if we're wrong about him
and he is paralyzed,

84
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,932
I'm going to hell
for that one.

85
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,404
He's in the cortex.

86
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,206
Ask questions fast.

87
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,607
Why did he kill Nora Allen?

88
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,741
Because he was angry.

89
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,976
About what?

90
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,244
That you escaped.

91
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,448
He's on B level.
He's coming this way.

92
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,116
What does he want from me?

93
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,619
For you to be the Flash.

94
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,720
Maybe that's why Wells let

95
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,121
The particle accelerator
explode,

96
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,791
So that you could become
the Flash.

97
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,659
Why?
I mean, for what reason?

98
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,394
Guys, we got to go.
He's almost here.

99
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,662
- Hurry.
- All right.

100
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,898
Wait a second.
Wait.

101
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,767
What if Hal over there tells
Wells that we were in here?

102
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,169
That would be bad.

103
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,438
If I can get into
its operating system,

104
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,907
Maybe I can disable
its memory core.

105
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,011
Gideon, can you show us where
your operating system is?

106
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,646
Certainly.

107
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,085
Yeah.
Nope.

108
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,353
That's not gonna happen.

109
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,854
Guys, he's in the corridor.

110
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,356
Gideon, could you just, like,

111
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,092
not tell him that we were here?

112
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,660
Of course.

113
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:22,894
I will accept any command
given to me by you.

114
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,496
- Barry.
- Come on.

115
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,864
- We got to get out of here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

116
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,500
Why would you accept
my commands?

117
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,435
Because you created me.

118
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,127
Good evening, Gideon.

119
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,561
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

120
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,096
Is everything all right?

121
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,866
Everything is fine.

122
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,808
Eddie.

123
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,943
- Thank you.
- What's the emergency?

124
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,146
Oh, no emergency.

125
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,848
I just wanted to,
you know, talk to you...

126
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,849
Thanks.

127
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:18,950
Without Iris around

128
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,652
Or Barry around

129
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,189
Or Cisco around
or Caitlin around.

130
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:27,659
So, in other words,
you want to talk to me alone.

131
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,362
What is it?

132
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,863
Right.

133
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,166
Um, so listen.

134
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,234
With everything going on...

135
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,338
Investigating Wells
and finding out about Barry...

136
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,239
Eddie, you cannot tell Iris
about Barry.

137
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:45,310
This isn't about Barry.

138
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,146
I know the timing
might seem off, you know,

139
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,249
With everything
that's going on,

140
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:55,220
But I want to propose to Iris,

141
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,290
And I'd like your blessing.

142
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,832
No.

143
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,167
Come again?

144
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,436
No.

145
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,804
You do not have my blessing.

146
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,843
That's Barry.
We got to go.

147
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,411
Joe, I only asked
as a courtesy,

148
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,413
out of respect.

149
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,415
I don't need your permission.

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,620
Really?

151
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,018
For three very smart people,

152
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,286
that was really stupid.

153
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:30,022
What if Wells had caught you
in that...

154
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,557
- Time vault.
- Thank you.

155
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,492
Okay, I know we've seen
a lot this past year,

156
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,526
but time travel?

157
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,862
I did it.

158
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,231
- Or I will do it, I mean.
- Excuse me?

159
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,067
One of the two speedsters
in Barry's house

160
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,336
the night his mother died
was Barry.

161
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,505
I mean, the Flash.
He was there.

162
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:49,475
Which means that one day
in the future,

163
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:53,245
Barry will travel back in time
to that night.

164
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,580
Okay.

165
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:58,417
Actually, I wasn't talking
about that.

166
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,921
I kind of already
time traveled.

167
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,590
- By accident.
- What?

168
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,292
I was running to
try and stop a tsunami

169
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,293
from hitting the city...

170
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,294
When was that?

171
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,763
A few weeks ago.

172
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,632
Right before you started
getting those dreams.

173
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,101
Oh, you mean the ones
where Wells uses

174
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,604
His super-speeding hand
to shred apart my heart?

175
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,472
- Those?
- Yes, right.

176
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,242
So, what if they're not dreams?

177
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:24,476
What else could they be?

178
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,577
Memories.

179
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,513
I'm not following.

180
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:30,015
All right, what if, that day,
Cisco found out

181
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,351
that Wells is the Reverse-Flash,
and then Wells killed him?

182
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:33,852
But when I ran back a day,

183
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,954
I changed the timeline
so that event never happened.

184
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,457
If it never happened,
how can Cisco remember it?

185
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,293
I don't know.
I don't know.

186
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,263
I think the important thing is,
he does.

187
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:51,937
Guys, I think
I've got a really bad idea.

188
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:11,023
Dad, it's been three weeks.
You barely eat or sleep.

189
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,424
You should probably go home
at some point.

190
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,692
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

191
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,429
I'll go home when Barry does.

192
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:23,035
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

193
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:24,269
Help!
My son's coding.

194
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,038
They said he was stable.

195
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,207
Barry.

196
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,474
- Oh, my god.
- I need the room.

197
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,978
Just go.
I need the room.

198
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,947
How can he be seizing?

199
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,215
He has no heart rhythm.

200
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:39,818
- Starting compressions.
- Epi push. Epi.

201
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,294
They can't save him.

202
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,663
But I can.

203
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,399
I know who you are.

204
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,435
You're that scientist
that Barry's obsessed with,

205
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:58,971
The one who blew a hole
in the city.

206
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,939
Harrison Wells,
and interestingly enough,

207
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,175
My facility is the very place
I would like to take him.

208
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:04,876
You're out of your mind.

209
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,845
I'm not gonna try and
convince you with promises.

210
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:09,181
But, Detective,
give me a chance.

211
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,350
I think we already know
what you're capable of, doctor.

212
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:12,918
You hurt a lot of people
that night.

213
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,687
So those doctors in there,
they're good enough?

214
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,190
The best in the city,
best in the country.

215
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:19,524
Look at them.

216
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,226
They have no clue
what's going on.

217
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,995
They're baffled,
and the reason for that is

218
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,997
what's happening
inside Barry is a mystery,

219
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,598
And they don't have
the tools to solve it.

220
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,066
- But you do?
- That's right.

221
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,602
Millions of people

222
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,338
Used to look at my lab,
and what did they see?

223
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,439
They saw the future.

224
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,841
Well, let me take
that technology,

225
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:38,176
Let me take that know-how
into ensuring

226
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:42,347
That your son
actually does have a future.

227
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:46,084
Detective.

228
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,619
Let me save him.

229
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:55,594
- Hand me the paddles.
- Starting compressions.

230
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:59,698
Then save him.

231
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,602
Charge.
200. Pads.

232
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,970
Joe?

233
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,271
Joe, are you listening?

234
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,939
Yeah.

235
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,643
We... we have to access
Cisco's memories somehow.

236
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,745
Somewhere in his subconscious
is the key.

237
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:14,913
The key to what now?

238
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,248
Getting my dad out of prison.

239
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,485
And how are we going to do that?

240
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,789
We're gonna get Wells to confess
to killing my mom.

241
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,400
So, this will allow Cisco
to see into his dream?

242
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,802
I got the idea
from a journal article

243
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,370
on lucid dream therapy.

244
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:39,905
They think it can be used
to help people

245
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,874
Suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

246
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:44,309
Traumatized, stressed?

247
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,777
Check and check.

248
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,479
The theory is that
it will allow people

249
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,981
to objectively enter
their dreams

250
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,716
And face their fears.

251
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,784
Still working on
the talking part.

252
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,387
And you're sure this thing
isn't gonna, you know,

253
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,655
mess with my brain?

254
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,323
Oh, the amount of electricity
required

255
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,392
to trigger lucid dreaming
is harmless.

256
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,827
Probably.

257
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,296
Who's going to be
lucid dreaming?

258
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:06,298
Um...

259
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,568
With all of the meta-humans
in Central City,

260
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,703
people have been seeing
some strange things...

261
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,705
Things that
they don't understand.

262
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,574
And it's really just
a matter of time

263
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,543
before psychological issues
develop.

264
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,511
And lucid dreaming will help
the doctors

265
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,743
better understand their fears.

266
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,148
Intriguing.

267
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,550
Of course, you still need to
guide the patient

268
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:26,051
from the outside, right?

269
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,787
Direct them to
specific aspects of that dream.

270
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,724
We're still working
on a communications interface.

271
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:34,193
When we dream,

272
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,562
the middle brain lights up
with electrical activity,

273
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:40,065
Whereas the higher brain
remains dormant.

274
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:43,035
Once we find a way to make
both parts of the brain active,

275
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,337
then it's just a matter of
finding the frequency

276
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,373
that will stimulate
the language center.

277
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,375
Then the dreamer could speak.

278
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:50,709
He could describe his dream.

279
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,077
- Exactly.
- Or her dream.

280
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,412
It could be used for anyone.

281
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:54,913
Right, it's not gender specific.

282
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:59,218
I would try a frequency of
45 hertz to start.

283
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,586
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

284
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:04,089
Well, you never cease to
impress me, Caitlin.

285
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,462
- Allen.
- Hey.

286
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,797
The Owens case.

287
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,965
I'm still waiting
on the fiber evidence

288
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,099
and the ballistics report.

289
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,834
Are you on vacation
or something?

290
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,469
No, I'm so sorry, I've just...

291
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,670
I've been distracted
by another case.

292
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,172
Which is no excuse, I just...

293
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,174
Okay, just get me the reports
when you can.

294
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,509
There's... there's no rush.

295
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:26,612
All right.
Uh, Captain?

296
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,947
Is everything okay?

297
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,451
Yeah, since Rob and I
have been planning the,

298
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,586
You know, wedding,
between the florist

299
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,855
And the hundreds of kinds
of cake filling

300
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:40,993
And who can sit next to who...

301
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:43,429
Never get married, Allen.

302
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,030
Right.

303
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:49,001
- Oh.
- Iris.

304
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:50,369
- Barry.
- Hey.

305
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:51,437
Are you okay?

306
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:52,638
Yeah. No. Yes.

307
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,673
That was...
that was just really weird.

308
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:57,209
Captain Singh was nice to me.

309
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:59,011
Oh, well, he's in a good mood.

310
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,113
He's about to get married.

311
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,582
Lucky him.
Yeah, I know, it's...

312
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,552
Oh, hey,
can I talk to you in private?

313
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:08,220
It's... it's kind of work-related.

314
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,955
Okay, yeah,
now's not a great time.

315
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,557
- I'm sorry, I've got...
- Hi, beautiful.

316
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,459
Hi.

317
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,793
Barry, can I grab you
for a second?

318
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,261
Absolutely.
Yeah.

319
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,030
Okay, well, can you call me
when you're done?

320
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,231
It's... it's really important.

321
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

322
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,271
What's up?

323
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,945
Oh.
O-okay.

324
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:34,780
W-what did she say?

325
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:36,415
Or, wait, you still have it, so,
duh, you haven't asked her yet.

326
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:38,283
Or you did ask her,
and she said...

327
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,152
- I was gonna propose tonight.
- All right.

328
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,421
But I went to Joe
to ask for his blessing.

329
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,423
- He said no.
- He did? He...

330
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,325
- Repeatedly.
- Uh, weird.

331
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:48,227
I need you to talk to him,
find out why.

332
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,595
Uh, Eddie...

333
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,263
Look, I know me
asking you like this,

334
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,264
It's a little awkward.

335
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,732
Yeah.

336
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,567
But you know how heartbroken
she's gonna be

337
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,437
if she finds out
that Joe's not on board.

338
00:13:58,439 --> 00:13:59,438
Yeah.
Yeah, all right.

339
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,672
Yeah, I'll talk to him, man.

340
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,142
Oh, thanks.
I appreciate it so much.

341
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:04,143
- Yeah.
- And so will

342
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:06,178
the future
Mrs. Thawne.

343
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,913
Iris Thawne.

344
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,550
Sounds pretty good, huh?

345
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,552
I have a feeling
she's gonna want to hyphenate.

346
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,423
Okay, can we go over this
one more time?

347
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,893
Yeah, you put the glasses on,
fall asleep, and start dreaming.

348
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:22,427
Not that hard.

349
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,329
Yeah, except I'm pretty sure
I die in this dream.

350
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,098
If I go back into it,
am I gonna die in real life?

351
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,666
I mean, what are
we talking about here?

352
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:28,901
Is this <i>Inception</i>
or <i>Dreamscape?</i>

353
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,102
Here.
Drink this.

354
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:31,570
- What, am I five?
- Just drink it.

355
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:32,838
Okay, I'll drink it.

356
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,072
You're gonna be fine, Cisco.

357
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,375
Mm.

358
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,210
Okay.

359
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,581
The glasses are emitting
a low-level delta wave

360
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,949
Which should help you
fall asleep.

361
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,885
Okay.

362
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,220
I got to warn you, though,

363
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,190
Usually it takes me
a long time.

364
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,958
I mean...

365
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,359
I'm not saying I'm, like...

366
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:57,796
An insomniac or any...

367
00:14:57,798 --> 00:15:01,099
Ah, so that's how you get him
to shut up.

368
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,801
He's entering rem.

369
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:04,002
It's working.

370
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,506
Cisco.

371
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:08,707
Can you hear me?

372
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,810
You're dreaming, bud.

373
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,552
Okay, I will take Dr. West
to jitters

374
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:23,288
So you do whatever it is
you want to do.

375
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:30,629
Whoa.

376
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:35,033
Guys, this is mad freaky.

377
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:38,670
Okay, um, where are you?

378
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:43,242
Um, in the cortex.

379
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:47,379
I mean, I know I'm just dreaming
that I'm in the cortex,

380
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:51,316
But it feels so real.

381
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,254
What is "dream you" doing?

382
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:57,222
Caitlin just left.

383
00:15:57,224 --> 00:16:02,060
I asked her to
take Wells to jitters.

384
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,129
Why... why do you want Wells
out of the lab?

385
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:08,400
I think he might have
tampered with my work.

386
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:11,503
I need to check.

387
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:14,506
Okay.

388
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:17,242
Okay, I'm walking to the bunker.

389
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,616
Oh, man, I love this shirt.

390
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:25,917
I thought the dryer ate it.

391
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,519
Focus, Cisco.

392
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:30,622
Okay, okay.

393
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:32,624
All right.

394
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:37,329
Now I'm running tests
on the containment system.

395
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:42,601
This data...
it doesn't make any sense.

396
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:45,270
All the supercapacitors...

397
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:48,440
They were all still
fully charged.

398
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:51,343
There's absolutely no reason
that the man in yellow

399
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,613
Should have escaped.

400
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,356
Oh, my god.

401
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,392
It was just a hologram.

402
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,429
He tricked us.

403
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,566
Hello, Cisco.

404
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,471
Oh, god, Wells is here.

405
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,307
Cisco, it's just a dream.
He can't hurt you.

406
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,809
You better be right
about that.

407
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:29,314
My name is Eobard Thawne.

408
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,816
Eobard Thawne.

409
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,918
Thawne?
Like Eddie Thawne?

410
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,755
You killed Nora Allen.

411
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:39,391
It was never my intention.

412
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,453
Nora?
What about my mom?

413
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:44,629
- He's confessing.
- Cisco?

414
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:48,631
He... he didn't want to kill her.

415
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,800
It was you, Barry.

416
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:52,302
He was trying to kill you.

417
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,721
His bloodpressure is 200 and
his heartbeat is 147.

418
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,700
Guys, he's losing
higher brain function.

419
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,376
Cisco, you're gonna be okay.

420
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,978
It's just a dream.
You're gonna be okay.

421
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,673
I have grown quite fond of you,
Cisco.

422
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,882
His hand...
it's vibrating.

423
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,218
- He's gonna kill me.
- Oh god, he's gonna have a stroke.

424
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,020
- Get him out of there!
- In many ways,

425
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,155
you've shown me
what it's like...

426
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,790
- Help me.
- Caitlin.

427
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,825
Help me, please!

428
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:15,827
...to have a son.

429
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,827
Help me!

430
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,289
Aah!

431
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,366
You're okay.

432
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,935
It was just a dream.
You're okay.

433
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,409
Oh, god.

434
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,245
It felt so real.

435
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,550
- Barry?
- My mom.

436
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,419
That's why it's my fault.

437
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,292
Hello?

438
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,561
Where are you?

439
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,402
Barry.

440
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,637
Barry, are you there?

441
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,205
Dr. Wells.

442
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,007
Yeah.
It's... sorry, yeah.

443
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,876
It's... it's a bad connection
right now.

444
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,344
Where have you been?

445
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,013
Uh, we're...
why? What's going on?

446
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,014
A fire.

447
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,749
A huge fire just erupted.

448
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:13,751
A fire?
Where?

449
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:14,752
New Brighton.

450
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,154
Bradford tower high-rise.

451
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,722
I know that building.

452
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,824
That's where Captain Singh's
fiance works.

453
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,260
On my way.

454
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,009
Now move it!
Go!

455
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,011
Get those hoses up.
Move!

456
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,245
And tell dispatch we need

457
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,580
as many tankers
as this city has.

458
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,382
- What floor?
- 21st.

459
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,217
My god.
That's where rob works.

460
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,424
Please hurry.

461
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,727
Over here!

462
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,199
Dr. Wells, the sprinklers...

463
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,633
they're not working.

464
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,035
I see that.

465
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,103
Just get everyone
out of there, Barry.

466
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,805
No, I can't.
I can't save them all.

467
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:12,310
Dr. Wells, please, what do I do?

468
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,711
You create a vacuum.

469
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,613
Rotate your arms
at super-speed.

470
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,415
That'll create a wind funnel

471
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,217
that will suck the air
right out of the room.

472
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,324
It's making it worse!

473
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,592
Barry, listen to me.

474
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:31,395
You need to move
your arms faster.

475
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,630
I believe in you, Barry.

476
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:08,432
Rob.

477
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,601
I'm okay.
It's okay.

478
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,436
I thought I lost you.

479
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,208
Medic!

480
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,655
Mr. Allen.

481
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:36,261
Tonight, at the fire,

482
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,530
I saw hesitation.

483
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:41,200
I saw you doubting yourself.

484
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:43,102
Why is that?

485
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:44,103
I don't know.

486
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:47,673
Uh, I guess I was afraid

487
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:49,508
I couldn't save everyone.

488
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,110
Right.

489
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:54,513
But if there is anything
that I have learned

490
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:56,181
In our time together, Barry,

491
00:21:56,183 --> 00:22:00,519
It is that the only thing
standing in the way of you

492
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:04,156
Achieving every goal
that you set for yourself

493
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,691
Is you.

494
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:10,095
There is no limit
to how strong you will get

495
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:13,999
Or how fast you will go.

496
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:18,270
Everything that you need,

497
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:21,273
You already have.

498
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,809
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

499
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:32,050
You know,

500
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:36,522
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

501
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,390
I feel the same way about you.

502
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,470
It's so strange.

503
00:22:51,472 --> 00:22:53,205
I mean, I look at him now,

504
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,475
And I know that he killed my mom
and he sent my dad to jail,

505
00:22:56,477 --> 00:23:00,179
But, I mean,
sometimes he's just so kind

506
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:03,782
In the moment,
I actually like him.

507
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,584
But you never did.

508
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:07,619
- No.
- No.

509
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:09,988
Well, at least now
we know how to trap him.

510
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,725
In Cisco's dream,
he confessed to everything.

511
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,827
If we can just recreate
those conditions,

512
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:16,828
He'll do it again.

513
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,165
Man, Barr.

514
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,434
Taking down bad guys,
pulling confessions.

515
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:24,136
I'm the cop.

516
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:25,604
I'm the one that's supposed
to be doing this.

517
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:27,005
Look, if we're gonna get him
to confess,

518
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:29,508
It has to be with someone
that he truly trusts,

519
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,477
Someone that he'll genuinely
let his guard down with.

520
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,980
He thinks of Cisco as a son.

521
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:38,350
Well, then we need to do
a better job protecting him

522
00:23:38,352 --> 00:23:41,086
Than I did protecting you.

523
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,822
I'm not sure what that means.

524
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:45,324
Barry,
this is all because of me.

525
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:46,992
No.

526
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:48,827
I never should've let Wells
take you from that hospital.

527
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,662
None of this would've
ever happened.

528
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:53,799
If you hadn't let him take me,
I would be dead, for sure.

529
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:56,435
But even then,
I knew something wasn't right.

530
00:23:56,437 --> 00:23:58,670
Everything in my gut
was telling me not to trust him,

531
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:00,038
But I did,

532
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,274
Because I was so desperate
to see you okay.

533
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,775
Joe, this isn't your fault.

534
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,577
It's not your fault.

535
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:09,448
Look, every bad thing
that has happened to us...

536
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,751
All of it...
it was him.

537
00:24:12,753 --> 00:24:15,254
And now he's gonna pay for it.

538
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,462
So, Wells set up a fake showdown

539
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:26,265
With a fake opponent
who was never really there?

540
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,400
He figured if we saw
both of them together

541
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:30,602
It would prove that he wasn't
the man in yellow.

542
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:33,438
This all just keeps getting
crazier and crazier.

543
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,644
I just talked to Dr. Wells.

544
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:40,212
He's attending
a lecture downtown,

545
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,546
Won't be back until 5:00.

546
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:42,948
All right, Cisco,
you know when he gets here

547
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,416
You need to be working
on the trap

548
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:46,084
So he sees you set off
the hologram.

549
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:48,253
Hold on,
isn't that, in your dream,

550
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:49,988
When everything went all...

551
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,590
Kali ma.
Temple of doom.

552
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:53,892
Yeah, that definitely happened.

553
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:57,162
But this time,
I'm ready for him.

554
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,730
I originally designed
the force field

555
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:00,632
To keep a speedster
from getting out.

556
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:02,000
But I've reversed it.

557
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,303
Now it won't let one in.

558
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:12,010
Back up.

559
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,758
Barry, are you okay?

560
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,227
Ah.

561
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,563
It works.

562
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:33,532
Okay, as long as I'm inside,

563
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:35,167
Wells won't be able
to get near me.

564
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:36,735
And I will be in the cortex

565
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:38,937
Watching and recording
everything that happens.

566
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,739
And as soon as we get
the confession we need

567
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:43,008
To free my dad,
I'm moving in.

568
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,843
So what do I do?

569
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,511
Wells also threatened Iris,

570
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:47,779
So if something
goes wrong here,

571
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,014
We need you to keep an eye
on her

572
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,248
Until Wells is neutralized.

573
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,951
I'll always keep Iris safe,
Joe.

574
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,291
- What?
- Come here.

575
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:04,629
So, um, Eddie told me
what happened,

576
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:07,165
That you kiboshed
his proposal.

577
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,834
That was supposed to be
between him and me.

578
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:11,603
I so agree with that.

579
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,039
And I... and I know that we have
a lot going on right now,

580
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,807
And I should definitely be
the last person

581
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,876
Pleading Eddie's case,
but I don't get it, Joe.

582
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:19,678
Why did you say no?

583
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,214
Because if Eddie
proposes to Iris,

584
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:24,383
She's gonna get caught up
in the moment and the romance,

585
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:25,851
And she's gonna say yes.

586
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:27,452
What's wrong with that?

587
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:30,355
Again, I don't know
why I'm saying this.

588
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:31,723
Because one day
she's gonna wake up and realize

589
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:33,291
She married the wrong guy.

590
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:36,361
But she'll stay anyway
because she made a promise.

591
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:37,829
I don't want
that kind of life for her.

592
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:39,531
Or him.

593
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:42,334
She's got feelings for you,
Barry.

594
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:45,070
She may not know how to deal
with those feelings right now,

595
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:47,339
But I know her.

596
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:49,408
They're there.
Always have been.

597
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:54,913
You know that, too.

598
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:58,650
Speaking of,
Iris just sent me a 911 text.

599
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:00,485
I'll be right back.

600
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:04,089
Like I said.

601
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,726
- Hey.
- Hi.

602
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:09,261
What's going on?

603
00:27:09,263 --> 00:27:10,829
Look, Barry, I know
it's not a good time.

604
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,431
I mean, lately, it never seems
to be a good time,

605
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:15,233
But I need you to listen to me
right now.

606
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:19,004
Like... like, really
listen to me.

607
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:20,972
Of course.
Yeah.

608
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:24,109
Whatever you need to tell me,
I'm listening.

609
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:25,510
Okay, I mean,
I know this is gonna sound

610
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:30,081
really crazy at first, but...

611
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,151
Everything strange that's been
going on in Central City,

612
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,853
it all goes back to
that night.

613
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,922
The night that the particle
accelerator exploded.

614
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:39,124
I have gone through
every bit of information

615
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:40,926
that I've collected
since I started my blog...

616
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,829
Every tip, every rumor,
every strange sighting.

617
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:46,998
Nothing predates the explosion.

618
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,334
Whatever was released
into the atmosphere that night,

619
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,535
I think it changed people...

620
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:53,872
Caused them to have powers.

621
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:56,441
And I think that
S.T.A.R. Labs knew about it.

622
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:59,344
I think the burning man
worked there,

623
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,781
And I think that that's how
the Flash got his powers too.

624
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,786
- Uh...
- So what do you think?

625
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:10,555
I...

626
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:12,791
I don't know.
I mean, it's... it's interesting.

627
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:14,125
Yeah, it's interesting.

628
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,527
It's... there's... there's just...

629
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,262
A big hole in your theory.

630
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:19,397
Um, you know...

631
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:24,769
I was affected by whatever was
released by the explosion,

632
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,772
And I don't have any powers.

633
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,875
- Obviously.
- Right, yeah.

634
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,143
Look, I mean, I know that it's...
it's really mind-blowing.

635
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:34,312
I mean, I haven't even talked to
Eddie about it yet, but...

636
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:37,115
Yeah, you and Eddie...
how are...

637
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:39,284
Everything's okay
with you and Eddie?

638
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:41,286
Uh, sure.
Sure.

639
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:44,155
Yeah, we're great.
Why?

640
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:46,625
Uh, I...
yeah, okay, look.

641
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:50,795
I'm gonna... let me read over
all of this stuff,

642
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:53,465
and we'll definitely
talk about it later.

643
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,466
I promise.

644
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:56,301
Just... I mean, this is crazy.

645
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:58,303
Yeah, okay, just let me
just go through it,

646
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:01,740
and we'll talk later,
all right?

647
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,942
Okay.

648
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:19,222
Hey, Barry.

649
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,326
It's Iris.

650
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:24,229
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I hope you can,

651
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:29,301
because I really, really
need you to wake up.

652
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:35,305
Like, the other day,

653
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,141
Detective pretty boy
came into jitters,

654
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:41,445
and he asked me out,
and I actually said yes.

655
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:47,618
See, I do dumb things like that
when you're not around.

656
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:57,728
And the house is really
quiet without you.

657
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,301
I know that the reason
that you came to live with us

658
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:08,438
Was awful.

659
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,741
But Barry,

660
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:13,343
You made it a home again.

661
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:18,248
You made us a family again.

662
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,286
We need you.

663
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:25,422
I need you.

664
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,134
Hello, Dr. Wells.

665
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,936
How was your lecture?

666
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:42,606
Oh, boring, tedious.

667
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,374
Platitudinous?

668
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,143
Couldn't have said it better
myself.

669
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:49,847
Um, where...
where's Cisco?

670
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,883
Uh, he is in the bunker.

671
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:56,520
He thinks he finally figured out
what went wrong at Christmas.

672
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:00,190
You know, when we were trying
to catch the Reverse-Flash?

673
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,627
Yes, I remember that night.

674
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,028
Well, did he say
what he's found?

675
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,864
Nope,
just that it was important.

676
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,199
Hmm.

677
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,735
Good for Cisco.

678
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:14,705
Um... Okay.

679
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,940
Well, maybe
I'll wheel on down there,

680
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:17,941
See what he's got.

681
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,477
Okay.

682
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:26,450
Here he comes.

683
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,913
Hello, Cisco.

684
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,926
You've been busy.

685
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,765
You really are
incredibly clever, Cisco.

686
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:18,702
I've always said it.

687
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,104
You're him.

688
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,007
The Reverse-Flash.

689
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,376
Joe was right this whole time,
wasn't he?

690
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,945
Good ol' Joe.

691
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,283
Joe west had his doubts
all along.

692
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,186
Even from that first night
in the hospital,

693
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,089
Joe knew
something wasn't right.

694
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,525
Cops... as inconvenient now

695
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:43,093
As they will be
in a hundred years.

696
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,963
Come on, Cisco.
We need a confession.

697
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,266
You killed Barry's mother.

698
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:50,701
I want to know why.

699
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:52,970
It was never my intention
to kill Nora.

700
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,539
But from my perspective,

701
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,542
She was already dead.

702
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,111
It just happened sooner
than it was supposed to.

703
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:05,115
No.
That's not an admission.

704
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,350
Oops.

705
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:14,958
You're not gonna get away
with this.

706
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,326
I'm not gonna get away
with it?

707
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:27,471
Oh, you're smart.

708
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,740
You're smart, Cisco.

709
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,079
But you're not that smart.

710
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,382
Cisco!

711
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,585
No!

712
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,273
He didn't confess.

713
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:06,076
Cisco, are you okay?

714
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,344
Yeah.

715
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:08,912
I'm never ever gonna sleep
ever again,

716
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:10,847
But, yeah, I'm okay.

717
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,086
He's dead.

718
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,187
He didn't confess.

719
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,289
Joe, this was it.

720
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,458
My dad's gonna be in prison
forever.

721
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,360
Barry, I'm sorry.

722
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:25,162
Hey, uh...

723
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:28,298
Whoa.

724
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,533
What the hell?

725
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:32,502
I told you this before.

726
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:37,174
I am always
one step ahead... Flash.

727
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,676
Allow me
to reintroduce to you

728
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,845
Mr. Hannibal bates

729
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,381
And his incredible ability
to transform

730
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:48,051
Into any person he touches.

731
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:50,287
I knew that ability
would come in handy.

732
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:53,824
I did not expect it
to come in handy this soon.

733
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:55,659
You used him!

734
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:56,893
Like you used all of us!

735
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,662
Well, he served a purpose.

736
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:01,098
Didn't take much convincing.

737
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,733
Just the simple promise
of his freedom.

738
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,536
You ruined my life!
All our lives!

739
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:10,040
We stood by you
after everything that happened.

740
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,976
I can see how this must be
difficult for you to understand,

741
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:15,712
But trust me,

742
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,215
Your lives now
are so much better

743
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:20,884
Because of what
I have done for you.

744
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,152
You don't have to
hide anymore.

745
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:23,487
We know you're not
Harrison Wells.

746
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,788
Just tell us who you are.

747
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,091
A confession
will get you nowhere.

748
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,827
You've seen who I am.

749
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:31,895
You know what I can do.

750
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,297
You want to kill me, go ahead.

751
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,599
I'm not gonna fight you.

752
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,068
But just tell the police
what you did.

753
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,436
Get my dad out of prison.

754
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,004
I don't want to kill you, Barry.

755
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,005
I need you.

756
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:44,474
And...

757
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,479
I also did not anticipate,

758
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,915
As difficult as the past
15 years have been for me,

759
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:55,418
How much I would come
to love working with you.

760
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,087
With all of you.

761
00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:00,624
And yet, that does not change
what needs to happen.

762
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,659
Then face me now!

763
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:07,230
Oh, we will face each other
again.

764
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,266
I promise you.
Soon.

765
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:13,036
Very, very soon.

766
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,239
He's in the time vault!

767
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,240
Barry!

768
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,593
It was all a set-up.

769
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,061
We thought we set
a trap for him,

770
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,096
But he set a trap for us.

771
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,237
Oh, my god.

772
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,605
Iris.

773
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:56,913
We have to find Iris.

774
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,215
- Why?
- Wells.

775
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,749
He's been watching all of us.

776
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,685
He has surveillance footage
set up everywhere.

777
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,687
Our homes, my lab
at the police station,

778
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,389
Central city picture news.

779
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,792
Cisco, call me
when you have a location.

780
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,666
I am very much enjoying
this stroll.

781
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,468
We needed a good stroll.

782
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,870
Yeah.

783
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:24,808
Actually, though, would you mind
if we park here for a second?

784
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,978
Um...

785
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,813
Oh, it's my dad.

786
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:32,415
Could you call him back later?

787
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,251
Sure.

788
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:36,253
What's going on?

789
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:40,056
Iris, this week,
when I was arrested

790
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:43,093
And it looked bad,

791
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,694
You never wavered.

792
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,496
You never lost faith in me.

793
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,265
Impossible.

794
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:55,238
And even though we've been
through some rough times,

795
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,507
I've never lost faith in us.

796
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:04,347
Iris west.

797
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:05,849
Eddie?

798
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,488
Eddie!

799
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:15,525
Bad timing, Detective.

800
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,362
Stop!
Leave him alone!

801
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,798
Iris, no!

802
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,202
I know who you are.

803
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,204
You killed Barry's mom.

804
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:30,206
But you don't have to hurt
anyone else.

805
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,713
Hey, Iris.

806
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:37,881
It's okay.
It's me.

807
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,282
He took him.

808
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:40,550
The man in yellow,
he took Eddie.

809
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,452
I promise I will find him,
okay?

810
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,620
What is happening?

811
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:45,789
Listen to me.
You go home.

812
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,857
Don't say anything to anyone.

813
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,327
I swear to you, I will
bring him back, all right?

814
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,795
Wait, stop.

815
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,200
Barry?

816
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:15,752
You might as well take
that mask off.

817
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:19,322
I know it's you, Wells.
Or whoever you really are.

818
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:25,795
Well, allow to
to introduce myself.

819
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:29,799
My name is Eobard.

820
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,236
Eobard Thawne.

821
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:36,106
I don't understand.

822
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,274
Why do you have my name?

823
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,943
Why?

824
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:44,814
Well, 'cause we're family,
Eddie.

825
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,917
Funny, I haven't seen you
at any reunions or weddings.

826
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,185
That is funny.

827
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,788
And the reason for that

828
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,626
Is because as far as
those guest lists are concerned,

829
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,662
I haven't been born yet.

830
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:03,700
So that's why you didn't kill me
that night at S.T.A.R. Labs?

831
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,506
This whole thing...

832
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:10,774
It's been about me?

833
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,475
Not a chance.

834
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:16,179
You, my friend,

835
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,248
Are simply my insurance.

836
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,790
You look so young.

837
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:35,165
And I could kill you

838
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,401
Right now so easy.

839
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:47,177
What I wouldn't have given...

840
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:53,149
All those times before
to have had you like this.

841
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,018
So...

842
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,586
Helpless.

843
00:40:56,588 --> 00:41:00,089
But fate,

844
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:03,293
It's tricky, isn't it?

845
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,262
I come here to destroy you...

846
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,800
And then to get home,
I have to be the one

847
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,571
Who creates you.

848
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:23,012
But I will say,

849
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:24,581
It's been an education...

850
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,519
Watching you grow up
all these years.

851
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:33,990
Science fairs
and soccer games.

852
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,693
No hint, no sign,

853
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:40,597
No trace of the man
you will be one day

854
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,000
For whom I have
nothing but hate.

855
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:48,304
And to be clear,

856
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:51,307
Nothing is forgiven.

857
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:54,110
There will be a reckoning.

858
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:58,982
I promise you, Barry Allen,

859
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,717
That you will die.

860
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,710
Greg, move your head.
