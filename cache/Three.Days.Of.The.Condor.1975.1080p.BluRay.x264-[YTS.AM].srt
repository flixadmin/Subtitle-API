1
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:35,119
So tell her what you got.

2
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:38,688
Male, Caucasian, mid-40s,
appears to have been shot.

3
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,332
-Where?
-In his room.

4
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,668
-Very funny, Harold.
-Okay, okay.

5
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:44,128
The wound is just below the heart.

6
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:46,171
-Was he shot once?
-Seems to have been, yeah.

7
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:48,799
First you said,
"Appears to have been shot..."

8
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:50,259
Mr. Turner.

9
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,600
Dr. Lappe, I'm sure he's gonna be here
any second now.

10
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,935
Really?

11
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:03,856
Mr. Turner's late again.

12
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,875
Just get back to work.

13
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,210
Come on. We can dope it out
in five minutes and get back to work.

14
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,879
If Joey were here,
you know what he would say...

15
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:28,380
Joey isn't the only mind in this place.

16
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:31,759
Come on. What caliber slug?

17
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:34,136
-You're missing the point, Ray.
-What do you mean?

18
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,472
The machine will come back
with a "Rephrase"

19
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,599
or "Please express in other words."

20
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:40,142
Well, so what do you want to feed in?

21
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,748
-Turner, Joseph. No middle initial.
-You're 17 minutes late.

22
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,042
Make it 12, will you?
I was bucking headwinds.

23
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,212
Dr. Lappe,
anything in the early pouch for me?

24
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,132
-Dr. Lappe.
-Yes?

25
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,676
-Is there anything...
-Nothing in response to your report.

26
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,679
And please have the book
I left on your desk analyzed

27
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:00,305
and on the computer by 4:00.

28
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,598
Yes, sir.

29
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,393
Better get the tolmieas
moved closer to the light, Doctor.

30
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,020
You're getting a blight on the leaf.

31
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:11,316
At ease, Sarge. At ease.

32
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,610
Going to rain today. 10:20.

33
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:20,993
-There's got to be more details.
-I only read two chapters.

34
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,995
-No other clues?
-Not so far.

35
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,496
What time did they find him?

36
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,915
Just the same afternoon,
just early evening.

37
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,501
They never said
what the caliber of the bullet was.

38
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:32,504
-Apparently a .38.
-There it is again, "apparently."

39
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:35,841
Well, it made an entry wound
characteristic of a .38,

40
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:37,801
but they couldn't recover the slug itself.

41
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:40,095
Hey, we're getting somewhere.

42
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,308
You guys figure it out.
I have Far East journals to read.

43
00:04:44,392 --> 00:04:46,018
Hey, was the slug
smashed against the wall?

44
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:49,271
No. As a matter of fact,
there was no exit wound.

45
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,858
We're not getting anywhere.
Finish the book, Harold.

46
00:04:56,321 --> 00:05:00,282
-Hi. What we've got so far is...
-Ice.

47
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:03,202
Instead of lead. Ice.

48
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:06,330
The murderer pours water
into a .38 caliber mold

49
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:08,874
and freezes it
and keeps it solid until the crime.

50
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,167
-Great.
-Then he shoots the guy

51
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:11,376
with the ice bullet.

52
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:14,713
Cops show up in a half an hour,
and there's just a few drops of water.

53
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:17,591
-No bullet, no ballistics.
-That's great.

54
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:19,051
-Hey.
-Yeah?

55
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,222
What is this?

56
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:26,892
Calligraphy's getting beautiful.

57
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,227
What is it?

58
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:29,686
That means heaven.

59
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:31,104
That's it? Nothing else?

60
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:35,150
Well, it can mean "the best."
"Tops" sometimes. Why?

61
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:38,946
I'm not sure.

62
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:42,032
We're going to Sam
and Mae's tonight, right?

63
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:43,951
Well, why don't you talk
to Sam about it?

64
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:46,328
About this? I did.

65
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,748
He says, "Well, that's interesting,
but it's not my department."

66
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:53,919
Which means he doesn't think
there's anything, just like Dr. Lappe.

67
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,965
-And you.
-Well, there's not much.

68
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,176
-A mystery that's been translated?
-A mystery that didn't sell

69
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,971
that's been translated into
a very odd assortment of languages.

70
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:07,808
Turkish, but not French,
Arabic, but not Russian or German.

71
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:09,810
Dutch.

72
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:12,688
-Spanish?
-Yes.

73
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,733
-Yes.
-Hey,

74
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:19,444
where'd you get that thing
about the ice? Dashiell Hammett?

75
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,489
Dick Tracy.
Are you sure about this ideogram?

76
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:27,202
Look at this face.
Could I be wrong about an ideogram?

77
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,000
It's a great face,
but it's never been to China.

78
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:44,970
Ray, when can I get
some computer time?

79
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,388
Dick Tracy?

80
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,641
-He was a very underrated detective.
-There's some free time at 2:45.

81
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,226
Morning pickup.

82
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,813
No, no, no, no.
Stay on schedule. I'll get it.

83
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:59,151
-Four pieces, right?
-Right.

84
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,236
-Hold it. Hold it.
-Five.

85
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,489
-Affirmative. Fiver.
-Where is Mr. Heidegger?

86
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:07,659
-He called in sick, Dr. Lappe.
-He's probably hung over again.

87
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:10,245
This is extraordinary.
I was just checking the files

88
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,289
and I came across this carbon copy

89
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:15,083
of an inquiry he sent
to Persian Gulf command.

90
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,918
He did that for me.

91
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:19,588
It never went through my office.

92
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,256
I asked him to do
some research for me.

93
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,675
I guess he didn't feel
it was that important.

94
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,636
I wish you people
would go through channels.

95
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,439
What's on your mind?

96
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:39,316
Okay.

97
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:28,740
This was in the pouch
from New York Center.

98
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:31,993
HQ at Langley said there's nothing
from any other intelligence source

99
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,621
-to support your theory.
-Gentlemen.

100
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,706
Is this your idea
of working on that book?

101
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,291
I'll have it on the computer by 4:00.

102
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:40,710
We have people
to service these machines.

103
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:43,630
These things are really pretty simple.
They just look complicated.

104
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:49,010
Mr. Turner,
I wonder if you're entirely happy here.

105
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:52,639
-Within obvious limits, yes, sir.
-Obvious limits?

106
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,267
It bothers me
that I can't tell people what I do.

107
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:58,061
Why is it taking you so long
to accept that?

108
00:08:58,354 --> 00:08:59,521
Well,

109
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,525
I actually trust a few people.
That's a problem.

110
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:07,154
Well, I believe it's your turn
to bring in lunch.

111
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:09,406
What time is it?

112
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:14,202
-11 :22.
-The rain's gonna stop by 11 :30.

113
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,872
You can wait eight minutes.

114
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,291
Yes, yes.

115
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,209
Mr. Turner? Hey! Hey!

116
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,921
Damn it. It's not a proper exit.

117
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,840
He always goes out that way
when it rains. Saves him a block.

118
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:13,178
Personnel should enter and exit
the premises by authorized means only.

119
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:02,269
Jimmy.

120
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,272
-Hey, Shakespeare, how's it going?
-Terrific.

121
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:07,607
I'm building up a great collection
of rejection slips.

122
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:11,319
Yeah, I know the feeling.
I always wanted to be Escoffier.

123
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:13,655
Well, maybe it's not too late.
You know, van Gogh was 30

124
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,782
-before he started to paint.
-No kidding?

125
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,493
There's no mayonnaise on Dr. Lappe's.

126
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,997
On the other hand, Mozart was three
when he started to play the piano,

127
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:25,458
-and he was composing at six.
-Fast starter. It's probably better.

128
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:27,002
I don't know.

129
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:31,423
Van Gogh never sold a painting in
a whole lifetime. Mozart died a pauper.

130
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,425
Where am I,
the New York Public Library?

131
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,051
Hey, that's a very bright man.

132
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:37,971
It's very educational.
That's why I come in here.

133
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:40,223
You come in here to get sick,
just like everybody else.

134
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,600
Hey, come on.

135
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:42,934
Hey, no butter on Ray's sandwich.

136
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,644
You know,
he gets very panicky about butter.

137
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:09,854
Give it to Jennings in the back.
He'll sign for it. Just...

138
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,940
Edwina Rose...

139
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:35,380
Mrs. Russell,
was the Kirkus report in this...

140
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,871
Wait, wait, wait!

141
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,239
Would you move
from the window, please?

142
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:47,160
Pardon?

143
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:49,871
Would you move
from the window, please?

144
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:02,801
I won't scream.

145
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,387
I know.

146
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,392
A little breakdown in the security there?

147
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,603
Well, what... What are you doing?

148
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:05,822
What...

149
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,668
Come on, now. Now, come on.

150
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:27,403
Harold.

151
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,047
For Christ's sake!
What the hell you doing, Mac?

152
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:52,590
Do your sleeping at night, will you?

153
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,743
-This is the Major.
-This is Joe Turner. Listen...

154
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,036
-Identification.
-What?

155
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,663
Identification.

156
00:20:23,747 --> 00:20:25,540
My name is Turner.
I work for you. Now listen...

157
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,126
-Identify yourself.
-I... I don't...

158
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,919
What is your designation?

159
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,254
Condor.

160
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:34,632
Section 9, department 17.
The section's been hit.

161
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:36,092
-What level?
-What level?

162
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:38,386
-Level of damage.
-Everybody.

163
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:42,557
Dr. Lappe, Janice, Ray, Harold.
Harold was in the...

164
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,308
Are you on a company line?

165
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:47,395
No, no. I'm in a phone booth.
I'm just a block away. I'm in the street.

166
00:20:47,521 --> 00:20:50,231
You're in violation of secure
communication procedures, Condor.

167
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,817
Listen, you son of a bitch!
I'm telling you, I came back with lunch,

168
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:56,028
and it was raining, and the whole house
was murdered. Everybody is dead.

169
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:59,991
Right. Has the incident been discovered
by anyone outside the company?

170
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:02,285
I don't... I don't know. I don't think so.

171
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,953
Are you damaged?

172
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:05,997
Damaged?

173
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,541
-No.
-Are you armed?

174
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:14,172
I don't... I have Mrs... I don't...
I can't remember her code name.

175
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:15,506
Nightingale.

176
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:17,884
She was afraid of being raped.
She kept a gun. I've got the gun.

177
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:19,093
Identify the armament.

178
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:23,681
It's a .45 automatic.
Will you guys bring me in, please?

179
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,058
I'm not a field agent. I just read books.

180
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:28,686
-Leave the area.
-All right. Well...

181
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,521
Well, do I come in
to headquarters now?

182
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:33,024
Negative. Find a secure location.

183
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:35,902
-Where?
-Avoid any place you're known.

184
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:38,946
Do not go home.

185
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:42,617
Surface again in two hours,
and call the Major.

186
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,579
That'll be 14:30, your time.

187
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:49,332
Wait a minute. All right. 2:30, right?

188
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,376
Now, walk away from the phone.
Don't hang it up.

189
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:53,669
Don't...

190
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:08,434
This is the panic officer.

191
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:10,811
Section 9-17 may have been hit.

192
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,563
Activate following procedures.

193
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:17,109
NY 127, DC 469er.

194
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:19,362
Replay of the report upcoming.
Stand by.

195
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,958
Augie One to New York Center.

196
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,002
This is New York Center.
Go ahead, Augie One.

197
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:17,837
-Who am I talking to?
-Higgins, Deputy Director.

198
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:19,171
I'm holding the baby, go ahead.

199
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:22,341
Hit confirmed.
Maximum as reported. Six cold items.

200
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:25,219
-What was the quality of work?
-Clean, fast, first-rate.

201
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:27,847
Did you say six?

202
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:29,390
Excepting Condor,
there should be seven.

203
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,393
Repeat. Six.
Here's a rundown on those items.

204
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,979
Lappe, Chon, Russell,

205
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:37,023
Jennings, Martin, Mitchell.

206
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:39,567
All right, Augie One. Find seven.

207
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,865
Thank you.

208
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:51,454
Condor.

209
00:23:54,124 --> 00:23:58,002
Researcher type
who likes to read comic strips.

210
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:00,606
Who is it?

211
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,545
Jesus.

212
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:40,855
Hey, you. You ring my buzzer?

213
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:44,733
-It was a mistake, buddy.
-Not you guys.

214
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:51,907
Hey. Hey!

215
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,285
Hey, who are you?

216
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:56,495
Hey, who the hell are you?

217
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:00,749
Augie Three here.
We found item seven, Ralph Heidegger.

218
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:02,918
He bought it at home.

219
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:06,046
Okay. Button it up, Augie.
I'll send you more janitors.

220
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,466
-Yes, sir.
-I need Langley right away.

221
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,842
Yes, sir.

222
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:11,719
Garber speaking.

223
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:16,015
This is Higgins, Deputy Director,
New York. Let me have department 17.

224
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,190
Somebody took out
one of your sections.

225
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:25,691
-What?
-9-17.

226
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,944
That's New York.
Somebody got mugged maybe.

227
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,529
They were hit.

228
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:33,324
-They're bookworms, for Christ's sake.
-They got seven out of eight.

229
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:35,826
We're on the shuttle to LaGuardia side.
Thirty minutes.

230
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:37,661
You say one of my people is still okay?

231
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,455
-Condor. You know him?
-No.

232
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,956
Is he okay enough
to say what happened?

233
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,667
They didn't touch him.
He was literally out to lunch.

234
00:26:43,752 --> 00:26:46,170
-What does he say happened?
-He's not in yet.

235
00:26:46,254 --> 00:26:48,506
First call was a little wild, scared.

236
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,382
-Who's bringing him in?
-Higgins.

237
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:51,717
-Higgins.
-Transportation.

238
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:54,970
-We're already booked on the shuttle.
-This is Wicks, OIC department 17.

239
00:26:55,055 --> 00:26:58,140
I want a chopper on the pad,
fueled for New York, now.

240
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,575
-Hey, Lois.
-They're waiting for you.

241
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,827
-What?
-Your two friends.

242
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:23,582
They said you'd be home early.

243
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:26,794
They just got here.
Said you gave them the keys.

244
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:31,298
Mr. Turner?

245
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:06,458
-This is the Major.
-This is Condor.

246
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:09,920
Stand by, Condor.
I'm routing you to New York Center.

247
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,383
Condor 1-1, Mr. Higgins.

248
00:28:15,802 --> 00:28:17,303
Hello, Condor.

249
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,762
Who is this?

250
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,472
Deputy Director Higgins,
New York Center.

251
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm controlling now, Condor.
Where are you?

252
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,810
How come I need a code name
and you don't?

253
00:28:27,522 --> 00:28:28,522
Where are you, Turner?

254
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,108
Here.

255
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:36,196
-You all right?
-Are you insane? Everybody's dead.

256
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,908
Take it easy. Just take it easy,
and we'll bring you home.

257
00:28:40,243 --> 00:28:42,995
Now, here's how we'll do it.
Do you know the Ansonia Hotel?

258
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,915
-Broadway and 71st.
-Broadway and 73rd.

259
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:50,169
There's an alley behind the hotel.

260
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:53,213
One hour from now at exactly 1530,

261
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,550
I want you to enter that alley
from the 73rd Street side.

262
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Will you be there?

263
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:03,390
The head of your department
just came here from DC.

264
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,600
He's gonna bring you home.

265
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,436
-I've never met him.
-Don't worry.

266
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,772
He's studying your photos now.

267
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:13,442
Turner?

268
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:16,737
Turner.

269
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,493
I don't know you, either.

270
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:23,911
We'll meet.

271
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,540
He'll be carrying a Wall Street Journal
in his left hand.

272
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:31,210
-There were two guys at my house.
-What were you doing there?

273
00:29:31,294 --> 00:29:34,880
-You were told not to go there.
-I was homesick. Who were they?

274
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:38,258
-They were ours.
-What were they doing in my house?

275
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,929
I'm not going into any alley with you
or anybody,

276
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,722
and fuck The Wall Street Journal.

277
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:46,225
Turner, it's been a long, bad day.
You've been under...

278
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:47,893
You're damn right I've been under.

279
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,858
All right, Turner.

280
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:57,945
We'll bring along a familiar face,
somebody you know.

281
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,614
Who's left?

282
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,742
You got a friend in statistics
named Sam Barber.

283
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,286
Sam...

284
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:10,624
-You guys are something.
-Will he do?

285
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:13,502
Yes, Sam will do.

286
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:16,422
All right, Turner.

287
00:30:16,506 --> 00:30:19,299
Stay well for 60 minutes,
and you're home.

288
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:22,344
-Can I ask a question?
-Sure.

289
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:25,264
What is happening?

290
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,392
I'll talk to you in 60 minutes.

291
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,272
You've got 55.

292
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:36,191
This is ridiculous.

293
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:38,527
You're not a field agent.
It's standard procedure.

294
00:30:38,611 --> 00:30:39,903
To pick up a friend?

295
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:42,406
-What about you, Mr. Wicks?
-No, thanks.

296
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,242
-Side arm?
-I don't know. Have you got a .45?

297
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,410
You bet.

298
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:48,829
Here, let me help you with that.

299
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,584
How long have you known Condor?

300
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:57,045
Who, Joey?
I knew him before he was a bird even.

301
00:30:57,213 --> 00:31:00,841
-We went to CCNY. My wife Mae, too.
-Yeah?

302
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:04,178
-She ever Condor's girl?
-Here you go, Mr. Wicks.

303
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:12,269
Hey, can you tell me anything
about what happened today?

304
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:14,146
-When?
-This morning.

305
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:16,523
All those murders.

306
00:31:17,317 --> 00:31:18,442
What murders?

307
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:19,419
Sam?

308
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,134
Sam.

309
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,598
Here he is. Joe!

310
00:32:44,612 --> 00:32:45,863
Hey, Sam,

311
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:50,450
where's that other...

312
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,126
What are you doing? It's him! It's him!

313
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,211
Joe!

314
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:14,201
Katherine Hale. H-A-L-E.

315
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:16,828
08, 1156,

316
00:34:16,913 --> 00:34:20,374
172, 208, 875.

317
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,209
Amount, $51.86.

318
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:25,003
Where's there enough snow this early?

319
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:28,632
-Vermont, I hope.
-What's open now, Sugarbush?

320
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:31,051
No, I don't do downhill.
This is for cross-country.

321
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,428
Don't like the lift lines, huh?

322
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:35,889
474? Thank you.

323
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:48,902
Kathy!

324
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:52,823
Kathy. Where have you been?
Here, let me give you a hand.

325
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:56,159
-Wait a minute, I don't know...
-Don't do anything.

326
00:34:56,577 --> 00:35:00,330
Be quiet. Get in the car.
Don't make a sound. Don't be dumb.

327
00:35:00,915 --> 00:35:02,416
Come on. Hurry up.

328
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,750
Get in.

329
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,215
Listen, please don't hurt me.

330
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:11,717
Where do you live? Where do you live?

331
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:13,802
-Brooklyn Heights.
-Alone?

332
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:16,304
I live with a friend.

333
00:35:17,223 --> 00:35:18,473
You live alone. Come on, let's go.

334
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:51,626
Leave the stuff.

335
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:00,510
Hey, Kathy.

336
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:05,807
You should have said hello.

337
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,476
-Where is it?
-Here.

338
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,776
"Condor shot us both."

339
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,070
Evidently, that was
the only statement he could make

340
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:21,156
before they took him
into the operating room.

341
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,827
-And the other man, Barber, he's dead?
-Before he hit the ground, Mr. Atwood.

342
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:28,830
You should add that
it was a remarkable shot,

343
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,124
a half inch above his flak jacket.

344
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,001
-I thought this guy was...
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

345
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,712
Was Condor qualified with a handgun?

346
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,968
Two years military service,
Signal Corps.

347
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,222
Telephone lineman, long lines,
switchboard maintenance.

348
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:46,723
Six months overseas.

349
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:50,227
Separated 9/61. Worked at Bell Labs
Communication Research.

350
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:51,561
College on the GI Bill.

351
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:55,065
The question was, Mr. Higgins,
is he qualified with a handgun?

352
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:57,776
No handgun, sir. M1 rifle and carbine.

353
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,779
Evidently, it was sheer luck.

354
00:39:00,863 --> 00:39:02,155
Or else...

355
00:39:03,532 --> 00:39:05,992
-Yes?
-Or else what, Mr. Higgins?

356
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:08,745
This Condor isn't the man
his file says he is.

357
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:10,538
Then where did he learn
evasive moves?

358
00:39:10,623 --> 00:39:12,666
-He reads.
-He...

359
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,084
What the hell does that mean?

360
00:39:14,168 --> 00:39:16,836
It means, sir, that he reads everything.

361
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,507
-I don't understand.
-Yes. Very good.

362
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,511
-Has Operations got anything?
-Absolutely nothing, sir.

363
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,597
-Extraordinary.
-It was very well executed.

364
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:30,892
Which requires planning,
communications, tracks.

365
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,937
I'm not asking for footprints,

366
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:37,607
but a blade of grass, a broken twig,
something disturbed.

367
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:39,234
Yes, sir.

368
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:42,904
-Wicks seems to be all we've got.
-Where do we have him?

369
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:44,239
We don't.

370
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:51,246
They rushed him to Guvenor Emergency
before we got word.

371
00:39:51,414 --> 00:39:53,290
Maybe we should leak
the name of the hospital,

372
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:55,250
try to get Condor to make his move.

373
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:59,129
Of course, Len, don't expect
too many mistakes from this man.

374
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:00,880
After all, he does seem
rather more interesting

375
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:04,259
than just another
of our reader-researchers.

376
00:40:04,343 --> 00:40:08,138
For example,
has he gone into business for himself?

377
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:12,434
Was he turned around?
Does someone operate him?

378
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:16,896
Is he homosexual? Broke? Vulnerable?

379
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:20,150
Could he be a soldier of fortune?

380
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,569
Did he arrange the hit?

381
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:25,780
Is that why he's still in flight?

382
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:28,992
Still, he may be an innocent.

383
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:34,581
But then, why didn't he come in gently
with Mr. Wicks?

384
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:40,670
-Tentrex Industries.
-It's a cover.

385
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:42,464
-For what?
-I work for the CIA.

386
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,424
Oh, Jesus.

387
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:48,845
Your assignment for today
was to go out and kidnap a girl.

388
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:52,098
Look it up. Look it up.
Tentrex Industries.

389
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:57,854
Then look up the number
for the CIA in New York.

390
00:40:57,938 --> 00:40:59,439
You mean they're listed,
like my Aunt Gladys?

391
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:02,359
It's under "US Government Agencies."
Go on.

392
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,616
Is this what you do? This photography?

393
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:12,535
Okay.

394
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:15,622
It's the same number.

395
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,874
-You could have had the card made.
-Yes, I could've made the card

396
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,043
in a machine, but I didn't.

397
00:41:20,336 --> 00:41:22,379
You really get into it, don't you?

398
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:23,755
Sit down!

399
00:41:27,927 --> 00:41:29,969
I told you I had a friend.

400
00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:33,390
15.5, 34.

401
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:36,059
-I dig 15.5, 34s. What size are you?
-What are you, a clown?

402
00:41:36,143 --> 00:41:37,644
-I'm scared!
-So am I!

403
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,187
What are you scared for?
You've got the gun!

404
00:41:39,271 --> 00:41:40,313
Yes!

405
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:45,819
Yeah, and it's not enough.

406
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:03,169
Listen.

407
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:06,923
I work for the CIA. I am not a spy.

408
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,388
I just read books.

409
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:24,315
We read everything
that's published in the world.

410
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:28,403
And we...
We feed the plots, dirty tricks, codes

411
00:42:29,864 --> 00:42:32,365
into a computer, and the computer

412
00:42:32,908 --> 00:42:35,994
checks against actual CIA plans
and operations.

413
00:42:36,537 --> 00:42:39,164
I look for leaks. I look for new ideas.

414
00:42:39,915 --> 00:42:43,585
We read adventures and novels
and journals.

415
00:42:47,756 --> 00:42:49,007
I...

416
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,010
Who'd invent a job like that?

417
00:42:54,388 --> 00:42:55,722
I... Listen!

418
00:42:56,765 --> 00:42:58,683
-People are trying to kill me!
-Who?

419
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:01,227
I don't know, but there's a reason.

420
00:43:02,938 --> 00:43:04,606
There is a reason!

421
00:43:06,275 --> 00:43:07,942
And I just need

422
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,155
some safe, quiet time
to pull things together.

423
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:15,825
-Here.
-Here.

424
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,954
That's only fair.

425
00:43:35,763 --> 00:43:38,097
Where is the guy with the shirts?

426
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:42,769
He's at a ski place,
in the Green Mountains.

427
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,565
We just want to go cross-country skiing

428
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,777
for a couple of weeks,
away from everything.

429
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:58,368
-What time does the news go on, 6:00?
-6:00.

430
00:43:58,452 --> 00:43:59,827
Forty minutes.

431
00:44:16,428 --> 00:44:19,764
-Come here.
-No, please. Please don't.

432
00:44:19,848 --> 00:44:21,140
Lie down.

433
00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:24,936
Lie down. Against the wall.

434
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:29,107
Put this arm behind you,
and keep it there.

435
00:44:31,443 --> 00:44:34,946
Now you listen to me. I am tired.

436
00:44:36,365 --> 00:44:38,992
I've got to close my eyes for a while.

437
00:44:39,535 --> 00:44:41,452
I can't think straight.

438
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:46,791
If you try and move, or climb off the bed,

439
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,003
I'll know it. I'll feel it,

440
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:52,880
and I promise you I'll hurt you.

441
00:44:55,676 --> 00:44:57,719
Couldn't you let me stay
in the other room?

442
00:44:57,803 --> 00:44:58,845
No.

443
00:45:02,141 --> 00:45:04,225
I believe what you told me.

444
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:07,353
No, you don't.

445
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:10,690
I don't know if I do.

446
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,193
That includes Condor, of course.

447
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:16,237
Yes, I owe you Condor.

448
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,532
-Otherwise...
-Otherwise does not exist.

449
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:23,703
Will Condor take long?

450
00:45:24,496 --> 00:45:26,956
-Do you want an estimate?
-There is a time factor.

451
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,916
Always with you people.

452
00:45:31,378 --> 00:45:33,171
Condor is an amateur.

453
00:45:33,422 --> 00:45:35,882
He's lost, unpredictable,

454
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:38,843
perhaps even sentimental.

455
00:45:40,095 --> 00:45:42,305
He could fool a professional.

456
00:45:44,058 --> 00:45:47,352
Not deliberately,
but precisely because he is lost.

457
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,937
He doesn't know what to do.

458
00:45:50,606 --> 00:45:52,065
Unlike Wicks,

459
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,610
who has always been
entirely predictable.

460
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:02,492
The man Condor killed in the alley.

461
00:46:03,077 --> 00:46:04,827
Some friend of his.

462
00:46:05,871 --> 00:46:08,373
-Close friend?
-I suppose so. Why?

463
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:11,000
It interests me. What was his name?

464
00:46:11,085 --> 00:46:12,919
I don't know. He was nobody. He was...

465
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,387
Right.

466
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,555
What about Wicks?

467
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:31,813
You want the firm to question him?

468
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:34,774
They will, you know.

469
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:38,194
We don't want that.

470
00:46:40,114 --> 00:46:41,739
Cost you nothing.

471
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:44,367
I was careless with Condor.

472
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:48,246
Wicks will be done for nothing.

473
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:54,961
-What time is it? What time is it?
-It's news time.

474
00:46:57,506 --> 00:46:58,715
Get up.

475
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,345
Lonely pictures.

476
00:47:49,141 --> 00:47:50,183
So?

477
00:47:53,854 --> 00:47:55,313
You're funny.

478
00:47:57,566 --> 00:48:01,068
You take pictures of empty streets

479
00:48:01,153 --> 00:48:02,862
and trees with no leaves on them.

480
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,157
It's winter.

481
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,326
Not quite winter.

482
00:48:10,537 --> 00:48:12,163
They look like

483
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:15,166
November.

484
00:48:16,043 --> 00:48:18,503
Not autumn, not winter. In-between.

485
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,384
I like them.

486
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:29,972
Thanks.

487
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:32,475
Eyewitness News continues
with an update from...

488
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:33,559
Sit down.

489
00:48:33,602 --> 00:48:35,812
...at the scene of the Ansonia shootings.

490
00:48:37,439 --> 00:48:41,484
The shootings behind the Hotel Ansonia
remain a complete mystery at this hour.

491
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,736
The victims' identities
have not yet been revealed.

492
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,863
-Victims?
-And according to a police spokesman,

493
00:48:45,948 --> 00:48:47,824
-drugs were not involved...
-Did he say victims?

494
00:48:47,908 --> 00:48:49,700
...nor does it seem
to have been a robbery.

495
00:48:49,785 --> 00:48:52,328
Lieutenant, can you tell us anything
about the possible motive?

496
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:54,664
-Not at present.
-Have you identified the victims?

497
00:48:54,748 --> 00:48:57,458
They were employees of
a large insurance company.

498
00:48:57,543 --> 00:48:58,543
What?

499
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:00,962
They were making a routine inspection
for possible violations.

500
00:49:01,046 --> 00:49:03,214
And did the victims know
their assailant or assailants?

501
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:04,674
-Absolutely not.
-Excuse me.

502
00:49:04,758 --> 00:49:08,010
Well, there you have it.
One man dead, one seriously wounded

503
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,346
in an alley on the west side
of Manhattan,

504
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,224
and the man with the gun, still at large.

505
00:49:13,308 --> 00:49:14,475
Stan Roberts, Eyewitness News,

506
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,102
-New York.
-Sam!

507
00:49:19,273 --> 00:49:20,857
Jesus Christ!

508
00:49:21,108 --> 00:49:23,025
Victims. What is he...

509
00:49:25,654 --> 00:49:27,780
What happened in that alley?

510
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:33,202
-I didn't shoot him.
-You said you shot somebody.

511
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:34,704
But not Sam!

512
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,876
Nobody in that alley
said anything about the CIA.

513
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,043
But...

514
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,802
But they were there.

515
00:49:51,847 --> 00:49:54,473
Wait a minute. You're telling me...

516
00:49:54,766 --> 00:49:57,560
They had to have been
to change that story.

517
00:49:57,644 --> 00:49:59,979
Wait a minute. What did Higgins say?
What did Higgins say?

518
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,063
He said he wouldn't be there.

519
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:04,984
He said the section chief
was coming in, the section chief...

520
00:50:05,193 --> 00:50:06,986
Wait a minute. He's...

521
00:50:07,863 --> 00:50:09,447
Section chief would be coming in
from Washington.

522
00:50:09,531 --> 00:50:12,742
He'd have to reach Sam.
Sam would have to call me.

523
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:25,880
Hello?

524
00:50:40,562 --> 00:50:42,980
-I need your car.
-That's called grand theft.

525
00:50:43,065 --> 00:50:45,691
You don't want to get in trouble
with the police.

526
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:51,530
This guy in Vermont, what's
he gonna do when you don't show up?

527
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,574
Probably call very soon now.

528
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,159
Call, or do I have to worry
about him showing up here?

529
00:50:55,243 --> 00:50:56,661
You're not entitled
to personal questions.

530
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:58,120
That gun gives you the right
to rough me up,

531
00:50:58,205 --> 00:50:59,288
it doesn't give you the right to ask me...

532
00:50:59,373 --> 00:51:00,998
Rough you up? Have I roughed you up?

533
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:05,628
-Yes! What are you doing in my house?
-Have I? Have I? Have I raped you?

534
00:51:05,712 --> 00:51:07,421
The night is young.

535
00:51:24,189 --> 00:51:27,108
You don't believe anything I've said,
do you?

536
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:33,072
I believe you're in trouble, danger,

537
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,243
but I don't know what kind,

538
00:51:37,953 --> 00:51:41,414
and I'm not sure
how much of it is made up,

539
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,749
real, but...

540
00:51:44,418 --> 00:51:46,127
Doesn't make any difference.
Doesn't matter.

541
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:47,837
-Just wait a minute. Will you...
-Forget it.

542
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:51,090
I'm trying to understand
what you're saying to me!

543
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,721
What are you doing? Let me go!

544
00:51:59,474 --> 00:52:02,727
You're hurting me. Wait a minute.

545
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:06,272
You bully!

546
00:52:07,149 --> 00:52:09,483
Don't tie me up! Come on, please!

547
00:52:13,238 --> 00:52:14,572
This is

548
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:17,158
unfair.

549
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,410
I know.

550
00:53:31,399 --> 00:53:34,193
Hi, Joey. You're early. Come on in.

551
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:39,532
Hey, is Janice working late?

552
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:44,161
So is Sam.

553
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,502
Hey, pour one for me, too,
will you, Joey?

554
00:53:53,213 --> 00:53:56,757
It's their own fault if we're zonked
when they get here.

555
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:01,762
Hey, I've got it.

556
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:03,848
We'll give them an hour,
and if they're not here,

557
00:54:03,932 --> 00:54:07,059
then it's you and me, babe,
just like old times.

558
00:54:11,565 --> 00:54:12,690
Joey.

559
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,775
What is it?

560
00:54:15,235 --> 00:54:17,153
-Hey, what is it, Joey? What?
-Mae.

561
00:54:18,196 --> 00:54:20,072
-What's wrong?
-Mae.

562
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:22,992
How do you know Sam's working late?

563
00:54:23,368 --> 00:54:25,828
-What do you think he's doing?
-When did he call?

564
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:28,038
I don't know. 2:00 or 2:30.

565
00:54:28,123 --> 00:54:30,207
What did he say? Exactly.

566
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:32,918
He didn't exactly.
He had the center call.

567
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:36,338
-Who at the center?
-I didn't recognize his voice.

568
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:38,924
It wasn't that lady that usually...

569
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,227
Hello?

570
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,815
-What is it?
-Third damn time tonight.

571
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,941
Third time?

572
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,568
It's some creepy burglar
casing the joint.

573
00:54:57,652 --> 00:54:59,486
Mae, I want you to get out of here.

574
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:00,863
-Well, I can't, Joey. I'm cooking.
-Right now.

575
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:01,989
Just do what I tell you, Mae.

576
00:55:02,073 --> 00:55:04,408
-What about dinner?
-Don't ask me. Go to Bill and Eileen's.

577
00:55:04,492 --> 00:55:07,203
-Stay there until I call.
-Joey, what's going on?

578
00:55:07,287 --> 00:55:08,370
Please.

579
00:55:08,455 --> 00:55:11,123
-Joey, you...
-Don't argue. Move! Move!

580
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:14,710
-Joey, this is crazy.
-Go upstairs and stay there.

581
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:18,130
Do what I'm telling you.
I'll call you. And stay there.

582
00:55:18,215 --> 00:55:20,591
-Joey. Joey, you're scaring me.
-I'll call you.

583
00:55:20,675 --> 00:55:23,844
-Do what I'm telling you, please!
-What about Sam?

584
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:18,482
Yours?

585
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:23,988
No.

586
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:33,539
Happy birthday to Grandpa

587
00:56:38,545 --> 00:56:40,754
You're always pushing the buttons.

588
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:43,549
-Would you stop it, would you?
-That's nice.

589
00:56:47,387 --> 00:56:49,930
Fifth floor, ladies' underwear.

590
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,062
Kids.

591
00:56:58,231 --> 00:57:00,441
Probably the same everywhere.

592
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:24,590
This is the second floor.

593
00:57:27,385 --> 00:57:29,219
I do it all the time.

594
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:43,650
-After you.
-No. Go ahead.

595
00:57:47,989 --> 00:57:49,323
Okay.

596
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:30,656
-Anybody here good with a coat hanger?
-What?

597
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,324
I locked my keys in my car.
I need to get in.

598
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:33,909
I'll give you some money,
couple of bucks, okay?

599
00:58:33,993 --> 00:58:35,327
Anybody can get in the car?

600
00:58:35,412 --> 00:58:37,413
Come on, you can't tell me
you've never busted into a car before.

601
00:58:37,497 --> 00:58:39,123
-Okay. I've busted a car. But how much?
-No, come on.

602
00:58:39,207 --> 00:58:41,333
Five bucks.
Five bucks if you help me get in my car.

603
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:43,210
-Five bucks? Why not? Yeah.
-I don't have much time.

604
00:58:43,294 --> 00:58:44,670
-Can you give me a break?
-Yeah.

605
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:47,548
-Do you mind?
-All right. Five bucks. Five bucks.

606
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:50,008
-I'll be right back. Come on, man.
-You can all come.

607
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:52,344
Have some fun.

608
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:11,530
Damn.

609
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,453
Wait a minute.

610
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:20,706
Give me the money.

611
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:23,459
Hey!

612
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,372
I want you to answer the phone.

613
01:00:43,456 --> 01:00:45,666
I'm not going to answer the...

614
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:48,418
I'm not answering any phone!

615
01:00:48,503 --> 01:00:50,295
Answer it. Answer it.

616
01:00:50,463 --> 01:00:53,173
You answer this phone! Tell him
what a brave son of a bitch you are.

617
01:00:53,299 --> 01:00:55,300
Get in there and answer.

618
01:00:56,844 --> 01:00:59,179
I want you to be casual and nice.

619
01:01:04,686 --> 01:01:07,104
-Hello?
-Where the hell are you?

620
01:01:07,939 --> 01:01:10,232
-Ben?
-Who do you think it is?

621
01:01:11,317 --> 01:01:12,484
Ben.

622
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:15,737
You were supposed to
be up here by now.

623
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:18,574
-I know.
-You haven't even left yet.

624
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:20,826
I was held up.

625
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:25,247
Held up? That's no excuse.

626
01:01:25,331 --> 01:01:28,709
Come on, what's going on,
doesn't this trip matter to you?

627
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:31,378
-It matters.
-Yeah, sure.

628
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:33,755
-No, it does.
-Come on. Come on.

629
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,175
This has happened over and over again.
The last minute, some excuse.

630
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,136
No, this is different.

631
01:01:39,304 --> 01:01:40,762
What's the hold up?

632
01:01:43,016 --> 01:01:45,934
-The car.
-What about it?

633
01:01:46,227 --> 01:01:49,521
-Broke down.
-What do you mean? What broke down?

634
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:53,525
-The generator went.
-Oh, Christ, the generator.

635
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:56,361
-That's going to take forever.
-Maybe not.

636
01:01:57,697 --> 01:02:00,282
I tried to call you before, but...

637
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:02,618
The generator... It's...
Look, it's gonna take too long.

638
01:02:02,702 --> 01:02:04,661
Why don't you just...
Look, forget about the car.

639
01:02:04,746 --> 01:02:07,706
Just take the bus up
first thing in the morning.

640
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,041
I'll try.

641
01:02:10,543 --> 01:02:11,710
Try?

642
01:02:12,754 --> 01:02:16,506
What's... What the hell's going on?
Are you okay? What... What's...

643
01:02:16,591 --> 01:02:18,634
No, I'm okay. I'm fine.

644
01:02:20,386 --> 01:02:22,721
You don't sound so fine.

645
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:24,931
I wish you would understand.

646
01:02:26,184 --> 01:02:28,685
I do. I do, I do. It's just...

647
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:32,064
God damn it, I'm just disappointed,
that's all.

648
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,733
I really...

649
01:02:35,026 --> 01:02:40,072
I really wanted to be with you up here,
tonight, babe, you know?

650
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,449
I know.

651
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,496
-We'll have time.
-Yeah.

652
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:50,207
Look, get...

653
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:53,585
Get the very first bus out
in the morning, okay?

654
01:02:54,128 --> 01:02:55,462
All right.

655
01:02:57,924 --> 01:03:00,592
-Good night, sweetheart.
-Good night, babe.

656
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:43,343
Listen, I'll be going in the morning.

657
01:03:48,975 --> 01:03:50,142
Where?

658
01:04:00,153 --> 01:04:01,820
Was it all right?

659
01:04:04,365 --> 01:04:05,699
All right?

660
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:09,035
Outside, was it safe?
Wherever you went.

661
01:04:15,376 --> 01:04:16,835
I'm not sure.

662
01:04:25,303 --> 01:04:26,511
Oh, God.

663
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,016
I wish I knew more.

664
01:04:33,644 --> 01:04:35,020
About you.

665
01:04:37,356 --> 01:04:38,690
Yesterday.

666
01:04:39,859 --> 01:04:41,026
Today.

667
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:44,863
I don't remember yesterday.

668
01:04:47,784 --> 01:04:49,367
Today it rained.

669
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,333
Why did you have to tie me up like that?

670
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:01,713
You thought I'd call the police.

671
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:06,635
I wouldn't have.

672
01:05:09,597 --> 01:05:10,680
Why?

673
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:17,395
Sometimes I take a picture that

674
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:22,359
isn't like me, but I took it,
so it is like me.

675
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:24,569
It has to be.

676
01:05:30,117 --> 01:05:32,160
I put those pictures away.

677
01:05:34,205 --> 01:05:36,331
I'd like to see those pictures.

678
01:05:36,415 --> 01:05:38,875
We don't know each other that well.

679
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:50,095
Do you know anybody that well?

680
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:53,181
I don't think
I want to know you very well.

681
01:05:55,893 --> 01:05:58,770
I don't think
you're gonna live much longer.

682
01:06:01,774 --> 01:06:04,568
Well, I may surprise you.

683
01:06:07,655 --> 01:06:10,198
Anyway, you're not telling the truth.

684
01:06:10,992 --> 01:06:12,617
-What do you mean?
-You'd rather be with somebody

685
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,828
who's not going to live much longer,

686
01:06:14,912 --> 01:06:18,373
at least somebody
who would be on his way.

687
01:06:20,126 --> 01:06:22,419
-I'm not...
-You take pictures,

688
01:06:23,629 --> 01:06:25,380
beautiful pictures,

689
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:28,300
but of empty streets

690
01:06:29,135 --> 01:06:31,553
and trees with no leaves, November.

691
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:35,473
Why haven't you asked me
to untie your hands?

692
01:06:42,315 --> 01:06:44,482
How much do you want?

693
01:06:50,489 --> 01:06:54,326
I just want to stop it.

694
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:03,501
For a few hours.

695
01:07:06,172 --> 01:07:08,214
For the rest of the night.

696
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:13,553
And then I'll go.

697
01:09:52,963 --> 01:09:54,005
Joe!

698
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,207
What was his name?

699
01:10:30,376 --> 01:10:32,418
What is it Higgins said? Was it...

700
01:10:32,503 --> 01:10:34,170
The head of your department
just came here from DC.

701
01:10:34,255 --> 01:10:35,380
He's gonna bring you home.

702
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:36,464
I've never met him.

703
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:46,558
Anything in the early pouch?

704
01:10:48,769 --> 01:10:50,979
Headquarters at Langley
says there's nothing

705
01:10:51,063 --> 01:10:54,607
from any other intelligence source
to support your theory.

706
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:59,821
Headquarters at Langley
says there's nothing

707
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:03,324
from any other intelligence source
to support your theory.

708
01:11:35,983 --> 01:11:37,150
Wicks.

709
01:12:02,801 --> 01:12:05,386
-You didn't sleep well.
-You didn't?

710
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:08,181
No, you didn't.

711
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,309
You're up early.

712
01:12:12,144 --> 01:12:14,479
Well, I had some thoughts.

713
01:12:17,149 --> 01:12:18,775
I've got a plan.

714
01:12:19,693 --> 01:12:22,445
I don't know if it'll work or not, but...

715
01:12:25,282 --> 01:12:27,033
I'll need your help.

716
01:12:27,534 --> 01:12:29,661
Have I ever denied you anything?

717
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:30,828
Hey.

718
01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:37,835
Well, when things quiet down,

719
01:12:39,672 --> 01:12:42,507
you're really a very sweet man
to be with.

720
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:47,971
You had bad dreams.

721
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,640
Talked in your sleep.

722
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:53,893
What did I say?

723
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,521
Who's Janice?

724
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:04,279
Was she a volunteer
or a draftee like me?

725
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:12,412
She was a friend.

726
01:13:13,372 --> 01:13:14,706
She's dead.

727
01:13:20,754 --> 01:13:22,755
Do I have permission to take a shower?

728
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,382
You don't have to help, you know.

729
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,134
No, no. I'll help.

730
01:13:26,385 --> 01:13:29,220
You can always depend
on the old spy-fucker.

731
01:13:34,852 --> 01:13:35,935
Okay.

732
01:13:36,937 --> 01:13:38,104
-I'm sorry.
-No.

733
01:13:38,188 --> 01:13:39,897
No, I didn't mean...

734
01:13:42,276 --> 01:13:44,319
I didn't mean to say that.

735
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:46,237
I'm really sorry.

736
01:13:48,282 --> 01:13:50,074
I'd like to help you.

737
01:14:14,808 --> 01:14:17,060
-Eighteen, isn't that...
-Yes.

738
01:14:19,605 --> 01:14:21,939
AID in ICU, 10-9-8.

739
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:32,450
Yeah?

740
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:35,912
Insured package for Katherine Hale.

741
01:14:40,793 --> 01:14:42,627
Could you leave it out on the stoop?

742
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,962
Somebody's got to sign for it.

743
01:14:45,589 --> 01:14:47,799
Well, she's... She's not here.

744
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:50,134
It's okay, you can sign.

745
01:14:57,476 --> 01:15:00,561
-Yeah?
-Her name on top, yours on the bottom.

746
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,563
All right.

747
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,400
-Wonderful.
-Government pens.

748
01:15:05,484 --> 01:15:07,777
Look, I don't have another pen.

749
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,696
I'll get one.

750
01:16:37,409 --> 01:16:39,660
Don't... Don't... No, no.

751
01:16:39,745 --> 01:16:41,245
No, no. No.

752
01:16:41,497 --> 01:16:43,831
Now listen. You're okay. You're okay.

753
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:46,209
Now listen to me. You're okay.

754
01:16:46,293 --> 01:16:48,586
Can you get dressed? You're okay.

755
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:51,172
Can you get dressed? Please, hurry.

756
01:17:34,925 --> 01:17:36,467
Stella Boutique.

757
01:17:38,136 --> 01:17:40,054
Extension 1891 , please.

758
01:17:41,348 --> 01:17:42,807
Pardon me?

759
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:49,188
Is this 662-3799?

760
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:52,567
-Yes. Who's this?
-There's no extension 1891 ?

761
01:17:52,651 --> 01:17:55,319
Are you kidding? We're lucky
if we have any phone service at all.

762
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:56,571
Sorry.

763
01:18:06,373 --> 01:18:08,082
-Operator.
-Operator.

764
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:11,544
What's the area code
for Washington? DC.

765
01:18:11,837 --> 01:18:13,504
That's 202.

766
01:18:16,008 --> 01:18:17,174
Kathy.

767
01:18:23,724 --> 01:18:25,141
6311.

768
01:18:27,144 --> 01:18:28,603
CIA? Langley?

769
01:18:29,187 --> 01:18:30,605
6311.

770
01:18:32,566 --> 01:18:34,108
Extension 1891.

771
01:18:36,028 --> 01:18:37,403
1891.

772
01:18:38,822 --> 01:18:40,865
Let me speak to Mr. Wicks.

773
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,870
He's not here just now.
May I ask who's calling, please?

774
01:18:46,622 --> 01:18:48,247
How do you feel? You okay?

775
01:18:48,332 --> 01:18:50,625
What did you do to those people?

776
01:18:51,209 --> 01:18:54,420
What people?
I don't know who they are anymore.

777
01:18:54,755 --> 01:18:57,131
I file a report,
and a guy in Washington reads it.

778
01:18:57,215 --> 01:18:59,300
He's supposed to read it.
He's my section chief,

779
01:18:59,384 --> 01:19:01,302
and he comes to New York to shoot me.

780
01:19:01,386 --> 01:19:03,471
-Did you know him?
-No.

781
01:19:04,514 --> 01:19:06,599
Did you know the mailman?

782
01:19:07,392 --> 01:19:09,894
No, but the guy in Washington did.

783
01:19:10,771 --> 01:19:12,146
Then you won't know
the next one, either.

784
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:13,648
I'm not gonna wait for the next one.

785
01:19:13,732 --> 01:19:17,401
-Has he gone double or dirty?
-I don't know, sir.

786
01:19:17,569 --> 01:19:21,113
-You think he's still in New York City?
-I wouldn't be.

787
01:19:21,615 --> 01:19:24,158
Question.
Is there an intelligence network,

788
01:19:24,242 --> 01:19:27,995
undetected by CIA, linking
certain Arabic-speaking countries

789
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,372
with Dutch and Spanish-speaking?

790
01:19:29,581 --> 01:19:32,583
We're already visible.
Let's not become conspicuous.

791
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:35,753
If company agents aren't enough,
use freelance.

792
01:19:36,129 --> 01:19:38,589
Use whatever it requires, but end it.

793
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:50,393
Okay.

794
01:20:01,655 --> 01:20:03,823
Let's get it over with, okay?

795
01:20:06,785 --> 01:20:07,952
Kathy.

796
01:20:09,955 --> 01:20:11,205
Thanks.

797
01:20:33,478 --> 01:20:35,146
Applications here.

798
01:20:39,109 --> 01:20:40,192
Okay.

799
01:20:42,112 --> 01:20:45,573
See Mr. Addison.
Turn right, first door on your left.

800
01:20:47,033 --> 01:20:48,409
Mr. Marcus.

801
01:21:13,685 --> 01:21:16,187
-Mr. Addison?
-No.

802
01:21:17,731 --> 01:21:21,025
He's in Clearance.
You passed it. It's on your left.

803
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:23,694
Sorry.

804
01:21:23,862 --> 01:21:25,196
Thank you.

805
01:22:21,545 --> 01:22:23,712
Yep. I didn't get the job.

806
01:22:28,385 --> 01:22:29,802
Looks good,

807
01:22:29,886 --> 01:22:33,556
but I have this friend,

808
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,641
and he asked me
to give you a message.

809
01:22:35,725 --> 01:22:38,727
Quote, "Dear Mr. Higgins,

810
01:22:38,812 --> 01:22:42,147
this will introduce a friend of mine,
Sparrow Hawk.

811
01:22:43,483 --> 01:22:48,028
Please accompany her to
the Nassau Street exit of this place.

812
01:22:48,947 --> 01:22:50,114
Now."

813
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,410
Personally, I'd do it,

814
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:59,290
because he has this huge gun,
and he's looking at us right now.

815
01:23:01,251 --> 01:23:03,127
I'll save this for you.

816
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:05,129
Shall we?

817
01:23:09,634 --> 01:23:11,468
To your left, please.

818
01:23:32,616 --> 01:23:34,283
Okay, sit up. Sit up!

819
01:23:34,367 --> 01:23:37,161
All the way up.
Back up against the panel.

820
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:40,664
Take it easy. Take it easy.
I'm not armed.

821
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:42,917
They could be DFing us
if you have a transmitter

822
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:44,752
hidden somewhere on your clothes.
What's this?

823
01:23:44,836 --> 01:23:47,087
DF, huh?
You do read everything, don't you?

824
01:23:47,172 --> 01:23:50,215
This is no goddamn book. Somebody
or something is rotten in the company.

825
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,717
You never complained till yesterday.

826
01:23:51,801 --> 01:23:53,928
You didn't start killing my friends
till yesterday.

827
01:23:54,012 --> 01:23:56,639
-Who's she?
-Who hit the Lit Society?

828
01:23:56,765 --> 01:24:00,017
We had a big meeting about that.
Your name came up.

829
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,895
Five Continents Imports. Ring a bell?

830
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:07,775
-Where'd you get that?
-The mailman.

831
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:08,984
-Mailman?
-The one you sent.

832
01:24:09,069 --> 01:24:12,154
You know, the one with the uniform,
cute little leather pouch, automatic gun.

833
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:14,281
-We never use mailmen.
-Would you also happen to be familiar

834
01:24:14,366 --> 01:24:17,701
with a very tall gentleman,
about 6'4", blond hair,

835
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:20,037
strong like a farmer, not American?

836
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:23,499
Accent. Country, near Germany.
Maybe Alsace-Lorraine?

837
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,611
-Yes?
-Was the letter delivered?

838
01:24:53,405 --> 01:24:55,906
The return receipt has not arrived.

839
01:24:56,116 --> 01:24:58,701
You should've delivered it yourself.

840
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:01,829
A more complicated package
had to be handled.

841
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:05,249
But I might have
underestimated this one.

842
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:08,460
I was told you never make
that kind of mistake.

843
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:11,755
-What will you do?
-Wait.

844
01:25:12,382 --> 01:25:13,632
For what?

845
01:25:14,592 --> 01:25:18,220
People who move
leave word of change-of-address.

846
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:21,181
-I wanna see that report, Turner.
-No, no, Higgins, come on.

847
01:25:21,266 --> 01:25:22,558
-Do you know him?
-Professionally, yes.

848
01:25:22,642 --> 01:25:25,394
-Professionally, he kills people.
-Yes.

849
01:25:25,603 --> 01:25:26,645
Yes.

850
01:25:27,063 --> 01:25:28,272
He works for the company?

851
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:30,524
He did once. He's a contract agent.

852
01:25:30,608 --> 01:25:32,735
-Contract agent.
-Freelance.

853
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,696
Where did you see him?

854
01:25:39,909 --> 01:25:42,828
-It would help if I knew.
-Who would it help?

855
01:25:42,912 --> 01:25:44,413
-Who'd hire him now?
-Anybody.

856
01:25:44,497 --> 01:25:46,123
Terrific answer!

857
01:25:47,459 --> 01:25:49,960
-I wouldn't accept it, either.
-What's his name?

858
01:25:50,045 --> 01:25:52,046
When I knew him, Joubert.

859
01:25:52,505 --> 01:25:53,547
Come on, Higgins. Who'd hire him?

860
01:25:53,631 --> 01:25:55,049
You don't look up Joubert
in the Yellow Pages.

861
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:56,592
That's right.

862
01:25:57,469 --> 01:26:00,179
It would have to be
somebody in the community.

863
01:26:00,263 --> 01:26:02,181
-Community?
-Intelligence field.

864
01:26:02,265 --> 01:26:06,060
Community! Jesus, you guys are
kind to yourselves. Community.

865
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,813
I want to see that report, Turner.

866
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:13,108
That report was sent to headquarters
and disappeared.

867
01:26:13,193 --> 01:26:15,819
-Who read it?
-You mean besides Wicks?

868
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,156
You tell me.

869
01:26:22,994 --> 01:26:25,412
I pick up traces of what
I think's an intelligence network

870
01:26:25,497 --> 01:26:27,790
the company doesn't know about,

871
01:26:28,124 --> 01:26:29,541
and I report it.

872
01:26:29,626 --> 01:26:32,920
Now, why is that going to
make anybody mad, Higgins?

873
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:35,964
Unless it was the company's network
and you didn't want it blown,

874
01:26:36,049 --> 01:26:38,092
not even to your own guys.

875
01:26:39,094 --> 01:26:41,512
Now, somebody is lying, Higgins.

876
01:26:41,971 --> 01:26:43,180
Come on.

877
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:46,225
Why is everybody so shy?

878
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,019
I'm not shy.

879
01:26:51,356 --> 01:26:53,941
I don't know. That's what worries me.

880
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,861
-I don't know.
-Ask Wicks.

881
01:26:58,154 --> 01:26:59,530
Wicks died.

882
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:07,788
Someone yanked him off the life
support system at Guvenor Hospital.

883
01:27:18,049 --> 01:27:19,758
Get me in, Higgins.

884
01:27:21,761 --> 01:27:24,304
What good would that do
if you're right, and they are inside?

885
01:27:24,389 --> 01:27:27,015
What good would it do to bring you in?

886
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,769
What am I supposed to do?

887
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:34,523
I'm sorry.

888
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,401
You're sorry?

889
01:27:44,617 --> 01:27:46,076
You're sorry.

890
01:27:49,914 --> 01:27:51,206
I get it.

891
01:27:53,126 --> 01:27:55,669
I get it. You expect me to draw fire,

892
01:27:56,713 --> 01:27:58,463
like one of those penny arcade bears

893
01:27:58,548 --> 01:28:00,716
that parades back and forth,
waiting for somebody,

894
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,218
somebody very good,
just to take another shot.

895
01:28:03,243 --> 01:28:04,571
And you're just gonna hang around

896
01:28:04,596 --> 01:28:06,638
and pick him up before he does it,
or just after?

897
01:28:06,663 --> 01:28:08,408
I'm gonna try
and find out what's going on.

898
01:28:08,433 --> 01:28:09,975
I'm gonna cross-check all those names.

899
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,518
-Nice talking to you, Higgins.
-Now wait a minute.

900
01:28:11,543 --> 01:28:12,871
-Have a nice day.
-Where are you going?

901
01:28:12,896 --> 01:28:14,688
Where will I find you?

902
01:28:14,772 --> 01:28:15,772
I'll find you.

903
01:28:25,116 --> 01:28:26,742
Do you trust him?

904
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:28,619
Trust.

905
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,621
Does he trust you?

906
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,706
He's in the suspicion business.
He can't trust anybody.

907
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:35,375
But they all are. How could
anybody sneak in and fool them?

908
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,127
Maybe nobody did.

909
01:28:37,587 --> 01:28:38,795
Then...

910
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,923
Maybe there's another CIA

911
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,592
inside the CIA.

912
01:29:07,825 --> 01:29:09,076
Hey, Sal.

913
01:29:09,994 --> 01:29:12,704
The lights went off. Come on over here.

914
01:29:14,457 --> 01:29:16,333
The generator went off.

915
01:29:19,671 --> 01:29:22,172
-It's a hotel room.
-What hotel?

916
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:26,051
There's no tag.
It's Room 819, City of New York.

917
01:29:26,261 --> 01:29:28,512
There's a code number cut in the edge.

918
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:30,222
You in the trade?

919
01:29:30,974 --> 01:29:34,268
-I read about it in a story.
-Was the story about locksmiths?

920
01:29:34,352 --> 01:29:38,021
It's the lock manufacturer's code.
He can give you the name of the hotel.

921
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:41,191
Look, I don't want to read
about you in the paper, sonny.

922
01:29:41,276 --> 01:29:43,193
Will you make the call?

923
01:30:21,524 --> 01:30:22,566
Yes?

924
01:30:24,193 --> 01:30:25,944
I'm doing a survey.

925
01:30:27,071 --> 01:30:29,906
Do you believe the Condor is
really an endangered species?

926
01:30:51,387 --> 01:30:53,680
-Your room number, please.
-819.

927
01:30:59,604 --> 01:31:01,021
-Hello?
-Yes.

928
01:31:01,105 --> 01:31:03,690
-I just had an interesting call.
-Who is this?

929
01:31:03,775 --> 01:31:07,110
In reference to an all but extinct bird,
the condor.

930
01:31:07,403 --> 01:31:10,364
-Have you had such a call?
-You're a fool to call me here.

931
01:31:10,448 --> 01:31:12,949
-You had no such call?
-No.

932
01:31:13,618 --> 01:31:15,869
Must have been the Audubon Society.

933
01:31:15,953 --> 01:31:19,081
I assume they're still located
in New York City.

934
01:31:23,127 --> 01:31:26,546
Langley Computer.
State your program at the tone.

935
01:31:27,048 --> 01:31:28,048
G.

936
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,384
Carriage return.

937
01:31:31,302 --> 01:31:32,803
TRS. Tone.

938
01:31:34,097 --> 01:31:35,764
Symbol for number.

939
01:31:36,933 --> 01:31:38,934
Computer is ready.

940
01:31:48,444 --> 01:31:52,989
That number is 202-227-0098.

941
01:32:10,007 --> 01:32:13,593
-CNA, Mrs. Coleman speaking.
-This is Harold Thomas, Mrs. Coleman.

942
01:32:13,678 --> 01:32:16,304
Customer service, requesting a CNA on

943
01:32:16,389 --> 01:32:21,852
202-227-0098.

944
01:32:22,437 --> 01:32:24,312
One moment, please.

945
01:32:26,858 --> 01:32:29,443
That would be a Mr. Leonard Atwood.

946
01:32:29,861 --> 01:32:33,321
365 Mackenzie Place,
Chevy Chase, Maryland.

947
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:11,151
All right.

948
01:33:11,235 --> 01:33:14,988
Cross-check this tape against Wicks
and hold any intersects.

949
01:33:26,542 --> 01:33:27,792
Hat size.

950
01:33:34,217 --> 01:33:35,425
"Lucifer."

951
01:33:36,385 --> 01:33:38,261
All right, run Lucifer.

952
01:33:38,596 --> 01:33:39,930
Coming up.

953
01:34:01,577 --> 01:34:04,788
I'll be damned. I'll be damned.

954
01:34:57,174 --> 01:34:59,509
-This is the Major.
-Condor.

955
01:34:59,677 --> 01:35:01,428
Find me Higgins.

956
01:35:01,929 --> 01:35:04,139
Routing you, Condor. Stand by.

957
01:35:10,021 --> 01:35:11,521
Hello, Condor.

958
01:35:11,606 --> 01:35:15,108
-The Holiday Inn, 57th Street.
-Is that where you are now?

959
01:35:15,192 --> 01:35:19,529
Room 819. If you move it, you'll find
the Alsatian gentleman we spoke of.

960
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:20,864
Where are you, Condor?

961
01:35:21,824 --> 01:35:23,366
Where are you?

962
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,036
Quiet down.

963
01:35:27,163 --> 01:35:28,163
Hey, Higgins?

964
01:35:28,914 --> 01:35:30,707
Yeah, I'm right here.

965
01:35:32,043 --> 01:35:33,376
Who is Leonard Atwood?

966
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:44,512
Where are you, Higgins?

967
01:35:49,727 --> 01:35:51,561
Ain't we pals anymore?

968
01:35:54,899 --> 01:35:56,900
-Something?
-Major?

969
01:35:57,693 --> 01:35:59,903
-Got him.
-Let me see that.

970
01:36:02,948 --> 01:36:05,075
What's he doing in Brooklyn?

971
01:36:05,284 --> 01:36:06,493
Condor.

972
01:36:06,911 --> 01:36:09,079
-We can get a unit...
-Wait.

973
01:36:17,213 --> 01:36:21,299
-What's going on, Major?
-Son of bitch wired together 50 phones.

974
01:36:21,384 --> 01:36:22,425
What?

975
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:25,512
Everybody in Brooklyn's
talking to each other.

976
01:36:43,614 --> 01:36:44,698
I didn't know you smoked.

977
01:36:44,782 --> 01:36:46,783
I quit three years ago.

978
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:52,038
-You're so pale.
-It's the light in here.

979
01:36:56,836 --> 01:36:58,962
What are you gonna do there?

980
01:36:59,922 --> 01:37:02,006
-See a guy.
-More secrets.

981
01:37:02,758 --> 01:37:04,968
Like those pictures you hide.

982
01:37:06,178 --> 01:37:07,303
Yes.

983
01:37:08,514 --> 01:37:11,683
Someday, I'd like to show them to you,

984
01:37:13,352 --> 01:37:15,353
if you live through this.

985
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:19,315
You could drive me to Washington.

986
01:37:25,698 --> 01:37:27,240
No, I couldn't.

987
01:37:30,786 --> 01:37:35,415
You...
You have a lot of very fine qualities,

988
01:37:37,501 --> 01:37:38,626
but...

989
01:37:38,961 --> 01:37:40,712
What fine qualities?

990
01:37:49,388 --> 01:37:51,139
You have good eyes.

991
01:37:52,975 --> 01:37:57,145
Not kind, but they don't lie,

992
01:37:57,229 --> 01:37:59,481
and they don't look away much,

993
01:38:00,107 --> 01:38:02,317
and they don't miss anything.

994
01:38:04,403 --> 01:38:06,529
I could use eyes like that.

995
01:38:08,866 --> 01:38:11,075
But you're overdue in Vermont.

996
01:38:17,666 --> 01:38:19,334
Is he a tough guy?

997
01:38:20,878 --> 01:38:22,545
He's pretty tough.

998
01:38:24,507 --> 01:38:26,090
What will he do?

999
01:38:27,218 --> 01:38:29,052
Understand, probably.

1000
01:38:31,555 --> 01:38:34,390
Boy, that is tough.

1001
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:37,393
Last call, track six, Newark connection

1002
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:40,730
passengers for Baltimore
and Washington DC, all aboard.

1003
01:38:44,568 --> 01:38:47,070
Kathy, I need time.

1004
01:38:48,948 --> 01:38:50,949
Eight hours or so, that's all.
Just till noon.

1005
01:38:51,033 --> 01:38:52,992
To do what I have to do.

1006
01:38:54,119 --> 01:38:57,747
-Do you understand what I'm saying?
-No.

1007
01:38:57,832 --> 01:39:00,124
Are you going right to Vermont?

1008
01:39:01,919 --> 01:39:02,961
Yes.

1009
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:07,090
What I mean is don't call anyone.

1010
01:39:09,426 --> 01:39:11,135
Don't stop, please.

1011
01:39:12,721 --> 01:39:14,764
Don't tell anyone about...

1012
01:39:24,483 --> 01:39:25,984
-Jesus.
-What?

1013
01:39:26,944 --> 01:39:28,111
Jesus.

1014
01:39:28,654 --> 01:39:30,154
I... I didn't...

1015
01:39:30,322 --> 01:39:31,823
All aboard!

1016
01:39:33,284 --> 01:39:34,367
Hey.

1017
01:39:35,953 --> 01:39:37,996
You take care of yourself.

1018
01:39:38,414 --> 01:39:39,998
I'll do my best.

1019
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:43,459
Do your best.

1020
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:55,597
Why aren't you further along,
Mr. Higgins?

1021
01:39:55,681 --> 01:39:57,181
You mean with the company, sir?

1022
01:39:57,266 --> 01:39:59,225
You seem perfect for it.

1023
01:40:02,104 --> 01:40:04,647
Are you perfect for it, Mr. Higgins?

1024
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:08,192
I have tried to be, sir.

1025
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:11,487
-You were recruited out of school?
-No, sir.

1026
01:40:11,655 --> 01:40:14,407
Company interviewed
a few of us in Korea.

1027
01:40:14,658 --> 01:40:18,036
You served with Colonel Donovan
in the OSS, didn't you, sir?

1028
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,831
I sailed the Adriatic
with a movie star at the helm.

1029
01:40:23,709 --> 01:40:27,170
Doesn't seem like much of a war now,
but it was.

1030
01:40:28,839 --> 01:40:31,215
I go even further back than that.

1031
01:40:31,342 --> 01:40:35,011
Ten years after the Great War,
as we used to call it,

1032
01:40:36,472 --> 01:40:39,015
before we knew enough
to number them.

1033
01:40:39,934 --> 01:40:41,726
You miss that kind of action, sir?

1034
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:42,852
No.

1035
01:40:44,355 --> 01:40:46,522
I miss that kind of clarity.

1036
01:40:51,028 --> 01:40:52,111
Yes?

1037
01:40:54,573 --> 01:40:55,907
Thank you.

1038
01:40:57,701 --> 01:41:00,203
He's being held at New York Center.

1039
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:10,129
Mr. Higgins, you do understand
the company's position.

1040
01:41:12,925 --> 01:41:16,052
There's nothing in the way
of your doing this, is there?

1041
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:00,680
What is this?

1042
01:42:00,806 --> 01:42:02,432
What's going on?

1043
01:42:21,171 --> 01:42:22,671
Who are you?

1044
01:42:32,182 --> 01:42:33,702
Who are you?

1045
01:42:34,703 --> 01:42:36,662
What are you doing here?

1046
01:42:38,135 --> 01:42:39,510
I'm Condor.

1047
01:42:43,474 --> 01:42:44,724
Sit down.

1048
01:42:46,643 --> 01:42:48,770
What do you do for a living?

1049
01:42:49,313 --> 01:42:51,647
-Don't be ridiculous.
-No.

1050
01:42:52,983 --> 01:42:56,444
What do you do exactly?

1051
01:42:59,615 --> 01:43:01,866
Deputy Director of Operations.

1052
01:43:03,619 --> 01:43:05,078
What section?

1053
01:43:05,788 --> 01:43:07,163
Middle East.

1054
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:11,375
What are you working on?

1055
01:43:13,879 --> 01:43:15,630
What are you doing?

1056
01:43:17,341 --> 01:43:21,177
What's the secret worth murdering
everybody at the ALHS house?

1057
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:24,430
-There's no secret.
-Wicks showed you my report.

1058
01:43:24,515 --> 01:43:26,182
What report? Yes.

1059
01:43:32,356 --> 01:43:34,690
It was your network I turned up.

1060
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:41,781
Doing what?

1061
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:46,994
What does Operations care
about a bunch of goddamn books?

1062
01:43:47,079 --> 01:43:48,704
A book in Dutch.

1063
01:43:49,998 --> 01:43:51,958
A book out of Venezuela.

1064
01:43:52,417 --> 01:43:53,960
-Mystery stories in Arabic.
-Wait.

1065
01:43:54,044 --> 01:43:56,671
What the hell is so important about...

1066
01:44:02,761 --> 01:44:04,137
Oil fields.

1067
01:44:08,725 --> 01:44:09,809
Oil.

1068
01:44:22,281 --> 01:44:24,073
That's it, isn't it?

1069
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:31,747
This whole damn thing was about oil.

1070
01:44:33,876 --> 01:44:35,668
Wasn't it? Wasn't it?

1071
01:44:37,421 --> 01:44:38,796
Yes, it was.

1072
01:44:40,591 --> 01:44:42,550
Don't turn for a moment.

1073
01:44:43,177 --> 01:44:45,761
Put your thumb in front of the hammer.

1074
01:44:51,101 --> 01:44:52,768
Release it slowly.

1075
01:44:56,607 --> 01:44:58,774
Set down the gun on the desk.

1076
01:45:05,115 --> 01:45:06,616
And don't move.

1077
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:19,629
Back up.

1078
01:45:26,303 --> 01:45:29,013
You were quite good, Condor, until this.

1079
01:45:32,184 --> 01:45:34,227
This move was predictable.

1080
01:45:36,521 --> 01:45:37,605
Hey!

1081
01:45:59,253 --> 01:46:03,339
What?

1082
01:46:03,966 --> 01:46:06,676
Did you touch anything
except the chair?

1083
01:46:08,345 --> 01:46:10,888
You're working for the company again.

1084
01:46:11,348 --> 01:46:12,598
The desk?

1085
01:46:12,849 --> 01:46:14,100
The lamp?

1086
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:17,645
Jesus. They took you back.

1087
01:46:19,314 --> 01:46:21,899
Just for this. For Atwood.

1088
01:46:24,027 --> 01:46:26,946
How... He's with the company. Why?

1089
01:46:28,532 --> 01:46:30,283
I don't interest myself in why.

1090
01:46:30,367 --> 01:46:32,618
I think more often in terms of when,

1091
01:46:32,703 --> 01:46:34,287
sometimes where,

1092
01:46:34,579 --> 01:46:36,205
always how much.

1093
01:46:37,666 --> 01:46:40,876
I suspect he was about to
become an embarrassment,

1094
01:46:42,504 --> 01:46:43,879
as you are.

1095
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:53,472
So you're not finished.

1096
01:46:53,557 --> 01:46:54,557
Pardon?

1097
01:46:54,641 --> 01:46:58,477
Oh, no. I have no arrangement
with the company concerning you.

1098
01:46:58,562 --> 01:47:01,939
They didn't know you'd be here.
I knew you'd be here.

1099
01:47:07,154 --> 01:47:09,488
But didn't you send the mailman?

1100
01:47:09,865 --> 01:47:12,742
That was a business arrangement
with Atwood.

1101
01:47:12,951 --> 01:47:14,577
But you see...

1102
01:47:21,585 --> 01:47:22,793
Come on.

1103
01:47:31,011 --> 01:47:32,094
Come.

1104
01:48:06,213 --> 01:48:08,130
Tell me about the girl.

1105
01:48:11,635 --> 01:48:13,386
What about the girl?

1106
01:48:14,888 --> 01:48:16,889
She was chosen how?

1107
01:48:18,642 --> 01:48:19,850
By age?

1108
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:22,603
Her car? Appearance?

1109
01:48:22,687 --> 01:48:24,021
At random.

1110
01:48:25,482 --> 01:48:26,649
Chance.

1111
01:48:26,817 --> 01:48:27,983
Really?

1112
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:33,322
Can I drop you?

1113
01:48:39,162 --> 01:48:41,497
I'd like to go back to New York.

1114
01:48:44,501 --> 01:48:46,836
You have not much future there.

1115
01:48:52,676 --> 01:48:54,844
It would happen this way.

1116
01:48:55,804 --> 01:48:57,513
You may be walking.

1117
01:48:59,015 --> 01:49:02,309
Maybe the first sunny day of the spring,

1118
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,855
and a car will slow beside you,

1119
01:49:06,690 --> 01:49:07,940
and the door will open,

1120
01:49:08,024 --> 01:49:11,110
and someone you know,
maybe even trust,

1121
01:49:11,862 --> 01:49:13,863
will get out of the car.

1122
01:49:15,574 --> 01:49:18,659
And he will smile, a becoming smile,

1123
01:49:20,912 --> 01:49:23,747
but he will leave open
the door of the car

1124
01:49:25,584 --> 01:49:27,835
and offer to give you a lift.

1125
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:36,427
You seem to understand it all so well.

1126
01:49:39,347 --> 01:49:41,223
What would you suggest?

1127
01:49:42,184 --> 01:49:44,310
Personally, I prefer Europe.

1128
01:49:44,853 --> 01:49:46,395
-Europe?
-Yes.

1129
01:49:47,856 --> 01:49:52,401
Well, the fact is,
what I do is not a bad occupation.

1130
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:55,654
Someone is always willing to pay.

1131
01:50:00,494 --> 01:50:04,246
I would find it tiring.

1132
01:50:05,081 --> 01:50:08,417
Oh, no. It's quite restful.
It's almost peaceful.

1133
01:50:09,586 --> 01:50:12,588
No need to believe in either side
or any side.

1134
01:50:13,298 --> 01:50:14,965
There is no cause.

1135
01:50:15,592 --> 01:50:17,426
There's only yourself.

1136
01:50:18,428 --> 01:50:20,930
The belief is in your own precision.

1137
01:50:26,728 --> 01:50:29,438
I was born in the United States, Joubert.

1138
01:50:31,691 --> 01:50:34,026
I miss it when I'm away too long.

1139
01:50:35,111 --> 01:50:36,278
A pity.

1140
01:50:39,533 --> 01:50:41,158
I don't think so.

1141
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:47,289
Is it any trouble to drop me
at the Union Station?

1142
01:50:47,374 --> 01:50:48,582
Oh, no.

1143
01:50:49,042 --> 01:50:51,001
It would be my pleasure.

1144
01:50:59,511 --> 01:51:00,970
For that day.

1145
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:27,079
Higgins!

1146
01:51:44,973 --> 01:51:47,558
Turner. Why'd you call so late?
We were worried about you.

1147
01:51:47,642 --> 01:51:49,435
Likewise. The car for me?

1148
01:51:49,519 --> 01:51:52,896
Yeah, it's all right. It's safe.
You have a few hours of debriefing.

1149
01:51:52,981 --> 01:51:54,857
-Hey, Higgins?
-Yeah?

1150
01:51:56,318 --> 01:51:59,612
Let's say for the purposes of argument,

1151
01:51:59,696 --> 01:52:02,072
I had a .45 in one of my pockets.

1152
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:07,870
And I wanted you to take a walk
with me. You'd do it, right?

1153
01:52:08,788 --> 01:52:10,122
Which way?

1154
01:52:11,207 --> 01:52:12,291
West.

1155
01:52:13,168 --> 01:52:14,501
Slowly.

1156
01:52:14,586 --> 01:52:17,588
Stay in front of me about three
or four steps.

1157
01:52:25,972 --> 01:52:27,723
Where are we going?

1158
01:52:29,059 --> 01:52:30,768
Wave them on ahead, Higgins.

1159
01:52:41,112 --> 01:52:43,947
Do we have plans
to invade the Middle East?

1160
01:52:44,616 --> 01:52:46,533
-Are you crazy?
-Am I?

1161
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:48,786
-Look, Turner...
-Do we have plans?

1162
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:51,038
No. Absolutely not.

1163
01:52:51,748 --> 01:52:53,791
We have games. That's all.

1164
01:52:54,501 --> 01:52:56,585
We play games. What if?

1165
01:52:57,253 --> 01:52:59,588
How many men? What would it take?

1166
01:53:00,256 --> 01:53:03,258
Is there a cheaper way
to destabilize a regime?

1167
01:53:03,343 --> 01:53:05,177
That's what we're paid to do.

1168
01:53:05,261 --> 01:53:06,512
Walk on.

1169
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:08,597
Go on.

1170
01:53:13,103 --> 01:53:15,396
So Atwood just took
the games too seriously.

1171
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:18,190
He was really going to do it, wasn't he?

1172
01:53:18,441 --> 01:53:20,234
A renegade operation.

1173
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:22,879
Atwood knew 54-12
would never authorize it.

1174
01:53:22,904 --> 01:53:24,905
There was no way,
not with the heat on the company.

1175
01:53:24,989 --> 01:53:26,490
What if there hadn't been any heat?

1176
01:53:26,574 --> 01:53:30,202
Supposing I hadn't stumbled
on their plan, say nobody had.

1177
01:53:31,329 --> 01:53:33,080
Different ballgame.

1178
01:53:33,498 --> 01:53:36,458
Fact is,
there was nothing wrong with the plan.

1179
01:53:36,543 --> 01:53:39,712
The plan was all right.
The plan would've worked.

1180
01:53:41,464 --> 01:53:43,799
Boy, what is it with you people?

1181
01:53:43,925 --> 01:53:47,511
Do you think not getting caught on a lie
is the same thing as telling the truth?

1182
01:53:47,595 --> 01:53:49,888
No. It's simple economics.

1183
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:52,266
Today it's oil, right?

1184
01:53:52,434 --> 01:53:57,271
In 10 or 15 years, food, plutonium,
and maybe even sooner.

1185
01:53:57,355 --> 01:54:01,442
Now, what do you think the people
are going to want us to do then?

1186
01:54:01,985 --> 01:54:02,985
Ask them.

1187
01:54:03,069 --> 01:54:06,238
Not now. Then.
Ask them when they're running out.

1188
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:09,450
Ask them when there's no heat
in their homes, and they're cold.

1189
01:54:09,534 --> 01:54:11,452
Ask them when their engines stop.

1190
01:54:11,536 --> 01:54:15,038
Ask them when people who've never
known hunger start going hungry.

1191
01:54:15,123 --> 01:54:16,415
You want to know something?

1192
01:54:16,499 --> 01:54:20,627
They won't want us to ask them.
They'll just want us to get it for them.

1193
01:54:21,671 --> 01:54:24,882
Boy, have you found a home.

1194
01:54:27,761 --> 01:54:29,595
Seven people killed, Higgins.

1195
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:32,598
-The company didn't order it.
-Atwood did.

1196
01:54:32,891 --> 01:54:34,266
Atwood did.

1197
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:37,936
And who the hell is Atwood?
He's you. He's all you guys.

1198
01:54:38,021 --> 01:54:39,813
Seven people killed!

1199
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:42,941
-And you play fucking games!
-Right.

1200
01:54:44,235 --> 01:54:46,445
And the other side does, too.

1201
01:54:46,821 --> 01:54:49,531
That's why we can't let you stay outside.

1202
01:54:49,657 --> 01:54:53,118
Well, go on home, Higgins.
Go on. They've got it.

1203
01:54:54,704 --> 01:54:55,954
-What?
-You know where we are.

1204
01:54:56,039 --> 01:54:59,875
Just look around. They've got it.
That's where they ship from.

1205
01:55:00,001 --> 01:55:01,877
They've got all of it.

1206
01:55:12,013 --> 01:55:13,889
What? What did you do?

1207
01:55:14,057 --> 01:55:15,891
I told them a story.

1208
01:55:16,059 --> 01:55:19,269
You play games, I told them a story.

1209
01:55:27,946 --> 01:55:29,321
You...

1210
01:55:30,156 --> 01:55:32,407
You poor, dumb son of a bitch.

1211
01:55:33,743 --> 01:55:36,161
You done more damage than you know.

1212
01:55:38,414 --> 01:55:39,748
I hope so.

1213
01:55:48,258 --> 01:55:50,884
You're about to be a very lonely man.

1214
01:55:54,347 --> 01:55:56,348
It didn't have to end this way.

1215
01:55:56,432 --> 01:55:58,058
Of course it did.

1216
01:56:00,770 --> 01:56:02,271
Hey, Turner.

1217
01:56:04,315 --> 01:56:06,817
How do you know they'll print it?

1218
01:56:08,486 --> 01:56:10,279
You can take a walk,

1219
01:56:11,239 --> 01:56:13,782
but how far if they don't print it?

1220
01:56:13,908 --> 01:56:15,534
They'll print it.

1221
01:56:17,036 --> 01:56:18,704
How do you know?
