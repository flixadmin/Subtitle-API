1
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,604
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

2
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,171
This is crazy. What did I do?

3
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,358
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

4
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,593
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

5
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,969
We can talk, sir.

6
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,848
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

7
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,934
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

8
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,538
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

9
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,023
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

10
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,585
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,194
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,406
Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh. Hey!

13
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,950
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

14
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,412
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

15
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,040
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,708
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,668
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,464
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,468
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,804
All right.

21
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,231
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,684
Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,637
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,814
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,277
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

26
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,868
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

27
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,952
What have we got?

28
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,289
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,500
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

30
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,382
Son of a bitch!

31
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,719
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

32
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,708
Whoa!

33
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,509
Tony Stark.

34
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,555
Visionary. Genius.

35
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,766
American patriot.

36
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,726
Even from an early age,

37
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,228
the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

38
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:34,065
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

39
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,359
At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

40
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,279
At age six, his first engine.

41
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,950
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

42
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,287
Then, the passing of a titan.

43
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,083
Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

44
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,587
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

45
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,049
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns

46
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,344
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

47
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,179
With the keys to the kingdom,

48
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,765
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

49
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,852
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

50
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,773
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

51
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,901
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

52
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,986
and her interests around the globe.

53
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,164
As liaison to Stark Industries,

54
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,252
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

55
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:39,339
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

56
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,008
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

57
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:46,388
to present this year's Apogee Award
to Mr. Tony Stark.

58
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,645
Tony?

59
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,119
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

60
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,623
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

61
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,125
This is wonderful.

62
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,378
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

63
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:25,760
But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel

64
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,932
and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.

65
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,976
Tony, you know...

66
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,563
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

67
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,440
He's always working.

68
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,066
Work it!

69
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,861
Come on!

70
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:51,161
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

71
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,289
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

72
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,766
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

73
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,460
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

74
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,521
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

75
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,255
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

76
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,059
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

77
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,926
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

78
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,345
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

79
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,822
I don't have any of those
floating around.

80
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,348
We're gonna let it ride!

81
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,328
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

82
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,436
Okay, you, too.

83
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,372
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

84
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,191
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

85
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,525
Two craps. Line away.

86
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,462
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

87
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,255
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

88
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,423
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

89
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,448
Tomorrow, don't be late.

90
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,675
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

91
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,699
I know, I know.

92
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,037
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

93
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,461
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

94
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,089
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

95
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,090
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

96
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,800
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

97
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,759
- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,427
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

99
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,773
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

100
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,613
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

101
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,571
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

102
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,519
"The Merchant of Death"?

103
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,602
That's not bad.

104
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,233
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

105
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,485
Well, Ms. Brown,

106
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,655
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

107
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,175
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

108
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,319
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Rehearse that much?

110
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,472
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

111
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,496
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand.

112
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,834
All I want is a serious answer.

113
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,503
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

114
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,755
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy.”

115
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,216
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

116
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,177
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

117
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,346
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

118
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,306
would call that being a hero.

119
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,493
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

120
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,787
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

121
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,563
by advancing medical technology

122
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,732
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

123
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,569
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

124
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,862
Wow.

125
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,785
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

126
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,407
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

127
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,631
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

128
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,010
The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

129
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,430
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

130
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,974
High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

131
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,492
Tony?

132
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,287
Hey, Tony?

133
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,353
You are not authorized
to access this area.

134
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,730
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

135
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,442
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

136
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,236
and there's a car waiting for you outside

137
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,238
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

138
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,617
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

139
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,330
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

140
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,042
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

141
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,962
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

142
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,588
Will that be all?

143
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,522
Give me an exploded view.

144
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,360
The compression in
cylinder three appears to be low.

145
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,027
Log that.

146
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,052
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

147
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,076
I'll keep you posted.

148
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,013
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

149
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,373
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

150
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,934
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

151
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,727
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

152
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,004
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

153
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,648
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

154
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,358
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

155
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,258
before I get you out of the door.

156
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,094
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

157
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,321
if it departs before you arrive?

158
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,557
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

159
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,058
Do you want it? Yes or no.

160
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,436
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

161
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,856
Um, no. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

162
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,232
where he lived and worked,

163
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,901
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

164
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:37,238
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

165
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,700
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

166
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:44,120
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

167
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,891
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

168
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,292
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

169
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,020
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

170
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,146
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

171
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,356
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

172
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,020
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

173
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,676
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

174
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,637
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

175
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,804
I knew that. Already?

176
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,892
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

177
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,229
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

178
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,940
- And?
- It was very nice.

179
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,526
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

180
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,278
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

181
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,533
Okay.

182
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,264
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

183
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,893
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

184
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,310
I got you. I got you.

185
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,729
What's wrong with you?

186
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,731
- What?
- Three hours.

187
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,733
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

188
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,236
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

189
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,196
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

190
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,116
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

191
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,002
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

192
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,129
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

193
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,965
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

194
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,276
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

195
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,735
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

196
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,945
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

197
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,405
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

198
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,763
You don't respect yourself,

199
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,741
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

200
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,641
I'm just your babysitter.

201
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,227
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

202
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,479
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

203
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,231
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

204
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,750
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

205
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,526
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

206
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,795
You can't have sashimi without sake.

207
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,820
You are constitutionally

208
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,447
incapable of being responsible.

209
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,259
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

210
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,283
Hot sake?

211
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,370
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

212
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,331
That's what I'm talking about.

213
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:54,417
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

214
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,877
you know what I recognize?

215
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:01,591
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

216
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,385
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

217
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,309
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

218
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,223
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

219
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,477
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

220
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,118
General.

221
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,623
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

222
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,706
Thanks.

223
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,462
Is it better to be feared or respected?

224
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,632
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

225
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,677
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

226
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,179
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

227
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,889
It's the first missile system

228
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,642
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

229
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,938
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

230
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,815
I respectfully disagree.

231
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,069
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

232
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,239
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

233
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,950
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

234
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,535
Find an excuse

235
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,871
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

236
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,458
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

237
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:40,189
For your consideration, the Jericho.

238
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,535
I'll be throwing one of these in

239
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,745
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

240
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,829
To peace!

241
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,709
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

242
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,112
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?

243
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,356
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

244
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,009
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

245
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,862
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

246
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:10,886
Good night, Tony.

247
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,308
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

248
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,101
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

249
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:20,146
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

250
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,422
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

251
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,336
What the hell did you do to me?

252
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,047
What I did?

253
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,883
What I did is to save your life.

254
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,554
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

255
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,639
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

256
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,557
Here, want to see?

257
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,687
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

258
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,650
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

259
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,068
We call them the walking dead

260
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,448
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

261
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,451
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

262
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,578
hooked up to a car battery,

263
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,748
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

264
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,508
That's right. Smile.

265
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,473
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

266
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,309
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

267
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,021
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

268
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,940
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

269
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,024
Where are we?

270
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,488
Come on, stand up.
Stand up!

271
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,324
Just do as I do.

272
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,618
Come on, put your hands up.

273
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,465
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

274
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,415
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

275
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,691
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

276
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,317
"in the history of America."

277
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,946
He is honored.

278
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,326
He wants you to build the missile.

279
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,122
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

280
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,167
This one.

281
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,882
I refuse.

282
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,102
Tony!

283
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,738
He wants to know what you think.

284
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,949
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

285
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,921
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

286
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,924
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

287
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,180
He says for you
to start working immediately,

288
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,933
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

289
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,397
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

290
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,955
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

291
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,999
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

292
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:20,005
Look, what you just saw,

293
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,591
that is your legacy, Stark.

294
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,680
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

295
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,431
Is that how you want to go out?

296
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:35,688
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

297
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,232
Or are you going to
do something about it?

298
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:43,320
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

299
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,404
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

300
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,782
Well, then,

301
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,287
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

302
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,123
Hmm?

303
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,086
If this is gonna be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

304
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,588
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

305
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,757
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

306
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,719
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

307
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,526
- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

308
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,612
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

309
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,448
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

310
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,993
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

311
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:36,540
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

312
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,751
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

313
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,095
You know, we might be more productive

314
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,819
if you include me
in the planning process.

315
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,141
Uh-huh.

316
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,567
Okay, we don't need this.

317
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,402
What is that?

318
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,950
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

319
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,370
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

320
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,667
What's he doing?

321
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,543
Working.

322
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,264
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

323
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,226
Relax. I have steady hands.

324
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,187
Why do you think you're still alive?

325
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,239
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

326
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,866
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

327
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,536
Nice to meet you, too.

328
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,620
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

329
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,373
That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

330
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,668
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

331
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,129
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

332
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,882
But what could it generate?

333
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:54,261
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

334
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,306
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

335
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,893
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

336
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:13,072
- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

337
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,866
Flatten them out and look.

338
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,995
Oh, wow.

339
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,874
Impressive.

340
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,860
Mmm.

341
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:55,114
Good roll. Good roll.

342
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,626
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

343
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,244
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

344
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,289
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

345
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:08,877
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

346
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,670
And you, Stark?

347
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,636
- No.
- No?

348
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,390
So you're a man who has everything

349
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,558
and nothing.

350
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,857
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

351
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,483
Maybe it's been modified.

352
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,693
The tail is wrong.

353
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,694
It's just backwards.

354
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,366
Relax.

355
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,835
The bow and arrow

356
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,631
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

357
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,344
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

358
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,598
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

359
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,852
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

360
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,607
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

361
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,445
But today,

362
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:44,783
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

363
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,577
rules these lands.

364
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
And soon,

365
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,627
it will be my turn.

366
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,934
Why have you failed me?

367
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,478
We're working.

368
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,147
Diligently.

369
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,190
I let you live.

370
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,361
This is how you repay me?

371
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,406
It's very complex.

372
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,075
He's trying very hard.

373
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,493
On his knees.

374
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,833
You think I'm a fool?

375
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,877
I'll get the truth.

376
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,004
We're both working.

377
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,596
Open your mouth.

378
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:48,888
What does he want?

379
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,308
You think I'm a fool?

380
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,688
What's going on?

381
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,691
Tell me the truth.

382
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,401
He's building your Jericho.

383
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,365
What do you want? A delivery date?

384
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,790
I need him.

385
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,501
Good assistant.

386
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,928
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

387
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,828
Okay? Can you move?

388
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,913
Okay, say it again.

389
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,083
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

390
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,170
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

391
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,512
Where is Stark?

392
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,806
He was here a moment ago.

393
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,016
Go look for him.

394
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,326
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

395
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,244
Say something.
Say something back to him.

396
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,788
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

397
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,041
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

398
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,608
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

399
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,748
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

400
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,279
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

401
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:52,947
Okay.

402
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,283
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

403
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,954
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

404
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,539
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

405
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,724
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

406
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,124
- I have it.
- Press Control

407
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,002
- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "I" and "Enter."

408
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,366
Come over here and button me up.

409
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,050
Okay. All right.

410
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,176
Every other hex bolt.

411
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,340
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

412
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,888
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

413
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,869
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

414
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,019
We need more time.

415
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:25,647
Hey,

416
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,942
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

417
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,903
Stick to the plan!

418
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,115
Yinsen!

419
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,748
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

420
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
Stark.

421
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,559
Come on. We got to go.

422
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,918
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

423
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,523
This was always the plan, Stark.

424
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,026
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

425
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,070
My family is dead.

426
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,574
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

427
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,035
It's okay.

428
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,500
I want this. I want this.

429
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,799
Thank you for saving me.

430
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,387
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

431
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,010
My turn.

432
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,531
Not bad.

433
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,024
Hey!

434
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,090
How was the "fun-vee"?

435
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,803
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

436
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,086
Watch it, coming up here.

437
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,716
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

438
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,389
Hmm.

439
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,519
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

440
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:48,441
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

441
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,110
Where to, sir?

442
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,034
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

443
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,530
No? Tony, you have to

444
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:55,490
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

445
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,342
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

446
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,427
I've been in captivity for three months.

447
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:01,204
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

448
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,016
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

449
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,393
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

450
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,293
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

451
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,088
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

452
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,144
Look at this! Huh?

453
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,522
Tony.

454
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,735
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

455
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,195
Look at you!

456
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,365
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

457
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,888
- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

458
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,706
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

459
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,547
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

460
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,690
Can I speak to you for a moment?

461
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,343
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

462
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,678
I'm not a reporter.

463
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,388
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

464
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,366
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

465
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,641
and Logistics Division.

466
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,853
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

467
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:11,440
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

468
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:14,986
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

469
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,822
We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

470
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,242
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

471
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,288
Uh...

472
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,584
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

473
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,295
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

474
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,797
A little less formal and...

475
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,889
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

476
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,307
I don't know what he's up to.

477
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,602
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

478
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,085
I never got to say good-bye to Dad.

479
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,939
I never got to say good-bye to my father.

480
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,255
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

481
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,759
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

482
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:05,077
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

483
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:10,249
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

484
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,089
I saw young Americans killed

485
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,386
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

486
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,097
And I saw

487
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:29,727
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

488
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,231
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

489
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:34,982
What happened over there?

490
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:40,279
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

491
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:44,825
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

492
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,329
And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down

493
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,332
the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International

494
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:56,254
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of this company will be.

495
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,356
I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

496
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,757
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

497
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,927
and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

498
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:10,059
What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

499
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,520
And he's healthier than ever.

500
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,357
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

501
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,359
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

502
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,989
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

503
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,836
Well, that... That went well.

504
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,046
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

505
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,465
Your head? What about my head?

506
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:45,094
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

507
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,888
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

508
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,597
Yep.

509
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,227
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

510
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,938
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

511
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,649
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

512
00:46:58,733 --> 00:46:59,960
It's my name on the side of the building.

513
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,611
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

514
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:03,779
Not based on what I saw.

515
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,967
We're not doing a good-enough job.

516
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,343
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

517
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,953
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

518
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,832
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

519
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:19,837
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

520
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,257
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

521
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,385
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

522
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:30,348
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

523
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,517
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

524
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:34,601
Maybe.

525
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,772
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

526
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,482
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

527
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,172
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

528
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,449
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

529
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,743
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

530
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,878
- Okay.
- Okay?

531
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:04,964
It works.

532
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,641
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

533
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,977
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

534
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,229
like your father and I.

535
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,356
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

536
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,315
- But if I had...
- Tony.

537
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:25,194
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

538
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,957
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

539
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,616
You gotta let me handle this.

540
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,160
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

541
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,912
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

542
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,457
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

543
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,334
Stark Industries!

544
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,337
I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

545
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,713
Sell, sell, sell!

546
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,841
Abandon ship!

547
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,219
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

548
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,600
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!

549
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:01,397
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

550
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:05,359
Pepper. How big are your hands?

551
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,778
- What?
- How big are your hands?

552
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,614
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

553
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,456
Hey.

554
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:22,984
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

555
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,253
Let's see them.

556
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:28,007
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

557
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,676
I just need your help for a sec.

558
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,263
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

559
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,849
It was. It is now an antique.

560
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,436
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

561
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:44,732
I'm swapping it out for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

562
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,253
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

563
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:51,655
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

564
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,909
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

565
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,577
It's fine.

566
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,014
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

567
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,290
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

568
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,919
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

569
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,589
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

570
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,317
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

571
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,759
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

572
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,321
- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

573
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:18,390
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

574
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,603
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

575
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:26,398
No, you're fine.
You are the most capable, qualified,

576
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,152
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

577
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,490
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

578
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,616
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

579
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,368
Okay.

580
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:43,624
Oh, there's pus!

581
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:48,295
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

582
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,297
- not from my body.
- It smells!

583
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,381
Yeah, it does.

584
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,635
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

585
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,558
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

586
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,907
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

587
00:50:58,931 --> 00:50:59,848
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

588
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,618
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

589
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,620
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

590
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,444
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

591
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:07,815
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

592
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,692
- Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

593
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,360
What's wrong?

594
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,879
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

595
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,922
'cause you yanked it out
like a trout lure...

596
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:17,283
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

597
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,446
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

598
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,328
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

599
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,621
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

600
00:51:22,705 --> 00:51:24,707
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

601
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,837
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

602
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,469
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

603
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,513
Nice.

604
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,849
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

605
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:42,932
You okay?

606
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,563
Don't ever, ever, ever,

607
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,649
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

608
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,610
I don't have anyone but you.

609
00:51:58,407 --> 00:51:59,407
Anyway...

610
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,666
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

611
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,127
Destroy it.

612
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,045
Incinerate it.

613
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,256
You don't want to keep it?

614
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:18,093
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

615
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,264
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

616
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,434
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

617
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,895
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

618
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,773
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

619
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,151
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff,

620
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:44,495
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

621
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,538
I'll tell you, in my experience,

622
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:51,752
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

623
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,253
his insight,

624
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,590
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

625
00:52:56,674 --> 00:53:00,177
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

626
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,138
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

627
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,933
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

628
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,452
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

629
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:09,120
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

630
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,939
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

631
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,583
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

632
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,959
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

633
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:15,901
- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

634
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,444
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

635
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,696
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

636
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,179
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

637
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,120
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

638
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,039
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

639
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,999
I'm doing a little better than walking.

640
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,418
- Really?
- Yeah.

641
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:34,920
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

642
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,465
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

643
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,803
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

644
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,723
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

645
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:46,807
that was a doozy.

646
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:52,312
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

647
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:55,023
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

648
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,467
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

649
00:53:56,525 --> 00:54:00,529
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

650
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,116
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

651
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,287
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

652
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,204
Thanks.

653
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,842
- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.

654
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,888
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark II.

655
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,809
Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?

656
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,277
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

657
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,708
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

658
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,193
Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

659
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,699
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

660
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,496
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

661
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,251
Next. Up.

662
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,045
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

663
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,548
Stay put. Nice.

664
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,970
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

665
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,556
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

666
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,063
Up.

667
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,233
Screw it. Don't even move.

668
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:05,112
You are a tragedy.

669
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,124
Okay, let's do this right.

670
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,460
Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

671
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,817
Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

672
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,426
You, roll it.

673
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:33,390
Okay. Activate hand controls.

674
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,955
We're gonna start off nice and easy.

675
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:41,690
We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

676
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,190
And three,

677
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,318
two,

678
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,236
one.

679
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,652
Up two. All right, set that.

680
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,946
I've been buzzing you.
Didn't you hear the intercom?

681
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,530
Yeah, everything's... What?

682
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,908
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

683
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,011
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

684
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,035
Okay.

685
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,806
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

686
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,830
It is.

687
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,919
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

688
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,257
I didn't expect that.

689
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,221
How'd it go?

690
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,768
Oh. It went that bad, huh?

691
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,729
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

692
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,400
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Uh-huh. Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

693
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,443
It would have gone better
if you were there.

694
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,405
Uh-uh. You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

695
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,951
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

696
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:21,248
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

697
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,793
The board is claiming
you have post traumatic stress.

698
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:25,895
They're filing an injunction.

699
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,963
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

700
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,482
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

701
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,424
We knew that was gonna happen.

702
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,676
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

703
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,845
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

704
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,681
Tony, the board has rights, too.

705
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:42,602
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

706
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,998
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

707
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,482
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

708
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,529
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

709
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,739
This is great.

710
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:57,367
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

711
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,578
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

712
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:02,998
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

713
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,624
Something to pitch them.

714
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:08,378
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

715
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:10,440
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

716
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,215
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

717
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:15,010
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- Well, this stays with me, then.

718
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,970
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

719
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,513
- Take two.
- Thank you.

720
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:20,742
You mind if I come down
there and see what you're doing?

721
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:21,933
Good night, Obie.

722
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:27,856
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

723
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,525
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

724
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,070
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

725
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,529
All right, nice and easy.

726
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:40,035
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

727
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,997
In three, two, one.

728
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:56,801
Okay.

729
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,906
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

730
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,307
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

731
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,077
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

732
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,186
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

733
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,146
Three, two, one.

734
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,348
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

735
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,708
Not the car, not the car!

736
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:30,001
Yikes!

737
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,211
Table!

738
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:46,726
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

739
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,912
No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

740
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,541
Yeah, I can fly.

741
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,882
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

742
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,384
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

743
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,678
Import all preferences
from home interface.

744
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:22,929
Will do, sir.

745
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,188
All right, what do you say?

746
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:34,357
I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.

747
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,419
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

748
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,696
Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

749
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,072
Do a check on control surfaces.

750
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,156
As you wish.

751
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,973
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

752
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:10,185
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

753
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,811
Start listening in on ground control.

754
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,039
Sir, there are still terabytes

755
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,315
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

756
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:19,527
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

757
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:23,406
Ready? In three, two, one.

758
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,306
Handles like a dream.

759
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,771
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

760
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,046
What's SR-71's record?

761
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:23,842
The altitude record for
fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.

762
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,261
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

763
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,310
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

764
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,020
Keep going!

765
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,314
Higher!

766
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,750
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

767
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,837
Come on, we got to break the ice!

768
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,041
Kill power.

769
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:06,045
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

770
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:10,341
Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

771
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,510
A very astute observation, sir.

772
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,637
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

773
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,041
we should improve the exosystems.

774
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,892
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

775
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,061
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

776
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:25,940
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

777
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,150
- Got it?
- Yes.

778
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,652
Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

779
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:30,736
Thrill me.

780
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,616
Tonight's red-hot red carpet

781
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,951
is right here at the Disney Concert Hall,

782
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:41,331
where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund

783
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,100
has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

784
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:44,501
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

785
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,628
I have no record of an invitation, sir.

786
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,630
...hasn't been seen in public

787
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:52,091
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

788
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:55,178
Some claim he's suffering
from post traumatic stress

789
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:59,015
and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

790
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:02,310
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

791
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,520
The render is complete.

792
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,189
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

793
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,359
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

794
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,655
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

795
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,032
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

796
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,204
The render is complete.

797
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,873
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

798
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,583
Commencing automated assembly.

799
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,878
Estimated completion time is five hours.

800
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,338
Don't wait up for me, honey.

801
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,440
- Mr. Stark.
- Thank you.

802
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,157
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

803
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:01,703
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

804
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,958
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

805
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:09,836
You look great, Hef.

806
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,399
We're going to have a great quarter.

807
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,063
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

808
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:21,347
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

809
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,473
I'll see you inside.

810
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:27,186
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

811
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,706
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

812
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,274
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

813
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:40,700
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

814
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:43,077
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

815
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,163
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

816
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,791
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

817
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,627
God, you need a new name for that.

818
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,462
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

819
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:56,966
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

820
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,469
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

821
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,554
and time can be a factor
with these things.

822
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,181
Let's just put something on the books.

823
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:06,643
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

824
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:10,355
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

825
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,276
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

826
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,696
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

827
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,240
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

828
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,010
- Are you by yourself?
- Where'd you get that dress?

829
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,952
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

830
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:27,246
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

831
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,330
Yes.

832
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,500
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

833
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,210
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

834
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,806
Am I making you uncomfortable?

835
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:51,437
Um, um, no. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

836
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:54,982
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

837
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,069
- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

838
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,172
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

839
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,449
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

840
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,451
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

841
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:06,994
What's your Social Security number?

842
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,000
- Five.
- Five?

843
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,378
- Right.
- Right.

844
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,797
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

845
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,050
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

846
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,732
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

847
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,578
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

848
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,197
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

849
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:44,758
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

850
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,582
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

851
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:50,121
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

852
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:53,541
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

853
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:56,502
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

854
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,839
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

855
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,341
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

856
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,445
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

857
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,929
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

858
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:09,241
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

859
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:13,102
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

860
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,813
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

861
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,667
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

862
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,001
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

863
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:41,756
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

864
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,802
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

865
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,428
Make one of them dirty, will you?

866
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,061
Wow. Tony Stark.

867
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,563
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

868
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,902
- Carrie.
- Christine.

869
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:03,985
That's right.

870
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,908
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

871
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,383
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

872
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,701
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

873
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,345
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

874
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,680
involvement in this latest atrocity.

875
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,141
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

876
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,835
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

877
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,104
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

878
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,839
Is this what you call accountability?

879
01:12:23,631 --> 01:12:26,008
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

880
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,147
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

881
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:43,001
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

882
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,527
Well, I'm not my company.

883
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,489
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

884
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,884
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

885
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:54,203
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

886
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,223
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

887
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,623
"This is how we do business."

888
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:01,002
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

889
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,378
Tony, your picture, please!

890
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:08,759
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

891
01:13:11,012 --> 01:13:13,973
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

892
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,310
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

893
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,523
It was the only way I could protect you.

894
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:26,736
No. No.

895
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:38,998
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

896
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:43,085
as a descent into hell,
into a modern-day Heart of Darkness.

897
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:46,088
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

898
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,673
have been driven from their homes,

899
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:51,594
displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a newfound power.

900
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,598
Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

901
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,434
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

902
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:01,854
or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

903
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:10,029
Recent violence has been attributed to a
group of foreign fighters

904
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:13,240
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

905
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:16,577
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

906
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:20,623
A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

907
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,834
With no political will
or international pressure,

908
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,638
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

909
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,882
Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,

910
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,246
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

911
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,344
either forced to join their militia...

912
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,598
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

913
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,643
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

914
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:44,355
A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"

915
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:48,150
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

916
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:52,154
refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

917
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:26,540
Hurry it up.

918
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:27,833
Put the women in the trucks.

919
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,001
Stack the weapons here.

920
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,126
Clear all the houses.

921
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:30,920
That one there.

922
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:31,961
Faster. Faster.

923
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:40,930
Grab that dog.

924
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,018
Put him with the others.

925
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,197
What the hell is this?

926
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,752
Shoot this dog.

927
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:13,504
You're all incompetent.

928
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:17,882
Turn your head!

929
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:25,784
He's all yours.

930
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,072
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

931
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:29,324
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

932
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:31,034
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

933
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:32,058
Get those monitors up!

934
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:33,935
We got a bogey!

935
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,438
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

936
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,375
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

937
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,150
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

938
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:41,694
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

939
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,363
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

940
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,740
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

941
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:49,660
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

942
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,252
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

943
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,045
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

944
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:02,047
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

945
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,924
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

946
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:05,688
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

947
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,303
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

948
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,054
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

949
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:11,473
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

950
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,726
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

951
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,519
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

952
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:20,607
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

953
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,905
- Hello?
- Tony?

954
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,657
- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.

955
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,951
- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.

956
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:33,495
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

957
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:37,333
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

958
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,792
It's funny how that works, huh?

959
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:42,421
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

960
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,190
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

961
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,924
Well, that's a hot spot.

962
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,469
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

963
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:49,779
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

964
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:50,905
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.

965
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,824
- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving

966
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:54,600
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

967
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,162
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

968
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,604
- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!

969
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,482
- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

970
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,859
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

971
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:06,695
That's my exit.

972
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:13,452
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.

973
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,245
I've got the bogey in my sights.

974
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:16,914
Whiplash One, what is it?

975
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,791
I've got no idea.

976
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:19,750
You have radio contact?

977
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,043
Nonresponsive, sir.

978
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,286
Then you are clear to engage.

979
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,129
Hit it.

980
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,019
That bogey
just went supersonic. I got a lock!

981
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:39,186
- Inbound missile.
- Flares!

982
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,357
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

983
01:21:58,914 --> 01:21:59,915
Deploy flaps!

984
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,543
Holy!

985
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:04,306
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

986
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,629
The sat visual has been lost.

987
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,673
No way that's a UAV.

988
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:08,756
What is it?

989
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:09,882
I can't see anything.

990
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,761
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

991
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:15,305
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

992
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,359
- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

993
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,194
- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

994
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:30,588
You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

995
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:31,780
No, see, this isn't a game.

996
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,534
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

997
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,595
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

998
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,456
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

999
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:41,819
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

1000
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,544
Mark your position and return to base.

1001
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:46,753
Roger that, Ballroom.

1002
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:50,174
On your belly!

1003
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,676
It looks like a man!

1004
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:55,262
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

1005
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:04,938
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1006
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:07,733
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

1007
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:12,362
Punch out! Punch out!

1008
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:20,913
Whiplash One down.

1009
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:23,057
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

1010
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:25,250
Negative! No chute, no chute!

1011
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:31,964
My chute's jammed!

1012
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:40,432
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

1013
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:43,435
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1014
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,749
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1015
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,959
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

1016
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:51,360
inside a legal no-fly zone!

1017
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,612
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

1018
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:56,114
You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

1019
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,407
Keep going!

1020
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,000
Good chute! Good chute!

1021
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:17,928
- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

1022
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,305
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1023
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:22,865
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1024
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,812
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1025
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,540
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

1026
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:31,024
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1027
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,443
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1028
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,862
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

1029
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:36,989
It's not that simple.

1030
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,450
An unfortunate training exercise

1031
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:43,412
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1032
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,790
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

1033
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:51,378
As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,

1034
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:54,881
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

1035
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:59,177
but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

1036
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:02,013
Hey!

1037
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:05,809
It is a tight fit, sir.

1038
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:09,855
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

1039
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,481
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1040
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,301
I designed this to come off, so...

1041
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,902
Hey.

1042
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:20,907
- I really should be able to...
- Please, try not to move, sir.

1043
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,493
What's going on here?

1044
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,807
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1045
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,422
Are those bullet holes?

1046
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,116
Welcome.

1047
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:09,623
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1048
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:14,169
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1049
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:16,254
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1050
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:18,131
Show me the weapon.

1051
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:23,136
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1052
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:42,072
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1053
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,910
So this is how he did it.

1054
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:49,454
This is only a first, crude effort.

1055
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:52,082
Stark has perfected his design.

1056
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,419
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1057
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:59,131
A man with a dozen of these
could rule all of Asia.

1058
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:02,676
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1059
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,138
We have a common enemy.

1060
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:13,019
If we are still in business,

1061
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,024
I will give you these designs

1062
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:20,818
as a gift.

1063
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:23,362
And in turn,

1064
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:30,704
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1065
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:44,676
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1066
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:48,680
Technology.

1067
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:53,727
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1068
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:58,732
Don't worry.
It'll only last for 15 minutes.

1069
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,777
That's the least of your problems.

1070
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,201
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

1071
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:13,538
All right, let's finish up here.

1072
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:20,754
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1073
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:24,508
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1074
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,426
I want a prototype right away.

1075
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:37,187
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1076
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:39,689
I need you to go to my office.

1077
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:42,460
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1078
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,611
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1079
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:46,695
This'll get you in.

1080
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:49,282
It's probably under Executive Files.

1081
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:51,636
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1082
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,220
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1083
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:57,099
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

1084
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:57,958
Same drill.

1085
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:00,228
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1086
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:03,380
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1087
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,089
Tony,

1088
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:09,511
you know that
I would help you with anything,

1089
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:13,640
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1090
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:17,143
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1091
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:20,814
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1092
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:25,068
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1093
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,320
Is that so?

1094
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:30,907
Well, then, I quit.

1095
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,996
You stood by my side all these years

1096
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,331
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1097
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:40,834
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1098
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,728
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1099
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:47,007
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1100
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:48,675
I shouldn't be alive,

1101
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,095
unless it was for a reason.

1102
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:55,098
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1103
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:59,394
I just finally know what I have to do.

1104
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:06,484
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1105
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,835
You're all I have, too, you know.

1106
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:39,077
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1107
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:53,883
You did not tell us that the target you

1108
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:56,094
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.

1109
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,947
- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.

1110
01:31:57,971 --> 01:32:00,765
...your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1111
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:03,643
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1112
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:11,985
So, what are we going to do about this?

1113
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,488
Hmm?

1114
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:27,459
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1115
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:38,762
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1116
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:04,829
I was so happy when he came home.

1117
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:07,582
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1118
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:12,128
Now I realize,

1119
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:17,926
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1120
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:22,263
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1121
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:26,351
Breaks my heart.

1122
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:33,066
Well, he's a complicated person.

1123
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:39,030
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1124
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:48,581
You are a very rare woman.

1125
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,710
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1126
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:57,423
Thank you. Thanks.

1127
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,386
I'd better get back there.

1128
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:08,393
Is that today's paper?

1129
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:11,854
Yes.

1130
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,523
Do you mind?

1131
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:16,484
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1132
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:17,610
Of course.

1133
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:22,448
Take care.

1134
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,934
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1135
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:51,227
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1136
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:52,705
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1137
01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:54,606
- Yep, walk with me.
- Okay.

1138
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:58,133
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1139
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,404
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1140
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:05,408
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1141
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,995
Mr. Stane?
Sir, we've explored

1142
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:11,223
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1143
01:35:11,247 --> 01:35:13,166
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1144
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:17,212
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1145
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:19,464
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1146
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:26,638
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1147
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:30,516
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1148
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:37,357
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1149
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,570
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1150
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,545
Tony?

1151
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:05,301
Tony, are you there? Hello?

1152
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:08,304
Breathe.

1153
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:11,975
Easy, easy.

1154
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:16,562
You remember this one, right?

1155
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,608
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1156
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:25,113
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1157
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:28,074
Tony.

1158
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:35,373
When I ordered the hit on you,

1159
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,128
I worried that I was

1160
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:45,550
killing the golden goose.

1161
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:50,430
But, you see, it was just

1162
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:54,142
Fate that you survived that.

1163
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:03,151
You had one last golden egg to give.

1164
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:12,493
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1165
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:21,586
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1166
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:26,007
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1167
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,685
Oh, it's beautiful.

1168
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:45,151
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1169
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,572
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1170
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:52,742
This is your legacy.

1171
01:37:55,328 --> 01:38:00,708
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1172
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:07,507
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

1173
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:09,634
put the balance of power in our hands.

1174
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:12,762
The right hands.

1175
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:20,812
I wish you could see my prototype.

1176
01:38:22,271 --> 01:38:23,648
It's not as...

1177
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:27,819
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1178
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:32,824
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

1179
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:35,243
I would have preferred that she lived.

1180
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:51,092
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1181
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:54,095
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1182
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:56,556
Okay, where's Tony now?

1183
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,319
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1184
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:00,768
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

1185
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:03,354
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1186
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:10,587
Good boy.

1187
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:51,628
Tony?

1188
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:55,299
Tony?

1189
01:40:57,385 --> 01:40:58,385
Tony?

1190
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:01,513
Tony?

1191
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:05,225
Tony!

1192
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:10,314
Tony! You okay?

1193
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:14,026
- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

1194
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:15,486
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1195
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:17,645
That's not going to be enough.

1196
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:48,477
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1197
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:59,488
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1198
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:02,366
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1199
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,011
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1200
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,595
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1201
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:27,642
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1202
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:30,728
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1203
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,195
You need me to do anything else?

1204
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:41,572
Keep the skies clear.

1205
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:48,203
Damn!

1206
01:42:56,545 --> 01:42:57,755
Next time, baby.

1207
01:43:28,285 --> 01:43:31,789
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1208
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:33,624
I thought it'd be bigger.

1209
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:20,211
Take him out!

1210
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:33,160
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

1211
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:35,519
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1212
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:38,272
That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.

1213
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:39,440
Keep me posted.

1214
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:42,485
Pepper!

1215
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:45,654
- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

1216
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:47,740
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.

1217
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:49,468
- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.

1218
01:44:49,492 --> 01:44:50,868
Get out of there right now!

1219
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:04,548
Where do you think you're going?

1220
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:13,224
Your services are no longer required.

1221
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:15,518
Stane!

1222
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:42,002
I love this suit!

1223
01:45:42,086 --> 01:45:45,714
- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.

1224
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:48,425
Divert power to chest RT.

1225
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:00,271
Power reduced to 19%.

1226
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:08,987
Lady!

1227
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,366
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1228
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:37,766
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

1229
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:44,189
I built this company from nothing!

1230
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:49,111
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1231
01:46:56,035 --> 01:46:58,579
Least of all you!

1232
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:11,216
Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

1233
01:47:11,717 --> 01:47:13,719
I've made some upgrades of my own!

1234
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,897
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1235
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:26,732
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1236
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:29,026
With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1237
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:30,819
I know the math! Do it!

1238
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:41,776
Sir, you're not going
to believe this. That thing is back.

1239
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:43,874
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1240
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:50,047
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1241
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:51,215
Yes, sir.

1242
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,308
- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!

1243
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:07,356
- Eleven percent.
- Keep going!

1244
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:16,407
- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!

1245
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,490
Stop telling me!

1246
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:29,586
You had a great idea, Tony,

1247
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:31,672
but my suit is more advanced
in every way!

1248
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,200
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1249
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:36,176
Icing problem?

1250
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:39,717
Might want to look into it.

1251
01:48:52,693 --> 01:48:53,861
Two percent.

1252
01:48:56,155 --> 01:48:58,532
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1253
01:48:58,615 --> 01:48:59,992
Whoa!

1254
01:49:10,627 --> 01:49:14,256
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1255
01:49:14,339 --> 01:49:16,759
I'm almost out of power. I've got
to get out of this thing.

1256
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:17,842
I'll be right there.

1257
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:19,218
Nice try!

1258
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:33,817
Weapons status?

1259
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:36,904
Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1260
01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:41,950
Flares!

1261
01:49:51,001 --> 01:49:53,253
Very clever, Tony.

1262
01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:00,677
- Potts?
- Tony!

1263
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:01,637
This isn't working.

1264
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,200
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1265
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:06,871
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

1266
01:50:07,309 --> 01:50:09,520
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1267
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:11,247
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1268
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:13,031
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1269
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:15,504
It's going to fry everything up here.

1270
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:19,780
Okay. I'm going in now.

1271
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:22,991
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1272
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:33,626
This looks important!

1273
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:57,734
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,

1274
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:02,322
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1275
01:51:10,873 --> 01:51:13,208
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1276
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,462
You'd have made your father proud!

1277
01:51:22,593 --> 01:51:24,887
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1278
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:45,699
Tony!

1279
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:48,827
How ironic, Tony!

1280
01:51:50,329 --> 01:51:55,459
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1281
01:51:55,542 --> 01:52:01,340
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1282
01:52:04,468 --> 01:52:08,597
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

1283
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:13,018
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

1284
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:17,147
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1285
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:21,735
Push it!

1286
01:53:19,293 --> 01:53:21,086
Tony!

1287
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:31,972
You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

1288
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:33,724
at Stark Industries last night.

1289
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:38,895
There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1290
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:41,398
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1291
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:44,794
Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

1292
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:46,796
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1293
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:50,365
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1294
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:53,035
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1295
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:54,286
Here's your alibi.

1296
01:53:55,704 --> 01:53:56,747
Okay.

1297
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,957
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1298
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:01,335
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1299
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:03,138
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1300
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:06,173
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1301
01:54:06,256 --> 01:54:08,008
alone on the island.

1302
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:10,778
- That's what happened.
- All right.

1303
01:54:10,802 --> 01:54:12,095
Just read it, word for word.

1304
01:54:14,806 --> 01:54:16,126
There's nothing about Stane here.

1305
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:19,811
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1306
01:54:20,604 --> 01:54:23,148
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1307
01:54:23,231 --> 01:54:25,734
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1308
01:54:25,817 --> 01:54:28,421
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1309
01:54:28,445 --> 01:54:30,614
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1310
01:54:31,114 --> 01:54:34,242
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1311
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:37,371
You've got 90 seconds.

1312
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:41,291
Agent Coulson?

1313
01:54:42,626 --> 01:54:46,838
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1314
01:54:47,255 --> 01:54:50,133
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1315
01:54:50,467 --> 01:54:53,470
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1316
01:54:54,096 --> 01:54:55,096
Right.

1317
01:54:56,306 --> 01:55:00,268
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

1318
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:01,686
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1319
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:04,272
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1320
01:55:04,356 --> 01:55:05,956
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1321
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:10,904
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1322
01:55:10,987 --> 01:55:13,716
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1323
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,992
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1324
01:55:16,076 --> 01:55:19,788
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1325
01:55:21,706 --> 01:55:22,582
Crazy about me.

1326
01:55:22,666 --> 01:55:24,227
Tell me you never think about that night.

1327
01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:25,669
- What night?
- You know.

1328
01:55:29,131 --> 01:55:34,636
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1329
01:55:36,596 --> 01:55:42,227
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1330
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:45,564
and you left me there, by myself?

1331
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:49,943
- Is that the night you're talking about?
- Mmm-hmm.

1332
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:52,571
Thought so.

1333
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:58,869
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1334
01:55:58,952 --> 01:56:02,622
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1335
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:05,500
He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

1336
01:56:08,837 --> 01:56:11,548
Uh, been a while
since I was in front of you.

1337
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:13,758
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.

1338
01:56:17,053 --> 01:56:19,893
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

1339
01:56:19,931 --> 01:56:21,475
on the freeway and the rooftop...

1340
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:24,352
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1341
01:56:24,436 --> 01:56:28,190
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1342
01:56:28,273 --> 01:56:30,692
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

1343
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:35,071
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

1344
01:56:35,155 --> 01:56:38,283
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1345
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:39,910
I never said you were a superhero.

1346
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:45,540
Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.

1347
01:56:47,459 --> 01:56:50,795
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1348
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:54,299
With this laundry list
of character defects,

1349
01:56:54,382 --> 01:56:55,842
all the mistakes I've made,

1350
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:59,304
- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.

1351
01:56:59,387 --> 01:57:01,014
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1352
01:57:03,099 --> 01:57:04,100
The truth is...

1353
01:57:10,774 --> 01:57:11,775
I am Iron Man.

1354
02:05:15,425 --> 02:05:16,425
Jarvis!

1355
02:05:16,843 --> 02:05:18,469
Welcome home, sir.

1356
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:27,270
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1357
02:05:27,812 --> 02:05:30,898
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1358
02:05:30,982 --> 02:05:32,817
You just don't know it yet.

1359
02:05:33,443 --> 02:05:34,443
Who the hell are you?

1360
02:05:35,486 --> 02:05:37,864
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1361
02:05:38,656 --> 02:05:39,949
Ah,

1362
02:05:40,033 --> 02:05:42,493
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
