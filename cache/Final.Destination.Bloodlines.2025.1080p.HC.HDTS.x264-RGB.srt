1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,580
- What was that?
- Nothing.

2
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:51,627
- Okay, just give me one little hint.
- No, no hints!

3
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,426
- Almost there.
- Okay, I'm gonna take this off.

4
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:54,870
No, no, no.

5
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,166
Hey, you said you like surprises.

6
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,090
Yeah, I do, when I know what they are.

7
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,710
You're gonna love it.

8
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,270
Promise.

9
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,570
Yeah, I already love the view.

10
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,390
Ah-ah.

11
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,860
Watch your step, watch your step.

12
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,980
I can't see.

13
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,540
Hey, are you ready?

14
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,370
Are you sure I'm dressed alright?

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,150
You look like a million bucks.

16
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,470
Don't steal coins from the fountain,
it's bad luck.

17
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
Smile.

18
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,700
- You coming?
- We'll take the next one.

19
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,660
Oh, come on, we can fit you in.

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thanks.

21
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,810
Going up.

22
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,370
Excuse me.

23
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,610
Sorry, it does that sometimes.

24
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,240
It's 494 ft tall and weighs over 9,000 tons.

25
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,520
It's made of steel and reinforced concrete
and glass.

26
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,853
And even more
impressive, the entire project

27
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:00,961
was completed five
months ahead of schedule.

28
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Is that a good thing?

29
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
What a time.

30
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Fancy.

31
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,220
Yes, may I help you?

32
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,080
We have a reservation, Campbell.

33
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,410
Oh, I'm sorry, but we're already over
capacity for opening night.

34
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,450
We cannot accommodate you, if you wouldn't
mind us stepping aside.

35
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,150
Thank you so much.

36
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,770
It's okay, I worked it out with Jake.

37
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,370
Is he here?

38
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,830
I could speak.

39
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,050
We let Jake go this morning.

40
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,610
Thank you so much.

41
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,430
You're tearing me

42
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,960
apart, but I'm sorry, I can't help you,
if you wouldn't mind.

43
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,360
Oh, Mr. Fuller, how nice to see you.

44
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,920
We have a lovely table for you.

45
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,340
Thank you, this way.

46
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Let's go to the bar.

47
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
I'm natural.

48
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,220
Um, wait a few.

49
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,150
This is good, right?

50
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,970
No, I'm just... I've just never been this
high up before.

51
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,290
I'm so sorry, this night's such a
disaster.

52
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,170
I've been waiting for it to be perfect.

53
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Hey, it is perfect, because I'm with you.

54
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,360
Ah, you okay?

55
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,420
Oh, I think I'll live.

56
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
Yeah.

57
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,110
Hey, look for champagne.

58
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,970
That's my favorite kind.

59
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,110
I'll be right back.

60
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,610
Excuse me, where's the ladies from?

61
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,150
Other side of the dance floor.

62
00:07:56,095 --> 00:07:57,590
Hi, sweetie.

63
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,710
Is everything all right?

64
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,090
I'm fine, thank you.

65
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,290
How far along are you?

66
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,670
What?

67
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,850
Oh, no, I'm, I'm not.

68
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:28,110
Um, I don't know exactly, maybe one or two
months?

69
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:34,050
Well, that's wonderful news, isn't it?

70
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,330
I haven't told my boyfriend yet.

71
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,850
Does he love you?

72
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,250
Yes.

73
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,030
Then he won't let go.

74
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:53,930
Thank you, of course.

75
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,130
Bye.

76
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,850
Okay, it's almost over.

77
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,010
Oh, hey, what?

78
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,430
Are you okay?

79
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,570
Yeah, I think so.

80
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,290
Come on, let's get some pressure.

81
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,310
Don't worry, I was

82
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,440
gonna do this at dinner, but as soon as we
have this view...

83
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,320
Hey, don't throw that penny.

84
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
You could kill somebody.

85
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,200
Oh, I'm so sorry, of course.

86
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
Yeah.

87
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,700
A fat ass?

88
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,900
Um, these past few years, I've been
absolutely magical.

89
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,660
And that's, uh, that's because of you.

90
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,380
Iris, I want to spend the rest of my life
with you.

91
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,700
You mean, with us?

92
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Sorry?

93
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,480
I... I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

94
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
You're not upset?

95
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,980
Are you kidding me?

96
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,420
No, this is, this is incredible.

97
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:47,980
Really?

98
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,560
We're gonna start a family.

99
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,900
Um, so, will you?

100
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,680
Oh, yes.

101
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,930
Is it too tight?

102
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,070
It's perfect.

103
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,870
Hey, let's go celebrate.

104
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,970
Now,

105
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,340
Multiplication is scary, but it's not that
scary.

106
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,900
All right, that's it for today.

107
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,280
We'll start prepping for the final next
week.

108
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,340
Ms. Reyes, we need to talk.

109
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,810
Oh,

110
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,160
this dream is surrounding my life.

111
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,460
Mine too.

112
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,840
Every night, Steph.

113
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,660
God, I'm not getting any sleep.

114
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Shit, I'm sorry.

115
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,820
Um, can I tell you something?

116
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,400
Yeah, what's up?

117
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:06,880
So, the woman in my dream, her name is
Iris, right?

118
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
Okay.

119
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,520
That was my grandmother's name.

120
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,900
I, uh, I think I'm dreaming about her.

121
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Are you serious?

122
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,440
Yeah, the thing is, I never even met her.

123
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,320
I don't even know if she's alive.

124
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,040
Okay, well, either go home and find out
about grandma and hope that stops the

125
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:30,640
dreams or stay here and die in your sleep
for real.

126
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,140
Because I will murder you.

127
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,390
I'm sorry.

128
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:35,720
Yeah.

129
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,140
Yeah.

130
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:36,640
Okay.

131
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Love you.

132
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,140
Love you too.

133
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,240
Go home.

134
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Yeah.

135
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Quietly.

136
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,820
Hey, there she is.

137
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,560
Hey, Dad.

138
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,940
Welcome home, sweetie.

139
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,320
So glad you're here.

140
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
I love you so much.

141
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:25,721
I know.

142
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,780
So great to see you.

143
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,340
Thank you.

144
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,180
Thank you.

145
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
I hate that for you.

146
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,113
Hey, sorry, Charlie took
your room a while ago, and my

147
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:37,660
files are in his room, so I
made up the pullout for you.

148
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,500
Is that okay?

149
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:38,960
Yeah.

150
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,240
Yeah.

151
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:40,401
No, that sounds totally fine.

152
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,720
Uh, hey, do we still have that box of
mom's old stuff?

153
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:50,920
It had, uh, some photos, like an address
book with phone numbers in it.

154
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Uh, why do you want that?

155
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,660
It's not a big deal.

156
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,920
I just, I thought I saw it lying around
here somewhere.

157
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,820
Stephanie, what's going on?

158
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,300
Okay.

159
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,518
This is going to sound
really, really weird,

160
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,020
but I, uh, I just need
to find mom's mom, Iris.

161
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,420
Uh, okay.

162
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:15,740
Yeah, that is weird.

163
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,680
And you know, I got rid of those boxes
years ago after your mom left.

164
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,140
Oh, hi, Charlie.

165
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Hey.

166
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,260
Um, hi, Steph.

167
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,340
How are you?

168
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,700
It's so nice to see you.

169
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Yeah, sure.

170
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,420
Uh, go to the cousins.

171
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Whoa, now?

172
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,996
I thought your sister just got home.

173
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,300
I thought we could... Actually,
you know what?

174
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:39,420
I can, I can drive you.

175
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,140
I was wanting to see them anyways.

176
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,440
That's fine.

177
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,220
Hey, if you're going to see your cousins,
please don't talk about Iris.

178
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,820
Yeah.

179
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Yeah, no problem.

180
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
All right.

181
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:51,900
Bye.

182
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,380
Love you.

183
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Love you too.

184
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,940
Can you just take these out?

185
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,260
I'm trying to talk to you.

186
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
What's your problem?

187
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
What?

188
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,700
You haven't said anything this entire
time.

189
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,020
What?

190
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,360
Steph, why are you here?

191
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,540
I mean, only coming home for holidays.

192
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,881
We have to tell you something, but
you will have to promise not to tell dad.

193
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
Are you pregnant?

194
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,260
No, I'm not pregnant, Charlie.

195
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:23,840
I don't know.

196
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,721
Why would you even... That's
not... I mean, you're in college.

197
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,700
Can you just promise me you won't tell
dad?

198
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,200
Why would I tell dad?

199
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,640
It's serious, Charlie.

200
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,060
Okay.

201
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:35,061
Okay.

202
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,420
I am on academic probation.

203
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:53,830
Stop!

204
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,230
Stop!

205
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,470
If I don't get my grades up... This is
kind of a big moment for me.

206
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,590
This is kind of funny.

207
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,970
Straight A's.

208
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,190
You're a class president, Ms.
Valedictorian.

209
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:02,870
Charlie, it's not funny.

210
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,270
If I don't get my grades up, I will lose
my scholarship.

211
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:09,370
Um, I'm sorry.

212
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,510
What happened?

213
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,070
I can't sleep.

214
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:19,490
Every time I close my eyes, I have this
same recurring nightmare about Iris,

215
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,010
our grandmother.

216
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,350
I don't...

217
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,630
I mean, it has to mean something.

218
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,270
I don't know.

219
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,610
I'm doing weird things.

220
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,150
I remember the hot dog ate me last night.

221
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,870
Like, the hot dog was eating me.

222
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,030
All right.

223
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,830
Dude, can you just do something?

224
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,210
Dude, calm down.

225
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,290
All right, we'll find him.

226
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,170
I can't pause over at the online event.

227
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:48,710
Are you serious?

228
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,470
I have to look under this.

229
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:50,471
Can you do me a kindness?

230
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:50,850
Fuck off.

231
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,690
You remember what happened last night?

232
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:52,830
It's a ranked match.

233
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,430
It's a ranked match.

234
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:53,890
What's going on?

235
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,310
I can't find Paco.

236
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,570
Dude, again?

237
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,010
It's Paco.

238
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,570
Hey, cuz.

239
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,510
Oh my gosh.

240
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,530
Hey, can you help us look and just watch
your feet while you're stepping?

241
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,590
Yeah, yeah, sure.

242
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,670
I just, I gotta talk to your dad first.

243
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,306
The fuck are you doing home?

244
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,690
Oh, dude, she's fucking out of school.

245
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,030
Welcome to the club.

246
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,830
Eric, dude, have you looked anywhere?

247
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,570
Oh, but look who's down here.

248
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,570
Hi, Julia.

249
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,770
Oh my gosh.

250
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,950
So we had to promposal with Jenny,
girl.

251
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:29,870
She said yes.

252
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,150
Oh my gosh.

253
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,490
Okay, wait, who's uh, who's Jenny?

254
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,830
Oh, he met her in junior lifeguards.

255
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,190
Junior lifeguards?

256
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,310
Charlie, I didn't, I didn't know you were
doing junior lifeguards.

257
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,950
Okay, so what are you gonna wear?

258
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,330
Um, I'm just gonna keep it simple,
black blazer, butt.

259
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,770
Stephanie!

261
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,150
Oh my gosh.

262
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,610
Hi, honey.

263
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,270
Hi, girlfriend.

264
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,530
How long are you here for?

265
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,190
Uh, not long.

266
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,830
Uh, is Uncle Howard around?

267
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,270
Yeah.

268
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,290
Yeah, he's out back.

269
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,291
Look at him.

270
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,770
Howard!

271
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,290
Stephanie's here!

272
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,410
Come in!

273
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,076
She's like a little tired.

274
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Is everything okay?

275
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Oh.

276
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Stephanie!

277
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
Look at you!

278
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,480
Come here, come here.

279
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Oh, sweetie.

280
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,340
Oh, so good to see you.

281
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,420
Hey, are you hungry?

282
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,796
I just want to make some lunch.

283
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,240
No, actually, uh, I came here because I
wanted to talk to you about your mother,

284
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,380
Iris.

285
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,720
I know you don't like to talk about her.

286
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,360
There's not much to tell.

287
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,780
Hey, kids, come on, lunch!

288
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,740
It's just that I've been, I've been having
this recurring nightmare.

289
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
About her.

290
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,620
Oh, honey, it's probably just us.

291
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,280
You should try melatonin.

292
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,020
Okay, but the weird thing is, I've been
dreaming about a real place from,

293
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,400
from 50 years ago.

294
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,300
It was like a restaurant called the
Skyview.

295
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,700
You know, it is.

296
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,880
Did, did Iris tell you about it?

297
00:26:54,295 --> 00:26:55,496
Uh, what did, what did she say?

298
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,760
Did, did she say anything?

299
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,721
Um, and maybe, maybe if I
could talk to her... Talk to who?

300
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,540
Uh, Stephanie's dreaming about Grandma
Iris.

301
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,780
Psycho Granny?

302
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,960
I thought she was dead.

303
00:27:03,961 --> 00:27:05,600
Well, she's dead to us.

304
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,000
Steffi, Iris Campbell is a very deeply
disturbed woman.

305
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,740
End of story.

306
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,543
Look, if I could just
talk to her, then, then

307
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,140
maybe, maybe I can
get these dreams to stop.

308
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Steph, just drop it.

309
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,180
I don't get it.

310
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,880
What, what happened?

311
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,916
That was so... For one thing, she's the
reason that your mother's so screwed up.

312
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,120
What?

313
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,116
Look, I just don't want to talk about this
anymore, okay?

314
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,800
Uncle Howard, please.

315
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,080
I just need to know.

316
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:33,680
Look, Steffi, after our father died,
Iris just snapped.

317
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,620
She, she wouldn't let us go to school.

318
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,500
She locked us inside the house.

319
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,180
She obsessed about all the horrific ways
we could die.

320
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,780
And eventually it got so bad.

321
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,040
I mean, so bad.

322
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,120
And the state came in and it took your
mother and I away from her.

323
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,130
But it didn't end there.

324
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,956
She, she tracked us all through foster
care.

325
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,420
And when the kids were born, she started
sending these horrible letters that were

326
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:02,900
full of obituaries and these disturbing
pictures of dead bodies.

327
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:05,400
We had to move so she couldn't contact us
anymore.

328
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:12,440
So, uh, do you still have any of those
letters?

329
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,020
Steffi, listen to me.

330
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,900
That woman is a sick and dangerous person.

331
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,320
And for your well-being and your safety,
stay the hell away from her.

332
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,820
I found Paco.

333
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,500
You heard your uncle.

334
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
Just let it go.

335
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,500
Just let it go.

336
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
You don't understand.

337
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:57,540
My whole life is falling apart because of
this dream.

338
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,120
And not only that, I feel like,
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

339
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,400
Please, you are the only person who can
help me.

340
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,180
Howard would never forgive me if I put you
in touch with Iris.

341
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,580
Please.

342
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:20,810
Whatever you do, do not look in the bottom
drawer of the dining room cabinet.

343
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,880
Hi, um, I'm, I'm here to see Iris
Campbell.

344
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:04,280
Did you not see the signs?

345
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,040
Uh, uh, yeah, yes, I did, but...
Hey, get the fuck out of here.

346
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
No visitors.

347
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
I'm your granddaughter.

348
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
Stephanie,

349
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,180
empty your pockets.

350
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,200
Phone, keys, everything.

351
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,160
Well, I'm not dangerous.

352
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,620
It's not you I'm afraid of.

353
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,700
Um, um.

354
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,790
Coming slowly.

355
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Shut the door.

356
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Quick, quick, quick.

357
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,900
Oh, don't move.

358
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,340
Oh my God.

359
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,120
It really is you.

360
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,610
I can see your mother in you.

361
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,800
Hi, I'm Stephanie.

362
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,540
Stop, stop, don't move.

363
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,120
Not until I tell you.

364
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,420
Trying to trick me, aren't you?

365
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,100
Getting me to let my guard down.

366
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,160
I'm, there you go.

367
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Sit.

368
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,360
Okay, um.

369
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
Sit.

370
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,620
That's it.

371
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,080
So, how is Darlene?

372
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,140
Your mom?

373
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:02,620
Okay.

374
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,360
Oh, uh, no, I, I don't, I don't know.

375
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:08,040
She, uh, she left when I was 10.

376
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,540
So we don't, we don't see her anymore.

377
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,690
But you saw my letters.

378
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,940
That's why you're here, right?

379
00:34:19,795 --> 00:34:24,920
No, um, I'm actually here because I've
been dreaming about the sky view.

380
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,320
Yeah, yeah, every single night for the
past two months.

381
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,000
It's, it's the same dream in it.

382
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,380
You're, you're on a date, but
then the dance floor breaks

383
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:39,340
and, and then there's an
explosion and then you-Fall and die.

384
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,620
Yeah, yeah, everyone dies.

385
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,840
It wasn't just your dream.

386
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,620
It was my premonition.

387
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:51,880
Years ago, at the sky view, I got a
glimpse into the future.

388
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,840
And saw what death was about to do.

389
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Oh,

390
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,280
I'm so sorry, of course.

391
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,460
These past two years have been absolutely
magical.

392
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,700
And that's all because of you.

393
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
No, no, no, no.

394
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
This isn't right.

395
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Is that a no?

396
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,440
Everyone's going to die.

397
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,200
The whole building is going to come down.

398
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Are you serious?

399
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
The penny.

400
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:33,980
Iris?

401
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,520
Keep up.

402
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,820
What the hell, lady?

403
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:36,836
You need to give it to me.

404
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,860
What are you doing?

405
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,240
What the fuck is wrong with you?

406
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,670
Iris?

407
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,290
She knows you'll make me a bummer.

408
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,540
I saved a lot of lives that night.

409
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,540
Lives that were never meant to be saved.

410
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,780
They closed the restaurant after that.

411
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,780
Said it needed additional renovations.

412
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
But it never reopened.

413
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,440
Eventually they tore it down.

414
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,140
So you stopped the disaster?

415
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
Yes.

416
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,800
But death doesn't like it when you fuck
with his plans.

417
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,100
So over the years he came back and he
killed everyone who was there that night.

418
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,050
Including my Paul.

419
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,740
Wait, wait a minute.

420
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,540
I'm sorry, did you did you say death came
back?

421
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,600
He's a relentless son of a bitch.

422
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,220
Won't stop till he finishes the job.

423
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,640
But I taught myself how to see him coming.

424
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,340
To anticipate his every move.

425
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,280
Been keeping him at bay for years now.

426
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,370
Now he's got me.

427
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Cancer.

428
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,340
Believe that shit?

429
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,480
Sorry.

430
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,300
Got the diagnosis two months ago.

431
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,240
Wait, that's when I started having my
dream.

432
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
See, it's a sign.

433
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,800
Okay, but why am I dreaming about what you
saw?

434
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,480
Maybe my cancer passed my premonition on
to you.

435
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,080
Maybe it's fate's demented sense of humor.

436
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,180
Who the hell knows?

437
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,760
What matters is that when the universe
speaks, you pay attention.

438
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,470
I see you, you fuck.

439
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:01,690
Um, who are you talking to?

440
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,210
Death.

441
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,450
He thinks I'm distracted because you're
here.

442
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,790
I have to teach you everything in this
book.

443
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,370
It'll take some time to learn the basics.

444
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,010
So you need to stay here.

445
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,710
Stay here?

446
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,190
Yes, high world is too dangerous.

447
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,270
I haven't stepped out there in 20 years.

448
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:19,350
In here, we can be safe.

449
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,090
Oh.

450
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,590
See that?

451
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,790
Yeah.

452
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,070
This is all my research.

453
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:27,770
My life's work.

454
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,510
Look, I'm sorry.

455
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,550
I can't stay here.

456
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,530
I have to get back to school.

457
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,770
But you know, I'll come back and I'll
visit.

458
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,290
No, I'm sick.

459
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,810
I won't be alive that long.

460
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,910
You can't leave.

461
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,470
Don't you see?

462
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,190
Death is coming for our family.

463
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,450
Oh.

464
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,810
You don't believe me?

465
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:49,690
No.

466
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,050
I think I made a mistake.

467
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,110
I think it was probably just a dream.

468
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,310
No, wait!

469
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,470
At least take the book!

470
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,090
Stephanie!

471
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,810
Stephanie!

472
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,770
Look, I'm sorry.

473
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,990
I shouldn't have found you.

474
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,570
This book is a lifeline.

475
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,690
It will show you everything you need to
know to keep our family safe.

476
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,210
You still don't believe me?

477
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,530
Step back.

478
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,050
Why?

479
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,310
Seeing is believing.

480
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
Hey, Steph.

481
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,216
Her face really exploded right in front of
you.

482
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,520
Is that like-Just leave her alone.

483
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,480
It's my bad, Steph.

484
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
I'm just curious.

485
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Hey.

486
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
How you holding up?

487
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,580
Yeah.

488
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,380
Sorry, Uncle Howard.

489
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,140
You were right about Iris.

490
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,200
I never should have went there.

491
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,900
Honey, there's no need to apologize.

492
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,400
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

493
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,360
She said something to me before she died.

494
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,120
She said death was coming for our family.

495
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,300
That's-That's crazy, right?

496
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,140
Oh my god.

497
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,580
I can't believe it.

498
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,520
I emailed her.

499
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,920
I just didn't think she'd show up.

500
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,820
I- Come on.

501
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,450
Is that Mom?

502
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,610
Yeah.

503
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:23,800
Come back.

504
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,600
It'll be ridiculous.

505
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
Come on.

506
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,960
You think she'll come to the barbecue?

507
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:36,570
Steph?

508
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,510
Hey, if she's going to Uncle Howard's
house, then I'm not.

509
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:40,730
You can get a ride with Dad.

510
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,150
I think you're going to talk to her?

511
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,330
Come on.

512
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,890
You don't remember her like I do.

513
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,370
Just give her a chance.

514
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:47,810
Why?

515
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,441
Charlie, she abandoned us
and now she rolls in here after

516
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,751
all these years and wants
to act like nothing happened?

517
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,140
Because who did that, right?

518
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,740
Wait, what?

519
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,640
Nothing, really.

520
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,660
No.

521
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,760
No, what's that supposed to mean?

522
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,520
I tried calling you so many times and
nothing.

523
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,640
Same with Julia.

524
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,600
You used to be best friends.

525
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,580
You don't even talk anymore.

526
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:12,200
Okay, well, I'm sorry.

527
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,860
I've just been distracted the last couple
of months because of this nightmare.

528
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,600
What about before that?

529
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,280
It's been like this ever since you left.

530
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,280
You're mad at Mom, but you haven't been
around either.

531
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,900
I'm not like her, okay?

532
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,680
I'm not crazy.

533
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,860
Yeah, you're right.

534
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,620
You're not crazy.

535
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,040
You just don't care.

536
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,000
Now you got it.

537
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,120
Watch out for splinters.

538
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,160
Hey, there she is.

539
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,120
Hey, come here.

540
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,020
So glad you made it.

541
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
Of course, come on.

542
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,640
Hey, everybody, come on, come on over.

543
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,460
Made cookies.

544
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,640
That's great.

545
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,220
Yes, of course.

546
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,481
Is this some peanut butter?

547
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,060
Yeah.

548
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,200
Are you trying to kill my brother?

549
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,340
Oh my God, Bob is allergic.

550
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,120
Yeah.

551
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,340
I totally forgot.

552
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,180
I'm so sorry.

553
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,746
The important thing is that you're here.

554
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,040
So, Bobby bartender, drinks, drinks all
around.

555
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,730
You don't get to pick the one you get.

556
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,090
Just gotta love the one that you got.

557
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,610
Now, uh, our mother, she lived alone till
the day that she died.

558
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,072
And her death should be
a reminder to all of us to

559
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:32,050
enjoy life and spend the
time that we have together.

560
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,721
Because we're not going to get any back.

561
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:39,050
I love you guys.

562
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:41,830
Cheers.

563
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,230
Cheers.

564
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:43,910
Cheers.

565
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:44,530
Cheers.

566
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,950
Cheers.

567
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,210
Cheers.

568
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:45,890
Cheers.

569
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:46,350
Cheers.

570
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:46,450
Cheers.

571
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,290
Cheers.

572
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:48,550
Cheers.

573
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,650
Oh my God.

574
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,270
There's a bug in there.

575
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,500
Bob, girls ready?

576
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,190
Mind if I join you?

577
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,690
See, get the load off.

578
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,600
There we go.

579
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:31,616
It's great to set up you've got here.

580
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:35,070
Well, I wanted the kids to have a happy
childhood.

581
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:36,930
Unlike some people I know.

582
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,711
You're not talking about us, are you?

583
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,030
Oh, yeah.

584
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,190
We had a great childhood.

585
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,910
Mm-hmm.

586
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:42,650
I mean, look at me.

587
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,910
I turned out fabulous.

588
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,090
Yep.

589
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,150
Oh, Howard.

590
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:57,290
What is that?

591
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,190
Looks like a housekeeping.

592
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:00,870
Come on.

593
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,819
You know, we got the
spare room and it's got to

594
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,231
be better than bouncing
around trailer parks.

595
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,500
I don't think this is a good idea.

596
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,440
It's never too late for a second chance.

597
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,750
I'm sorry.

598
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,920
They're better off without me.

599
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,000
Pick up.

600
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,360
Pick up.

601
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:32,361
Come on.

602
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,100
You got me, right?

603
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,220
Oh, nice catch, Andy.

604
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,460
All right.

605
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,080
All right.

606
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,520
Here we go.

607
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,100
Hey, Dad.

608
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:30,860
Let's do it.

609
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,940
Stay away from that edge.

610
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,640
Stephanie.

611
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,860
I'm glad you decided to come.

612
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,740
The whole family's here.

613
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,720
I'm okay.

614
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,040
All right.

615
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,400
Oh, good.

616
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:34,310
It's all right.

617
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,690
We shall wipe away every tear from their
eyes.

618
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,770
What is all this stuff?

619
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:03,650
Okay.

620
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,270
I found these papers in Iris's book.

621
00:52:06,945 --> 00:52:11,373
They are obituaries and
articles for the people who were

622
00:52:11,374 --> 00:52:14,310
at the Skyview on the night
that Iris had her premonition.

623
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,690
Each one of these people went on to die in
some weird and messed up way.

624
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,790
And not only that, they all died in the
same order as Iris's premonition.

625
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:29,270
Hundreds of people were supposed to die
that night, but Iris stopped the disaster.

626
00:52:30,795 --> 00:52:33,470
So death came back for them one by one.

627
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:38,870
Since there were so many survivors, it
took years for death to get to all of them.

628
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,730
But eventually it got to Iris.

629
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,430
She was the last to die in the
premonition.

630
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,190
It was her and a little boy.

631
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,130
But she was prepared.

632
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,410
She single-handedly held off death for
decades.

633
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,120
Stephanie, sweetie.

634
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,410
I don't think this is the appropriate time
with us.

635
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,350
Yeah, I mean, none of this even has
anything to do with us, right?

636
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:04,550
Why are we even here?

637
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,310
No, it has everything to do with us.

638
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:10,010
I mean, because death took so long to make
its way through the survivors,

639
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,790
these people went on to have families.

640
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,830
Families that they never should have had.

641
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,490
So death took them too.

642
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,050
Don't you see this?

643
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,250
Death is coming for us because we were
never supposed to exist.

644
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:29,190
Okay, so why everybody in this room is on
death's hit list?

645
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,410
Bobby, stop.

646
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:31,270
That's what she's saying.

647
00:53:31,271 --> 00:53:32,390
No, no, no.

648
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,430
Dad and Aunt Brenda are safe because
they're not part of Iris' bloodline.

649
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,910
Okay, following the pattern.

650
00:53:39,075 --> 00:53:41,950
Death makes its way down each branch by
age.

651
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:45,790
So because Uncle Howard was the oldest,
it'll start with his family first.

652
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,210
Meaning, Eric, you're next.

653
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:48,370
Go fuck yourself.

654
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,910
Then it'll go for Julia, then Bobby.

655
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,526
Then it'll come for our branch.

656
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:57,430
Starting with Darlene, then me,
then Charlie.

657
00:53:58,750 --> 00:53:59,750
Charlie, Charlie.

658
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,130
You buying this?

659
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:04,590
I don't know.

660
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,310
This is so messed up.

661
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,830
I mean, you're turning our dad's death into
some kind of fucked up conspiracy theory.

662
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,070
What is wrong with you?

663
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:11,990
No, no, no, no, no.

664
00:54:11,991 --> 00:54:12,470
It's not.

665
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,070
It's not a conspiracy theory.

666
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:14,990
That's enough.

667
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:15,770
We're all going to die.

668
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:16,170
Stop.

669
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,610
I can't listen to this for one more
minute.

670
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:24,070
That crazy woman's nonsense has caused
enough pain and suffering for this family.

671
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:24,590
Hang on.

672
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:27,250
Hey, Brenda, please just leave it alone.

673
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:27,650
Okay.

674
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:31,350
In Iris's book, she mentioned somebody who
cheated deaths and survived.

675
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:33,990
Eric, no, wait.

676
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,530
I'm worried about you.

677
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:36,970
Stop it.

678
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,190
Let me take care of this.

679
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,330
Brenda, Brenda.

680
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:41,810
No, no, no.

681
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:42,470
I'm sorry.

682
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:43,890
Please.

683
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,160
You believe me, right?

684
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,650
I'm sorry.

685
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,470
Look, I love you.

686
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,910
But sometimes I really hate you.

687
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:18,750
I know how convincing all of this can be,
but it's not real.

688
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,860
How can you say that?

689
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,170
I know Iris taught you all of this.

690
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,870
Don't let my mom's beliefs derail your
life.

691
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:29,070
Sing me they did mine.

692
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:37,460
Thank you so much for that advice,
but I really don't need a mom anymore.

693
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:38,461
All

694
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,910
right, open mine.

695
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:45,810
Very good.

696
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,110
This is gonna pinch, right?

697
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:50,370
Ready?

698
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:55,650
Five, four, three, two.

699
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,750
Gonna hit the club.

700
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,430
I need you to lock up.

701
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,990
And don't touch any of my liquor.

702
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,710
No, no.

703
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,230
You didn't say anything about locking up.

704
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:07,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

705
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,650
You didn't say shit about closing,
dude.

706
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:10,790
And cry me a river.

707
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:12,690
I hope you burn in hell.

708
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,550
You believe that shit?

709
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,770
My old man just died.

710
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:22,330
I come in as a favorite of that asshole,
and now he wants me to lock up.

711
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:24,430
You know what that is?

712
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:25,950
You know what that is?

713
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:27,630
It's inconsiderate.

714
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:28,870
Anyway, you're all done.

715
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:30,490
Thank you.

716
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:31,030
Of course.

717
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:31,910
Hey, five star review.

718
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:35,950
Like and subscribe and all the things.

719
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:26,980
And now it's only fair that I should let
you know what you should know.

720
00:58:26,981 --> 00:59:56,020
Oh God Come on.

721
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:16,900
Shit!

722
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,220
Shit!

723
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:57,620
Charlie, wake up.

724
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:58,740
Charlie, wake up!

725
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,916
I've been trying to call Eric all night.

726
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,000
He's not answering me.

727
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,020
I don't know where he is.

728
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,240
I'm worried.

729
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:05,480
I'm sure he's fine.

730
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,520
Well, have you heard from him?

731
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:15,230
I'm going over there.

732
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:16,290
I need to check on him.

733
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,090
You're coming too, Charlie!

734
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:23,510
He's got a whole voicemail.

735
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,750
Is that him?

736
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,270
My friend just said the testing part went
down last night.

737
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:31,790
What?

738
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,390
Steph!

739
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:33,570
Steph!

740
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:35,270
Ow!

741
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:36,271
Oh, what?

742
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:37,610
You're trying to kill me?

743
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:39,430
Eric?

744
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:40,350
Oh, yeah.

745
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:41,450
No, of course it's you.

746
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Dude!

747
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,260
We heard about the fire.

748
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:48,940
We thought you were dead.

749
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,960
I'm fine.

750
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:51,720
Are you okay?

751
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:52,580
I'm so worried about you.

752
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,120
Yeah, I'm fine.

753
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,940
I said I was lucky as fuck, but I was
wearing that leather jacket.

754
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,180
Bailey got burned.

755
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,356
Really my favorite jacket, though.

756
01:01:59,380 --> 01:01:59,920
What is this?

757
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:00,720
Oh, yeah.

758
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:01,721
Check it out.

759
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,200
I got branded.

760
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,920
Sick, right?

761
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,300
You like it?

762
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,400
You said you were asleep.

763
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,636
You're blowing up my phone with a goddamn
stalker.

764
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,140
What do you want me to do?

765
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,060
I don't get it.

766
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,061
You should be dead.

767
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,880
Right, yeah.

768
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:14,680
Yeah.

769
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,180
Or, you know, maybe...

770
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,740
Maybe death's not actually coming for our
family.

771
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,100
Because that would be fucking crazy.

772
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,220
Jesus!

773
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,680
Shit!

774
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,230
Or maybe I'm invincible.

775
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,990
Eric?

776
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:34,310
Eric!

777
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,950
Yeah?

778
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:35,570
Eric, wait!

779
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:36,270
Stop!

780
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,170
Just wait, okay?

781
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:40,171
Just because death didn't kill you last
night doesn't mean that you're safe.

782
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:43,830
Stay away from that tree trimmer!

783
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:48,230
Gonna move on its own, Steph?

784
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,370
Is that what it's gonna do?

785
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:51,050
It could fall.

786
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,370
And stay away from these kids.

787
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,370
I'll take my chances.

788
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:58,870
Steph, how is a couple kids with a soccer
ball gonna kill him?

789
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,530
I mean, I don't know.

790
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:07,150
The trimmer could fall and hit the leaf
blower guy, which causes him to...

791
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,610
blow stuff into the kid's eyes and then
take the ball to his face.

792
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

793
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,570
Soccer ball to my face?

794
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:17,130
That does sound deadly.

795
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:19,530
I should be more careful.

796
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:22,350
Hey!

797
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:23,270
What's up?

798
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:24,290
What happened to you?

799
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,230
Charve rolled by death, apparently.

800
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,090
She came.

801
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:28,530
That looks really bad.

802
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:30,350
No, wait, let me see that.

803
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,230
Eric, just stay away from this truck.

804
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:34,490
Oh, what, this truck?

805
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:34,770
Stop!

806
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:35,750
Oh my god.

807
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:36,850
Please.

808
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:38,070
Let's stop right here.

809
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:39,990
But it's such a beautiful truck.

810
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,050
Eric, just wait.

811
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,610
Stop.

812
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,350
You like that?

813
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:47,790
Oh my god.

814
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:49,030
Oh!

815
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,450
Uh oh!

816
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:52,770
Oh, Eric's tempting death again.

817
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,950
What's gonna happen?

818
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,110
Stop doing that.

819
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,690
What's gonna happen?

820
01:03:58,650 --> 01:03:59,790
Nothing at all.

821
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:01,310
How about that?

822
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:02,790
I'm just trying to help you.

823
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:04,730
Try less.

824
01:04:04,731 --> 01:04:07,430
Yeah, honestly, we're so done with your
garbage.

825
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:08,890
Can you please?

826
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,188
For the fifteen hundredth
time, no one gives a

827
01:04:11,189 --> 01:04:13,171
shit about your stupid
little death curse, okay?

828
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:17,010
So take a hint and leave us alone,
because death's not coming for our family.

829
01:04:21,090 --> 01:05:16,450
It's your dentist!

830
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:17,850
Whoa, whoa!

831
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:46,270
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

832
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:57,450
Should have believed you, Steph.

833
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,930
No, I am.

834
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:07,450
I screwed up the order and now Julia's
dead and it's my fault.

835
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,150
Guys, look.

836
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:15,430
What happened was traumatic and awful,
and it's not anybody's fault.

837
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,410
It's my fault.

838
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:21,730
Mom, it's not your fault.

839
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:22,950
It is my fault.

840
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:27,352
Stephanie, you were
only wrong about the order

841
01:06:27,353 --> 01:06:29,911
because there was
something you didn't know.

842
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:37,990
Eric isn't Howard's biological son.

843
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:42,706
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

844
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,116
And Stephanie, I didn't
believe you, so I didn't

845
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:48,430
say anything to you, and
now my little girl is dead.

846
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,590
Well, I don't understand why you had an
affair.

847
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:56,630
Your father and I were having such a hard
time, but it was good because I got you.

848
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:57,970
I got you out of it.

849
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,810
It was my real time.

850
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:02,310
It doesn't matter because Howard loved you
so, so much.

851
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:03,311
How is it?

852
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,280
It's my real time.

853
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,050
Jerry Fenbury.

854
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,250
Oh!

855
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,630
Jerry Fenbury?

856
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:16,190
Yes.

857
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:17,730
Oh, shit.

858
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,110
No, Jerry!

859
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:20,490
Jerry fucking Fenbury?

860
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,590
You don't know what we're going through.

861
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,050
Oh, God, what is this?

862
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,850
Why are you always wanting to play catch?

863
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:26,930
Oh, Rick.

864
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:34,230
Okay.

865
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:42,070
So that means that if it's going in the
right order, then I'm next, right?

866
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,041
You got to help me, Steph.

867
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,840
Oh, my God.

868
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:54,460
I don't think that I can.

869
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:58,920
I mean, I thought I did,
but I don't... No, but you can.

870
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,980
I mean, you predicted exactly what was
going to happen.

871
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,580
You just got the order wrong because you
didn't have all the information, Charlie.

872
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,500
What do you mean, predicted?

873
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,020
She saw everything.

874
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,520
The trimmer, the blower, the soccer ball.

875
01:08:15,475 --> 01:08:18,053
It was like they were
pieces to a puzzle and she

876
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:19,880
just had to put them together,
you know what I mean?

877
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:20,540
Is that true?

878
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,860
Darling, please do not encourage this.

879
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:31,940
Marty, I mean, everything in Iris' book,
it's like an equation.

880
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:32,780
It's math.

881
01:08:32,955 --> 01:08:37,300
Stephanie, if you can see how all of this
fits together, we might have a chance.

882
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,480
Just stop.

883
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:44,760
You devastated this family when you walked
out, but we've been okay without you.

884
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,460
I'm begging you not to traumatize our kids
anymore.

885
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,620
It's real this time.

886
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:56,860
I'm going for a walk.

887
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,240
I need some air.

888
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,860
I can appreciate that.

889
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,146
Our family is clearly going to
need some counseling in the

890
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:13,880
future, but can we focus on the
fact that we're all about to die?

891
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:14,560
Right?

892
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:19,620
I mean, I mean, Steph,
didn't you say that Iris

893
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:23,020
knew someone that
cheated death or something?

894
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,620
Yeah, um, it's here somewhere.

895
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:33,040
It says that, um, right here, J.B.

896
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:37,600
found someone who survived, but it doesn't
say anything about who this J.B.

897
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,320
was or-Wait a minute, I know that name.

898
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,150
My mom used to write me
letters, and she sometimes

899
01:09:43,151 --> 01:09:45,020
would talk about a
friend of hers named J.B.

900
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,920
who worked at a hospital.

901
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:55,780
Um, um, something, uh, something river
hospital, uh, uh, Deep River, uh,

902
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,820
Peace River Hospital, uh, Clear River-
Hope, Hope River?

903
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,280
That's it!

904
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,840
Shit, it's like an hour away.

905
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:02,900
I'm going.

906
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,060
I'm gonna go find him and talk to him
myself.

907
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,500
While I'm coming with you.

908
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:06,860
Me too.

909
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,040
Okay, yeah, yeah.

910
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,080
Let's, let's go.

911
01:10:10,965 --> 01:10:12,980
Harvey, uh-What?

912
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:15,931
You need to stay here with your mom,
it's safer.

913
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,200
Yeah, fuck that.

914
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:18,820
Are you kidding me?

915
01:10:18,821 --> 01:10:20,120
I'm not staying here by myself.

916
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,400
Well, it's, it's too dangerous on the road
for you.

917
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,620
You can't-No, I read Gammie's death book,
okay?

918
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,000
Alright?

919
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:30,240
I mean, there's like a thousand
house-related deaths in that thing, man.

920
01:10:30,575 --> 01:10:35,160
You could trip down the stairs,
fall down a toilet or something,

921
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:35,960
I don't, I don't know.

922
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,640
But I'm not, I'm not, no way, I'm not
staying here.

923
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:40,420
Hang on, hang on.

924
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:40,840
Hey.

925
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,200
Okay, okay.

926
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:42,900
Too fast.

927
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:43,460
Okay, okay.

928
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,400
We'll go slow, we'll go slow.

929
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,656
I'm gonna go open up the truck.

930
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,540
Charlie, check the back.

931
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,680
Got it.

932
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,591
Be careful, this stuff's slippery
sometimes.

933
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,440
Hey!

934
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,720
Any of you fuckers doing that check?

935
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:01,740
Excuse me?

936
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,840
You made cookies in that thing with peanut
butter in them just a few days ago.

937
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,686
This poor bastard so much
as he even touches, and

938
01:11:08,687 --> 01:11:10,761
not his sword, he's
gonna close up tight and...

939
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:13,651
You understand, where's the peanut butter?

940
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:15,260
Cabin and above the sink.

941
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,680
Thank you.

942
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,720
I'm so sorry Bobby, I just...

943
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,200
Hey, okay.

944
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,400
All cleared.

945
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:28,500
Thank you.

946
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,400
You're a good brother, Eric.

947
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,020
Not checked.

948
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,220
What?

949
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,460
It was good, I get it.

950
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,380
Wait!

951
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,340
I'm coming with you, bro.

952
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,000
Someone's gotta protect you.

953
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:57,830
Dad's calling again.

954
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:00,490
Tell him we just went for a ride with mom.

955
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,690
He's not gonna believe that.

956
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,030
At least it'll buy us some time.

957
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,610
Death doesn't get us, you did,
Will.

958
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,380
I always keep them where I can see them.

959
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,663
I mean, you could've
just had the real thing,

960
01:12:27,664 --> 01:12:30,221
but it's okay, not everyone
wants to be a mom.

961
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,640
Is that what you think?

962
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,020
That I didn't want to be your mom?

963
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:43,740
Look, I was raised by a woman who taught
me to see death everywhere.

964
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:48,400
I thought I could put it behind me,
but then when I had you and your brother,

965
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:53,040
all I could see were a hundred different
ways that you and Charlie could die.

966
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,720
I didn't want you to leave the house.

967
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,320
I would freak out on you guys over...
nothing.

968
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:05,680
One day I looked at your face and I saw
the same scared little girl that I was

969
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:08,820
growing up, and I knew that if I stayed,
I was gonna ruin your life.

970
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,320
I have no idea if I did the right thing.

971
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,440
But I'm here for you now.

972
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:56,510
Hey, I see you, buddy.

973
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:57,150
We're going.

974
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:58,870
The front desk is this way.

975
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:06,130
Oh, hi.

976
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:09,330
Um, we're looking for JB.

977
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:11,430
And who are you?

978
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:14,590
The front desk told us we could find him
down here.

979
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:15,050
Is that you?

980
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:17,630
That would be me.

981
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,720
William John Bloodworth.

982
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,200
But my friends call me JB.

983
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,200
I've been waiting for you, Stephanie.

984
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,540
Charlie, Darlene, Button.

985
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,550
So, which one of you is next?

986
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:48,530
Hi.

987
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:50,430
I was sorry to hear about Iris.

988
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:53,150
She was a special woman.

989
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:55,450
How did you know her?

990
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,010
She saved my life.

991
01:14:58,950 --> 01:14:59,950
When?

992
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,970
At the Skyview.

993
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:11,170
Another brought me with her to work that
night.

994
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:14,730
JB, honey, I told you, you've got to stay
back there while I'm on stage.

995
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:19,130
I wasn't supposed to be there,
except, of course, to die.

996
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:51,383
So, all that time, she
wasn't just protecting

997
01:15:51,384 --> 01:15:54,561
our family, she was
protecting you, too.

998
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,340
Years later, she tracked me down,
helped me see the truth.

999
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,680
We traded ideas.

1000
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,060
I helped her fortify her cabin.

1001
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,180
We became friends.

1002
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:12,100
I even helped her get the best medical
care I could, considering her condition.

1003
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,740
Iris said that you found somebody who
stopped death and survived.

1004
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,220
Yes.

1005
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,960
And how do we do that?

1006
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,900
There are only two ways.

1007
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,740
By killing or by dying.

1008
01:16:24,741 --> 01:16:29,540
If you take a life, you get the time that
person had left.

1009
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:29,980
What?

1010
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,300
No, I'm not going to kill someone.

1011
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,876
Maybe we should let the guy finish.

1012
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,460
Then, to truly break the cycle,
you have to die.

1013
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,800
What does that mean?

1014
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:44,442
A long time ago, a young
woman named Kimberly

1015
01:16:44,443 --> 01:16:48,800
Corman found herself on
death's list, just like you.

1016
01:16:48,801 --> 01:16:52,580
And when her turn finally came,
she died.

1017
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,240
Flatlined.

1018
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,340
But her doctor managed to bring her back.

1019
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,140
And that broke the chain.

1020
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,840
Alright, then we'll do that.

1021
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,100
What are you talking about?

1022
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,580
Why didn't Iris try that?

1023
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,860
It's risky.

1024
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:13,360
And if you fuck with death and lose,
things can get very messy.

1025
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,300
Wait.

1026
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:17,570
Hang on.

1027
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:17,870
Hang on.

1028
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,010
Okay, wait.

1029
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,970
There has to be another way.

1030
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:22,590
Please, you have to help us.

1031
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,730
For years, people have been coming to me
for advice.

1032
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,550
Well, I'm tired.

1033
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:30,430
I'm done with all that.

1034
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:32,850
And now I'm sick, just like Iris.

1035
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:34,930
There's no running this time.

1036
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:38,430
The fact is, you're all going to die.

1037
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:42,210
And after that, I will too.

1038
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:49,120
Now that my old friend is gone,
I'm retiring.

1039
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:49,940
So what?

1040
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,476
You're just going to leave us here?

1041
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:51,500
Wait, wait, wait.

1042
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,220
Dude, what means your help?

1043
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:52,760
Where are you going?

1044
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:57,100
I intend to enjoy the time I have left.

1045
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:00,680
And I suggest that you do the same.

1046
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,740
Life is precious.

1047
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,840
Enjoy every single second.

1048
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,220
You never know when.

1049
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:23,090
That's fantastic.

1050
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:25,610
No.

1051
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:27,850
No, that can't be it.

1052
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,110
No.

1053
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:31,750
There has to be something here.

1054
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,390
There has to be another answer.

1055
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:37,010
Steph, Steph, he gave us an answer.

1056
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:39,150
Bobby's got to die.

1057
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:41,850
Eric, you're fucking insane.

1058
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:42,710
We're not killing Bobby.

1059
01:18:42,711 --> 01:18:43,290
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1060
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:45,291
Am I the only guy that just listened to
that, dude?

1061
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:46,590
There's only one way.

1062
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:50,650
We kill Bobby, we resuscitate him,
and then boom, you're all off death's list.

1063
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:51,170
Congratulations.

1064
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:53,070
Wait, there has to be something else,
right?

1065
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:55,310
I mean, there has to be another solution,
right, Steph?

1066
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:57,490
No.

1067
01:18:58,455 --> 01:19:00,990
No, there's nothing else we can do,
okay?

1068
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,070
It's over.

1069
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:05,390
Stephanie, listen to me.

1070
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,431
You have to trust me on this one,
okay?

1071
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:08,490
She's giving up on you.

1072
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:09,710
I'm not going to.

1073
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:13,050
Look, Iris found a way to hold death off
for decades.

1074
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:16,490
So will we.

1075
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:17,670
I trust that guy.

1076
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:18,730
Do you trust that guy?

1077
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:20,150
He was... that just went back.

1078
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:23,270
He was just on a charismatic, and you know
that as well as I do.

1079
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,700
Eric and Bobby are gone.

1080
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,760
Shit.

1081
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,960
Shit!

1082
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,420
I don't think I like this, dude.

1083
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:45,720
We're in a hospital.

1084
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,496
Remember, there's doctors everywhere.

1085
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,440
We kill you, they bring you back.

1086
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:50,780
Everybody's safe.

1087
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,160
We're heroes.

1088
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,140
That is literally the opposite of keeping
you safe.

1089
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,660
Hey, what's the alternative, huh?

1090
01:19:55,661 --> 01:19:58,640
You want to kill someone, take the time
they have left?

1091
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:00,100
How?

1092
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,220
How do you even know how many years they
have?

1093
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:10,100
No.

1094
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:10,520
No.

1095
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,060
No.

1096
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,060
Well, I mean, no.

1097
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:15,540
No.

1098
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:16,160
Of course not.

1099
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:16,700
Of course not.

1100
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:17,440
We would do that, right?

1101
01:20:17,441 --> 01:20:17,540
No.

1102
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,080
We would never.

1103
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,200
Don't touch those babies.

1104
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,980
Look, bottom line, flatlining is your best
option.

1105
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,500
What do you have to lose?

1106
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:30,100
Okay.

1107
01:20:30,101 --> 01:20:30,420
Okay.

1108
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:30,920
All right.

1109
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,960
How would we even do that?

1110
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,300
See, I got an idea.

1111
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,320
But it's a little nuts.

1112
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:45,340
Your allergy is deadly, right?

1113
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,680
Well...

1114
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,240
Oh, hey, dude, wait.

1115
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:57,900
No, look, all right?

1116
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,620
If I'm going out, it's not going to be on
those... what is it?

1117
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,460
Salted bitches, all right?

1118
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,760
Give me those.

1119
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,140
Nice choice.

1120
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,520
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

1121
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:20,580
Come on.

1122
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,140
Hey, all right.

1123
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:22,860
Come on.

1124
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,300
You know, maybe this is a sign,
so we can just...

1125
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:27,660
Ah, okay.

1126
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,100
Hey, dude, maybe we can just bail now.

1127
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,620
I'm not giving up.

1128
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:37,340
Can you help?

1129
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:38,260
It's all right.

1130
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,320
We work here.

1131
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,160
Maintenance.

1132
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:40,980
It's fine.

1133
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,220
Put your headphones back on.

1134
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,320
Dude, it's going to fall.

1135
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,640
It's going to fall.

1136
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,300
Oh, it's falling.

1137
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:48,860
Hold it.

1138
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:56,700
Easy work.

1139
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,080
Now what?

1140
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:01,660
Come on, man.

1141
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:02,740
Come on, man.

1142
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:07,630
Hey, hang here.

1143
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:08,850
Got to get something.

1144
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:11,090
Don't move.

1145
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:12,490
What are you talking about?

1146
01:22:26,740 --> 01:23:02,060
It's cool.

1147
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,480
I've seen it in the back.

1148
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,500
And we're in the RV?

1149
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:05,060
No.

1150
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,776
Look, if Eric was trying to cut Bobby,
where would they be?

1151
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,240
I don't know, but there's a million ways
to die in a hospital.

1152
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:11,520
Can I help you?

1153
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:12,980
Excuse me?

1154
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,920
No, just come to see my Nana.

1155
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,240
Lovely day today.

1156
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:23,820
Got much time left?

1157
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,340
I think so.

1158
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,468
All the talent, belongings,
and devices that

1159
01:23:31,469 --> 01:23:34,101
could interact with the
MRI's powerful magnets.

1160
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,180
Hey, dude, Charlie's trying to call our
banking event.

1161
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:40,080
Hey, come on.

1162
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,480
Sit down.

1163
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:41,320
Sit down.

1164
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:41,740
What the hell?

1165
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,140
No, but I sit in that.

1166
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,420
Well, I've got a great idea.

1167
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:47,720
There's an ER down the hall, so as soon as
you flatline, boom, I'm going to wheel

1168
01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:49,481
your ass down there and bring you right
back.

1169
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:50,880
Hey, where's your FVV?

1170
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:52,660
It's right here.

1171
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:53,720
Give it to me.

1172
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,040
What?

1173
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:57,780
What is that?

1174
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:58,340
Give it.

1175
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:58,940
Give it.

1176
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,280
Dude, listen.

1177
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,880
The whole idea is that you have to die.

1178
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:02,420
Remember?

1179
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:03,660
This keeps you alive.

1180
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:04,740
Now sit.

1181
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:06,780
Dude, we need to hurry.

1182
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:07,860
Come on, go.

1183
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,120
Alright, meet up.

1184
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,460
Hey, man.

1185
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,520
Um,

1186
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:21,420
the plan's great, but, you know, if it
doesn't work out... It's going to work, Bobby.

1187
01:24:21,421 --> 01:24:22,421
Okay, yeah.

1188
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:27,420
Yeah, but, you know, just in case,
and I die for real...

1189
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:34,620
Will you just, um... Will you look after
Paco?

1190
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,800
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1191
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:37,260
I'll look after him.

1192
01:24:37,261 --> 01:24:40,220
Dude, I'm just saying, I mean,
the Turtles live to be like 100 years old.

1193
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,820
Look at me.

1194
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,180
Look at me.

1195
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,800
Brother, I'm not going to take care of
Paco because you are going to be okay.

1196
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:50,960
Me and you, we are going to fix things for
everyone right now.

1197
01:24:57,410 --> 01:24:59,230
I promise you, I'm not going to let you
die.

1198
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:03,546
Technically, I'm going to let you die,
but then I'm going to bring you back.

1199
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:04,570
Dude, it's not funny.

1200
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:05,910
I'm just talking with you.

1201
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:07,930
I'm up.

1202
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:09,890
You got this.

1203
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,400
Oh, my God.

1204
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:42,960
What?

1205
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,200
It's really good.

1206
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,360
It's very good, I know.

1207
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,840
Okay, other than good, what are you
feeling?

1208
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:53,610
Nothing.

1209
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,070
You've got to be kidding me.

1210
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:57,170
What, are you telling me you're not
allergic anymore?

1211
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,650
I grew out of it.

1212
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:00,750
What, grew out of it?

1213
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:02,230
Fuck.

1214
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:04,410
You know, I don't have a plan B exactly.

1215
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:11,410
Hey, you're doing it.

1216
01:26:11,411 --> 01:26:12,550
Bobby, you're doing it.

1217
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:14,510
Hey, I'm here with you.

1218
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,130
Hey, hey, I can't give you that.

1219
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:20,570
Bobby, Bobby, hey.

1220
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:23,430
Wait.

1221
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:25,370
Bobby, it's so hard to play.

1222
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:26,690
Calm down.

1223
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:29,170
Bobby, in the wheelchair.

1224
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,410
Try calling them in.

1225
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:39,070
This is the only way we can do this.

1226
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Yeah.

1227
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,420
Why, why is Eric dead if he's not related
to Iris?

1228
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,580
When you fuck with Dad, things get messy.

1229
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:17,890
We have to get out of here.

1230
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:21,230
It's not safe.

1231
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:23,730
Then go where?

1232
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:26,290
Nowhere is safe.

1233
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,030
Except Iris' cabin.

1234
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,870
She was able to survive there for decades.

1235
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,530
Yeah, and then she got her face blown off.

1236
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:39,430
She only died because she left the cabin.

1237
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:44,110
Outside is dangerous, but inside is the
safest place that there is.

1238
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:50,770
It's the only place where we have any
advantage.

1239
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:55,530
So we just lock ourselves in a cabin
forever?

1240
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:01,710
Not you.

1241
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:04,750
Me here.

1242
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:06,990
Mom, you can't leave.

1243
01:30:06,991 --> 01:30:08,030
We just got you back.

1244
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:12,250
If anybody's gonna live in that cabin,
it's me.

1245
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:16,670
And as long as I am alive, death can't
touch you.

1246
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:18,210
Mom, let me do this.

1247
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,010
He'll never let you get there on your own.

1248
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,030
But I can see him coming.

1249
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:24,810
We have to do this together.

1250
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,960
You should drive.

1251
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,440
Yeah.

1252
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,060
Look at this place.

1253
01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:21,370
It's gonna be impossible to get through
that gate.

1254
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:41,880
He's about to make a move.

1255
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,320
I don't know what it is.

1256
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,180
We need to get you inside now.

1257
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,540
Wait.

1258
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:50,700
Wait, what?

1259
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:33,920
Shit!

1260
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,180
What?

1261
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:44,110
Don't wait for me.

1262
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:44,590
Just get inside.

1263
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:46,610
If you get inside, I'll be safe.

1264
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:47,350
Go.

1265
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:48,970
Okay.

1266
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,240
We'll save you, sister.

1267
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:44,740
I'm gonna stay alive as long as I can.

1268
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,640
Okay.

1269
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:23,190
Just breathe.

1270
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,110
Breathe.

1271
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,010
Tell me.

1272
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:32,110
What happened?

1273
01:37:33,010 --> 01:37:34,130
You're okay.

1274
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,190
You died.

1275
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:39,490
And I brought you back.

1276
01:37:56,650 --> 01:37:57,650
Mom?

1277
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,000
She saved us.

1278
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:22,930
Let's go home.

1279
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,480
Well, there he is.

1280
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:12,060
Wow.

1281
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:13,100
Okay, Charlie.

1282
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,100
Alright, give us a spin.

1283
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:18,240
Oh.

1284
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:20,820
You look really good.

1285
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:22,740
I'm a great stylist.

1286
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,760
Come on.

1287
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:25,900
You're gonna be late.

1288
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Where's Jenny?

1289
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:38,160
You think she's still inside getting
ready?

1290
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:40,840
Here, let me fix this.

1291
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,880
I'm really happy to be here for this.

1292
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,400
Me too.

1293
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,160
You're okay?

1294
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:53,640
Yeah.

1295
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:03,340
Can I have one cookie, please?

1296
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,340
Look, it's sharp.

1297
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:40,000
Thank you.

1298
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:42,320
Steph, I want you to meet Jenny's dad,
Dr. Redick.

1299
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,140
Hey, Bart.

1300
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:44,080
Nice to meet you.

1301
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:45,300
You too.

1302
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:46,660
We just adore Charlie.

1303
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:49,136
And I understand he's quite the life
saver.

1304
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:50,540
Oh, yeah, you heard about that.

1305
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,920
He, uh, brought me back from the dead.

1306
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:58,400
Yeah.

1307
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:00,460
What?

1308
01:41:00,461 --> 01:41:02,160
Well, technically, you weren't dead.

1309
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:05,220
What?

1310
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:07,533
I mean, if you were
unconscious and Charlie got

1311
01:41:07,613 --> 01:41:09,720
your breathing again,
then your heart didn't stop.

1312
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,680
But regardless, way to go, Charlie.

1313
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
So she wasn't dead?

1314
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,520
Exactly.

1315
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:21,850
She was lucky Charlie was there.

1316
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:22,650
Yeah.

1317
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:24,390
Everything happens for a reason.

1318
01:41:24,391 --> 01:41:25,391
Jenny!

1319
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:32,490
She looks like a girl in a box.
