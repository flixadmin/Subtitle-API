1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,580
Mr Churchill...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,580
If there are bodies to be buried,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,580
dig holes and dig them deep.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,580
Don't do this in here.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,580
You're taking me away from my baby!

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,580
Freddie! Ada!

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,580
It wasn't me
who shopped Freddie Thorne.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,580
He trusts me. I told you that.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,580
I think I know where
the guns are hidden.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,580
I want your word that
Thomas Shelby will not be harmed

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,600
if the guns are recovered.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,580
It would be an honour
to work with you, Mr Kimber.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Nobody works with me.
People work FOR me.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,580
A black star? What does that mean?

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
Black star day is the day we take
out Billy Kimber and his men.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,580
Grace...will you marry me?

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,580
You deserve better.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,580
Is it him?!

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Where is he? He left.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
With the barmaid.

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,580
Service.

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,580
HE KNOCKS AT DOOR

23
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
We don't open two more hours.
You come back later.

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Police.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,580
Inspector Campbell, sir.

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,580
Any trouble, sir?

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,580
Look...

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,600
I know.

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,580
That is, I am given to understand
by several of my officers...

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,580
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,600
..several of my officers,
that people come here...

32
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,580
..that men come here for...

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
a certain purpose.

BANGING AT DOOR

52
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,580
John, I've told you
to keep the doors locked.

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,580
I could've been anyone.

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,580
Get dressed.

We're doing it today.

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,580
As a matter of fact,
he's doing me today.

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,580
Make sure he's done you by nine.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,580
You should learn to knock!

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
It's not a day for knocking.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Dear Lord, make this day pass well.

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,580
Let none get hurt

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
and make them that do not Shelbys.

63
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,580
Watch John,

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
cos he has so many
depending on him.

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,580
Watch Arthur

66
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,580
because he's as likely to hurt
himself as anyone else.

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Watch Thomas.

68
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,580
I know how he is.

69
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
But he does what he does for us.

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,580
I think.

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Amen.

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,580
I used to do that every
morning during the war.

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,580
I hoped I'd done
it for the last time.

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Today will be the last time, Poll.

75
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,580
After today,
there'll be no need for prayers.

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
We'll be set.

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Family meeting, half ten.

78
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I'm sorry I kept you.
It is so early.

79
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,580
Yes. I-I...

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I didn't sleep last night.

81
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Mr Zhang said you are special,
special customer.

82
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Do you want to sit?

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Do you want to take off your boots?

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Yes.

85
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
And...this.

86
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
So tight.

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,580
We can also clean and press
your shirt while we do this.

88
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
That's a very efficient service.

89
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
You never been to
a place like this before?

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,580
It's OK.

91
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,580
Sometimes old men who have
lost their wives, they come here...

92
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,580
all the time.

93
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,580
Old men?

94
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,580
I am so old?

95
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,580
No! I mean I am young.

96
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,580
Anyway...

97
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I'll make you young as well.

98
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Whore.

99
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,580
'Dear Grace.

and with whom.

any of it in my report.

I know you gave yourself to the man

105
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,580
'That is not only treason,

106
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,580
'it is disgusting
beyond all measure.

107
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,580
'Your father would be
ashamed of you.

108
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,580
'And as for myself...
I am beyond desolation.

109
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,580
'You have betrayed every principle

110
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,580
'and standard of honour
that was your birthright.

111
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,580
'And for what?'

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,580
THEY GASP

113
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Love.

114
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,580
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
Did I do that?

115
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,600
It's OK.
You are special, special customer.

116
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,580
Would you sit with me for a moment?

117
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Please.

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
You want to hear something funny?

121
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
WHISPERS: Campbell was in the back
room with one of my girls.

123
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I am unarmed.

124
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,580
It's curious, Inspector.

125
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,580
I thought you came here
to clean up the city.

126
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Not to sleep with its whores.

127
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,580
You're no different from any other
copper that came before you.

128
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,580
I'm no different from those
who would follow

129
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,580
should I choose to leave.

130
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,580
You've no reason to stay.

131
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,580
You have what you came for.

132
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Yes. I have what I came for.

133
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,580
I have a meeting with
Mr Winston Churchill at midday.

134
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,580
And no doubt he intends to
congratulate me

135
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,580
on finding those stolen guns.

136
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,580
And you still don't know
how we found them, do you?

137
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,580
Good.

138
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,580
Oh, you got lucky.

139
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,580
Did I?

140
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Yeah.

141
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
One thing I have learned...

142
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,580
..is that you and I are opposites,

143
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
but also just the same.

144
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Like an image in a mirror.

145
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
We hate people.

146
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,600
And they in turn hate us.

147
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
And fear us.

148
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Before the day is over,
your heart will be broken...

149
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
..just the same as mine.

150
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Men like us, Mr Shelby...

151
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
..will always be alone.

152
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
And what love we get...

153
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
..we will have to pay for.

154
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
You forget, Inspector.

155
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
I have my family.

156
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Enjoy your day.

157
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
BABY CRIES

158
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,580
Oh, little one...

159
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
You're much better
with him than I am.

160
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,580
He settles quicker with me
cos he can't smell the milk.

161
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
You're tired. Let's put him down.

162
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,580
Mine were terrors for the tit.

163
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Both of them.

164
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,580
Well, you never knew
my children, did you?

165
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
No, I was a child myself, then.

166
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,580
You never talk about them.

167
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Never had reason to.

168
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
My heart breaks even
when I think about them.

169
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,580
But today...

170
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,580
I do have reason to.

171
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Sit down, Ada.

172
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
They were three and five years old.

173
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,580
Sally was three,
Michael was five. Well...

174
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
two weeks away from being six.

175
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
It was Sunday morning.
I was at church.

176
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,580
"You're not forgiven."

177
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,580
This...pinch-faced bitch said
to me, "You're not forgiven."

178
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,580
You see, some sheets I washed
and hung on the line

179
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,580
had the name of a hotel on them.

180
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,580
They'd been stolen in a robbery,

181
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,580
and they said some porter
at the hotel had been coshed.

182
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,580
And a woman from round here told
the police about the sheets -

183
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,580
jealous, you see, of the new sheets.

184
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,580
And when the police came,

185
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,600
they found a spirit still
for making a few drops of gin.

186
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
And for that...

187
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
..they took my children from me.

188
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,580
And they never told me
where they took them.

189
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,580
And they did it cos they could.
And cos I was weak.

190
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,580
But they will never take
your baby away from you.

191
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Do you know why?

192
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,580
Cos Tommy wouldn't let them.

193
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,580
Cos Tommy won't let them
walk all over us.

194
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Now it is Tommy who has given
strength and power to this family.

195
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Cos he knows...

196
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,600
..you have to be as bad as them
above in order to survive.

197
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,580
I'm telling you this
cos I want you to forgive him.

198
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,580
How can I?

199
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,580
When my Freddie's rotting
in jail because of him.

200
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
There's something about today
you need to know.

201
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
KEY CLANKS IN LOCK

202
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,580
All right, Freddie, time to go.

203
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,580
I want to get a message to Campbell.

204
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
I can't let them move me to Brixton.

205
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,580
If I go to Brixton,
they'll kill me.

206
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,580
Freddie.

207
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
You're not going to
get as far as Brixton prison.

208
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,580
On your feet.

209
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,580
I told the Prime Minister personally
that the guns had been retrieved

210
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,580
and he actually heard me
and listened,

211
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,580
and I'm pretty sure
he gave me a half smile.

212
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,580
He never usually smiles
unless a political opponent dies.

213
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,580
HE CHUCKLES

214
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,580
I plan to put your name forward
in the New Year's Honours list...

215
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,580
That would be too much, sir.

216
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,580
Nonsense. You deserve it.

217
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,580
As I recall, you wrote to me several
times about an undercover operative.

218
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
A woman.

219
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Was she involved in the discovery?

220
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Does she deserve
some kind of commendation?

221
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,580
Yes.

222
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,580
She was instrumental.

223
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,580
A truly loyal servant of the crown.

224
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
And that is what
the record should state.

225
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,580
And what of the men
who actually stole the guns?

226
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,580
The Peaky...

227
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Blinders, sir.

228
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,580
If we were to make arrests,

229
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,580
the whole thing would
end up in open court,

230
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,580
and I know we wish to keep
this matter confidential.

231
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,580
So they'll go free?

232
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Not quite, sir.

233
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,600
You see, I have plans
for the Peaky Blinders.

234
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
All right.

235
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,580
All right. All right, mate?

236
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,580
Leave that, boys,
come back to it later.

237
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,580
Right.

238
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,580
I've brought you all here today

239
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,580
because this is the day
we replace Billy Kimber.

240
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,580
This is the day
we become respectable.

241
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,580
The day we join the official
National Association...

242
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
of Race Course Bookmakers.

243
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,580
But first...

244
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,580
we do the dirty work.

245
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,580
We've all known it's been coming.

246
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
I just haven't told anyone the date.

247
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,580
We're going to the Worcester races.

248
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,580
The track opens at one,
we get there at two.

249
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,580
Now, Kimber thinks we're going there
to help him fight the Lee brothers.

250
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,580
But thanks to the efforts
of our John,

251
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,580
and his lovely new wife Esme,
the Lees are now our kin.

252
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,580
I interrupted those efforts
this morning, and, er...

253
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,580
LAUGHTER
I can assure you all,

254
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,580
John is making great sacrifices
in the cause of peace.

255
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,580
Yeah, all right.

256
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
So, it'll be us and the Lees
against Kimber's boys.

257
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,580
We take them out,
then leave the bookies.

258
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,580
I expect a swift victory which will
send a signal all the way to London,

259
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,600
that we believe in letting
legitimate businesses run peacefully.

260
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
And, er...
What about Kimber himself?

261
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,580
I'll deal with Kimber.

262
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Any other questions?

263
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Yes.

264
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Oh, does anyone object if I bring
a newcomer to the meeting?

265
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Come on.

266
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I'd like to introduce the newest
member of the Shelby clan.

267
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Welcome home, Ada.

268
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,580
We named him Karl.

269
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,580
After Karl Marx.

270
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,580
LAUGHTER
Karl bloody Marx?

271
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,580
Let me get a look at him.

272
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,580
Oh, here we go.

273
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,580
Eh, look.
He looks just like me, look.

274
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,580
LAUGHTER

275
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,580
That's his arse looks like you,
Arthur. He's all right.

276
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,580
He's a Shelby.

277
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Well, Ada?

278
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,580
Am I forgiven?

279
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
If what Aunt Polly says is true,
you are.

280
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
It's true.

281
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Thank you, Tommy.

282
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,580
So, who the hell are you?

283
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,580
Someone who wants to keep his eyes.

284
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,580
They came to my house.

285
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,580
Told me to volunteer for this.

286
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Who did?

287
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Peaky blinders.

288
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600

What the bloody hell is that?

298
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Looks like your friends are here.

299
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,580
Stay down on the ground.

300
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Or the next one's for you.

301
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,580
Make it look good.

302
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
I am sorry about this, comrade.

303
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,580
Holy shit.

304
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,580
Danny, you're dead.

305
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,580
Nah. I've been living in London.
Same thing.

306
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
In you get.

307
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,580
All right, lads, listen up.

308
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,580
You have a pint and a chaser,
no more.

309
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
On the house.

310
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Right. Let's get pouring.

311
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,580
Do you have the enclosure tickets?

312
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,580
And the register of book-keepers
on the track?

313
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,580
In me coat.

314
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,580
You did a good job, Grace.

315
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
That's what it is, innit?

316
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,580
The next family meeting,
I'll make sure you're there.

317
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,600
If I were family. But I'm not.

318
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
That could change.

319
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,580
Tommy... We'll talk about it more
when I get back. All right?

320
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,580
When will you be back?

321
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,580
Oh, is this how it's going to be, eh?

322
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,600
You waiting at home for me, saying,
"What time do you call this?"

323
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
The barrel needs changing.

324
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,580
Go on, Tommy, go out the back,

325
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,580
give her a good seeing to
before we go.

326
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
THEY CHUCKLE

327
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,580
Grace...

328
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,580
Hey, Grace, I was joking.

329
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,580
JOHN BANGS ON THE BAR
Tommy, we need more mild!

330
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Just help yourselves.

331
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,580
Tommy, the truth is

332
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
when you come back from the races,
I won't be here.

333
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
What are you talking about?

334
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,580
All right, look.

335
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Grace, I know you weren't born
to be with a man like me...

336
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,580
But I'm turning things around.

337
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,580
And when I get back here tonight...

338
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,600
I will have one of the biggest legal
racetrack syndicates in the country.

339
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
And I'm going to close down
some of that other stuff.

340
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,580
Maybe open a club, hey?

341
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Like in London.

342
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
And another thing.

343
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,580
You have a contract of employment.

344
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,580
With a real limited company.
You remember?

345
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,580
I remember everything, Tommy.

346
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,580
I am going to make a success of this.

347
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,580
I am going to make a success of it.

348
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
I am. I know. I know.

349
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,580
And I'm not talking about marriage.

350
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
I'm...

351
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
We know each other. We can talk.

352
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,580
We're the same...

353
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Tommy, I have done
something terrible to you.

354
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,580
DOOR OPENS

355
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,580
Right, tell him
what you just told me.

356
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,580
Just heard there's two vans driving
up the Stratford Road.

357
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,580
An old corporal of mine
said he recognised some of the men.

358
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,600
He said it's Kimber boys,
and they're heading this way.

359
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,580
Ada, wake up.

360
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,580
You and the baby get into the Bull
Ring, where there's lots of people.

361
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,580
What's going on?
We've been fucking betrayed.

362
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,580
Someone let slip.
Kimber's men are on their way here.

363
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,580
Yeah, but you can handle them,
Tommy? It's just us.

364
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,580
All the Lees are on their way
to Worcester. We're outnumbered.

365
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,580
Fuck!

366
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,580
Who else knew today was the day
you were moving on Kimber?

367
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,600
You said you kept it a secret.
Who else did you tell?

368
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,580
There's only one thing can blind
a man as smart as you, Tommy.

369
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,580
Love.

370
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
It was that barmaid.

371
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,580
I'll deal with Grace.

372
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
If you set eyes on her again,
you might kill her.

373
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,580
Going for good?

374
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,580
I heard there was trouble.

375
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Instinct's a funny thing.

376
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,580
See, normally I can tell about
a person. But with you...

377
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,580
Look, the fighting's about to begin.
We should get out of here.

378
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
We know who you are.

379
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,580
Tommy knows as well.

380
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,580
Turned out that copper as good
as told him this morning.

381
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
But I wanted to hear
it from your own lips.

382
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,580
I am an agent of the crown.

383
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,580
I have the power to arrest
and the right to use force.

384
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,580
So, please, step out of my way.

385
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,580
Like I say,
instinct's a funny thing.

386
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,580
You fell for Tommy for real,
didn't you?

387
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,580
This gun is loaded.

388
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,580
I'm not afraid of you.

389
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
I feel sorry for you.

390
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,580
Slip of a thing.

391
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,580
Thought you'd come in here
and stitch us all up.

392
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,580
I mean, we've had some copper's
narks in here, but you?

393
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
You're the queen of them all.

394
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
So, who are you?

395
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,580
Rich girl, I'd guess. Unionist.

396
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,580
Ulster Volunteer.

397
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,580
You thought Fenians,
communists, low people...

398
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,580
they're all the same.

399
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,580
Scum.

400
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Then you met Tommy.

401
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,580
I'll fight you with my fists
and show you how a rich girl fights.

402
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm from a tough family, too.

403
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Nah.

404
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
We women have more sense.

405
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Why don't you pour us both a drink?

406
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
So, am I right?

407
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Did you fall for Tommy?

408
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Yes. Then I pity you.

409
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,580
I think he'll try to kill me.

410
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,580
He's too soft. Soft?

411
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,580
Soft. Like you.

412
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,580
You saved his life
the night the coppers came.

413
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,580
That's why we're drinking,
not fighting.

414
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
We owe you.

415
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,600
What was he like...before France?

416
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
He laughed, a lot.

417
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
He wanted to work with horses.

418
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,580
He won medals.

419
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Threw them in the cut.

420
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Ah, not a single man
came back the same.

421
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
You know, after all this is over...

422
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,580
..he might forgive you.

423
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,580
He might take you in.

424
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,580
You can never tell with men.

425
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,580
They go for whoever
their dicks point at,

426
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,580
and there's no changing their minds.

427
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
But I should tell you something.

428
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
I will never forgive you.

429
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Or accept you.

430
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Or take you in.

431
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,580
And it's me who runs the business
of the heart in this family.

432
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,600
And as far as I'm concerned,
you're a snitch from the Parish.

433
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,580
And if you're not gone
from this city by tomorrow...

434
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I'll kill you myself.

435
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Now, go.

436
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,580
Maybe what really upsets you

437
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,600
is the thought that one day
you might lose him.

438
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,580
Tommy.

439
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,580
We've had word from Nipper
at Hay Mills,

440
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,580
and he says the police
are letting them through.

441
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,580
And how come all our police
have disappeared?

442
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,580
Because it was the police
who told Kimber about our plan.

443
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,580
And who told the police?

444
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,580
You know what, John?

445
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,580
For all I think I'm the smart one...

446
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
I'm guessing it was me.

447
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
All right, men...

448
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,580
..you were mostly in the war,

449
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,580
so you know that battle plans
always change and get fucked up.

450
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,580
Well, here it is.
Things have changed.

451
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,580
We fight them here. Today. Alone.

452
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,580
Now, they're going
to come for the pub.

453
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,580
They're going to try
to break us up for good.

454
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,600
And we'll have no help
from the law today.

455
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,580
That pub there is called
the Garrison.

456
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,580
Well, now it really is one.

457
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,580
And it belongs to us, right?

458
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,580
ALL: Right!

459
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,580
How many are there?

460
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,580
Jeremiah says two Riley vans.

461
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,580
So I reckon we're outnumbered
three to one.

462
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,580
Ah... Fuck.

463
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,580
But it's us, boys. It's us.
The Small Heath Rifles.

464
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,580
Never lost a fight yet, did we?
ALL: No!

465
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,580
All right. Jeremiah.

466
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,580
I know you vowed to God to never
pick up a weapon again.

467
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,580
But can you ask him from me
if you can help us today?

468
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,580
God says he don't deal
with Small Heath, sir.

469
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,580
Good man.

470
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,580
Arthur, Scudboat.
You take the flanks.

471
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,580
Just like at St Marie. Sir.

472
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Curly, if any Shelby man dies
here today, you bury us side by side.

473
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,600
All right. We've about ten minutes.
Make your peace with whoever.

474
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,580
We've had a report of a large
group of men in vehicles

475
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,580
heading towards the city.

476
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,580
Most of them
are known to the police, sir.

477
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,580
We think a gang fight's
about to break out.

478
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,580
I want all officers and constables
stood down in the following areas.

479
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,580
Bordesley, Small Heath,
Shard End, Greet...and Hay Mills.

480
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,580
Stood down, sir? Immediately.

481
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,580
And the vehicles approaching
the city should not be impeded.

482
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,580
What the hell is going on?

483
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Let dog eat dog.

484
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Let the beasts devour each other.

485
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
And then we shall pick the bones.

486
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
She's gone, then?

487
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,600
You're not accustomed to not getting
what you want, are you, Tommy?

488
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
You wanted my pub and you took it.

489
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
You got a fair price.

490
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
What I got was an ultimatum.

491
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,580
Like you give to everybody.

492
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Do it, or else.

493
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,580
And yet, it's funny.

494
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Everybody round here,
they want you to win this battle.

495
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,580
I think, what it is...

496
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
you're bad men,
but you're our bad men.

497
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Will you go looking for her?

498
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
She's in the past.

499
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
The past is not my concern.

500
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,580
The future is no longer
my concern, either.

501
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
What is your concern, Tommy?

502
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
The one minute.

503
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
The soldier's minute.

504
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
In a battle, that's all you get.

505
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
One minute of everything at once.

506
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
And anything before is nothing.

507
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,580
Everything after...

508
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
nothing.

509
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,580
Nothing in comparison...

510
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
to that one minute.

511
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Didn't you get enough
minutes over there?

512
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Seems not, doesn't it?

513
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,580
DOOR OPENS

514
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Tommy, they're here.

515
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Get your weapons out, boys,
and load 'em up.

516
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
Take your time.

517
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Hold 'em up in the air
so as they can see what we've got.

518
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,600
All guns and no balls, right,
Billy boy?

519
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,580
So, what do we do now?

520
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Just give the order.

521
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,600
The men that have arrived in
Garrison Lane are armed with rifles.

522
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,580
Did you hear me?

523
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,580
Their methods of self-destruction
are not my concern.

524
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,580
Well, we've also had report
of machine gun fire in Saltleigh.

525
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,580
The ravings of an old soldier
with shell shock.

526
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,580
We only found 24
of those 25 Lewis guns.

527
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
If they were to get
to use the one...

528
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,580
You know, when, er...

529
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,600
when you came here from Belfast
I was overjoyed.

530
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,580
I was sick of this force, and I was
sick of all the corruption.

531
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,580
When you made that speech
about cleaning this place up,

532
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
I gave a little cheer inside.

533
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,580
You said it was the devil's work
to look the other way.

534
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,580
I am not looking the other way,
Sergeant Moss.

535
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,580
I am looking directly
at the events of the day.

536
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
And I like what I see.

537
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,580
It doesn't have to be
like this, Kimber.

538
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,580
Too late for all that.

539
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,580
You've bit off more than you can
chew, you little toerag.

540
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
And now I'm going to take over
this shithole. Oh?

541
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,580
We have to use guns...

542
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
let's use proper guns.

543
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Sergeant Thorne
reporting for duty, sir.

544
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,600
You were saying
something about being out-gunned.

545
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
ADA: Move!

546
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,580
BABY CRIES

547
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,580
What are you doing?

548
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,580
I believe you boys call
this "no-man's land."

549
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,580
Ada... Shut up and listen.

550
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Have you lost your mind?
I said shut up!

551
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,580
Now, most of you were in France.

552
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,580
So you all know what happens next.

553
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,580
I've got brothers and a husband here

554
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,580
but you've all got somebody
waiting for you.

555
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Now, I'm wearing black
in preparation.

556
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
I want you to look at me.

557
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,580
I want you all to look at me.

558
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Who'll be wearing black for you?

559
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,580
Think about them.

560
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,580
Think about them right now.

561
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,600
And fight if you want to,
but that baby ain't moving anywhere.

562
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
And neither am I.

563
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,600
KIMBER: She's right, you know.

564
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,580
Why should all you men die?

565
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
It should just be them
who's caused it.

566
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,580
VOICES ECHO

567
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,580
Don't shoot!

568
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,580
You're all right, son.
You're all right.

569
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,580
Ada, move away.

570
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Don't shoot!

571
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
Hold your guns up!

572
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Enough.

573
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Kimber and me fought
this battle one on one.

574
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
It's over.

575
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Go home to your families.

576
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Scudboat, Curly...pick him up.

577
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
DOOR OPENS

578
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,600
I want to ask you one question.
Then I'll leave.

579
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Tommy knows who I am.
What did you say to him?

580
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
What did you say to him?

581
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
I told him...

582
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,600
..that his heart would be broken
before the day was over.

583
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
So, it seems...

584
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,600
..you've broken two hearts, Grace.

585
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
As well as my own.

586
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,580
That's it, Tommy, that's it.

587
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,580
Bite it, Tommy.

588
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,580
Take it. Take it!

589
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,580
Hold him still. That's it, lad.

590
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,580
Come on. Come on!

591
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
That's it.

592
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,600
There! I still have the knack.

593
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Have a drink.

594
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,580
Right, deep breath.

595
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,580
Augh!

596
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
That's it. It's done.

597
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,580
Now we can bury him properly

598
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,600
in the grave we dug for him.

599
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,580
Yeah.

600
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,600
It's high on a hill. He'll like that.

601
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,580
To Danny Whizz-Bang. Danny.

602
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,600
May we all die twice.

603
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
To Danny Whizz-Bang.

604
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Danny Whizz-Bang.

605
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,580
Come on.

606
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
The day is ours, let's celebrate.

607
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,580
Well?

608
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,600
Who won?

609
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:38,580
A Mr William Kimber has been found
dead with a gunshot wound.

610
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,580
So, I'm guessing that means
the Peaky Blinders won.

611
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
Sir.

612
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,580
Also, the communist agitator
Freddie Thorne

613
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,600
was taken from his transport
by armed men.

614
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,580
Since there were no police officers
on the street at the time...

615
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,580
following your orders...

616
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
he managed to escape easily
and is now at large.

617
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,580
The prison officers said they
recognised the men.

618
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,600
They were Peaky Blinders
as well, sir.

619
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,580
I mean, we could go down there
and make a few arrests

620
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,580
but, er, no-one will have
seen anything.

621
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,600
And there were no officers there
to witness, so...

622
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,580
..the Shelbys will get away
with murder.

623
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,600
Just like they always have.

624
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,580
Some things never change.

625
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,600
Eh, sir?

626
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,600
ROWDY CELEBRATION

627
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,580
Get us some of that!

628
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,580
Come here, son.

629
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,600
Wey! Keep it going!

630
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,580
A toast...

631
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,580
A toast, to Shelby Limited!

632
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,600
ALL: Shelby!

633
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,580
He's got sons.
Should we find work for them?

634
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,580
No. Let them be.

635
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Let them find ordinary work
like ordinary men.

636
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Could you put me through
to Mr Churchill, please?

637
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,580
Yes, sir.

638
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,580
Sir...

639
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,600
I have made a decision
about my future.

640
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
Everyone's leaving town.

641
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
Tommy, you're hurt. I'm fine.

642
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,580
What exactly can I say?

643
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,600
I don't know, Grace.

644
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,580
I could tell you who I really am.

645
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,600
I think I know who you are.

646
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,580
And you know who I am.

647
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
The circumstance is not important.

648
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,600
Circumstance? Is all it is.

649
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,580
Just uniform.

650
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
Yeah.

651
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
Someday I will throw
this gun in the canal.

652
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,600
Why not now?

653
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,600
Here it comes, Tommy.

654
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,600
I love you.

655
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,600
And there it goes, Grace.

656
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,600
Away it goes.

657
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,600
We can say it as much as we like...

658
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,600
..but there's no chance.

659
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,580
I'll be in London one week.
This address.

660
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,600
Finish your business here
and join me.

661
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,600
I have an idea.

662
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
DOOR OPENS

663
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,600
There he is... Tommy. Drink?

664
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,600
Not whisky.

665
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,580
If you check behind the bar...

666
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,600
you will find a bottle of champagne.

667
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,600
The one she bought.

668
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,600
Today was a good day.

669
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,580
All of Kimber's men were busy here,

670
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,600
so the Lee boys took all the pitches
at the Worcester races.

671
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,580
It couldn't have gone better
if we'd planned it.

672
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,580
Shelby Brothers Limited

673
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:27,580
are now the third largest legal race
track operation in the country.

674
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Cheers! Only the Sabinis and the
Solomons are bigger than us, boys.

675
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,600
And all my family is here
to celebrate.

676
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,580
To Shelby Brothers Limited.

677
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,580
Shelby! Brothers!

678
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,600
Cheers.

679
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
There'll be others.

680
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,600
To the others.

681
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,600
All of them.
