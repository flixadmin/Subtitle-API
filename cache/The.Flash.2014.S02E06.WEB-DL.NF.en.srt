1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,922
I'm here to kill you, Flash.
So, get ready to fry.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,174
(GROANS)

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:08,550
Bring it on.

4
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:09,759
Hmm. (CHUCKLES)

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,861
Told you.

6
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,866
Zoom always wins.

7
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,255
{\an8}Zoom sent me here to kill you.

8
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,424
{\an8}But I didn't want to.

9
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,427
{\an8}But you were fine with killing Linda Park.

10
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,680
{\an8}It was the best bad idea
I could come up with.

11
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,892
{\an8}Leave her body for Zoom to find.
He'd think I was dead and I'd be free.

12
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,188
{\an8}How was he supposed to know
where to find her body?

13
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:05,232
{\an8}Just let me go.

14
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,567
{\an8}Let me disappear.

15
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:11,071
{\an8}You would spend the rest of your life
looking over your shoulder,

16
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,780
{\an8}never knowing when Zoom is coming.

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,074
{\an8}Okay.

18
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,368
{\an8}Then what's your great idea?

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,412
{\an8}How were you supposed to contact him
after you killed me?

20
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,581
{\an8}I was supposed to get something.

21
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,083
{\an8}Something I could only get
if you were dead.

22
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,960
{\an8}And then throw it through
the breach as proof.

23
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,420
And then what?

24
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,590
Then he'd come for me.
Confirm the kill and bring me home.

25
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,550
-Why do you want to know?
-Because I want to find him.

26
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,760
You really don't.

27
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:35,262
He's gonna keep coming for me.

28
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:39,557
He's gonna keep kidnapping people like
you, forcing them to do what he wants.

29
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,935
I have to stop him before more people die.

30
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,604
You can't stop Zoom.

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,941
Yes I can. I will. But I need your help.

32
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,782
Zoom wants Doctor Light to send him
your new emblem?

33
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,575
Yes. We need it for bait.

34
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,913
{\an8}If we can get Doctor Light to take
my emblem, throw it through the breach,

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,957
{\an8}then Zoom will come to collect my body
and we can trap him.

36
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,959
{\an8}You know it took a lot of work
to make that emblem, right?

37
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,421
{\an8}This is the woman
who was willing to kill Linda

38
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,840
{\an8}in order to escape Zoom, but now
she's willing to help us catch him?

39
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,301
{\an8}She knows it's the only way.

40
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:19,639
{\an8}Before I left Earth Two, I worked on a
serum to dampen Zoom's speed.

41
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,017
{\an8}All we would need is for Ramon
to develop a weapon to deliver it.

42
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,520
{\an8}Oh, great, that could be
this year's cold gun.

43
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,481
{\an8}Maybe another criminal can get it
and then we'd have Sergeant Slow.

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,651
I would never let that happen.
Sergeant Slow is a terrible name.

45
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,988
Are we forgetting how much more powerful
than Barry Zoom seems to be?

46
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,865
I mean, if Barry can catch bullets,

47
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:40,327
{\an8}what's to say Zoom can't catch
whatever you shoot at him?

48
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,705
{\an8}Surprise, the element of surprise.

49
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,667
{\an8}All we would do is rig a projectile to
fire as Zoom crosses into the breach.

50
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,669
He can't stop what he can't see coming.

51
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,128
-That's great.
-Thanks.

52
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,839
(SIGHS) Joe, voice of reason here?

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,844
We need a plan, that's as good as any.
As long as he can deliver.

54
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,387
{\an8}Don't underestimate me, Detective.

55
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,555
{\an8}-(PHONE VIBRATING)
-Oh.

56
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,684
{\an8}Patty needs us back at the station.
I'll meet you there, all right?

57
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,694
{\an8}Are you just forgetting everything Jay
told us and supporting Wells now?

58
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,363
{\an8}Oh, no, I don't trust Wells at all.

59
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,864
{\an8}I just want to see what he's up to.

60
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,907
{\an8}I figure, we give him some rope,
he'll hang himself.

61
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:22,159
{\an8}Yeah, I'm totally with you.
I think he's hiding something.

62
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,414
{\an8}Look, my hunch after interrogating
suspects all these years,

63
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,541
{\an8}something's not right with this dude.

64
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,379
{\an8}Barry told me about this thing you can do?

65
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,671
{\an8}-Oh, God.
-Vibing.

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,922
{\an8}Just relax.

67
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,424
{\an8}Can you do it with Wells?

68
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,676
{\an8}I can try.

69
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,896
HARRISON: <i>Incapable?
Well, let me tell you something.</i>

70
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,733
If you're
incapable of aligning the quantum helix,

71
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:57,404
and by the way, the sole purpose
of your employment here at S.T.A.R. Labs,

72
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,738
could you save me some time and effort,

73
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:02,909
could you go out there and find someone
who can actually do your job for you?

74
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,120
There it is.

75
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,873
Work voice.

76
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,420
When I was little, and you used
to bring me to S.T.A.R. Labs with you,

77
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,754
it used to freak me out,

78
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,798
how differently you talked here
than when you're at home.

79
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,926
You and your mother, both.
Shouldn't you be at school?

80
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,719
I graduated high school
when I was 15, Dad.

81
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,095
-(CHUCKLES)
-Right.

82
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,389
I can miss a day of college.

83
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,600
Ah, that's my Jesse, always so quick.

84
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,270
So?

85
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,979
So.

86
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,315
Is it true? (SIGHS)

87
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,442
Is what true?

88
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,777
What The Flash said about you
at the press conference,

89
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,113
that your particle accelerator
created the meta-humans?

90
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:45,952
-It is... (SIGHS) Jesse...
-Look, why didn't you just tell me?

91
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,290
Jay Garrick, it turns out,

92
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:56,087
is much faster at assigning blame
than he is at actual heroics.

93
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,214
-Dad, The Flash is a hero.
-Uh-huh.

94
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,633
Hey, I've never understood
why you disliked him so much.

95
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,845
But now I know it's because he knew
what you'd done.

96
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,307
What I've done at S.T.A.R. Labs
is change the world, Jesse.

97
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,477
Unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

98
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,895
And when you don't have
the key to the lock,

99
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,773
sometimes you have to kick in the door.

100
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,319
You should get to school.

101
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,573
Don't worry. I got my education today.

102
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,999
You're my joy, Jesse Quick.

103
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,216
JOE: All right. Talk to you later.
WOMAN: See you, Joe.

104
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,968
Great, you're here.

105
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:45,302
Good morning to you too, Patty.

106
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,514
Yes, I was up all night
working on the Doctor Light case.

107
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,349
I've been trying to anticipate
all the powers she might throw our way,

108
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,977
you know, on the premise
that she can manipulate light energy.

109
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:54,479
-I appreciate it, but...
-Did you know

110
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,856
that light energy
can be turned into hard light?

111
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,525
I mean, that doesn't even
sound like a thing, but it is.

112
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,692
-Seriously, Patty...
-No,

113
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,819
and on the other end of the spectrum
is invisibility.

114
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,821
Look, it's just hypothetical
but I think that...

115
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,533
The Doctor Light case is closed.

116
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,035
Oh. Uh...

117
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,913
Okay, can you tell me why?

118
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,081
No.

119
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,209
No?

120
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,087
-Okay.
-Hey.

121
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,839
-Hi.
-Are you good?

122
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,217
Yeah. I'm fine, your dad just shut me down
in a big way.

123
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,053
-What do you mean?
-(STUTTERS)

124
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:32,684
I don't know, it just... You don't think
it's because you and I kissed?

125
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,603
No, I don't think he knows.
I didn't say anything.

126
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,564
But I can talk to him if you want.

127
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,065
No, no, no.
(STUTTERS) I'll talk to him.

128
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,026
You know, he's my partner,
we should have trust and communication.

129
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:43,903
Are you sure?
I don't mind talking about that kiss.

130
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,112
It was a good kiss.

131
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:50,785
Yeah, yeah. Although, the memory,
it's a little foggy.

132
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,870
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

133
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,623
I might need, like, a reminder soon.

134
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,750
Okay.

135
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,471
-Hey.
-Hey.

136
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:13,641
Have you had any word from The Flash
about the meta-human that killed Larkin?

137
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,437
No. Not yet.
But I know he's working on it.

138
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,939
You know, maybe I could talk to him.

139
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,775
Linda, I don't think that's a good idea.

140
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,612
Look, Larkin is dead,
which makes it really hard for me

141
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,448
to concentrate
on field goals and doping scandals.

142
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,576
I don't want to sit around being told not
to worry my pretty little head about it.

143
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,621
I get that. Believe me, I do.

144
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,998
Then tell him I want to help. Please.

145
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:39,959
I can't let this woman who looks like me
hurt anyone else.

146
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:45,590
I'll ask again. But trust me,
Flash has everything under control.

147
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,767
Crap.

148
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,653
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

149
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,123
Doctor Light's gone invisible!

150
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,374
<i>Lock the doors!</i>

151
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,168
<i>Shut the doors!</i>

152
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,049
The door is not responding. None of
the security protocols are responding.

153
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,842
She's hacked the system.

154
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,553
Barry, Doctor Light is escaping!

155
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:38,560
Where is she?

156
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,194
Doctor Light managed to hack
into the lights of her cell.

157
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,739
The whole building runs on fiber optics
that operate on pulses of light.

158
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,491
So, she turned off the dampeners
and used her powers.

159
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,743
I told you how dangerous she was.

160
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,244
You should've listened to me
and sedated her.

161
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,538
I thought I had convinced her

162
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,873
that helping us was the only way
she'd free herself from Zoom.

163
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,166
-Well, you thought wrong.
-Yeah.

164
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:03,626
Okay, look. Doctor Light is gone.

165
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,796
So, instead of assigning blame, let's try
to figure out what we're going to do next.

166
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,590
Do you think she's going to try
and take Linda again?

167
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,843
I had Iris bring Linda to the house,
just in case, to keep an eye on her.

168
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,678
How are we doing with the speed-dampener?

169
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,179
I think we isolated the composite.

170
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,557
And we're modifying the dart
the Arrow used to take down Wells.

171
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,602
He's not Wells, I'm Wells.

172
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,894
Whatever, Harry.

173
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,563
But we don't even really know
if this thing works.

174
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,356
HARRISON: Until we try it, no.
This will be a field test.

175
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:28,067
So, can we end this scintillating
staff meeting and get back to work?

176
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,526
Or how 'bout I say
what everybody's thinking.

177
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,445
Maybe it's a good thing
that Doctor Light is gone.

178
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,406
Maybe it's the universe stopping us
from doing something really stupid.

179
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:38,953
No. No. Keep going. I'm gonna figure out
another way to get Zoom.

180
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,457
Hey, slow your roll. I wanna talk to you.

181
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,418
Joe, look, I know what I'm doing.

182
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,254
Okay, I don't.
So why don't you clue me in?

183
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,007
I'm trying to stop Zoom.
I thought you were on board with that.

184
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,424
I'm keeping my options open.

185
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,261
I don't understand
why you think we have a choice.

186
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,929
Zoom wants me dead.

187
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,598
The meta-humans
that he's sending from Earth Two,

188
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,432
they don't care
how many innocent people get in the way.

189
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,602
Look at what happened
to Iris and Linda's boss.

190
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,896
He was just collateral damage
in Zoom's war.

191
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,981
The next time, that could be you, or Iris.

192
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,942
I'm just wondering
if going after him now is premature.

193
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,819
I mean, we barely know anything
about his abilities.

194
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,112
Wells does.

195
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,446
You're putting a whole lot of faith
in the man

196
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,323
wearing the face of your mother's killer.

197
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,535
I think we should find Jay,
get him to help us on this.

198
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,246
Nah, Jay made it pretty clear
that he doesn't wanna help get me killed.

199
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:25,457
And we can't just sit around and wait
for Zoom to make his next move anymore.

200
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,126
We can't.

201
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,629
Aren't you the one who told me
life isn't about playing defense?

202
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,048
Sometimes the only way to succeed
is by working the offense?

203
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,967
I think at the time we were talking about
your high school football tryouts.

204
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,385
You said you'd never bring that up again.

205
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,311
Hey.

206
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,399
I just wanted to say,
using the, uh, tungsten composite

207
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:54,570
to dampen vibrations, that was...
It's pretty brilliant.

208
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,909
What are you doing?

209
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,578
I'm congratulating you.

210
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,997
Don't touch me.

211
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,623
Wow! Try to give a guy a compliment...

212
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,834
You're not trying to give me a compliment.

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,086
You're trying to meddle into things
that are none of your business.

214
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,628
-What did you vibe about me?
-Nothing.

215
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,547
-What did you vibe about me?
-Nothing.

216
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,925
God. Why? What's there to vibe on?

217
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:22,348
Don't touch me.
If you have questions, ask them.

218
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,308
Otherwise, stay away from me.

219
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,193
So?

220
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:35,527
God.

221
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,823
You'd think the serial killer version
would've been the bigger jerk.

222
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,200
Uh, what happened when you touched him?
What did you see?

223
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,326
Oh, I didn't see anything.

224
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,535
Well, go touch him again.

225
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,537
(STUTTERS) No. He's onto me now.

226
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:50,126
Well, you'll have to keep trying.
I mean, I think Joe's right.

227
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,713
Something must have happened between
Wells and Zoom that made this personal.

228
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,391
MALE NEWSCASTER: <i>The hero of
Starling City, formerly known as The Hood,</i>

229
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:08,394

232
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,735

<i>The science building is the focus

<i>We're being told that the footage

238
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,087
Hey, Jesse, it's Dad. Can you...

239
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,589
I... I just... I saw on the news...

240
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,093
Just call me, all right? Let me know
that you're okay, that you weren't...

241

242

245
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,607
(SIGHS) No. No.

246
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,250
(SIGHS)

247
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,390
Joe, Detective, can we talk for a minute?

248
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,766
If this is about Doctor Light...

249
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,229
No. Yeah. No. Uh, maybe.

250
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,147
But, okay, look, I think I figured out

251
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,275
why you've been a bit shut down
the last couple of days.

252
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,111
-Really?
-Yeah,

253
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,154
I feel like you're not being
completely transparent with me,

254
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,573
but I think that it's my fault.

255
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,327
Look, you're a great, excellent,
wonderful detective,

256
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,413
and I think you could sense I'm not being
completely transparent with you.

257
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,499
And you're right. Look, we're partners.

258
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,418
We need to be completely honest
with each other, no secrets.

259
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,295
-Patty?
-Barry and I kissed.

260
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,635
There's something
to being too transparent.

261
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,305
No. No, no, no, I think that it's great.

262
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,682
Everything is just out there,
right out in the open.

263
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,852
Whatever you and Barry do in private
is your own business.

264
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,773
Okay.

265
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,527
So, you're not mad at me?

266
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,113
I promise you, I could care less.

267
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,322
(SIGHS)

268
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,949
Great.

269
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,825
I feel so much better.

270
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,833
Is there anything, you know,
maybe you've been meaning to tell me?

271
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,379
We're partners,
totally transparent with each other.

272
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,756
Uh...

273
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,968
Nope.

274
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,722
Cool.

275
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,774
-Hey.
-Hey.

276
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,651
Are you guys having a dinner party?

277
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,819
You would think.

278
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,446
I know, I know.

279
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,490
It's just,
sometimes cooking helps me to relax.

280
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,575
Oh.

281
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,035
Have you heard anything
about Doctor Light?

282
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,244
Am I still in danger?

283
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,870
Um, we're not really sure.

284
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,957
Come on, I'm going crazy here, Barry.

285
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,083
Yeah, she is.

286
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,377
-(OVEN DINGS)
-That is the cake. Hope you're hungry.

287
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,632
She's not kidding. There's enough food
in there to feed an army.

288
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,259
(SIGHS) She must be terrified.

289
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,097
Uh, more like furious.
Larkin died trying to protect her.

290
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,724
And it only makes it worse if the person
who did it looks just like her.

291
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,518
I mean, trust me, if Linda had
Doctor Light's powers right now...

292
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,773
What?

293
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,986
I just... Linda and Light,
they're identical,

294
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,321
so identical that Light even thought
she could fool Zoom.

295
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,116
And now we have Light's suit.

296
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,619
You don't have to say anything,
I know, it's a terrible idea.

297
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:54,911
No, no, no, it's not.

298
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,415
We make Zoom think
that Linda is Doctor Light

299
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,376
and use her to draw him out.

300
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,086
It's too dangerous, right?

301
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:03,920
Let Linda decide.

302
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,881
I mean, she's desperate
to catch the person

303
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,633
who's responsible for Larkin's death.

304

00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,980
I thought your dad said
not to leave the house.

308
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,689
Someone wants to talk to you.

309
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,857
Who?

310
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,445
Ms. Park. I need your help.

311
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,990
Whoa!

312
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:42,793

How long you been sitting on this?

313

This is ridiculous.

318

No, it's not.
You look just like Doctor Light.

319
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,517
And with these gloves
that Cisco rigged up,

320
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,352
you'll be able to do what she does.

321
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,604
Don't worry, they are totally safe.

322
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,273
-Ish.
-Ish?

323
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:09,028
Oh, come on, it's gotta be believable,
so they really do fire and explode things.

324
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,197
And you are gonna have to
let her hit you with those blasts,

325
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,698
once she gets the hang of it.

326
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:16,285
Who exactly came up
with this terrible idea?

327
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,620
CISCO: Okay, it's not a terrible idea.

328
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,456
The suit can absorb the blasts.

For real or "ish?"

00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,044
What does a terrible idea
look like to you, Cisco?

331
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,337
Okay, you know what?

332
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,049
I like to think
I can see the bright side of things, okay?

00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,717
Positivity, people.

334
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:38,640
All right, all right.
So, just hit the ones of me, okay?

-Got it.
-Great.

Okay. No offense to Linda
but there is no way she can pull this off.

Well, maybe if she didn't scream
every time she fired.

Yep! Linda had a rocky start,
but she can pull this off. I know she can.

All right, did you find someplace
near a breach

where we don't have to worry
about civilians getting in the way?

Yeah, there's a place by the docks
that's usually deserted at night.

Awesome. How are we doing
with the speed dampener?

00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,086
My tests indicate that it should work.

364
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,298
It will work. I'll tune up Ramon's gloves,
make sure they work better.

00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,549
Okay, great.

Hey, we're actually gonna go through
with this?

367
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,762
Yeah, we're doing this.
I'm gonna have Iris get Linda ready.

368
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,477
Yeah, I'll go talk to him.

Wait, why do you think? I want to get him.

375
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,701
Get who exactly?

376
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,495
Is that a real question?

You tell me.
I'm not sure this is even about Zoom.

you're still chasing the Reverse Flash.

Reverse Flash is dead.

380
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,881
Yeah, but after all he did to you,
you weren't the one that stopped him.

We all worked together.

382

Yeah, and Eddie got him in the end.

I mean, that doesn't
make you feel cheated,

like you didn't get your revenge,

and stopping Zoom is the next best thing?

386
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,231
Look, all I'm saying is, if you're gonna
ask people like Linda to risk their lives,

387
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,858
you better be sure
of exactly why they're doing it.

about this not being just about Zoom,

about it being about the Reverse Flash.

-Okay.
-But not for the reason that you think.

Not because I didn't beat him.

It's... Wells,

495
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:14,609
he said something to me on that video
before he confessed to my mom's murder.

496
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,446
He said that even if he was dead,

497
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:22,658
that he still won because I wasn't happy.

498
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,660
That I'd never really be happy.

499
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,454
How the hell would he know?

500
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:28,664
He knew me. He knows future me.

501

That's future you.
This is the you here and now.

I still think that Wells was right.

503
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,382
Ever since I went back to that night
and I didn't save her,

504
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:41,887
I didn't save my mom, I just...
There's just been this void in me.

You know, I just feel like
that is always gonna be there.

506
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:50,854
For better or worse. Wells, he knew me.

507
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,023
Better than I know you?

508
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,234
He may have stalked you for 15 years,
but I raised you.

509
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,738
Look, Wells said what he said to you,
to mess with you.

510

To get in your head one last time.

00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,492
Look at your hero.

623
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,161
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

624
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:10,210
This man is no god.

625
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,920
He is nothing.

626
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,674
(GASPING)

627
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,517
The days of The Flash protecting this city
are over.

628
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:28,394
-Hold your fire!
-Put him down!

629
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:33,023
Now, what will you do
without your precious hero?

630
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,025
Shoot that thing, now!

631
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,377
Nice try.

632
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,306
-Anything?
-No.

633
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,724
-Do you have him?
-No.

634
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,110
Barry.

635
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,737
ZOOM: Harrison Wells.

636
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:25,660
You thought you could defeat me with this?

637
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,415
I made a mistake.

638
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,752
Yes, a costly one.

639
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,588
(GROANS)

640
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:45,346
Good-bye, Flash.
You too weren't fast enough.

641
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,390
(GRUNTS)

642
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,099
(YELLS)

643
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,613
No. No!

644
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:08,118
Stay with me. Stay with me, Barry.
Stay with me. Please, Barry. Please.

645
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,959
This is all you. If Barry dies, you die!

646
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,211
Joe! Barry's vitals have stabilized.
Let's let him go.

647
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,463
No, Caitlin.

648
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,548
Why? What good does that do for Barry?

649
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,841
It's gonna help me.

650
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:24,134
Joe, stop!

651
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,428
Who's Jesse?

652
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,306
How do...

653
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,393
Jesse's my daughter
and Zoom has her. You've...

654
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,853
-You did vibe me.
-Yes.

655
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:35,145
What did you see?

656
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,399
I saw your daughter. She was with Zoom.

657
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,818
But she's alive?

658
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,488
Yeah.

659
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,115
(SIGHS)

660
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,825
Zoom sent you here like the others?

661
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,495
You kill The Flash
and you get your daughter back?

662
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,664
The only way I get my daughter back
is I capture Zoom.

663
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,584
Do you understand? You love Barry.

664
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,086
I love my daughter.

665
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,590
And none of these children are safe
as long as Zoom is here.

666
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,676
I tried on my Earth to capture him.

667
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,011
I failed.

668
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,430
I thought I could bring him down here

669
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,516
with Barry's help.

670
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,686
I was wrong.

671
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,950
Hey. I think he's waking up.

672
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,037
CAITLIN: Barry.

673
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,374
Barry? Can you hear me?

674
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,044
Hey.

675
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,962
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

676
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,258
You scared the crap out of us.
You were gone for a long time.

677
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,218
How bad is it?

678
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,388
Bad.

679
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,391
If you didn't heal so quickly,
I'd be very worried.

680
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,560
Linda. How is she?

681
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,396
She's fine. She's staying out
with some friends out in Coast City.

682
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,981
Zoom?

683
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:04,485
Let's... Let's worry about Zoom
when you're up and about.

684
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,945
Okay?

685
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,448
Oh, no. You're staying put.

686
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,242
Yeah, seriously. You got your ass kicked.

687
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,328
No, guys.

688
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,038
I can't feel my legs.

689
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,835
I can't feel my legs.
