1
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,840
<i>Every month the complaints
against you are increasing.</i>

2
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,120
<i>Misdemeanor,</i>

3
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>insubordination,</i>

4
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,960
<i>no-show!</i>

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
<i>Sometimes, you just
don't bother reporting!</i>

6
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,920
And even now, you're drunk!

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,560
There's no point in warning you anymore.

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,200
The committee has decided that
you're gonna retire voluntarily.

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,640
You think I'm gonna do...

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,840
what the committee decides?

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,440
You'll be expelled if you don't!

12
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,400
Expelled!

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,520
That will be the perfect
end to my police career.

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,960
I WANT TO MEET YOU
RIGHT NOW.

15
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,360
NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

16
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,320
CAN THERE EVER BE A GOOD TIME
FOR US TO MEET?

17
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,920
Fernandez.

18
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,680
Let him in.

19
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,560
Stop.

20
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,520
Don't worry. She won't molest you.

21
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,680
-Come on.
-Flask.

22
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,840
Aw! You really miss her!

23
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
What are you saying, Yasmin?

24
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
-Done?
-Done!

25
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,840
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

26
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,280
You'll get it tomorrow.

27
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,360
-The stuff...
-Tipu!

28
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,800
Only call me, alright?
Just me.

29
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,280
Tipu.

30
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,000
You don't need to do that anymore.

31
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,760
I've been expelled.

32
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,560
I don't feel sorry for you.

33
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,800
Me neither.

34
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,720
Actually...

35
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
I'm feeling free.

36
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,040
Rules,

37
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,200
orders,

38
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,720
protocols...

39
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
They're all part of a technique...

40
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,240
to shackle police officers.

41
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,200
Being a criminal is better.

42
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,080
Right?

43
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,080
What are you waiting for?

44
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,320
Enjoy!

45
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,360
Why did you wanna meet?

46
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,960
I've quit drinking.

47
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Cheers!

48
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,720
7th September!

49
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,240
The famous night!

50
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,640
The police cracked down on Nayak!

51
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,280
What an eventful night!

52
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,360
But what exactly
happened that night, Bhumi?

53
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,400
My statement is on the record.

54
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,280
You had ordered an inquiry against me.

55
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, the inquiry's over.

56
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,680
The case is over.

57
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,680
And today...

58
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,640
ACP Jason Fernandez is over!

59
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,640
So, even if I find out anything...

60
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,080
what am I gonna do, Bhumika Pardesi?

61
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,360
Anyway...

62
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,520
what could the police do...

63
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,880
to stop you for the past five years?

64
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,720
Come on.

65
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,520
Tell me the truth.

66
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Let it be, sir.

67
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,920
Forget about it.

68
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,240
I really do try...

69
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
to forget about it.

70
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,680
But...

71
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
I'm stuck!

72
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,840
I think about it every day.

73
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,040
What could've happened that night?

74
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,440
What did Bhumi do?

75
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,160
My Bhumi!

76
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,760
My discovery!

77
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,360
My pride!

78
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,920
My bloody doom!

79
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,440
Was I right... about you?

80
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
I really want to know.

81
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,040
For...

82
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,600
For my mental peace.

83
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,000
Please!

84
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
You want to know.

85
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,480
But why should I tell you?

86
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
Who else could you talk to?

87
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,960
Who else can you share it with, Bhumi?

88
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,720
Sir!

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,160
Come. Sit, Bhumi.

90
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,680
Our intelligence team has found
many login IDs through the darknet.

91
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,440
Some of those definitely belong to
the members of the Nayak syndicate.

92
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,320
We need to find out
exactly which of those IDs are.

93
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,400
This will be your final
task for this operation.

94
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,840
You'll have to go back there, Bhumi.

95
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,320
And verify this information somehow.

96
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,560
But you've only got five days.

97
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,000
Can you do it?

98
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,200
Let's consider, hypothetically,

99
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,200
that Nayak's not a syndicate.

100
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,960
It's just one man.

101
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,800
Hypothetically?

102
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,080
Yeah.

103
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,520
When I come to see you...

104
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,880
I don't like it anymore.

105
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,120
Because as soon as I meet you,

106
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,480
a timer for my return
starts ticking in my head.

107
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,200
Tick!

108
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,040
Tick!

109
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Tick!

110
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
<i>Nayak...</i>

111
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,080
<i>he was smarter...</i>

112
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,800
<i>shrewder, and more dangerous...</i>

113
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,960
<i>than any man...</i>

114
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,760
<i>any of us would've ever seen.</i>

115
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,080
<i>Conning him...</i>

116
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,840
<i>it would only be possible in a dream.</i>

117
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
Can't I stay with you longer?

118
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,360
You need to note the exact login time.

119
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,520
You don't talk to me like you used to.

120
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,040
About Rupa,

121
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,440
about your mom.

122
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,920
I'm not the same girl anymore.

123
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,200
Run it through all the programs we've
got and make a backup of it, okay?

124
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,960
Sir, most probably, there are six
top-level members in the syndicate.

125
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,120
And the darknet activity suggests
that they all have equal powers.

126
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,240
<i>The extent is massive, sir!</i>

127
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,280
<i>Too many locations, routes,
vehicles, all across the country.</i>

128
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,200
<i>It's way bigger than what we had expected.</i>

129
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,000
<i>I'll make the calls, Alam.</i>

130
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,920
All the task force you need...

131
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,400
-I will make sure you get it.
<i>-Sir.</i>

132
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,120
Station the teams and be ready.

133
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,680
We'll strike all the locations at once.

134
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
7th September.

135
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,520
You have two days.

136
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,560
Gorai!

137
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,280
These jetty areas, immediately.
Mostly in North Bombay.

138
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,160
We've decoded new information, Bhumi.

139
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,280
And it seems to be completely
unrelated to any other activity.

140
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,160
One of the syndicate's IDs has
marked five jetty areas for 7th September.

141
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,040
Manori, Gorai, Uttan,
they're all in Northern Mumbai.

142
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,760
But we've no clue what's
gonna happen here.

143
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,520
Do you know?

144
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
<i>My job here will be done in two weeks.</i>

145
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,200
I might go away for a few days.

146
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,600
I could've told you then,
what I'm about to tell you right now.

147
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,760
I wanted to tell you.

148
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,600
I don't know, sir.

149
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,880
But you didn't.

150
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,080
And Nayak...

151
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,840
who we're assuming, hypothetically,

152
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,080
was one single man,

153
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,280
had planned some activity
at those five jetty areas.

154
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Maybe...

155
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,840
he planned on getting out of Mumbai
on the last night of the operation.

156
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,800
But you were found there.

157
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
What was your plan?

158
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm just a Constable, sir.

159
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
I don't have "plans".

160
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,360
I do shit...

161
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,880
and then think about what I've done.

162
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,320
None of it would've happened
if I had planned it.

163
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,800
What wouldn't have happened?

164
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,000
Everything!

165
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,200
Nayak letting me off the hook
even after finding out I was a cop.

166
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,600
He chopped Sasya up,
right in front of me...

167
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,720
but let me go.

168
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,920
How could I have planned that?

169
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,960
That I would end the
biggest drug operation ever?

170
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,400
Me?

171
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,160
And get away with it?

172
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,800
Get away unscathed?

173
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,080
That the danger...

174
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,240
would just magically disappear,

175
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,840
and I would get...

176
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,360
way more than I could even dream of?

177
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
BHUMI - WHEN ARE WE MEETING?

178
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,200
UNKOWN - BEFORE I LEAVE.

179
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,960
<i>-Do you want the leg piece?
-No, I'm not hungry.</i>

180
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
Come on, for me! Please!

181
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,400
Chinese.

182
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,280
Thank you.

183
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,360
Don't thank me.

184
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm just thanking you for paying the
hospital bills and getting Chinese food.

185
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,400
You haven't really done anything
else that's worth thanking you.

186
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,440
Schezwan fried rice.

187
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,840
-Why?
-Keep it.

188
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,240
I'll look after her...

189
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
and you.

190
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,520
But I want you to look
after your girlfriend as well.

191
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,440
TOMORROW 9:00 P.M.

192
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,880
<i>-Move now.</i>
-Ok, sir. Let's go.

193
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,720
<i>Everyone stay on your comms.</i>

194
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,080
<i>No zone should be left out.</i>

195
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,840
<i>Every area should be covered.</i>

196
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,200
<i>Follow that truck to the
delivery location.</i>

197
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,120
There.

198
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,840
<i>Send a team to the coast.
Talk to the locals there.</i>

199
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,280
<i>Check the tracking devices and
attach them to the boats.</i>

200
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,480
Sir!

201
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,120
<i>Do we have Nayak's complete plan?</i>

202
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,120
Some pieces of the
puzzle are missing, sir.

203
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,680
But we have enough to
end the Nayak syndicate.

204
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,360
You know about my health, right?

205
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,000
I went to the doctor for common cold
and he wants to conduct multiple tests!

206
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,160
It's so silly...
Yes, thank you.

207
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,600
Eat.

208
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,200
-How's Meena?
-Hey, try this!

209
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,640
-She's a good cook.
-Mom!

210
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,680
There's a locker in the new apartment.

211
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,320
There's some cash and
some bank account details in it.

212
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,080
It's all in there, alright?

213
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,920
Why are you telling me all this?

214
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,920
Mom, you should know about it.

215
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,120
You never know when you might need it.

216
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,720
-Be careful with it.
-Is this one ready?

217
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,440
Sir, as per the ongoing landing patterns,

218
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,280
the expected delivery time
for the last batch is 9:00 p.m.

219
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,520
So, we strike at 9:00 p.m.?

220
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,840
In two hours, sir.

221
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,200
-Fernandez.
-Sir!

222
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,400
-You're commanding the ground units?
-Yes, sir.

223
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,480
Keep us updated and all the best.

224
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:51,760
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

225
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,840
-Come, Alam.
-Sir.

226
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
All ground units, alert!

227
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,400
We strike at 9:00 p.m.

228
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,720
I repeat,

229
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,040
we strike at 9:00 p.m.

230
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,080
-Nambiar?
-Sir.

231
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,480
What about those five jetty areas?

232
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,040
-No update?
-No, sir.

233
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,920
-Leena...
-Sir?

234
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,680
I want you to constantly
keep an eye on Bhumi.

235
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,200
I've asked the cybercrime
unit to track her cell phone.

236
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,680
Only you will be getting the signal.

237
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,760
Sir, is she supposed to go somewhere?

238
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,640
Her role in this operation is over.

239
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,840
But I have a feeling
something could happen, so...

240
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,480
keep your eyes on her.

241
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,760
Sir, Bhumi just got into
a cab outside her hotel.

242
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,320
Where is Bhumi?

243
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,080
Sir, she's just left Malad station.

244
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,960
That's where those
five jetty areas are, right?

245
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,240
Yes, sir.

246
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,640
Call Khan and his team.
Ask them to get there immediately.

247
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,520
Position them at a place that gives
them easy access to all five jetty areas.

248
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,480
She's come to Uttan-Gorai.

249
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,120
Why's the whore taking a
dip in the ocean this late?

250
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,120
Sir!

251
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,200
Sir!

252
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,360
We lost her.

253
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,680
Her phone's been switched off.

254
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,480
And then you disappeared.

255
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,480
So, you were tracking my phone?

256
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,040
I didn't trust you completely.

257
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,760
Or maybe I was trying to protect you.

258
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,480
I don't know.

259
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,440
Confused.

260
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,440
Okay, call Khan.

261
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,240
Ask him to get to Bhumi's
last known location quickly.

262
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,120
She has no business being there, Leena.

263
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,720
Copy, sir.

264
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,760
Sir...

265
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,880
five minutes to engage.

266
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,040
Hey, wait, wait.

267
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
Why are they checking her?

268
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,080
They're taking her somewhere.

269
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,800
Come on, come on.

270
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,760
<i>Stand by. Wait for my command.</i>

271
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,160
All units engage!

272
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,440
<i>Strike now!</i>

273
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
Go! Go! Go, guys! Go!

274
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,400
Barge in! Barge in!
Team A, barge in!

275
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,800
<i>Leena, mark the locations
that we've struck on the screen.</i>

276
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,960
<i>Copy, sir.</i>

277
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,920
Okay, seal all the entry
points at all the locations.

278
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,240
Copy, sir. Get them in a group.

279
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,000
Go wait on the boat.

280
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,120
These two are leaving.
Where's the whore?

281
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,120
Bhumi!

282
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,360
Yeah?

283
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,440
Why am I ruining you?

284
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,920
Ruining me?

285
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
How?

286
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,120
I'm turning you into Nayak.

287
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,280
But I don't want to be Nayak either.

288
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,480
The darkness...

289
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,280
the loneliness...

290
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,720
I was stuck being this Nayak.

291
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,880
But then I met you.

292
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,600
What you and I have...

293
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,240
it's powerful.

294
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,360
If it can change you...

295
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,600
why can't it change me?

296
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,760
I don't get it.

297
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,240
Finishing Rupa off...

298
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,760
just because I had
finished off Chinnanna...

299
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,520
Cancel it.

300
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,320
Forget about it.

301
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,200
Please be Bhumi...

302
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,400
because I like Bhumi.

303
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
Not Nayak.

304
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,400
Please change me.

305
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,640
Come with me, Bhumi.

306
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,720
Right now.

307
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,640
Don't worry about anything.

308
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,680
I'll look after you.

309
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,560
The world's out there, Bhumi!

310
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,880
I would love to see it with you.

311
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,200
And there would be
no timer ticking in your head!

312
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,800
Tick! Tick! Tick!

313
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,080
You could stay forever.

314
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,400
We'll do everything
the way you wanna do it.

315
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,320
Come.

316
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,680
No one's ever been so nice to me.

317
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,160
I've betrayed you, Nayak.

318
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,560
I gave all the information to the police.

319
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,520
They're attacking your
whole network right now.

320
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,120
You'll learn about it soon.

321
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,240
Liar.

322
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,400
I need something sharp.

323
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,760
I'll have to slit her throat.

324
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,000
Will have to kill her
by slashing her throat.

325
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,600
It's always like this.

326
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
Calm down, Nayak.

327
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,760
I'm not going anywhere.

328
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,920
I'm right here.

329
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,720
Alright!

330
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,840
Stay there!

331
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,320
Shooting you would be a
waste of this opportunity!

332
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,800
I've never lost like this!

333
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,400
I'm furious!

334
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,480
Yes.

335
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
I'll carry this fury...

336
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,440
as long as you live!

337
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,720
This rage will drag me back to this city!

338
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,120
You must live...

339
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,200
to fuel my fury!

340
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,720
And this rage will help me get
back everything that I've lost today!

341
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,520
And that is when I'll kill you...

342
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,360
by slitting your throat!

343
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,800
One swift clean stroke.

344
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,800
That's the way to do it!

345
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,960
Full blood drain-out!

346
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,400
I refuse to be killed.

347
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,960
I'm gonna live!

348
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,960
I matter more than you do...

349
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,840
Nayak!

350
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,000
<i>People you hate...</i>

351
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,960
killing them is ordinary.

352
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,680
It's easy.

353
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,840
<i>But killing someone you love...</i>

354
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,760
<i>it gives you real power.</i>

355
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,720
I want every evidence bagged.

356
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,040
<i>Don't leave anything behind.</i>

357
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,040
<i>Be very careful about the evidence, guys.</i>

358
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,800
Hey, where is she?

359
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,120
No clue.
But we heard a gunshot from there.

360
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,440
Come on, get up.

361
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,640
Get up.

362
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,600
Get out of here.

363
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,240
Pick her up. We need to get
this asshole's body out of here.

364
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,320
Leena, no sign of Bhumi yet.

365
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,440
Look over there. Check in the back.

366
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,760
Give it to me.

367
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,120
Come on.

368
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,960
Come on.

369
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,800
Go. Alright?

370
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,440
Go.

371
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,720
Check the boats.

372
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,440
I'm proud of you, Bhumi.

373
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,880
The biggest criminal
I've seen in my life...

374
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,960
Nayak!

375
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,520
You defeated him.

376
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,640
But you lost to crime.

377
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,600
I'm gonna take this guilt to my grave.

378
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,320
That I put you on a path...

379
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,320
you couldn't come back from.

380
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,240
This filthy world sucked you in.

381
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,080
You were from a simple
middle-class family.

382
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,120
What have I done to you, Bhumi?

383
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,880
Don't flatter yourself, sir.

384
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,280
You could've chosen any other girl.

385
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,600
But only I could've made it here.

386
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,240
This life.

387
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,200
The danger, the filth, and the...

388
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,520
loneliness.

389
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,440
No one else could've lived this life, sir.

390
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,680
This is my life.

391
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,680
And I have snatched it for me!

392
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,960
Because here, I get respect.

393
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,400
Respect, that I never got in
my "simple middle-class family".

394
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,440
Real criminal...

395
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,920
is the man who couldn't give his
wife the respect she deserved!

396
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,440
The man who couldn't
love his own daughter!

397
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,800
Who chucked his love-starved
daughter out into the world...

398
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,960
to beg... for love!

399
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,240
I met you really late, sir.

400
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,040
I was always ready.

401
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,240
<i>We're not sure who among the
casualties are the syndicate ID holders.</i>

402
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,120
<i>Hopefully, we've got them all.</i>

403
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,880
<i>We've seized 80-90% of the
syndicate's narcotic material.</i>

404
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,600
<i>Some of it could be floating around,
we're not sure.</i>

405
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,800
<i>But we are keeping an eye, sir.</i>

406
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,800
We have two more
rooms full of this stuff.

407
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,520
You'll be getting a huge consignment soon.

408
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,840
<i>Be ready.</i>

409
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,040
This is a mistake.

410
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,280
It must be an old order.

411
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
What do we do with it?

412
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,400
What if someone finds it?

413
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,960
How much is this worth?

414
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,240
It'll take us two months to
even flush it down the drain.

415
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,640
Why would we flush it?

416
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,160
What would we do after that?

417
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,480
What do you wanna do?
Start our own business?

418
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,480
But how would we do that?

419
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,120
There's no one to protect us now.

420
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,600
Why do we need a protector?

421
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,400
-We have you!
-Hey!

422
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,680
Do you realize what you're getting into?

423
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,240
Cops, as well as criminals,
will both be coming for us!

424
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,960
What will they come for?

425
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,480
We have nothing left.
What are they gonna take?

426
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,440
All we have is our life.

427
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,000
That is all they can take.

428
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,920
But we'll get paid, right?

429
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,960
Our kids could go to decent schools.

430
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,760
This is a one-way street.

431
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,160
There's no coming back.

432
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,160
Who's waiting for us to return anyway?

433
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,320
Who's gonna take us back?

434
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,880
And who the hell wants to go back?!

435
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,200
We'll meet again someday.

436
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,000
No, sir.

437
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,360
I'm not someone you
should be meeting anymore.

438
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,880
<i>I saw it all today.</i>

439
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,600
<i>The good. The bad.</i>

440
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,760
<i>Crime. Police.</i>

441
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,720
<i>Humans.</i>

442
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,240
<i>Humans and the thin
line that separates them.</i>

443
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,680
<i>The law.</i>

444
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,120
<i>Bhumi...</i>

445
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,960
<i>the girl we had sent to seduce Nayak,</i>

446
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,560
<i>who was scared about
getting killed by Nayak,</i>

447
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,680
<i>she killed Nayak.</i>

448
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,120
<i>But Nayak managed to seduce her.</i>

449
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,040
<i>Nayak faded into oblivion...</i>

450
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,480
<i>but Bhumi became Nayak.</i>

451
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,920
<i>How did this happen?</i>

452
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,600
<i>What power did this girl have?</i>

453
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,080
<i>Which I did sense, but...</i>

454
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,960
<i>neither I could control it,
nor could she.</i>

455
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,840
<i>Something that changed
all our calculations.</i>

456
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,960
<i>It created something new.</i>

457
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,240
<i>Something that is neither good...</i>

458
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,000
<i>nor bad.</i>

459
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,720
<i>Nor is it the law, nor the police.</i>

460
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,200
<i>Something that is just human.</i>

461
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,320
<i>A woman.</i>
