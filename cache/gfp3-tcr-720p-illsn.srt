1
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,415
The Vatican announced today...

2
00:49:34,417 --> 00:49:38,211
that Pope Paul VI has canceled
his Sunday blessing...

3
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:40,582
due to ill health.

4
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:43,296
His physician has
ordered total bedrest...

5
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:46,008
and cessation of all activities.

6
00:50:37,259 --> 00:50:40,186
The purpose of this
meeting is to ratify...

7
00:50:40,188 --> 00:50:44,258
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

8
01:26:32,891 --> 01:26:34,981
What do you think about Altobello?

9
01:26:37,219 --> 01:26:39,460
A very talented man.

10
01:26:39,462 --> 01:26:43,424
He has kept the peace between
our Sicilian and American friends.

11
01:26:44,264 --> 01:26:46,199
The saint of reason.

12
01:27:05,191 --> 01:27:10,112
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

13
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:15,903
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

14
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:23,093
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

15
01:27:25,012 --> 01:27:29,012
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

16
01:27:29,014 --> 01:27:34,227
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

17
01:28:02,855 --> 01:28:09,409
Is there someone in the Church we can turn to?
Someone we can tell our problem to?

18
01:28:12,237 --> 01:28:14,467
Cardinal Lamberto.

19
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:19,807
A wise and good man...
very influential.

20
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:23,380
He will see you.

21
01:28:57,976 --> 01:29:00,585
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

22
01:38:38,091 --> 01:38:40,926
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

23
01:44:41,874 --> 01:44:46,836
Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church,...

24
01:44:46,838 --> 01:44:50,007
died last night at 9:40 p.m.

25
01:44:50,866 --> 01:44:55,043
The Pope was 81 years old,...

26
01:44:55,045 --> 01:45:01,253
and had been in poor health
for the last several months.

27
01:47:46,577 --> 01:47:53,583
I am honored, Don Altobello,
that you've come from Palermo to visit me.

28
01:47:56,888 --> 01:48:01,892
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

29
01:48:02,729 --> 01:48:04,563
Do the donkey for me.

30
01:48:21,882 --> 01:48:25,969
It's been some time since
we did business together.

31
01:48:29,623 --> 01:48:33,804
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

32
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:40,997
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

33
01:48:48,178 --> 01:48:49,907
Only one stone?

34
01:48:53,124 --> 01:48:58,407
It's dangerous. A famous man.

35
01:48:59,023 --> 01:49:02,525
You will have to take precautions.

36
01:49:05,493 --> 01:49:07,373
Tell me what to do.

37
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:10,997
Then I will tell you my price.

38
01:49:15,399 --> 01:49:17,967
Ah, what bread!

39
01:49:22,151 --> 01:49:24,542
Olive oil...

40
01:49:29,489 --> 01:49:32,815
Virgin... only in Sicily.

41
01:49:37,208 --> 01:49:38,588
To death.

42
01:55:27,839 --> 01:55:30,977
"Oh father, my father!"

43
01:55:31,231 --> 01:55:34,121
"Give me some time
to pray to the Lord."

44
01:55:34,123 --> 01:55:37,702
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

45
01:55:37,704 --> 01:55:41,683
and fallen in love with her cousin.

46
01:55:41,685 --> 01:55:43,133
"There will be no forgiveness!"

47
01:55:43,135 --> 01:55:45,772
Her father stabbed her
through the heart.

48
01:57:13,288 --> 01:57:17,666
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

49
01:57:27,305 --> 01:57:31,436
I know you.
You're Mosca of Montelepre.

50
01:57:32,236 --> 01:57:36,109
You were an assassin then
and you're an assassin now.

51
01:57:36,111 --> 01:57:39,446
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

52
01:57:40,209 --> 01:57:42,130
I will pass through
the gates with you.

53
02:02:59,419 --> 02:03:01,956
What is it? What's wrong?

54
02:03:02,395 --> 02:03:05,189
They found Don Tommasino shot.

55
02:03:06,663 --> 02:03:07,872
Is he dead?

56
02:03:10,643 --> 02:03:14,187
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

57
02:03:14,646 --> 02:03:18,252
I must have revenge!

58
02:03:20,936 --> 02:03:26,149
Some day, you may have
to do a difficult service for me.

59
02:03:27,008 --> 02:03:33,530
Command me.
I will avenge him!

60
02:03:48,881 --> 02:03:50,340
Totals...

61
02:03:52,290 --> 02:03:54,551
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

62
02:03:55,716 --> 02:03:58,413
Siri, 11 votes.

63
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:02,681
Lamberto, 99 votes.

64
02:04:08,071 --> 02:04:13,788
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

65
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:19,545
Oh God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

66
02:04:20,620 --> 02:04:21,929
I accept.

67
02:04:22,461 --> 02:04:25,172
By what name do you
wish to be called?

68
02:04:25,174 --> 02:04:27,960
John Paul the First.

69
02:04:57,836 --> 02:05:03,746
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while”...

70
02:21:18,896 --> 02:21:21,440
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

71
02:21:23,260 --> 02:21:27,471
I bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

72
02:21:28,861 --> 02:21:30,279
Let him in.

73
02:28:22,849 --> 02:28:26,309
Tea, Your Holiness?
It will help you sleep.

74
02:28:48,746 --> 02:28:51,748
This is from Vincent Corleone.

75
02:31:06,314 --> 02:31:08,940
The Holy Father is dead!

76
02:33:53,438 --> 02:33:55,578
Speak... tell me.

77
02:33:55,580 --> 02:34:02,602
You have lost the
faith of the people.

78
02:34:04,986 --> 02:34:08,016
He who builds on the
people builds on mud.

79
02:34:09,388 --> 02:34:13,224
And Michael Corleone's message?

80
02:34:28,361 --> 02:34:36,621
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

81
02:34:40,619 --> 02:34:42,194
He's clean.

82
02:35:00,656 --> 02:35:03,450
Power wears out those
who don't have it.
