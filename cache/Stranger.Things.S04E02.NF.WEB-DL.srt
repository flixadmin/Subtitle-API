1
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,728
Looks like that Munson boy's
up to no good again.

2
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:58,987
Mr. Munson.

3
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,074
Where is she?

4
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,324
I just found her there.

5
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:05,870
I swear, I don't even know her name.
I never seen her 'fore.

6
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,122
Just calm down and stay back.

7
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:15,212
What you boys doing?

8
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,098
Holy mother of God.

9
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,983
Hey!

10
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,608
You can't be out here.
Get back inside.

11
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:38,653
Back inside.

12
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,673
Hey, Frank. Chief Powell here.

13
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,341
Listen…

14
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,930
We caught a body
over here at the Munsons' trailer.

15
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,725
<i>I don't even know how to describe it.</i>

16
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,769
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

17
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,939
<i>Uh, look…</i>

18
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,774
<i>…I need you down here ASAP</i>

19
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,944
<i>to tell me what the hell I'm looking at,</i>

20
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,699
<i>or how someone
could even do something like this.</i>

21
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:36,711
<i>Flight 623 just landed from Indianapolis</i>

22
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:38,463
<i>and will be arriving at gate two.</i>

23
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,050
<i>Flight 623 from Indianapolis at gate two.</i>

24
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,973
Mike.

25
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,893
Ah!

26
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:58,816
Oh, careful, careful, careful.
You're squishing your present.

27
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,233
It's a gift.

28
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:03,821
I, uh... I handpicked those
for you in Hawkins.

29
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:07,617
I know you like yellow, but now
I'm realizing it's too much yellow.

30
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,077
I know you also like purple,
so I got purple as well.

31
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,747
So I kinda did, like,
a 70/30 split kinda thing.

32
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,874
- They're perfect. Thank you.
- Oh. Oh!

33
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:16,625
Hey. How you doing?

34
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,795
- Hey, Mike.
- How you doing?

35
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,797
Yeah, good, man.

36
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,632
Great. Uh, what's that?

37
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,636
Um, it's nothing.
Just this painting I've been working on.

38
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:27,803
Cool.

39
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,182
That's a rad shirt, man.

40
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,264
Ocean Pacific?

41
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,726
Oh, hey, Mike.
This is, uh, my friend Argyle.

42
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,187
Oh. Hey.

43
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,941
Oh no, no, no.

44
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,776
No, it's a shitty knockoff. Yeah.

45
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,947
But don't sweat it.
I'll get you the good threads out here.

46
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:49,242
I heard a lot about your sister.

47
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,326
Uh.

48
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,456
O-Okay. Um, should we go?

49
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,207
Yeah, this is kinda awkward, man.

50
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,334
Yeah, so awkward.

51
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,463
I really thought it was Ocean Pacific.

52
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,464
I have our whole day planned.

53
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:07,134
First, El Rodeo for burritos.

54
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,387
What, really? Burritos for breakfast?

55
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,555
Yes. Trust me.

56
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,473
Yeah, no, I… I trust you.
It's just, you know, a little weird.

57
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,101
Then, after burritos,
I want to go to Rink-O-Mania.

58
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,353
Rink-O-Mania, okay.
What's Rink-O-Mania?

59
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,355
It's the most fun place in Lenora.

60
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,190
They have skating and games.

61
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,526
Sounds awesome.
Are your friends gonna meet us?

62
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,237
Friends? What… What friends?

63
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,737
You know, Stacy and Angela.

64
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,449
- Angela?
- You'll meet them, I promise.

65
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,077
Just not today.
I want today to be about me and you.

66
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,591
- Where to?
- 4819 Lonzo Way.

67
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,137
Let's go. This is life or death.
Snap, snap!

68
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,262
Yes, sir.

69
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:04,442
Then Vicki laughed. And it wasn't
like a cheap, fake laugh either.

70
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:07,360
It was like… It was a real, genuine laugh.

71
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,779
Of course.
It's my Muppet joke. It's hilarious.

72
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:13,576
My point is that Vicki laughed
and everything was just like…

73
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,327
- It was perfect.
- But?

74
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,915
But I'm having this problem
where it's like, I should stop talking.

75
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,209
I have said everything I need to say.

76
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,586
But then I guess I get nervous,
and the words keep spilling out,

77
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,088
and it's like my… my brain
is moving faster than my mouth,

78
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,466
or… or rather my… my mouth
is moving faster than my brain.

79
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052
I'm digging this hole for myself,

80
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,513
and I want to stop digging,
I'm trying to stop, but I can't.

81
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,597
And I'm doing it right now, aren't I?

82
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,225
Yeah, you are.

83
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,852
Oh, I'm hopeless.

84
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:42,395
Eh.

85
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,315
We both are.

86
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,568
If only we could just, like, combine.

87
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,113
Combine?

88
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,572
No, think about it.

89
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:56,451
I know exactly what I want,
and I've found the girl of my dreams,

90
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,578
but I can't get the courage
to ask her out.

91
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,581
- Mm.
- Meanwhile, you go on a million dates.

92
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,168
- And you have no idea what you want.
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:08,004
So if we just combined,
all our problems would be solved.

94
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,591
Because, I mean, alone, let's face it…

95
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:11,841
We totally suck.

96
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,344
Totally and utterly.

97
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,763
Ooh, I think
I found our morning movie.

98
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,432
<i>Doctor Zhivago.</i>

99
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,811
Ugh, you know I don't do double VHS.

100
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,312
But it's about doomed love.

101
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:25,523
- Oh, well, that's relatable.
- Precisely.

102
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:29,735
Also, Julie Christie
is b-b-bonkers hot in this.

103
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:32,404
Like, seriously,
the most beautiful creature

104
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,780
I have seen in my life.

105
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,951
<i>We're in the Forest Hills
trailer park in east Roane County.</i>

106
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:39,745
<i>We don't have a lot of details now,
but we can confirm</i>

107
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:43,081
<i>that the body of a Hawkins High student
was discovered early this morning.</i>

108
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:45,500
<i>- Police have not released the name…</i>
- Holy shit.

109
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,129
<i>…although we are told they're currently
in the process of notifying the family.</i>

110
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,018
You all right in there, Sinclair?

111
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,519
I'm good.

112
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:07,355
First hangover feels like
you're gonna split in two,

113
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,649
but you'll live.

114
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:16,032
<i>…occurred here is sure to touch
a nerve across the community of Hawkins,</i>

115
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,659
<i>which is still reeling
from last year's devastating mall fire.</i>

116
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,245
<i>Over 30 innocent…</i>

117
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,000
<i>…completely blocked off at…</i>

118
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,878
Come on.

119
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:32,715
Just hit it, man.

120
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,383
- Yo, just hit it.
- Yeah.

121
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,009
<i>But whatever has occurred…</i>

122
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,928
- Piece of shit.
- There you go. See?

123
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,349
<i>…Is newly appointed police chief
Calvin Powell,</i>

124
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,643
<i>who served as deputy under Chief Hopper.</i>

125
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,394
What's this?
I thought we were watching <i>ThunderCats.</i>

126
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,438
Hawkins student got murdered.

127
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,356
What?

128
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,192
Yeah, it's on every channel.

129
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:55,321
<i>As you can see behind me, Chief Powell
and the Hawkins Police Department</i>

130
00:10:55,403 --> 00:10:57,405
<i>are actively investigating the scene…</i>

131
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,200
They say who it is?

132
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,493
No, not yet.

133
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,412
Hey, maybe Chrissy
didn't stand you up after all.

134
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,163
Hey, don't say that.

135
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,082
Relax, it was a joke.

136
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,086
A joke? Come on, someone just died
and you're making a joke out of it?

137
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,672
It was at the trailer park,

138
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,173
so probably some druggy
OD'd on heroin or some shit.

139
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:17,259
Oh, see, that makes it funnier.

140
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:20,136
What is up your ass this morning?
It was a joke.

141
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,653
<i>We also don't yet know
if foul play was involved.</i>

142
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,446
<i>But whatever has occurred here</i>

143
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,115
<i>is sure to touch a nerve across Hawkins.</i>

144
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:43,159
<i>Ever since that girl, Barb,
died a few years ago,</i>

145
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,788
<i>it has been one thing after another.</i>

146
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,667
<i>I'll tell ya, you start to believe
all those things they say,</i>

147
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,626
<i>that this town is cursed,</i>

148
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,129
<i>that the devil lives here in Hawkins.</i>

149
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,297
Nancy!

150
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,469
I don't think anyone's gonna
care about the basketball game anymore.

151
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:01,678
Nancy?

152
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:03,096
- Earth to Nancy.
- What?

153
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:05,682
I said I don't think anyone's
gonna care about the game.

154
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:07,559
Yeah. No, I know.

155
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,062
Would you be up for a field trip?

156
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,294
Many of the residents
we spoke to voiced similar concerns to us.

157
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,340
Grief, shock, disbelief, anger.

158
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,384
Everyone wants to know the same thing,

159
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:43,846
how can so many tragedies
befall a once-peaceful town?

160
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:47,682
All eyes are now
on the police for answers.

161
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,061
Is the new chief of police, Powell,
in over his head?

162
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:53,522
Or is he the very savior this town needs?

163
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:56,357
<i>We'll be here the rest of the day
right here on channel nine,</i>

164
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,360
<i>where we'll keep you posted
on all the latest developments.</i>

165
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,908
<i>In the meantime, we recommend you
keep your doors and windows locked tight.</i>

166
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,576
<i>This is Beverly Moss, signing off for…</i>

167
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:09,330
My heart can't take it anymore.
It just can't take it.

168
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:19,130
<i>Chrissy Cunningham?</i>

169
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,466
You're sure it was Chrissy?

170
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:24,511
Yes, in her cheerleader outfit. Same thing
she was in when I saw her with Eddie.

171
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,679
- Did you tell all this to the cops?
- No.

172
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,265
No, but I… I can't be the only one
who saw them together.

173
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,475
They stood out.

174
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:33,394
Eddie the freak
with Chrissy the cheerleader?

175
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,690
Exactly. You know, his name's not
in the news yet or anything,

176
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,150
but I guarantee you
Eddie is suspect one now.

177
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,693
That's crazy.

178
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,654
Eddie didn't do this. No way.

179
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,615
No way.

180
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:46,491
- We can't rule it out.
- Yes, we can.

181
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,744
- Dustin!
- You don't know him like I do, Max.

182
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,037
Okay?

183
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,540
When we got to high school,
Lucas made all his sports friends.

184
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,624
Mike and me?

185
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,253
I mean, no one was nice to us.

186
00:13:58,086 --> 00:13:59,296
No one except Eddie.

187
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,758
Okay. Well, they said
the same shit about Ted Bundy.

188
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,509
Yeah, he's a super nice guy,

189
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:07,346
but then he's murdering women
on the weekend.

190
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:10,014
So you're saying Eddie is like Ted Bundy?

191
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,061
No, I'm not saying... I'm saying
that we can't presume anything, okay?

192
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,895
But it doesn't look good for Eddie.

193
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:23,778
Why haven't you told the cops this?

194
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,530
I… I don't know.

195
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:28,658
You don't know?

196
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,169
After I saw Eddie and Chrissy
go in the trailer…

197
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,673
…something else happened.

198
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,510
Okay, all right. Last one.

199
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,484
Come on.

200
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,059
<i>Nothing that weird
or anything. I mean…</i>

201
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,937
Eddie always drives like a maniac,

202
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:41,899
and the power goes off at my place
all the time. It's a piece of shit. But…

203
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,528
This morning,
I started to think back, and…

204
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:50,950
I don't know.

205
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,951
The look on his face.

206
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,206
He was scared, Dustin.

207
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,707
Really scared.

208
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,293
Maybe he was scared because,

209
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,630
you know, he…
he just killed someone, or…

210
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,383
Maybe, um…

211
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,177
Maybe be... because…

212
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,263
I don't… I don't know, maybe…

213
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:16,933
Something else killed her.

214
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,524
But that's impossible.

215
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,317
Right?

216
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,611
I don't know.

217
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,865
It should be.

218
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,203
Only one person knows
what actually happened.

219
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:41,667
Eddie.

220
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,585
- Have you talked to anyone else?
- No.

221
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:46,046
I can't find Lucas or Nancy,
and Mike's in...

222
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,880
California. Shit, shit, shit.

223
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,549
- Where you going?
- To see a friend.

224
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,970
- You heard the news. It's not safe.
- We'll be careful. Thanks. Love you. Bye.

225
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,941
<i>"Hop is alive."</i>

226
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,443
"He looks ford to date."

227
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,903
"Pleeze to make resarvazion,

228
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:15,491
call seven-four-one-five-two,"
blah, blah.

229
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,746
"Open 12 day P.E.T.T."

230
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:20,580
"No government, please."

231
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:22,833
"Kind regards, Enzo."

232
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,127
I like it even less in person.

233
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,255
What do you mean, "Like it less"?

234
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:29,506
I don't trust it.

235
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,674
For starters, who the hell sent this?

236
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,759
A friend?

237
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,302
- A friend?
- Of Hop's?

238
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:36,888
"Hop is alive. No government"?

239
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:40,476
This looks and reads like a ransom note,
and a bad one at that.

240
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,103
- There's no proof of life here.
- Yes, there is.

241
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,939
It's signed "Enzo."

242
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:47,273
- So?
- So?

243
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:50,611
There's only two people
who knew about our date at Enzo's,

244
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:51,819
and that's me and Hop.

245
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,822
So, whoever wrote this,

246
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:56,866
Hop trusted enough
to make him sign it Enzo.

247
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,243
He's sending me a message.

248
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,501
You saw him die, Joyce.

249
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,176
I didn't see a body.

250
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,266
Because he evaporated.

251
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:22,518
Or…

252
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,644
He survived.

253
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,148
Okay. Okay.

254
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,569
Let's indulge this fantasy for a moment.

255
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:35,239
He's Houdini.

256
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,200
He's a cat man with nine lives.

257
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:40,285
Whatever it is, he survives.

258
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,372
What's he doing in Russia?
He was captured, that's what.

259
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:45,749
Then he probably met some new friends.

260
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,376
And by friends, I mean the KGB.

261
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,048
And believe me when I tell you,
these people are the worst of the worst.

262
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,009
I am talking torture, Joyce.

263
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,346
And no matter how strong you think Jim is,

264
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,471
they will break him.

265
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,891
They will get his whole life story.

266
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:07,938
And yes, that might very well include
a planned date at Enzo's with you,

267
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,272
his co-conspirator,

268
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:13,277
making this all an elaborate ruse
to capture you as well.

269
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,321
You just made all that up.

270
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:22,618
It's a theory.

271
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,663
I prefer mine.

272
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,747
So do I.

273
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,416
Doesn't make it right.

274
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,710
Well, either way,

275
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,921
this could be real.

276
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,633
Hopper could be alive.

277
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,052
I suppose there's
only one way to find out.

278
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,556
What are you doing?

279
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,266
We're gonna call that number

280
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:46,934
and you're going to find out

281
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,605
who the hell sent you that letter.

282
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,441
But we're doing it… my way.

283
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,307
Where do you think you're going?

284
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:41,573
Tell me, who you work with?

285
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,242
I told you,

286
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:45,911
no one.

287
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,875
This woman,

288
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,796
who is she?

289
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:57,506
Why don't you tell me?

290
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,424
She's wearing a Russian uniform.

291
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,096
Get the Elephant.

292
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,122
You want to die
for this woman, American?

293
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,430
Hey, Will.

294
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,682
We'll be back at 6:00.

295
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,018
Have fun, okay?

296
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,269
Okay.

- Have fun.
- Thanks.

- Yeah, bitchin'. Do you come here a lot?

- Will does not, but I go to parties here.
- No...

307
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,521
It's a big party place.

308
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:25,444
Oh, I forgot. You need socks.

Oh, shit.

- They… They sell them at the counter.
- Oh, okay.

311
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,037
How'd you forget about the socks?

312
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,205
I mean, since you come here all the time.

313
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,583
I… I don't know. I just forgot.

314
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,250
Right.

315
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,546
Why do you keep lying?

316
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,007
- What?
- Why do you keep lying to Mike?

317
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,509
- I'm not lying.
- You're not?

318
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,846
You're friends with Angela and Stacy
and you come to parties here?

319
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,890
- I have been to a party here.
- For Mom's work.

320
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:55,433
That's not what you implied.

321
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,855
I just… I don't think Mike's gonna like
that you're lying to him.

322
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,941
And he doesn't deserve that.
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.

323
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,779
Okay, so, I asked for vomit green
and I got vomit green.

324
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,990
Isn't that awesome?

325
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,259
I'm so bad at this, I'm like Bambi on ice.

326
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,678
No, you're good. You got this.

327
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,761
Okay.

328
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:51,448
That's what it's all about, right?

329
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:01,249
Oh my God, guys.

330
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,083
Check it out.

331
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,837
Who's that twig with her?

332
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,338
I don't know.

333
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:12,594
But it seems like
the snitch has a boyfriend.

334
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:15,137
Told you spring break's gonna be fun.

335
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,766
<i>♪ Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus ♪</i>

336
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:19,308
<i>♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, Amadeus ♪</i>

337
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,690
All right, let me check.

338
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,278
Hey.

339
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,906
I'm sure it's nothing, all right?

340
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,285
Probably the neighbors complained
about the noise or some shit.

341
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,787
You all right?

342
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,248
Yeah.

343
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,582
I'm good.

344
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,211
All right.

345
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,844
And you were here all night?

346
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:55,927
Yes.

347
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,221
Ask anyone.

348
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,099
Oh, we will,
but thank you for the suggestion.

349
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:02,434
I see a whole lot of beer around.

350
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:06,021
- You have fun last night?
- What, you gonna arrest me for drinking?

351
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:08,482
It is against the law, so we could.

352
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,567
Should we?

353
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,028
I'd vote for trespassing, myself.

354
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,405
I don't think Benny's family
would be too thrilled

355
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,199
to see what you've done to his place.

356
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:18,617
Yo, people been using this shithole
for years, man.

357
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:20,077
Act like you guys didn't know.

358
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,538
What about your girlfriend?

359
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:23,539
She party here last night?

360
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,499
Chrissy?

361
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:27,126
No.

362
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,212
That's odd, what with her
being your girlfriend and all.

363
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,215
- Why you asking about Chris?
- When's the last time you talked to her?

364
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,384
After the game.

365
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,640
Look, this… this doesn't have to do with
that dead student, does it?

366
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:43,309
What did Chrissy say
when you talked to her?

367
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,227
Well, sh-she…

368
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,315
I mean, said she was gonna go home,
get changed, something like that.

369
00:26:48,397 --> 00:26:50,983
Did she mention anything
about buying drugs for the party?

370
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:55,070
Drugs? No. No way.
Chrissy doesn't mess with that crap.

371
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:58,866
- Maybe someone talked her into it.
- No. She's straight as an arrow.

372
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,201
What about Eddie Munson?

373
00:27:00,993 --> 00:27:02,494
Ever seen her talking to him?

374
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:03,829
That freak?

375
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:04,998
No.

376
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,207
No way.

377
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,047
Wait, what…

378
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,548
What does Eddie have to do with all this?

379
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,178
Did that freak hurt her?

380
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,638
He hurt Chrissy?

381
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,683
Did he hurt Chrissy?

382
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:34,778
Jason. Hey, man, you all right?

383
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,944
Jason, what happened?

384
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:38,781
Where are you going?
Is everything good?

385
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,200
What did they say?

386
00:27:40,282 --> 00:27:41,992
Are they gonna call our parents?

387
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:43,826
Jason!

388
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,776
Hey, Steve.

389
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,087
- You see this?
- How many phones do you have?

390
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,030
- Someone was murdered.
- How many phones do you have?

391
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,826
- Two. Why?
- Technically three, if you count Keith's.

392
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,243
Yeah, three works.

393
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:26,121
What are you doing?

394
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:27,830
- What are you...
- My pile!

395
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:30,916
No, no, no! My tapes! Dude.

396
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,292
What are you doing, man?

397
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:35,212
- Setting up base of operations here.
- Base of operations?

398
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,756
- Get off.
- I need it.

399
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,883
- For what?
- Eddie's friends' phone numbers.

400
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,095
Your new best friend you think is cooler
because he plays your nerdy game?

401
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:43,680
Yes. I never said that.

402
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:48,058
Seriously, you guys, maybe on a Monday
you can play around, but it's Saturday.

403
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,394
It's our busiest day.

404
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,646
- Robin, I empathize, but this cannot wait.
- Oh my God.

405
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,773
Calling Eddie's friends is an emergency?

406
00:28:54,857 --> 00:28:57,443
- Correct!
- Want me to strangle him or you want to?

407
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,611
We could take turns.

408
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,948
- Can you fill them in while I do this?
- Fill us in on what?

409
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,913
What's our game plan?

410
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,082
Game plan?

411
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,040
Yeah.

412
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,961
When you and Jonathan investigated
for <i>Hawkins Post,</i> did you split up or…?

413
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,757
Well, first of all, you're not Jonathan.

414
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,215
Clearly not.

415
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,551
I'm here, present and accounted for.

416
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:25,305
I've gone through
a lot of managing editors. Okay?

417
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:27,265
Ooh, somebody's testy.

418
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:28,516
Curious.

419
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:32,436
I'm annoyed he's not here.
Okay? Is that what you wanna hear?

420
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,521
And yeah, something's going on with him.

421
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:36,982
But that's not the mystery
we're investigating today.

422
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,108
A student died.

423
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:41,863
The game plan is for you to let me
do the talking, for you to take notes,

424
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:43,865
and for you to follow my lead
at all times.

425
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,948
Is that understood?

426
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,409
Totally and completely.

427
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:49,953
Shit. Slow down, slow down.

428
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:52,499
Just act casual.

429
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,541
And follow your lead.

430
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,125
Got it.

431
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,803
- Hi, officer.
- Can't get through. Got a crime scene.

432
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:07,430
Yeah, um, I... I was just going to…

433
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:09,597
Um…

434
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,851
See Max Mayfield, a friend.

435
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:12,935
She lives in there.

436
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,979
We're restricting access
to residents only.

437
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,105
It's just, um,

438
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,066
her mom is working today

439
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:21,068
and we would really
like to check in on her.

440
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,279
We're basically her nanny. Nannies.

441
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,909
Don't I know you?

442
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:30,368
I don't think so.

443
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,411
Yeah.

444
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,039
Actually, I do know you.

445
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,750
You're Fred Benson.

446
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,252
You killed that kid last year.

447
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:40,127
What?

448
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,965
That ugly scar on your face.

449
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,051
It's from that crash.

450
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,847
It… It was an accident.

451
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:51,641
An accident?

452
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:56,229
Is that why you ran all the way home
instead of calling us?

453
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,231
You're a murderer is what you are.

454
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,108
Everyone here knows it.

455
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:05,153
A murderer. A murderer. A murderer.

456
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:08,991
Murderer. Murderer. Murderer.

457
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,618
Murderer. Murderer. Murderer!

458
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,746
- You all right there?
- What?

459
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:17,165
I said, you all right, kid?
You're looking a little peaked.

460
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,127
Fine.

461
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,045
I'm fine.

462
00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:23,381
He's just, um, on edge.

463
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:24,965
I mean, we all are.

464
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:29,636
I'll let you check on your friend,
but be fast. Yeah?

465
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,763
Of course, officer. Thank you.

466
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,189
Okay, what was that?

467
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:41,900
I said act casual.

468
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,192
Yeah, it's just…

469
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,862
Sorry.

470
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,701
Yes!

471
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,459
I don't know.

472
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,544
Part of me expected her
to be on that plane.

473
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:03,503
Or something.

474
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,715
Just like, "Hey, surprise!"

475
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:08,800
"Here I am."

476
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:11,596
- But also…
- Shit!

477
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,056
…I felt this…

478
00:32:13,138 --> 00:32:15,141
I felt this intense relief

479
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:16,807
when she wasn't there.

480
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,104
No, that's the Purple Palm Tree Delight
working its magic, my man.

481
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,564
Makes your troubles float away

482
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:24,150
like the seed pods of a dandelion
flowing in the wind.

483
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:25,233
No.

484
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,112
No, that's not it.

485
00:32:28,654 --> 00:32:29,654
Hey…

486
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:32,240
If I show you something,

487
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,535
you wouldn't tell anyone, right?

488
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:37,163
Who would I tell? You're my only friend,
Jonathan.

489
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:46,297
Yes.

490
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:50,925
What's that?

491
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,097
It's an acceptance letter
to Lenora Community.

492
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,932
- That's where I'm going.
- I know.

493
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,769
But you're going to Emerson with Nancy.

494
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,311
No, I'm not.

495
00:33:01,895 --> 00:33:03,690
She just doesn't know it yet.

496
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:05,107
Hold on, what is going on?

497
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,736
Like, I… I can't leave
my mom and my brother

498
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:11,364
to… to… to chase
a dream that isn't mine.

499
00:33:11,446 --> 00:33:13,907
You're dead, man. You are so dead.

500
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,367
What was I supposed to do?

501
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,786
- Not lie.
- Not lie?

502
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,037
- Yeah.
- Not lie?

503
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,248
- Yeah!
- What, so I just tell her the truth?

504
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,958
- Yes.
- No. No.

505
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,335
Because… Because if I told her the truth,

506
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,171
then she'd just
throw her dreams out the window

507
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,799
to come out here and be with me.
And I… I just can't take that.

508
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,925
Like, you know?

509
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,096
Like, this… this huge knot
of resentment would build,

510
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,472
like… like some cancer,

511
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,559
until eventually she hates me.

512
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,770
And then, before you know it,
we're just like my mom and dad.

513
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,273
- We're divorced, my kids hate me.
- Shit!

514
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:48,901
Yeah, shit! I mean, it's all shit.

515
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,070
The cycle never ends.

516
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:54,115
Yeah, man. Your nightmare cycle.

517
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,826
You want it to stop,
but what is your approach here?

518
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,369
To just slow-motion break up with Nancy?

519
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:02,457
- I guess.
- No, man!

520
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:04,375
I know. I don't know what to do.

521
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,210
Palm Tree Delight! That's what you do.

522
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,836
- Palm Tree Delight?
- Go, go. Go.

523
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,838
<i>Ándale, ándale.</i>

524
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,548
- Really? Okay.
<i>- Ándale. Arriba, arriba.</i> Let's go!

525
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,217
Backpack in the back of the van.

526
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Go!

527
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,391
Got me stressed out.
It's not even my girlfriend.

528
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,407
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

529
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,617
Yup, mine's better.

530
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,577
No, it isn't.

531
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,911
Milkshakes?

532
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,704
Yum.

533
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:46,583
Where, oh where have you
been hiding this handsome thing?

534
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,085
Uh,

535
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:52,882
Angela, thi… this is Mike,

536
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,050
my boyfriend.

537
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:56,885
Angela. Pleasure.

538
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,012
Heard a lot about you.

539
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,889
It's really cool to finally meet
some of El... Jane's friends.

540
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:02,099
Friends?

541
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:03,309
Yeah.

542
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:04,601
Super cool.

543
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,269
Come on, friend.

544
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:07,813
Let's skate, shall we?

545
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:10,650
- I wanted to finish...
- I'll hold that.

546
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,527
Come on.

547
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,742
Whoo!

548
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,371
Why are you so nervous?

549
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:25,873
We're just having fun.

550
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,302
- Oh no.
- What?

551
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,429
El, she hasn't been
telling you everything.

552
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,431
- What you talking about?
- She's lying to you.

553
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,143
- Bullshit.
- No, listen to me.

554
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,938
- She's having problems here.
- Problems. Okay, what kind of problems?

555
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,900
Stay put.

556
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,990
All right, everyone.

557
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,492
This next song is dedicated to Jane,

558
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,619
the local snitch.

559
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:11,168
<i>♪ Wipe out… ♪</i>

560
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,340
Freak! Go home!

561
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,092
Loser!

562
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:38,653
- She's a little baby!
- Baby!

563
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,289
Gonna cry to Mommy?

564
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,166
Hey!

565
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,376
Hey, hey, turn it off.

566
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,378
Sorry. I can't hear you, dude.

567
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,677
Crybaby!

568
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,097
I said turn it off.

569
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,681
If you say so.

570
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,898
Wipeout.

571
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,318
Oh!

572
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:33,458
Didn't you see the sign, dummy?

573
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:36,045
"No food or drinks on the rink."

574
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,925
El! El!

575
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:42,009
El!

576
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:49,141
So sad!

577
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:53,771
El!

578
00:37:56,523 --> 00:37:58,567
Stop. No.

579
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,362
Hey, get out of my way! El!

580
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,242
El!

581
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,554
Murray, we gotta make this call.

582
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:29,056
One moment, please.

583
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,894
Voilà.

584
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:38,065
Okay, you are now calling
from Durham, North Carolina.

585
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:42,485
But if this is KGB, they will still
be able to trace us eventually,

586
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,280
so keep it brief.

587
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:45,280
How brief?

588
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,782
A minute, max, and…

589
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:49,117
Proof of life. Got it.

590
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,077
Okay.

591
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,751
One, two…

592
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:21,523
This is Enzo.

593
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:22,943
Hello, Enzo?

594
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,277
This is Joyce.

595
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,572
I received your message,

596
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:30,201
<i>- and I would like to make a reservation.</i>
- Yes, good, good.

597
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,577
<i>But for reservation,
you need to make deposit.</i>

598
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,996
Uh, what… what kind of deposit?

599
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,456
Forty thousand dollars.

600
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,210
You have it in Hopper's trust,
for the girl, yes?

601
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:42,505
Uh, yes. Yes. Forty thousand.

602
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,422
<i>Good.</i>

603
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:46,467
Bring to Yuri's Fish n' Fly
in Nome, Alaska.

604
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,552
Uh, you want me to go to Alaska?

605
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:49,677
<i>Yes.</i>

606
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,972
You give Yuri money, Yuri gets me money,

607
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,224
I give him your friend.

608
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:55,518
<i>Simple trade, understand?</i>

609
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:57,394
Uh…

610
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:01,981
…uh, first, we… we're gonna
have to speak to Hopper.

611
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:03,608
We need to know he's alive.

612
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,902
Hey!

613
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,242
I'm afraid not possible.

614
00:40:11,324 --> 00:40:12,367
Why not?

615
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,161
Your friend is, uh, stuck.

616
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,873
<i>But you give me money, I make him unstuck.</i>

617
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:19,291
<i>You must trust me.</i>

618
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,293
How do I trust you?
I don't know who you are.

619
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,177
Forty thousand. Yuri's
Fish n' Fly. Two days. Do not call again.

620
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:39,311
Well, that wasn't the KGB.

621
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:41,230
But it wasn't a friend either.

622
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,065
So we're both wrong.

623
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,818
Who the hell was that?

624
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:02,918
Still alive.

625
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,172
But he is barely breathing.

626
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,010
More of this, he will die.

627
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,349
You are strong, American.

628
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,563
Perhaps the Motherland
could use that strength.

629
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:26,900
Send him to Kamchatka!

630
00:41:34,115 --> 00:41:37,619
I never knew you to be generous.

631
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,748
You clearly do not know Kamchatka, Doctor.

632
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:46,295
This man does not deserve
the peace of death.

633
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:49,840
So I have sent him...

634
00:41:51,257 --> 00:41:52,384
to Hell.

635
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:29,797
Present arms.

636
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,425
Lieutenant Colonel, welcome to Indiana.

637
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:37,972
Eddie Munson.

638
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:40,391
He's a part of
that freak devil cult, Hellfire.

639
00:42:41,057 --> 00:42:43,393
<i>The cops, they say
Chrissy went to him to buy drugs.</i>

640
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:44,686
Drugs? No.

641
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:46,956
That's what I said.
Chrissy would never touch that shit.

642
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,983
<i>They wouldn't even
show her parents her face.</i>

643
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:53,278
I don't know what this freak did
to Chrissy, but he did something sick.

644
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,864
Probably sacrificed her,
drained her blood for the devil.

645
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:58,951
- Satanists do that.
- That's what I'm saying. It's this cult.

646
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,329
Hellfire isn't a cult.

647
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:07,001
It's… It's just a D&D club.

648
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,545
D… D&D?

649
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,880
Dungeons & Dragons?

650
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:16,552
It's like a… It's like a game.
It… It's fantasy.

651
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,764
And how exactly is it
you know all of that, Sinclair?

652
00:43:22,056 --> 00:43:23,056
Uh…

653
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,186
Well, it's my sister.

654
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,190
Yeah, she's like…
She's like, a total nerd.

655
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:31,525
- You know?
- Yeah.

656
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:34,277
Nerds? Like, she plays a lot sometimes...

657
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,780
I'm sure your sister
isn't killing people, right?

658
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,576
But I've read the wrong person
plays this game, it can warp their mind.

659
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,246
They confuse fantasy and reality,
and innocent people die.

660
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:47,081
Been happening all over the country.
It's an epidemic.

661
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,876
I've read about that shit. It's real.

662
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,043
And I think Eddie…

663
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:53,380
He's the wrong type of person, right?

664
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,798
You know, he got lost.

665
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,052
He thought Chrissy was
just a part of his… his sick game.

666
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:01,804
And chances are,
he's still in the game. Meaning...

667
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,056
He's gonna kill again.

668
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:06,851
But not if we can help it.

669
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:09,771
Would Chrissy want us to just stand by

670
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,733
while the cops go around
pursuing some bullshit leads,

671
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:15,360
spreading rumors saying she's some druggy?

672
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:17,237
- No!
- No, she'd want us to go out there.

673
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,657
- To do something about it, wouldn't she?
- Yeah!

674
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,449
- Then let's hunt some freak!
- Yeah!

675
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:22,951
- For Chrissy!
- Yeah!

676
00:44:23,034 --> 00:44:24,952
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

677
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:28,456
<i>♪ I can't seem to face up to the facts ♪</i>

678
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,793
<i>♪ I'm tense and nervous
And I can't relax… ♪</i>

679
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:33,336
Let's go!

680
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,673
<i>♪ I can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire ♪</i>

681
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:41,219
<i>♪ Don't touch me, I'm a real live wire… ♪</i>

682
00:44:41,302 --> 00:44:43,429
Have you seen or heard
from Eddie recently?

683
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,639
Eddie Munson.

684
00:44:44,722 --> 00:44:47,059
- When's the last time you talked to him?
- Seen him?

685
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:50,813
- Okay. Sorry to bother you.
- Know anyone who'd know where he is?

686
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:54,273
I really don't think he's at the arcade.
Yep, I'm pretty sure.

687
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,612
Reefer Rick? No. Does this Reefer Rick
have a last name? I mean, it's kind of…

688
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,030
All right, <i>Doctor Zhivago.</i>

689
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:03,117
It's a double VHS. It's long.

690
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,036
But that's because
it's filled with action and romance,

691
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:08,288
and a little bit of suspense.

692
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:11,583
So, my boyfriend won't, like,
totally puke when I bring it home?

693
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:13,335
Oh, you… your boyfriend?

694
00:45:13,418 --> 00:45:16,003
Uh, no. No. He's gonna…

695
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,880
He's gonna love it.

696
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:18,965
Yeah.

697
00:45:19,632 --> 00:45:22,219
- See ya.
- Yeah, see ya later.

698
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,304
Alligator.

699
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:27,556
Goddammit.

700
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,393
Hey, guys, I might have a lead.

701
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,438
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

702
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,273
Apparently, Eddie gets drugs
from some guy named Reefer Rick,

703
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:36,900
and sometimes Eddie crashes there.

704
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:39,277
Sounds promising.
Where does Reefer Rick live?

705
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,655
See, that's the thing. No one knows.

706
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,117
He's more of a… a legend
than someone that people actually know.

707
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:47,202
- Last name?
- I don't know that either.

708
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,911
Bet the cops know the last name.

709
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,371
- What?
- Cops.

710
00:45:51,664 --> 00:45:55,835
I mean, listen, if this Reefer Rick
is actually a drug dealer,

711
00:45:55,918 --> 00:45:58,547
I guarantee you
he's been busted at some point.

712
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,715
- Means he's in the system.
- The cops?

713
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,719
Really, Steve? That's your suggestion?

714
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:07,431
I think they should be filled in
on what we know, what's going on.

715
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,682
- You think Eddie's guilty, don't you?
- Whoa.

716
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:13,061
I believe in innocent until proven guilty,
all that constitutional shit.

717
00:46:13,144 --> 00:46:14,271
I just, you know,

718
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:16,856
don't think we can rule it out.

719
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,860
That's precisely what
we're trying to do here, Steve.

720
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,653
And maybe we'd have a little bit more luck

721
00:46:22,737 --> 00:46:25,199
if you spent less time
trying to find a girlfriend

722
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,284
and more time trying to find Eddie.

723
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,746
- Somebody has to attend to the customers.
- Especially if they're babes, right?

724
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,414
Hey, not fair. Okay?

725
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:36,168
I attend to all customers equally,
babes and non-babes alike.

726
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:40,338
We've got a very big selection in here.
It can be super overwhelming for people.

727
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,965
Yeah, it can be.

728
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,719
- What are you doing?
- Maybe we don't need a last name.

729
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:53,893
- Twelve Ricks have accounts here.
- Lot of Ricks.

730
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:56,271
So, let's narrow it down.

731
00:46:56,355 --> 00:47:00,150
Rick Alderman's latest rentals
are <i>Annie </i>and <i>Dumbo.</i>

732
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:02,735
- Chances our drug dealer has a family?
- Not likely.

733
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,947
All right. Rick Conroy.

734
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,199
<i>Sixteen Candles,
Teen Wolf, Romancing the Stone.</i>

735
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,492
No.

736
00:47:08,574 --> 00:47:12,788
Okay. Rick Joiner.
<i>Mask, Footloose,</i> and<i> Grease.</i>

737
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,039
Nah.

738
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,458
Rick Kimbrough.
<i>The Blue Lagoon </i>and <i>Splash.</i>

739
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,793
Definitely not.

740
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:20,670
- No way.
- Okay. Rick Lipton.

741
00:47:20,753 --> 00:47:23,465
<i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
Cheech & Chong's Next Movie.</i>

742
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:25,050
<i>Cheech & Chong's Nice Dreams.</i>

743
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:27,594
<i>- Cheech & Chong's Up in Smoke.</i>
- Bingo.

744
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:30,556
- Lipton?
- Spelled like the tea. 2121 Holland Road.

745
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,974
- That's out by Lovers Lake.
- Middle of nowhere.

746
00:47:33,057 --> 00:47:34,518
It's a perfect place to hide.

747
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:51,242
Um, hi, I'm Nancy Wheeler
from the<i> Hawkins Tiger...</i>

748
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,244
I've talked to enough reporters. Yeah.

749
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,085
Okay, well…

750
00:48:00,668 --> 00:48:02,753
What about that one? With the flag?

751
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,007
Yeah, I tried them twice.
They were actually quite rude.

752
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,759
I am not doing that again.

753
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,219
I'm telling you, we've talked to everyone.

754
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,472
Nope. Not everyone.

755
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:17,768
Hi there. Hi.
Did you see something last night, huh?

756
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,271
Oh, you wanna tell us everything?

757
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,023
Nancy, come on. Let's get outta here.

758
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:24,483
But he's just the cutest little witness.

759
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,030
Stay here.

760
00:48:42,543 --> 00:48:43,543
Hi.

761
00:48:44,545 --> 00:48:47,590
Uh, I'm a friend of Max Mayfield's,
over there.

762
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,762
You're Wayne Munson, aren't you?

763
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,472
Eddie's uncle?

764
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:56,222
That's right.

765
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,394
I heard you found the body.

766
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,981
- The neighbors, they were...
- Like to gossip.

767
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,735
And I'm not interested
in gossiping no more.

768
00:49:09,153 --> 00:49:10,822
Certainly not to a reporter.

769
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:15,284
What gave me away?

770
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:20,498
Look, let me level with you, Mr. Munson.

771
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,710
The paper that I write for is… small.

772
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:28,422
We don't have the staff
to keep up with the big guys.

773
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,552
And I'm just… looking for something,

774
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:35,179
anything really,
about what happened last night.

775
00:49:35,262 --> 00:49:36,262
Why?

776
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,934
Far as I can tell,
you all have it figured out already.

777
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:42,353
My nephew's a freak.

778
00:49:42,853 --> 00:49:44,271
He killed that girl.

779
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,523
Ain't that about right?

780
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,693
Let me guess.

781
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,902
You've been speaking to the <i>Hawkins Post?</i>

782
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,489
Chuck Bailey?

783
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,782
Yeah, I used to work with him.

784
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:57,827
I mean, that guy
doesn't know his ass from his elbow.

785
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,083
Let me tell your side of the story.

786
00:50:20,641 --> 00:50:21,643
<i>My nephew,</i>

787
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:25,438
<i>he may look dangerous,</i>

788
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,065
but he didn't do this.

789
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,862
It just… ain't in his nature.

790
00:50:37,324 --> 00:50:39,911
No matter what anyone says,

791
00:50:39,994 --> 00:50:42,164
and they will say things, believe you me.

792
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,914
But…

793
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,126
This… wasn't Eddie.

794
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,922
The man who did this…

795
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,469
Who killed that poor girl,

796
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:57,635
he's…

797
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,264
Pure evil.

798
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:02,724
"Man"?

799
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,438
You think you know
who might've done this?

800
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,110
You ever hear the name

801
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,780
Victor Creel?

802
00:51:21,786 --> 00:51:25,916
<i>I guess you're too young,
but back when I was a kid,</i>

803
00:51:25,998 --> 00:51:29,085
<i>everybody knew the name Victor Creel.</i>

804
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:31,630
He lost his mind.

805
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,298
Killed his whole family.

806
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,884
Kids and wife.

807
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,052
Took their eyes.

808
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,514
Cut 'em right out.

809
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:42,889
God.

810
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,561
<i>That poor girl
I found this morning,</i>

811
00:51:47,186 --> 00:51:49,188
<i>same exact thing.</i>

812
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,148
<i>So I'm thinking</i>

813
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,068
<i>maybe he broke out.</i>

814
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:55,987
Victor Creel is still alive?

815
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:59,240
They locked him away in Pennhurst Asylum.

816
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,034
Yeah, as far as I know, he's still there.

817
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,121
That is, unless he broke out.

818
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:09,126
<i>Like that… What's his name?
White mask and killed the babysitters?</i>

819
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,628
<i>Michael Myers?</i>

820
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,380
<i>Yeah, Michael Myers.</i>

821
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,007
<i>You ask me, Victor's like that.</i>

822
00:52:18,425 --> 00:52:20,137
He's a real boogeyman.

823
00:52:29,728 --> 00:52:31,981
Um, I'll be right back.

824
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:41,782
Fred?

825
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,952
Fred!

826
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:48,498
Fred!

827
00:52:52,126 --> 00:52:53,126
Fred?

828
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,672
Fred?

829
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,880
Murderer.

830
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,547
Murderer!

831
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,717
- Murderer. Murderer!
- Murderer.

832
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,385
Murderer.

833
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:48,974
Murderer! Murderer!
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

834
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:52,228
Murderer! Murderer!

835
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:56,398
Murderer!

836
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,420
You are no longer men.

837
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,465
You are cogs in a machine.

838
00:54:21,548 --> 00:54:25,844
A machine in service
of our great Motherland.

839
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:32,184
And if you are foolish enough
to attempt escape,

840
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,730
you will be hunted down.

841
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,692
You will be captured.

842
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,027
And then you will suffer greatly

843
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,780
as you perform your final act

844
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,532
for the Motherland.

845
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,994
There will be no second chances.

846
00:54:54,206 --> 00:54:55,206
Run,

847
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:56,708
you die.

848
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,336
You hear, American?

849
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,510
<i>Your friend is… stuck.</i>

850
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,264
<i>But you get me money, I make him unstuck.</i>

851
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,806
<i>You must trust me.</i>

852
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:12,309
<i>How do I trust...</i>

853
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:15,769
Joyce, whoever Enzo is,
the answer is not on that tape.

854
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,733
You don't hear that?
In the background?

855
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,693
So he's outside.

856
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,987
Someone's talking. Not surprising.

857
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,157
I think she's talking to Enzo.

858
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,492
Play it again.

859
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,710
Can you translate that?

860
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,545
Uh, I… I can't understand it.
It's too low.

861
00:56:00,606 --> 00:56:01,775
Hey!

862
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:07,447
<i>But you get me
money, I make him unstuck.</i>

863
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,449
- Turn it up.
- <i>You must trust me.</i>

864
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,284
<i>How do I trust you?
I don't know who you are.</i>

865
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,538
She… She wants to use the phone.

866
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,331
She's mad at Enzo.

867
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,293
- Calls him a "moosor."
- "Moosor"?

868
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,378
- It's slang.
- For what?

869
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:26,007
<i>Literally, "moosor" translates
to trash or garbage.</i>

870
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,050
Like "pig" here, often directed at cops.

871
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,635
Cops?

872
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,724
Or guards.

873
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,023
Hopper's stuck.

874
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:49,322
And Enzo can get him unstuck.

875
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:53,367
Yeah.
It's not exactly the Ritz, is it?

876
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:59,666
Welcome to your new home, American.

877
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:05,630
Enzo's a prison guard.

878
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,715
Maybe Hopper bribed him.

879
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:09,425
Sounds like Jim, doesn't it?

880
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:15,056
- Joyce, where are you going?
- Bank.

881
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:17,724
I'm gonna get Enzo his damn money,

882
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,728
and we are getting Hopper back.

883
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:22,646
Okay.

884
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:25,692
El?

885
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,360
What the hell? Get out!

886
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,195
- Not there?
- No.

887
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,599
- Should've told me she was having trouble.
- I didn't know they were gonna be here.

888
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:36,452
You knew she was having trouble for a year
and didn't tell me.

889
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,664
- I didn't know she was lying to you.
- Which is why you were a douche all day?

890
00:57:39,746 --> 00:57:41,748
- I wasn't being a douche.
- You were.

891
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,335
You were rolling your eyes, moping.
You were barely talking.

892
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,547
- You basically sabotaged the whole day.
- She was lying to you.

893
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,175
Straight to your face,
ever since you got here.

894
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,804
And I've been a total third wheel all day.
It's been miserable.

895
00:57:54,887 --> 00:57:58,182
So, sorry if I wasn't… wasn't smiling.

896
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,309
Yeah, whatever, man.

897
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,771
Well, what about us?

898
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:05,856
What?

899
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,358
You're mad that I didn't talk to you?

900
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,655
You made it super clear that you're
not interested in anything I have to say.

901
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,782
- That's just not true.
- You've called maybe a couple times.

902
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,534
It's been a year, Mike.

903
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,954
Meanwhile, El has
a book of letters from you.

904
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,539
- That's because she's my girlfriend, Will.
- And us?

905
00:58:22,623 --> 00:58:24,333
We're friends. We're friends.

906
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:26,001
We used to be best friends.

907
00:58:27,961 --> 00:58:30,715
Then maybe you should've
reached out more. I don't know.

908
00:58:30,797 --> 00:58:32,300
But why is this on me?

909
00:58:32,382 --> 00:58:33,885
Why… Why am I the bad guy?

910
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,559
Let's just…
Let's just find her. Okay?

911
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:14,217
Yeah.

912
00:59:30,983 --> 00:59:33,027
- Oh my God, her face.
- Right?

913
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,153
- She looks like she shit herself.
- Yeah.

914
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:50,251
Angela.

915
00:59:51,336 --> 00:59:53,922
- Uh-oh. Look who it is.
- She looks upset.

916
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,425
You ruined my day.

917
00:59:55,507 --> 00:59:59,137
Oh no. Did we embarrass you
in front of your boyfriend?

918
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:01,389
I want you to say sorry to me,

919
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:05,393
and I want you to tell my boyfriend
that it was just a joke

920
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,436
and that we are really friends.

921
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:08,521
Or what?

922
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,398
You gonna hurt us
with your mean stare again?

923
01:00:15,902 --> 01:00:18,364
Sorry you can't cry to teacher today.

924
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:21,074
You'll just have to cry
to your daddy instead.

925
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,827
Oh, wait. Can't do that either.

926
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,550
Hey!

927
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,559
Angela.

928
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,940
Holy shit. Angela, you okay?

929
01:00:53,023 --> 01:00:55,150
- Angela, hey. You okay?
- Oh my God!

930
01:00:56,485 --> 01:00:58,112
- What did she do?
- Oh my God.

931
01:00:58,195 --> 01:01:00,030
- Oh my God, what do we do?
- Oh, shit.

932
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,784
You're okay. You're okay.

933
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,472
Oh… Oh my God.

934
01:01:24,554 --> 01:01:25,722
Holy shit, El.

935
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:27,307
What did you do?

936
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:29,976
What did you do?

937
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,106
What have you done? What have you done?

938
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,431
Okay. Well, that's settled.
I guess he's not here.

939
01:02:07,514 --> 01:02:09,726
- Eddie! It's Dustin!
- Great.

940
01:02:11,101 --> 01:02:13,061
Look, we just wanna talk, okay?

941
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,606
No cops, I swear. We just wanna help.

942
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,067
Eddie!

943
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:19,152
Shh.

944
01:02:22,195 --> 01:02:23,195
Rick!

945
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:25,532
Reefer Rick!

946
01:02:25,615 --> 01:02:27,117
Don't scream that.

947
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:31,289
- Rick!
- He's not there.

948
01:02:31,371 --> 01:02:33,458
- Reefer Rick!
- Just…

949
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,251
He could just be really high.

950
01:02:36,293 --> 01:02:38,920
- Is that a foot?
- No, that's a shoe.

951
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,088
Hey, guys?

952
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:11,871
Hello?

953
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:14,998
Is anyone home?

954
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,384
What a dump.

955
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,530
What are you doing?

956
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,449
What are you doing?

957
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,952
He might be in here.

958
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:53,704
So take the tarp off.

959
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,748
If you're so brave, you take the tarp off.

960
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:05,382
Hey, look over here.

961
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:09,804
Someone was here.

962
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,597
Maybe he heard us. Got spooked and ran.

963
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:15,268
Don't worry.
Steve will get him with his oar.

964
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,978
I know you think you're being funny,

965
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:20,021
but considering everyone in this room
has nearly died a hundred times,

966
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,315
personally, I don't find it funny
in the slight...

967
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,985
Whoa!

968
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,570
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

969
01:04:26,528 --> 01:04:30,157
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Eddie! Eddie! Stop!

970
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,867
Eddie! Eddie!

971
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:34,159
It's me.

972
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:35,704
It's Dustin.

973
01:04:36,204 --> 01:04:37,414
This is Steve.

974
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:41,251
He's not gonna hurt you, right, Steve?

975
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,503
Right. Yeah.

976
01:04:42,586 --> 01:04:44,422
Steve, why don't you drop the oar?

977
01:04:47,173 --> 01:04:49,802
He's cool. He's cool.

978
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:51,177
I'm cool, man. I'm cool.

979
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,847
- What are you doing here?
- We're looking for you.

980
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:54,931
We're here to help.

981
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,518
Eddie, these are my friends.

982
01:04:57,601 --> 01:05:00,896
You know Robin, from band.

983
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,023
This is my friend Max.

984
01:05:03,106 --> 01:05:05,192
The one who never wants to play D&D.

985
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,068
Eddie.

986
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,197
We're on your side.

987
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,074
I swear on my mother.

988
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,369
- Right, guys?
- Yes. Yes. We swear.

989
01:05:15,452 --> 01:05:16,454
On Dustin's mother.

990
01:05:16,536 --> 01:05:18,414
Yeah, Dustin's… Dustin's mother.

991
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,130
Jesus Ch…

992
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:42,811
Eddie…

993
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:50,570
We just want to talk.

994
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,657
Okay?

995
01:05:58,411 --> 01:05:59,914
We want to know what happened.

996
01:06:02,916 --> 01:06:04,835
You won't believe me.

997
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:08,295
Try us.

998
01:06:14,552 --> 01:06:15,552
Fred!

999
01:06:17,722 --> 01:06:18,722
Fred!

1000
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:22,603
Excuse me.

1001
01:06:23,561 --> 01:06:24,561
Hi.

1002
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,525
Excuse me, sorry.
Have you seen my friend wandering around?

1003
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:30,527
Uh, nerdy, glasses, scar on his face?

1004
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,778
No, sorry.

1005
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,456
Hi, officer?

1006
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,418
- Officer?
- What are you still doing here?

1007
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,503
My… My friend from the car earlier,
I… I can't find him.

1008
01:06:48,586 --> 01:06:49,963
What do you mean?

1009
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:52,425
He was there
and then he was just gone and…

1010
01:06:52,507 --> 01:06:55,260
Did you maybe see him
leave with somebody or…?

1011
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,929
I told you kids to go home. Jesus Christ.

1012
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,432
This is Glenn.
We might have a situation here.

1013
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,998
Her body just, like,

1014
01:07:25,081 --> 01:07:29,210
lifted up into the air and, uh…

1015
01:07:31,755 --> 01:07:33,507
And she just, like, hung there.

1016
01:07:34,257 --> 01:07:35,259
In the air.

1017
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,429
And her bones… Uh, she…

1018
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,266
Her bones started to snap.

1019
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,603
Her eyes, man.

1020
01:07:46,686 --> 01:07:48,981
It… It was like there was something,

1021
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,983
like, inside her head, pulling.

1022
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,072
I… I didn't know what to do, so I…

1023
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:01,701
I ran away.

1024
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,371
I left her there.

1025
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11,920
You all think I'm crazy, right?

1026
01:08:12,003 --> 01:08:14,380
No. We don't think you're crazy.

1027
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:17,384
Don't bullshit me, man!
I know how this sounds.

1028
01:08:17,467 --> 01:08:19,511
- We're not bullshitting you.
- We believe you.

1029
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,640
Look,

1030
01:08:22,722 --> 01:08:24,891
what I'm about to tell you might be

1031
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,895
a little… difficult to take.

1032
01:08:30,105 --> 01:08:31,356
Okay.

1033
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,818
You know how people say Hawkins is…

1034
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,777
Cursed?

1035
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,279
They're not

1036
01:08:39,405 --> 01:08:40,405
way off.

1037
01:08:43,493 --> 01:08:44,869
<i>There's another world.</i>

1038
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,501
<i>A world hidden beneath Hawkins.</i>

1039
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:56,631
Sometimes it bleeds into ours.

1040
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,301
Like ghosts and shit?

1041
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,845
There are some things

1042
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,555
worse than ghosts.

1043
01:09:08,726 --> 01:09:10,645
Help me!

1044
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,877
No, no, no…

1045
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,338
<i>These monsters
from this other world…</i>

1046
01:09:37,422 --> 01:09:39,841
- Help! Somebody!
- <i>…we thought they were gone.</i>

1047
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:42,177
- Nancy, please!
<i>- But they've come back before.</i>

1048
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,845
That's why we needed to find you.

1049
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:47,891
If they're back again, we need to know.

1050
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,351
Fred.

1051
01:09:57,025 --> 01:09:58,027
<i>That night,</i>

1052
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,320
did you see anything?

1053
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,363
Dark particles, maybe?

1054
01:10:09,162 --> 01:10:12,123
It would almost look like dust,
swirling dust.

1055
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:15,377
No, man, there was nothing
you could see or, uh…

1056
01:10:17,003 --> 01:10:18,255
Or touch.

1057
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:24,177
What do you want?

1058
01:10:29,557 --> 01:10:31,518
I want you

1059
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,979
to join me.

1060
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:37,899
No, no, no, no.

1061
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,877
<i>You know,
I tried to wake her, man.</i>

1062
01:10:57,377 --> 01:10:58,796
She couldn't move.

1063
01:11:00,046 --> 01:11:03,550
It was like she… she was
in a trance or something.

1064
01:11:04,717 --> 01:11:06,136
Or under a spell.

1065
01:11:07,136 --> 01:11:08,180
A curse.

1066
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,140
Vecna's curse.

1067
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,198
Who's Vecna?

1068
01:11:28,324 --> 01:11:33,079
An undead creature of great power.

1069
01:11:34,414 --> 01:11:35,748
A spell caster.

1070
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:38,627
A dark wizard.
