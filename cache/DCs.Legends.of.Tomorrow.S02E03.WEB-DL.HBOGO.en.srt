1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,600
<i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,120
<i>and all of history is vulnerable</i>

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,240
<i>to the attack
of rogue time travelers.</i>

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,040
<i>But one group travels throughout time</i>

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,840
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called Time Aberrations</i>

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,840
<i>and erase their damage to history.</i>

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,480
<i>A group of outcasts and misfits.</i>

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,320
<i>These individuals aren't heroes.</i>

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,880
<i>They're something else.
They're Legends.</i>

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,200
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,480
Heywood, Dr. Nate Heywood.

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
I'm a historian.

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,160
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,000
In layman's terms,
I'm a time detective.

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,280
Ingestible translator.

16
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,720
You'll be able to speak
and understand

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,960
any language spoken to you.

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,080
You know how fragile
we historians can be.

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,680
I know my cuts and bruises.

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,760
You're a hemophiliac.
You can bleed to death.

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,720
So your superpower
is wearing the suit.

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,000
<i>Without that fancy suit,</i>

23
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,160
you're nothing
but a self-righteous rich guy.

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,720
<i>Mr. Heywood's vitals are dropping.</i>

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
I think I can save him.

26
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,480
<i>I did a little tinkering
to the formula.</i>

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,240
Hello, Rex.

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,880
- Rex! Rex!
- Time traveler.

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,640
- So how's our patient?
- Still stable.

30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,160
Gideon has him under sedation.

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,600
Any side effects
from the Nazi super-serum

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
you injected him with?

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,560
No, but that may have
a little something to do

34
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,920
with the work
I did altering the serum

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,240
to remove the Nazi parts.

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,040
Yes, it would be a tad inconvenient

37
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,720
to have a monster roaming the ship.

38
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,440
Gideon,
can you pilot for a little bit?

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
I need a break.

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,560
Where are all the knives?

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,320
Oh, there's one.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,400
Look, if this is about me
taking all the mayonnaise,

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,120
you might be slightly overreacting.

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,360
You killed him!

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,600
Killed him?
I've killed lots of people.

46
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,840
You're gonna have to be
a bit more specific.

47
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,400
What the hell happened to you?

48
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,240
I really don't know.

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,000
You injected me with Nazi serum?

50
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,600
Which I'd redesigned
to quintuple my own strength

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,720
and transform my skin into an alloy

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,960
a hundred times stronger than steel.

53
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,400
Steel, that's a cool name.

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,640
Yeah, especially since my grandfather

55
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,880
was called Commander Steel.

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,480
But what does that make me?

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,720
Corporal Steel? Mr. Steel?

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Citizen Steel?

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Who cares?

60
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,680
You got superpowers now, dude.

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,640
{\an5}Except,I don't know
how I turned to steel

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
in the first place.

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Ray will teach you.

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,080
- He will?
- You said it yourself.

65
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,440
You redesigned the serum.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,320
Which I did beautifully,

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
but it's not like I have

68
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,200
some sort of instruction manual.

69
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,560
Guess you'll have to wing it.

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,320
Now, I'm gonna go have a chat

71
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,760
with our stowaway.

72
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,840
This is gonna be so much fun!

73
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,920
You stowed away
before we time-jumped from 1942.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
I'm gonna get out of here

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,080
and I'm gonna finish what I started.

76
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,920
You mean, killing Mick?

77
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,320
{\an5}Not that I haven't
thought of it myself, but why?

78
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,560
He killed Rex.

79
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
What?

80
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,480
Rex Tyler?

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,960
As in Hourman?

82
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,920
His killer stole the Askaran Amulet.

83
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Look, I'm sorry. I am.

84
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,600
But Mick didn't do it.

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
He is a thief and a murderer.

86
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,720
He's also a Legend...

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,200
and Mick hasn't been off the ship

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,720
{\an5}since we dropped
your team off at the JSA.

89
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,840
With his last words,

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,120
{\an5}he told me his killer
was a time traveler.

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,000
{\an5}You know,
we've been tracking someone

92
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,760
who's been trying to alter history.

93
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,120
We think it's the same person

94
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,520
that gave Krieger the super-serum.

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
This might be your time traveler.

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Look, if I let you out of here,

97
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,800
you promise not to hurt Mick

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,200
unless he really deserves it?

99
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,920
Sorry for knocking you out.

100
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,640
Sorry for locking you up.

101
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Call it even?

102
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,240
When I was a kid, I used to play

103
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,720
JSA versus Nazis with my dolls.

104
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,280
{\an5}Well, they were action figures,
really.

105
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,160
{\an5}But it doesn't matter
'cause I got superpowers now

106
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,400
and it's awesome.

107
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,080
Your powers manifested

108
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,960
{\an5}as a result of
a heightened adrenal response.

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,200
{\an5}Basically, Amaya threatened
you and you reacted.

110
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,440
So now...

111
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,520
{\an5}what we need to do
is duplicate the conditions

112
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,160
{\an5}which caused you to,
you know, steel on?

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,840
Wait, so you want to threaten me?

114
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Not exactly.

115
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
Wait, let's discuss this.

116
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,600
I thought this was a time machine?

117
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,120
You saved the Justice Society.

118
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,240
Why can't you save Rex?

119
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,840
{\an5}Because we're dealing
with another time traveler.

120
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,000
{\an5}If we go back and save Rex,
the time traveler will just

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,640
go back before then
and kill Rex again.

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,080
So instead of chasing our own tails,

123
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,720
{\an5}we need to identify
who we're up against.

124
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,120
I don't understand any of this.

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Look, I just need you to trust us.

126
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
We're gonna find who do this.

127
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
I promise you.

128
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,520
{\an5}In the meantime,
Gideon will fly you home.

129
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm not going back until Rex's killer

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
is brought to justice.

131
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,400
We don't know
how long that will take.

132
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,480
Don't worry, we're professionals.

133
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,600
We know what we're doing.

134
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
Yeah, come on!

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,880
If Grandpa Heywood
could see me now.

136
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,080
Professional?

137
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Ish.

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
I know you not gonna take that, Ray.

139
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,080
Go crush this Tin Man.

140
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
- Nice try.
- Come on.

141
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Hold on, I'll close it!

142
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Nate!

143
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,080
Ray, get inside!
We have to close the door.

144
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,040
No, I got to go after him.

145
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,080
Gideon, shut the cargo door.

146
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,880
What's happening to the ship?

147
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,800
Jax, what's our status?

148
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,240
<i>I've rerouted power
from the secondary manifolds.</i>

149
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,080
Where are Dr. Palmer
and Dr. Heywood?

150
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,920
- Did you check out the window?
- What?

151
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,240
How is it you people haven't
managed to kill yourselves yet?

152
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,520
The day is still young.

153
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,920
- Jax?
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

154
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,600
Gideon, I need you
to track down Ray and Nate

155
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,760
and take us to their position.

156
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,040
<i>The explosive decompression</i>

157
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
<i>caused us
to lose corrective altitude,</i>

158
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,160
<i>which put too much strain on
the station-keeping thrusters.</i>

159
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,320
For God's sake, say it how it is.

160
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,480
We're screwed.

161
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
<i>We're screwed.</i>

162
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,600
Edo Period.

163
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,720
Mid-17th century Japan.

164
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
That's cool.

165
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Well...

166
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,560
I'm still alive.

167
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
So far, so good.

168
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,720
Whoa, Samurais.

169
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,960
Oh, right, almost forgot.

170
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,440
Can you understand me now?

171
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,640
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

172
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,080
Okay, he fell from the sky.

173
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,480
He's about yeah tall.

174
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Made out of metal.

175
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
No?

176
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
You're alive.

177
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
Hi. How did I get here?

178
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,840
I found you lying
at the bottom of a crater

179
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,240
like you had been dropped
from the sky.

180
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Dropped from the sky?

181
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,880
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

182
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,200
Yeah, I sailed here.

183
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,120
You know, across the ocean...

184
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,880
with some friends.

185
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,000
Who hopefully are gonna find me.

186
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,160
By the looks of it, I'm gonna say

187
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
we're on the island of...

188
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,200
Honshu, in the vicinity of Kyoto?

189
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Yes.

190
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,640
How did you learn
to speak my language?

191
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,520
I studied it for many years.

192
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,360
You know, so I could trade
with your countrymen.

193
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,360
Yep, feudal Japan is my jam.

194
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,480
Masako, what are you doing

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,080
talking to this <i>gaijin?</i>

196
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,480
He was hurt, Father.

197
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,040
I brought him home
so you could care for him.

198
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,880
And who would care for us
when the Shogun finds out

199
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,320
we're aiding a foreigner?

200
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Please, Father.

201
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,800
You know what they would do to him.

202
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
Very well.

203
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,720
Get him inside quickly.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,760
My name is Nate, by the way.

205
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,280
- My name is Masako.
- Masako.

206
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,840
That's a pretty name.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,280
The Shogun asked you a question.

208
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,200
Where did you find your armor?

209
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
I made it.

210
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,840
Your armor is mine now.

211
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
You don't understand.

212
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,800
I designed the suit specifically
for my body.

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,280
Take the armor away.

214
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,480
You're making a big mistake.

215
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,560
It could kill you!

216
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Too hot?

217
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,120
Are you, sure your old man's cool

218
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,480
with you giving me a bath?

219
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,200
My father is not home.

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,280
I'm only giving you a bath

221
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,160
because you are dirty and injured.

222
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,600
About that. I'm...

223
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm more durable than it looks.

224
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,400
You still have not told me
where you are from.

225
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
The United States...

226
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,800
which you've never heard of

227
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,280
because it doesn't exist
for another 200 years.

228
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,480
You are a strange man.

229
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,680
You have no idea.

230
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,840
Enough about me.

231
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,720
I overheard your father
talk about the Shogun.

232
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,040
Is that Tokugawa Iemitsu,
by any chance?

233
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Historians view him as
a particularly brutal warlord

234
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
and...

235
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,560
Did I say something?

236
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,520
Tomorrow, I'm to be married
to Tokugawa Iemitsu.

237
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,840
Then my life is over.

238
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
How can you bring a thug
on a rescue mission?

239
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,480
I've known men like you.

240
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,000
Men who take and prey on the weak.

241
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,280
Listen, girly.

242
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,440
I'm risking my neck for two morons

243
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,240
who fell out of a ship. Why?

244
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,880
'Cause they'd do the same for me.

245
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,400
Why are you on the ship?

246
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,880
'Cause I'm a member of
the Justice Society of America.

247
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,480
- It's my job to protect everyone.
- Except for me.

248
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,440
You snuck up behind me
and sliced my throat like a ninja.

249
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,440
There's no such thing as ninjas,
you idiot.

250
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,360
- Tell that to Chuck Norris.
- Who's that?

251
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
- And I'm the idiot.
- And by the way,

252
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,240
- I'm not your girly.
- All right.

253
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
If you two don't quit
your squabbling,

254
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,840
I am going to maroon you

255
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,960
in a time period of my choosing.

256
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Together.

257
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,160
Not to brag, but...

258
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,800
Between the docking stabilizers
and the blast doors...

259
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
I think this might be
my best patchwork ever.

260
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
Well, charming as your confidence is,

261
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,160
I think we better consult the expert.

262
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,000
Gideon, would you be so kind
as to run a diagnostic report?

263
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
<i>Mr. Jackson's
work has done the trick.</i>

264
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,360
<i>A scan has revealed that</i>

265
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,040
<i>all 36 compartments of the ship</i>

266
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,560
<i>are in optimal condition.</i>

267
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
That's weird.

268
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,560
Actually, I think
it's astonishing given

269
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,160
the considerable abuse
we've been under...

270
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,760
No, no. Not, not that.

271
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,840
Gideon, did you say
36 compartments?

272
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,000
<i>Correct. The entirety of the ship.</i>

273
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,520
Before Rip, you know, disappeared,

274
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,160
he made me learn
every inch of the Waverider.

275
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,560
And of those inches,

276
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,160
35 compartments.

277
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,080
So either I miscalculated or...

278
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,680
Captain Hunter
had a secret compartment

279
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,160
he failed to tell you about.

280
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,400
Gideon, please pull up
the schematics of the ship.

281
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,760
No, we still have
to fix the time drive.

282
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
And we will.

283
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
After.

284
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,120
Please, don't tell me
you're not intrigued.

285
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Masako-san, a word please.

286
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
What's wrong?

287
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,320
The Shogun's men are here.

288
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,480
Please come outside.

289
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,800
<i>Konnichiwa.</i> How can I help you?

290
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,440
We found a <i>gaijin</i>in the forest.

291
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,360
The Shogun wants to make sure

292
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
there are not
any other foreigners around

293
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
to bother you.

294
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,920
Oh, that is very kind of him.

295
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,880
but you are the only visitor
we've had today.

296
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Good.

297
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,280
The last thing the Shogun wants

298
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,680
before his wedding is surprises.

299
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Too late!

300
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
What are you doing?

301
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,040
Relax, I got this.

302
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,320
- Who are you?
- I'm the guy telling you

303
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,760
that your Shogun's wedding
has been canceled

304
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,000
on account that he's an asshat.

305
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
But seriously.

306
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,160
Why don't you boys mosey on back
to your big bad boss

307
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
and tell him the news?

308
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Or what?

309
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,120
Or it's gonna get ugly.

310
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,320
I am wearing a Samurai's armor.

311
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,440
You are not.

312
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,160
I wear my armor on the inside.

313
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,120
Nate, stop insulting him.
I beg of you.

314
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Relax, I got this.

315
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,720
He caught me off guard.

316
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,800
He caught me off guard.

317
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
He caught me off guard.

318
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,520
Come at me now.

319
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,880
It's not turning on.

320
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,920
Stop! Stop! Please!

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,120
You're going to kill him.

322
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,640
That is entirely up to him.

323
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Stay down, <i>gaijin.</i>

324
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,320
She doesn't want to marry him.

325
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,960
We will return tomorrow
to take you to the castle.

326
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,640
I trust there will be no more...

327
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,760
surprises.

328
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,120
The sword did not
cut any vital organs

329
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,840
but the blood loss...

330
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Tell me about it.

331
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,840
What were you thinking?

332
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,440
I didn't mean to cause
you any more trouble.

333
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
I was just trying to help.

334
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,280
No one can help me.

335
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,560
We have that in common.

336
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,600
Nate? Nate!

337
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,840
The signal from Ray's ATOM
suit is getting stronger.

338
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,520
Doesn't exactly look inviting,
does it?

339
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
It's like
"Ninja III: The Domination."

340
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,600
Never took you for a cinephile.

341
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,480
All I know is ninjas
like to hide in trees.

342
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,160
- I don't see anything.
- Exactly.

343
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,080
You don't find them, they find you.

344
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,360
Just because you saw ninjas
in a movie...

345
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,600
that doesn't make them real.

346
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,680
I have to side with Mick on this one.

347
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,880
They're real.

348
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,680
You think there's
a secret brotherhood of men

349
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,480
trained in the art of assassination?

350
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,040
I hate to break it to you, Amaya,

351
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,440
but I'm basically a ninja.

352
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,920
I miss the JSA.

353
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,720
Compartment 36
should be right about here.

354
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,400
What are you doing, Grey?

355
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,120
I'm looking for any hidden doors.

356
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
We don't have time for this.

357
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,960
Nate and Ray
are lost in Feudal Japan.

358
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,920
Let's just fix the ship and go.

359
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,440
Did you hear that, Jefferson?

360
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Move.

361
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,880
- Oh, my God.
- Secret hatch.

362
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,320
With a sequencing lock.

363
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,120
Clearly, Captain Hunter
didn't want anyone getting in.

364
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,040
Or maybe he was trying to
keep something from getting out.

365
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,120
If I've learned one thing
from "Lost",

366
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
it's you don't go
opening secret hatches.

367
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,560
<i>Ray's close.</i>

368
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
<i>Look sharp.</i>

369
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
Haircut, let's get out of here.

370
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,880
We're saving your ass, again.

371
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,400
It is you who need rescuing.

372
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,680
Fellas, getting a little cold
in here without my suit.

373
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,640
You are already defeated
before you have even begun.

374
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,480
I have been trained in the art
of war by Shimura himself.

375
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,760
League of Assassins, class of '09.

376
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,440
Don't take it easy on me.

377
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
We got to go.

378
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Oh. Hey, guys!

379
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,080
Wrong way, Haircut.

380
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
What about my suit?

381
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,400
We can get it later.

382
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,320
My friend's serum...

383
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,120
it's cured my hemophilia.

384
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,280
Oh, long story.

385
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,600
Short version...

386
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,160
my blood didn't clot
like normal people.

387
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,440
So if I were to cut myself shaving

388
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,600
or get a paper cut, I could die.

389
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,280
So every day,
you were afraid to live?

390
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Pretty much.

391
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,760
In the Samurai tradition...

392
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,520
a warrior is always prepared
for death.

393
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,320
A woman celebrates when
her husband dies with honor.

394
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
That's hardcore.

395
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,560
A Samurai who fights without armor...

396
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,320
that is hardcore.

397
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,040
Nate, you're alive.

398
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,560
Oh, hey, guys!

399
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,360
- You found me.
- Bad timing?

400
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,880
Nope. Nope.

401
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,160
Masako, these are...

402
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,640
my friends I was telling you about.

403
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,880
<i>Hajimemashite.</i>

404
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,920
Can I get you something to drink?

405
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,600
Sake, lots of it.

406
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,840
What he meant to say
is thanks for your hospitality

407
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,360
but we must be going.

408
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,960
- No, I didn't.
- Amaya's right.

409
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,280
- Nate, let's go.
- I can't.

410
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,760
We can't leave.

411
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,800
Masako's supposed to marry
the Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu.

412
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,320
Yeah, met him. Not a fan.

413
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,560
Well, the reason he sticks out
in the history books is

414
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,240
because he likes
to murder his wives.

415
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,080
And I can't leave Masako
to his mercy.

416
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,040
Especially since
he stole my ATOM suit.

417
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,440
Exactly. Wait, what?

418
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,560
You let the Shogun steal
a 21st century super-suit?

419
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,360
After I crash-landed
trying to rescue you.

420
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,240
How does the Shogun even know
how to operate your ATOM suit?

421
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,240
I designed it
so an idiot could use it.

422
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,040
An idiot does.

423
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,200
Guys, bottom line is,
if the Shogun has the ATOM suit,

424
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,520
it's not just Masako and
the village we have to protect.

425
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,600
He can use it to conquer
the whole region.

426
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,200
You said the Shogun's coming
for your new girlfriend.

427
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,320
Easier to defend a village

428
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,240
- than to attack a castle.
- But anyone who tries

429
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,000
to fight the Shogun will be cut down.

430
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,120
Except, if that person
is made of steel.

431
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
About that.

432
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,720
I'm having a little problem
accessing my powers.

433
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,880
Sounds like you're having
performance issues

434
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,600
and it looks like you're not
done training him yet.

435
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,320
Now the rest of us need to figure out

436
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,320
how we can defend a village.

437
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,760
Not me.

438
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,480
Wake me up when the action starts.

439
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,320
What is this place?

440
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,080
It appears to be some sort of armory.

441
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,120
There's a reason why
Rip didn't want us in here.

442
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,880
Some things you can't un-see.

443
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,960
But why the big secret?

444
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,480
Rip didn't trust us to know that

445
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,120
there were heavy-duty
weapons on board?

446
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Well, would you?

447
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,520
- What the...
- Look, Jefferson.

448
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,440
Our old friend
has hailed the Waverider.

449
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Let's play it.

450
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,400
<i>Sorry to contact you like this,
Captain Hunter.</i>

451
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
<i>But I can't risk putting
any more lives in danger.</i>

452
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,880
Thought this was from Barry Allen?

453
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,840
It is. Only from 40 years
in the future.

454
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,320
- <i>And neither can this.</i>
- Fascinating.

455
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,080
<i>Which is why you'll keep what
I'm about to tell you a secret.</i>

456
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,720
<i>Even from the rest of your team.</i>

457
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,200
The ATOM suit is made of
and powered by dwarf star alloy.

458
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,920
It's strong enough to withstand
bullets, arrows, and explosives.

459
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,120
- So it's impenetrable?
- Not quite.

460
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,520
Underneath the left thruster
is the alpha-stabilizer.

461
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,640
- Alpha-stabilizer, got it.
- If you destroy it,

462
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,160
the photons that stream
from suit's weapons systems

463
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
will overheat.

464
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,560
Theoretically,
causing somatic overload.

465
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,680
Theoretically,
that's... that's comforting.

466
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,680
You have to get close to the Shogun.

467
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,640
And in order to do that,
you have to be able to harden.

468
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, when you're putting it
in those terms, it isn't helping.

469
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,560
Neither is that.

470
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
It worked the last time.

471
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Come on.

472
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,360
My serum is flawless.

473
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
Your lack of focus is the problem.

474
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,640
You think I'm not focusing?

475
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,200
Like... enough!

476
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,640
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

477
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,120
You don't think
I don't want to save the girl,

478
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,680
spare the village, and be a hero
for once in my damn life?

479
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,640
I spent half of my childhood
in the hospital

480
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,000
where it didn't even occur to me

481
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
to dream about having superpowers.

482
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,640
But guess what?
I got them, I lost them.

483
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,960
Now I really, really need them,
and I can't get them back.

484
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,440
This isn't all about you.

485
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,880
I worked for years,
spent billions of dollars

486
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,520
to develop the ATOM suit.

487
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,720
I nearly died learning to shrink.

488
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,680
And now, I have to teach you
to destroy the very thing,

489
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,200
the only thing, that makes me a hero.

490
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Wait?

491
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,280
"Somatic overload"
means destroy the suit?

492
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Yeah, Nate.

493
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,320
We can't beat the Shogun
while he's wearing the suit.

494
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,920
So we have to blow the suit up.

495
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,960
Your powers are within you.

496
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
After today...

497
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
I'll have nothing left.

498
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Ray...

499
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,000
You should all be safe here.

500
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,240
They've never seen foreigners before.

501
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,200
I was once just like them.

502
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,640
My village was also
small and isolated.

503
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,600
Some would say that my people
were superstitious.

504
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,600
But... in truth,

505
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
we were protected.

506
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,960
Protected by that?

507
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,560
Legend has it that
this totem was one of five

508
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,960
created by the gods

509
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,560
and given to the five
great tribes of Zambesi.

510
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,440
This totem harnesses the ashe,

511
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,080
or the... the life force

512
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,400
of the animal kingdom.

513
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,920
It was passed down to me
from my mother

514
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,520
and from hers before that.

515
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,040
And why did you leave?

516
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,440
I was recruited by the JSA...

517
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,040
and I realized that

518
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
the world was much larger
than just my village...

519
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,960
and that there were people
beyond its borders

520
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,400
who also needed protection.

521
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,920
Sometimes, I can't help but worry

522
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,120
that with me gone...

523
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,000
there's no one left to guard my home.

524
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,360
From people like Mr. Rory.

525
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,560
At the end of the day,

526
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,880
Mick does the right thing.

527
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Usually.

528
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,240
You remind me of my son.

529
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
Why?

530
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,080
Was he a terrible teacher, too?

531
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,520
He was a great Samurai.

532
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,440
I built him the strongest
and most formidable armor

533
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,600
in all of Japan.

534
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,080
Forged him a sword

535
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,120
fit for an Emperor.

536
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,720
What happened to him?

537
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,640
My son was popular

538
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,080
with the men who served under him

539
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,520
and the Shogun resented him for it.

540
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,920
So he ordered Oda

541
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,560
to commit <i>seppuku.</i>

542
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,640
We will make sure
that the Shogun pays

543
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,000
for what he's done to your family.

544
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,160
Maybe.

545
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,920
Maybe not.

546
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,920
But I ask you...

547
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,040
Would I rather hold my son again

548
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,440
or his armor?

549
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,720
Your son, obviously.

550
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,120
An armor is nothing but iron,
leather, and silk.

551
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,760
It can be replaced.

552
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,240
But, the man...

553
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,640
who wears the armor is...

554
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I get it.

555
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,920
You're saying I don't need
a suit of armor

556
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,240
to defeat the Shogun.

557
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,200
Don't be ridiculous.

558
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,480
He'll kill you in seconds.

559
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Follow me.

560
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
I'm gonna die.

561
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,440
Yeah, probably.

562
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,400
That was actually your cue
to cheer me up.

563
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,440
Oh, if you accept death

564
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,600
you have nothing to fear.

565
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,040
I'm more afraid of what's
gonna happen to you if I die.

566
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,960
I know I have these powers inside me.

567
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,800
I just can't figure out
how to use them.

568
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,320
Does a child learn to laugh?

569
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,320
Does he sit and practice laughing?

570
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,520
No. He just laughs.

571
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,120
"Do or do not, there is no try."

572
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,480
Exactly.

573
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,760
Where did you learn that?

574
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,440
From a great <i>sensei</i>

575
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
from where I'm from.

576
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Yoda.

577
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,160
Oh, this Master Yoda is very wise.

578
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
The Shogun approaches.

579
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
Get to the temple.

580
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,480
Where is my bride?

581
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
She's not leaving.

582
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Not with you.

583
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,080
I'm just gonna need a second.

584
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,040
Find the villagers. Kill them.

585
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,720
Your form is all wrong.

586
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,640
I ordered Ichiro
to destroy that blade

587
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,240
after the death of his son.

588
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Very well.

589
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,680
I will destroy it myself.

590
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,320
<i>Konnichiwa,</i>scumbag.

591
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,880
Go get him.

592
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,440
I will kill you

593
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,200
with your own armor.

594
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,360
Check the temple.

595
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,840
Rematch?

596
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,640
Who is your master?

597
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,880
I have no master.

598
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
A ronin.

599
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,240
You're not worthy of the effort.

600
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,640
You have fought with honor.

601
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Now you will die with it.

602
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,560
About that.

603
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,520
This village is under our protection.

604
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,160
Leave now and we'll spare your lives.

605
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,560
A sword is only as deadly
as the man who wields it.

606
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,640
And armor is only as strong
as the man who wears it.

607
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,120
I don't want to shoot you guys.

608
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,560
I love ninjas.

609
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,160
That was the armature relay.

610
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,880
It enhances the limbs' reaction time.

611
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,000
Where the hell is Mick?

612
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,920
Probably ransacking
the village himself.

613
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,760
Told you ninjas were real.

614
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,880
That's the cooling system.

615
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,400
Trust me, it gets hot in there.
I know.

616
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,400
You think you are clever.

617
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,800
You dishonor my family
and torture my village.

618
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,080
I will enjoy killing you.

619
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,320
Your family will be
extinguished from history.

620
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,400
We haven't been introduced.
Name's Steel.

621
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,360
Remember, you got to hit...

622
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
I remember!

623
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Do it!

624
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,600
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

625
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,400
- You did it.
- I did it.

626
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Yeah...

627
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,320
you blew up the ATOM suit.

628
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,280
I am so sorry.

629
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
It's okay.

630
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
You steeled on.

631
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Kind of proud of you.

632
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,520
Master Yoda taught you well.

633
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,880
Right, Yoda. Well, thank you.

634
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,920
I was thinking now that

635
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,560
your wedding is canceled...

636
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,600
You come from the sky.

637
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,720
Something tells me
you have to return.

638
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I...

639
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,320
I'm glad the katana sword
found a worthy owner.

640
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Me too.

641
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You.

642
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,520
Don't think I didn't see
how you stood up to the Shogun.

643
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
Even though he's gone,

644
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,720
your village still needs a protector.

645
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
That sword,

646
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,000
what did you say
your family name was?

647
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,200
Yamashiro.

648
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,880
Thank you for loaning me
your son's armor.

649
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,680
I'm sorry it got
a bit dinged up in the battle.

650
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,080
Then it served its purpose.

651
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,080
Haircut.

652
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,240
Steel.

653
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,720
Sara says we got to clear out.

654
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,000
- Good-bye, Masako.
- Good-bye, Nate.

655
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,000
What an amazing time period.

656
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,600
Definitely my favorite,
besides the Old West.

657
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,440
Why are you two
goofy bastards so happy?

658
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,080
You lost your damn suit,
the food sucks

659
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,080
and I've got no proof ninjas exist.

660
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,040
What are you staring at?

661
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,880
I've figured you out.

662
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,600
Congratulations.

663
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,120
You act like this selfish meathead...

664
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,560
but secretly, you're not so bad.

665
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,160
You know, you might even
have the makings of a hero.

666
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,880
Well, that proves one thing.

667
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
You don't know me.

668
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Perhaps not.

669
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,760
Trying to kill me again?

670
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,240
Trying to give you a present.

671
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,520
In case you ever need proof
you met an actual ninja.

672
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,960
All right. What's your secret?

673
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,680
What on earth do you mean?

674
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,440
Well, you two must be magicians

675
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,600
considering how badly damaged
the Waverider was

676
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,600
- before we left.
- Oh, that.

677
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,080
Well, Jefferson and I went over
the ship top to bottom.

678
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,760
And safe to say there are no
surprises left on the Waverider.

679
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,600
Great. I'll go prep for takeoff.

680
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,000
So are we gonna say something

681
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,600
about future-Barry's message or not?

682
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,080
Barry was very clear

683
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,120
about the team not knowing
what he told Captain Hunter.

684
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,640
- Except now we know.
- Indeed.

685
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,960
You were right, Jefferson.

686
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,120
Some things you just can't un- see.

687
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,760
I think it's time we said sayonara
to Feudal Japan.

688
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,080
Now, where to next?

689
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,000
I could always open the hatch,
jump out, and see where I land.

690
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,280
I say we just sit back and see
where the timestream takes us.

691
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,120
Aren't you forgetting that
Rex's killer is still at- large?

692
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,320
Not my problem.

693
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,600
I mean, we should find
the bastard and kill him.

694
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
Perhaps we can enjoy
a little takeoff music.

695
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,240
Oh, nice one, Gideon.

696
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,560
<i>Captain Hunter always
enjoyed this song.</i>

697
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
<i>Time...</i>

698
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,760
Speaking of problems.

699
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,800
Don't worry. We're gonna find Rip
and Hourman's killer.

700
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,040
In the meantime,
everyone just shut up

701
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,440
and let me do the flying.

702
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,280
<i>Yes, it is</i>
