1
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,414
Man 1: Go, move out!

2
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,017
Soldiers:
Here comes the king in the north!

3
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,210
The king in the north!
The king in the north!

4
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,295
Here comes the king in the north!

5
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,464
The king in the north!
The king in the north!

6
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,007
Here comes the king in the north!

7
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,732
Man 2: Here comes the king in the north!

8
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,571
Soldiers:
Here comes the king in the north!

9
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,597
The king in the north!
The king in the north!

10
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,001
Here comes the king in the north!

11
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,550
Ser eldrick sarsfield
and lord Desmond crakehall.

12
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,094
Ser eldrick sarsfield
and lord Desmond crakehall.

13
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,012
What are you doing?

14
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,681
I have a list.

15
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,641
A list of people you mean to kill?

16
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,185
For laughing at me?
Do I look like Joffrey to you?

17
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,063
No, death seems a bit extreme.

18
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,065
Fear of death, on the other hand...

19
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,775
You should learn to ignore them.

20
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,736
My lady, people have been laughing at me

21
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,738
far longer than they've
been laughing at you.

22
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,908
I'm the halfman, the demon monkey, the imp.

23
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,410
You're a Lannister.

24
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,830
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor ned stark.

25
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,583
The disgraced daughter
and the demon monkey.

26
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,826
We're perfect for each other.

27
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,340
So how should we punish them?

28
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,842
Who? Whom?

29
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,845
Ser eldrick sarsfield
and lord Desmond crakehall.

30
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,513
Ah!

31
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,017
I could speak to lord varys
and learn their perversions.

32
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,520
Anyone named
Desmond crakehall must be a pervert.

33
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,898
I hear that you're a pervert.

34
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,274
I am the imp.

35
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,837
I have certain standards to maintain.

36
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,948
We could sheep shift lord Desmond's bed.

37
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,034
You cut a little hole in his mattress

38
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,119
and you stuff sheep dung inside.

39
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,247
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

40
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,042
His room will stink,
but he won't know where it's coming from.

41
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,668
Lady sansa!

42
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,129
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

43
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,632
And she was always angry with me.

44
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,675
Why "sheep shift"?

45
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,179
That's the vulgar word for "dung."

46
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,181
My lady...

47
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,599
Well, you asked me.

48
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,310
That's him!

49
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,647
My lord, my lady.

50
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,691
Your father has called
a meeting of the small council.

51
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,368
Killed a few puppies today?

52
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,370
Show him.

53
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,163
Come on, show him.

54
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,877
Pycelle: Oh!

55
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,422
Apologies, my lord. Old fingers.

56
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,225
"Roslin caught a fine fat trout.

57
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,855
"Her brothers gave her
a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding."

58
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,607
Signed, "walder frey."

59
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,446
Is that bad poetry
or is it supposed to mean something?

60
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,490
Robb stark is dead.

61
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,410
And his bitch mother.

62
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,329
Write back to lord frey.

63
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:17,168
Thank him for his service and command
him to send robb stark's head.

64
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,338
I'm going to
serve it to sansa at my wedding feast.

65
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,842
Your grace, lady sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

66
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,344
A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.

67
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,013
Yes, I did.

68
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,016
I'm going to have it
served to sansa at my wedding feast.

69
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,475
Tyrion: No.

70
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,811
She is no longer yours to torment.

71
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,315
Everyone is mine to torment.

72
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,111
You'd do well
to remember that, you little monster.

73
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,071
Oh, I'm a monster.

74
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,575
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

75
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:55,415
Monsters are dangerous,
and just now kings are dying like flies.

76
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,009
I could have your
tongue out for saying that.

77
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,054
Let him make his threats.

78
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,098
He's a bitter little man.

79
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,226
Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.

80
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,315
Unacceptable, disrespectful,
and in very bad taste.

81
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,984
I am the king!

82
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,778
I will punish you.

83
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,074
Any man who must say,
"I am the king," is no true king.

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,826
I'll make sure you understand that

85
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,578
when I've won your war for you.

86
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,958
My father won the real war.
He killed prince rhaegar.

87
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:42,003
He took the crown
while you hid under casterly rock!

88
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,020
The king is tired. See him to his chambers.

89
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,981
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

90
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,024
We have so much to celebrate.

91
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,736
A wedding to plan. You must rest.

92
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,866
Grand maester,
perhaps some essence of nightshade

93
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,327
to help him sleep.

94
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,747
I'm not tired!

95
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,083
Cersei: Come.

96
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,897
Not you.

97
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,699
You just sent the most powerful man

98
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,909
in Westeros to bed without his supper.

99
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,039
You're a fool if you believe he's the
most powerful man in Westeros.

100
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,167
A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.

101
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,878
You really think a crown gives you power?

102
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,842
I think armies give you power.

103
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,510
Mmm-hmm.

104
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,847
Robb stark had one, never lost a battle,

105
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,725
and you defeated him all the same.

106
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,893
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,895
Oh, I know.

108
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,814
Walder frey gets all the credit.

109
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,568
Or the blame, I suppose,
depending on your allegiance.

110
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,156
Walder frey is many
things, but a brave man?

111
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,828
He never would have risked such an action

112
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,289
if he didn't have certain assurances.

113
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,500
Which he got from me.

114
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,127
Do you disapprove?

115
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,088
I'm all for cheating. This is war.

116
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,298
But to slaughter them at a wedding...

117
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,134
Explain to me why it is more noble

118
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,429
to kill 10,000 men in battle
than a dozen at dinner.

119
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,183
So that's why you did it? To save lives?

120
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,436
To end the war. To protect the family.

121
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,189
Do you want to write a song
for the dead starks?

122
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,942
Go ahead, write one.

123
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,612
I'm in this world a little while longer

124
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,407
to defend the lannisters,
to defend my blood.

125
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,952
The northerners will never forget.

126
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,495
Good.

127
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,374
Let them remember
what happens when they march on the south.

128
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,253
All the stark men are dead.

129
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,297
Winterfell is a ruin.

130
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:36,052
Roose Bolton will be named
warden of the north

131
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,890
until your son by sansa comes of age.

132
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,647
I believe you
still have some work to do on that score.

133
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,110
Do you think she'll open her legs for me

134
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,655
after I tell her
how we murdered her mother and brother?

135
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,867
One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.

136
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,244
I will not rape her.

137
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,999
Shall I explain to you
in one easy lesson how the world works?

138
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,960
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

139
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,130
The house that
puts family first will always defeat

140
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,340
the house that puts the whims and wishes

141
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,593
of its sons and daughters first.

142
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,138
A good man does everything in his power

143
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,473
to better his family's position,

144
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,811
regardless of his own selfish desires.

145
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,525
Does that amuse you?

146
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,986
No, it's a very good lesson.

147
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,198
Only it's easy for you
to preach utter devotion to family

148
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,950
when you're making all the decisions.

149
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,869
Easy for me, is it?

150
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,331
When have you ever done
something that wasn't in your interest,

151
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,583
but solely for the benefit of the family?

152
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,252
The day that you were born.

153
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,842
I wanted to carry you into the sea

154
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,928
and let the waves wash you away.

155
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,641
Instead, I let you live.

156
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,311
And I brought you up as my son.

157
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,067
Because you're a Lannister.

158
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,459
Sansa.

159
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,365
It's empty.

160
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,783
Let's find a place to sleep.

161
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,378
Hodor

162
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,506
Hodor

163
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,591
don't, hodor.

164
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,515
Brandon: Maybe we shouldn't stay here.

165
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,600
You'd rather be out there?

166
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,396
There are a lot of
stories about this place.

167
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,898
Horrible stories.

168
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,026
I always quite liked the horrible stories.

169
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,778
So did I. Once.

170
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,326
You ever heard about the rat cook?

171
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,661
No. Who's he?

172
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,205
Just a cook in the night's watch.

173
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:56,044
He was angry at
the king for something, I don't remember.

174
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,172
When the king was visiting the nightfort,

175
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,507
the cook killed the king's son,

176
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:06,262
cooked him into a big pie
with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and bacon.

177
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,433
That night he served the pie to the king.

178
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:16,105
He liked the taste of his son so
much, he asked for a second slice.

179
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,569
The gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

180
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,030
who could only eat his own young.

181
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:29,452
He's been roaming the nightfort ever
since, devouring his own babies.

182
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,666
But no matter what he does,
he's always hungry.

183
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,879
If the gods turned every
killer into a giant white rat...

184
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,382
It wasn't for murder
the gods cursed the rat cook

185
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,176
or for serving the king's son in a pie.

186
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,553
He killed a guest beneath his roof.

187
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,475
That's something the gods can't forgive.

188
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,194
"The late walder frey," old Tully called me

189
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,906
because I didn't get
my men to the trident in time for battle.

190
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,117
He thought he was witty.

191
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,744
Look at us now, Tully.

192
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,665
You're dead,
your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead,

193
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,168
your son spent
his wedding night in a dungeon,

194
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,213
and I'm lord of riverrun.

195
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,675
The blackfish escaped.

196
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,972
An old man on the run with no allies.

197
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,058
I have tywin Lannister backing me.

198
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,351
Who does he have?

199
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,769
As you say.

200
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,815
They all laughed at
me, all those high lords.

201
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,901
They all thought they were better than me.

202
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,612
Ned stark, hoster Tully.

203
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,949
People snigger when I marry a young girl,

204
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,619
but who said a word when Jon
arryn married the little Tully bitch?

205
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,621
You'll be needing a new young girl.

206
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,039
Yeah.

207
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,334
Got that to look foward to.

208
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,794
Hmm.

209
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,590
And you, the warden of the north.

210
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,843
No more starks to bow and scrape to.

211
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,722
Must have been torture following
that stupid boy all over the country.

212
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,391
He ignored my advice at every turn.

213
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,935
If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...

214
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,231
Calling himself
the "young wolf." How's that for pomposity?

215
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,777
Well, here's to the young wolf!

216
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:29,947
Forever young.

217
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,206
Will you move to winterfell
now that the war's over?

218
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,291
At some point perhaps.

219
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,002
But winterfell's in ruins.

220
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,545
Yeah.

221
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,843
What happened up there?
I heard the greyjoy boy seized the place.

222
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:55,806
I heard he killed all the
ravens. And after that, nothing.

223
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,935
I sent my bastard ramsay to root him out.

224
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,315
Robb stark offered amnesty for the
ironborn if they gave us theon.

225
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,067
Oh. And?

226
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,860
Ramsay delivered the terms.

227
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:12,156
The ironborn turned on theon,
as we knew they would.

228
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,201
They handed him over trussed and hooded.

229
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,870
But ramsay, well...

230
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,999
Ramsay has his own way of doing things.

231
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,671
Well, the girls weren't
lying. You had a good-sized cock.

232
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,806
What?

233
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,645
Pork sausage.

234
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,398
You think I'm some sort of savage?

235
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,162
People talk about phantom limbs.

236
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,250
An amputee might
have an itch where his foot used to be.

237
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,168
So I've always wondered,

238
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,050
do eunuchs have a phantom cock?

239
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,804
Next time you think about naked girls,

240
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,682
will you feel an itch?

241
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,025
Sorry.

242
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,486
I shouldn't make jokes.

243
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,699
My mother taught me
not to throw stones at cripples.

244
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,081
But my father taught
me to aim for their head.

245
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,875
Kill me.

246
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,877
Sorry, what?

247
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,047
Kill me.

248
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,383
A little louder.

249
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,761
Kill me!

250
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,975
You're no good to me dead. We need you.

251
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,291
You don't look like a
theon greyjoy anymore.

252
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,836
That's a name for a lord.

253
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,591
But you're not a lord, are you?

254
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,053
You're just meat.

255
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,933
Stinking meat.

256
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,397
You reek.

257
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,192
Reek!

258
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,361
That's a good name for you.

259
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,321
What's your name?

260
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,283
Theon greyjoy.

261
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,457
What's your name?

262
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,588
Theon greyjoy.

263
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,222
Please.

264
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,351
What is your name?

265
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,063
Reek.

266
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,277
My name is...

267
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,488
Reek.

268
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,516
Hodor

269
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,051
- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?

270
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,386
- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?

271
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,430
Gilly. Don't hurt us.

272
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,558
Where are you going?

273
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,103
To castle black.
I'm a brother of the night's watch.

274
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,547
My brother, he's in the night's...

275
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,239
- Who's your brother?
- Jojen: Doesn't matter.

276
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,493
You're Jon's brother.

277
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,106
The one who fell from the window.

278
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,539
No, I'm not.

279
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:17,086
I've been around ghost
enough to know a dire wolf when I see one.

280
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,505
And I've heard all about hodor.

281
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,090
Hodor

282
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,427
I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.

283
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,639
If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.

284
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,891
And anything I can do to help you, I will.

285
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,102
Take us north of the wall.

286
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,069
What? Why in the world
would you want to go...

287
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,321
I don't want to. I have to.

288
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,725
How did you get through the wall?

289
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,951
Does the well lead to an underground
river? Is that how you came here?

290
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,620
Come with us.

291
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,874
There are steps carved
into the south side of the wall.

292
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,792
Hodor can carry you to the top.

293
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,128
We'll walk straight to castle black.

294
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,172
Come with us.
There's nothing north but death.

295
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,677
If Jon is alive,
then castle black's where he'll be.

296
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,679
It's the safest place for you.

297
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,265
There's nowhere
safe any longer. You know that.

298
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,434
Samwell: What I know is what I saw.

299
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,770
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

300
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,190
You saw the white walkers
and the army of the dead.

301
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,776
How do you know all that?

302
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,446
The night's watch can't stop them.

303
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,866
The kings of Westeros
and all their armies can't stop them.

304
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,085
But you're going to stop them?

305
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,670
Please, Sam.

306
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,840
I have to go north.

307
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,344
I have to.

308
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,961
"Balon greyjoy, lord of the iron
islands and invader of the north.

309
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,546
"I give you until the full moon

310
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,257
"to order all ironborn
scum out of the north

311
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:31,720
"and back to those
shit-stained rocks you call a home.

312
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,432
"On the first night of the full moon,

313
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:38,435
"I will hunt down every islander

314
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,563
"still in our lands and flay them living,

315
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:47,736
"the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum I found at winterfell.

316
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,365
"In the box you'll find a special gift...

317
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,077
"Theon's favorite toy.

318
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,872
"He cried when I took it away from him.

319
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,646
"Leave the north now,
or more boxes will follow

320
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,274
"with more theon."

321

Signed, "ramsay snow,
natural-born son of roose Bolton,

322
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,198
"lord of the dreadfort
and warden of the north."

323
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,995
Get that out of my sight.

324
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,087
Theon disobeyed my orders.

325
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,052
The boy is a fool.

326
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,766
He cannot further the greyjoy line.

327
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,771
I will not give up the lands I have seized,

328
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:07,483
the strongholds I have taken.
Get this away from me.

329
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,069
He's your son.

330
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,737
Son?

331
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,866
He's not a man anymore.

332
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,994
He's your son. He's my brother.

333
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,081
He's a greyjoy.

334
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,832
Watch yourself.

335
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,460
I've made my decision.

336
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,884
And I've made mine.

337
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,848
I'm going to pick the
fastest ship in our fleet.

338
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,604
I'm going to choose
the 50 best killers on the iron islands.

339
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,689
Man: Get those ropes!

340
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,400
Yara: I'm going to sail up the narrow sea,

341
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,694
all the way to the weeping water.

342
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,116
I'm going to march on the dreadfort.

343
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,868
I'm going to find my little brother,

344
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,704
and I'm going to bring him home.

345
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,711
What is it?

346
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,421
Dragonglass.

347
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,215
We found them at the fist.

348
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,218
Someone buried them a long time ago.

349
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,012
Someone wanted us to find them.

350
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,724
Why? What are they for?

351
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,189
Killing white walkers.

352
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,983
How do you know that?

353
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,026
Gilly: The Walker came for my baby.

354
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,654
And Sam...

355
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,824
But no one's killed
a white Walker in thousands of years.

356
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,578
Well, I suppose someone
had to be the first.

357
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,955
Take it, hodor.

358
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,505
And the Archer.

359
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,599
I got lucky with one of them.

360
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,434
There are more.

361
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,394
Many more.

362
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,356
And for every one of them,

363
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,442
the dead men,

364
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,111
more than you could count.

365
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,909
I wish you'd come with us.

366
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,703
I wish I could.

367
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,040
I really do.

368
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,172
How are you keeping?

369
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,718
Great. Never better.

370
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,096
It was just a bit of blood.

371
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,015
I should have known.

372
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,352
Every time
a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.

373
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,604
We're not really people to you.

374
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,439
Just ways to get what you want.

375
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,691
I'm not a highborn.

376
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,025
She called you "ser."

377
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,485
I heard it.

378
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,407
A recent state of affairs.

379
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,663
I was born in flea bottom, just like you.

380
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,501
Sure, you were.
You're my friend. You're here to help.

381
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,503
I lived below the street of flour.

382
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,048
How far below?
How close to the red keep were you?

383
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,136
The shit that poured from their privy pipes

384
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,931
flowed down the side ofaegon's hill,

385
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,852
along Tanner's row
and right in front of my front door

386
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,937
- on gin alley.
- Gin alley.

387
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,777
The street of steel,
with your armor and your knights?

388
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,489
You lived in the fancy part of town.

389
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,162
And here we are now.

390
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,000
Two boys from flea bottom
in the castle of a king.

391
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,502
Yeah, we've come a long way.

392
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,672
We're all the same, really.

393
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,759
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

394
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,428
If you mistrust fancy people so much,

395
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,139
why were you in such a hurry to trust her?

396
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,059
You're me.

397
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,519
Never been with a woman.

398
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,314
Never talked to a woman, really.

399
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,857
And then she comes at you,

400
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,027
big words, no clothes.

401
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,196
What would you have done?

402
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:09,743
She does know her way
around a man's head, I'll give her that.

403
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,167
So how'd you become a lord?

404
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,252
Oh. That's a long story.

405
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,172
Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.

406
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,970
Many years ago I helped king
Stannis out of a difficult situation.

407
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,807
He rewarded me with a lordship.

408
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,976
And this.

409
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,980
You see?

410
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,441
Highborns.

411
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:49,866
I didn't want to be a lord.
I nearly didn't accept.

412
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,368
Why did you?

413
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,245
I did it for my son.

414
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,957
I didn't want him to
step over a river of shit

415
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,501
every time he stepped
through his front door.

416
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,588
I wanted him to have a better life.

417
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,508
Does he?

418
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,386
He's dead.

419
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,476
How'd he die?

420
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,021
Following me.

421
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,785
When did you come to this strange country?

422
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,539
When I was 13.

423
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,374
You were only a child.

424
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,086
I stopped being a child when I was nine.

425
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,839
My mother made sure of that.

426
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:51,553
You've been a good
influence on our mutual friend, you know.

427
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,390
He used to drink from sundown to
sunup, visit three brothels a night,

428
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,976
gamble away his father's money.

429
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,895
Now it's just the drinking.

430
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,315
And now I'm his wife's servant.

431
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,818
I brush her hair and clip her
nails and empty her chamber pot.

432
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,821
She is a sweet young thing.
None of this is her fault.

433
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,240
I love that girl. I would kill for her.

434
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,784
Do you think that makes it easier for me?

435
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,120
No, I expect not.

436
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,710
She's young
and she's beautiful and highborn.

437
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:28,089
We break bread with them,
but that doesn't make us family.

438
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:32,260
We've learned their language, but
we'll never be their countrymen.

439
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,848
If you let yourself believe

440
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,100
that a foreign girl with no name

441
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,520
could spend her life with
the son of tywin Lannister...

442
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,938
I have a name.

443
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,356
You have one name.

444
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,860
As do I. Here, only the
family name matters.

445
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,029
What do you want from me, lord varys?

446
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,535
Diamonds.

447
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,496
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

448
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,123
but you know how to protect yourself.

449
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:07,462
Get on one of those
ships. Sail to pentos or lys or myr.

450
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,634
You can buy a house
with these diamonds, a very large house.

451
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,511
Hire servants.

452
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,473
Start a new life, a
good life, far from here.

453
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:23,603
The mysterious foreign
beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.

454
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,855
Why do you want me to leave?

455
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,233
Tyrion Lannister is one
of the few people alive

456
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,652
who could make this country a better place.

457
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,822
He has the mind, the will,
and the right last name.

458
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,198
And you,

459
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,077
you are a complication.

460
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,664
I know you love him.

461
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,585
And I know it's
true love, not bought by gold and silver.

462
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,045
I'm not asking you to leave him for money.

463
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,756
I'm asking you to leave

464
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,928
because your presence
in the capital endangers him.

465
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,640
This will never be your home, my lady.

466
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,644
Find a true home somewhere far from here,

467
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,106
while there's still time.

468
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,442
Lord varys.

469
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,867
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

470
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,127
Keep up.

471
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,047
I don't think I can, my lord.

472
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,676
It's not easy being drunk all the time.

473
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,722
Everyone would do it, if it were easy.

474
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,976
Leave.

475
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,530
So, enjoying married life?

476
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,621
An unhappy wife
is a wine merchant's best friend.

477
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,791
She doesn't deserve this.

478
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,334
Deserve?

479
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,294
Be careful with that.

480
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,382
Start trying to work out who deserves what,

481
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,343
and before long you'll spend your days

482
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,346
weeping for every person in the world.

483
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,808
There's nothing worse
than a late-blooming philosopher.

484
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,687
Will you be facing your
marriage to ser loras

485
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,523
with the same philosophical spirit?

486
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,108
I won't be marrying ser loras.

487
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:38,029
I seem to remember saying something
similar about my own marriage.

488
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,656
You're not me.

489
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,286
You want to make
things better for sansa? Give her a child.

490
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,624
So you can tell father it was you
who finally talked me into it?

491
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,585
So she can have some happiness in her life.

492
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,337
You have children.

493
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,424
How happy would you say you are?

494
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,886
Not very.

495
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,142
But if it weren't for my children,

496
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,769
I'd have thrown myself
from the highest window in the red keep.

497
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,315
They're the reason I'm alive.

498
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,276
Even Joffrey?

499
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,279
Even Joffrey.

500
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:27,912
He was all I had once.
Before myrcella was born.

501
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:35,003
I used to spend hours looking at him.

502
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,757
His wisps of hair.

503
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,552
His tiny little hands and feet.

504
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,181
He was such a jolly little fellow.

505
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,437
You always hear
the terrible ones were terrible babies.

506
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,231
"We should have known.
Even then we should have known."

507
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,775
It's nonsense.

508
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,696
Whenever he was with me, he was happy.

509
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,287
And no one can take
that away from me, not even Joffrey,

510
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,790
how it feels to have someone.

511
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,709
Someone of your own.

512
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,013
How long does it go on?

513
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,602
Until we've dealt with all our enemies.

514
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:39,108
Every time we
deal with an enemy, we create two more.

515
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:44,197
Then I suppose
it will go on for quite a long time.

516
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,496
I'm telling you, that's what she did.

517
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,835
Man 1: Sounded like a cow in heat.

518
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,086
Man 2: Aye, not for long.

519
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,254
Man 3: That's right.

520
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,673
Black walder shut her up right quick.

521
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,592
None of the starks
had much to say about the end of that meal.

522
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,052
I'll tell you what, though.

523
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,722
The hardest thing was getting
that wolf's head to stay on the body.

524
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:10,974
Man 2: You sewed it on?

525
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,267
I did.

526
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,186
I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.

527
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,980
It was me.

528
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,857
And Malcolm and talbott.

529
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,902
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

530
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,445
Took the skin right with it.

531
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,574
What we ended up
having to do was hook the needle

532
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,950
right under the collarbone,

533
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,786
give it a nice firm mooring and...

534
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,541
What do you want?

535
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,792
Mind if I keep warm?

536
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,127
Fuck off.

537
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,004
But I'm hungry.

538
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,466
Does "fuck off' mean
something different where you're from?

539
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,343
I've got money.

540
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,725
What kind of coin is that?

541
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,393
It's worth a lot.

542
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,480
Sorry.

543
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,649
Little shit.

544
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,031
Man: Fooi!

545
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,590
Where did you get the knife?

546
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,216
From you.

547
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,139
Is that the first man you've killed?

548
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,099
The first man.

549
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:41,189
Next time you're going
to do something like that, tell me first.

550
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,953
Valar morghulis.

551
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,235
Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice.

552
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:34,659
You always knew who I was, what I am.

553
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,580
I have to go home now.

554
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,419
I know you won't hurt me.

555
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,006
You know nothing, Jon snow.

556
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,095
I do know some things.

557
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,015
I know I love you.

558
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,103
I know you love me.

559
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,108
But I have to go home now.

560
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,651
I know how this must look.

561
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,073
What I meant was...

562
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,532
I swear to you, my lord...

563
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,856
Aemon: I'm not a lord, my dear.

564
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,120
Not for many, many years.

565
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:08,211
Every man who joins the night's
watch renounces all former titles.

566
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,006
Among other things.

567
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,887
What is your name?

568
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:19,597
Gilly.

569
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,393
For the gillyflower. Lovely.

570
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,813
Yes, my...

571
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,399
Maester.

572
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,735
Master.

573
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,153
Maester.

574
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,198
And the child?

575
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,077
She hasn't chosen a name yet.

576
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,954
His name is Sam.

577
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,042
Aemon: Tarly,

578
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,171
do you remember the oath you swore

579
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,007
when you joined this order?

580
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,094
He's not my child, maesteraemon.

581
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,264
She's one of craster's wives.

582
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,564
I remember every word of the oath.

583
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,442
"Night gathers and my watch begins.

584
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:17,238
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men.

585
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,909
"The realms of men."

586
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,330
That means her as well as us.

587
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:32,837
We didn't build 500 miles
of ice walls 700 feet high to keep out men.

588
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,634
The night is gathering,
maesteraemon. I've seen it.

589
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,721
It's coming for all of us.

590
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,435
Gilly, you and your son

591
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,771
will be our guests for the time being.

592
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:57,737
We certainly
cannot send you back beyond the wall.

593
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,906
Thank you...

594
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,782
Maester.

595
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,118
I can cook and clean and I can...

596
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,578
Good.

597
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,708
Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell.

598
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,841
I hope your penmanship
is better than your swordplay.

599
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,801
Miles better.

600
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:26,140
We had 44 ravens at last count.

601
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,185
Make sure they're all fed.

602
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,355
Every one of them flies tonight.

603
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:43,991
"To his grace

604
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,245
"king Stannis Baratheon.

605
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:51,374
"Invaded... invited

606
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,169
"to the name day celebration

607
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:00,383
"for rylene florent

608
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,177
"on the first nigit..."

609
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,012
Night.

610
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,640
"First night of the full moon."

611
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,100
Why is there a "g" in night?

612
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,935
I don't know. There just is.

613
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,230
Well, your father's
not going to go to that.

614
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,317
My books are better
than these boring scrolls.

615
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,444
You could read about balerion the dread.

616
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,154
They say you can still see his skull

617
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,948
in the dungeons beneath the red keep.

618
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,325
I'd like to see that someday.

619
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:29,620
I've been trying to stay out of
those dungeons my whole life.

620
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,082
"His fangs were as long as bastard swords."

621
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,127
Aye, old balerion's definitely better

622
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,213
than anything your cousin
rylene's got on offer.

623
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:44,385
But now that I'm your father's hand
again, I have to keep him informed.

624
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,930
The king does not have time
for this drudgery.

625
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:53,894
"To all the lords
and knobble men of Westeros..."

626
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,271
Noblemen.

627
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,731
"Noblemen of Westeros,

628
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,568
"the night's watch

629
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,489
"implores..."

630
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,533
What is it?

631
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,582
Why are they ringing the bells?

632
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:16,417
Are we being attacked?

633
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:21,130
Stay here. Bar the door.

634
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:44,111
The usurper robb stark
is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.

635
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,075
And you take credit
because you dropped a leech into the fire?

636
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,868
I take no credit.

637
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,746
I have faith, and my
faith has been rewarded.

638
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:01,420
Your grace, the world has got so far bent.

639
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:05,925
I've seen things crawl out of
nightmares, but my eyes were open.

640
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,301
I don't know if robb stark died

641
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,820
because of the red woman's sorcery

642
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,888
or because at war men die all the time,

643
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,016
but I do know that uniting
the seven kingdoms

644
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,061
with blood magic is wrong. It is evil.

645
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,146
And you are not an evil man.

646
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,899
Do you know who had
this table carved and painted, ser davos?

647
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,402
Aegon Targaryen.

648
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:27,071
And do you know
how aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?

649
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,115
On the back of his dragon,
balerion the dread.

650
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,493
He had a smaller fleet
than the kings he faced

651
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,788
and a smaller army,
but he had three dragons.

652
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,915
Dragons are magic, ser davos.

653
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,335
My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.

654
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,089
I will not forget that.

655
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,300
I will not forgive that.

656
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:53,556
I will punish them
with any arms at my disposal.

657
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,475
You do not need to burn the boy.

658
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,854
If what you say is true,

659
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,815
a drop of his blood killed robb stark...

660
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,609
And our king is
still no closer to the iron throne.

661
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,824
A great gift requires a great sacrifice.

662
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:32,803
His name is gendry. He's a good lad.

663
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:38,392
A poor lad from flea bottom, who
happens to be your nephew.

664
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:47,151
What is the life
of one bastard boy against a kingdom?

665
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,571
Everything.

666
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,741
The boy must die.

667
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,209
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

668
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,420
Is this some kind of trick?

669
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,380
Yes, but not on you.

670
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,554
Aim for that star. Don't stop.

671
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:18,098
There's bread and water. Go slow with it.

672
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:22,520
If you finish it off,
no matter how thirsty you get,

673
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,189
don't drink seawater.

674
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,024
I know not to drink seawater.

675
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,736
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach rook's rest.

676
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,489
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

677
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,074
Where should I go?

678
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,593
You must keep the coast on your left side

679
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,993
until you reach king's landing.

680
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,745
The gold cloaks are looking for me.

681
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,539
They were looking for me for 20 years.

682
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,374
- Do they know your face?
- No.

683
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,960
I'd worry more about the red woman.

684
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,968
The other way.

685
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,224
You ever been in a boat before?

686
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,143
You know how to swim?

687
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,939
Don't fall out. Go on.

688
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,069
Why are you doing this?

689
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,571
Because it's right.

690
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,115
And because I'm a slow learner.

691
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:22,246
When you get to flea bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

692
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,128
Guard: Horse approaching!

693
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,630
Halt! Halt!

694
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,692
Jon! Jon!

695
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,444
Jon, it's us.

696
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,613
I don't think he can see us.

697
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,534
Pyp?

698
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,372
Sam?

699
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,916
Hush, now. You're home.

700
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,296
Carry him inside. Gently.

701
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,532
Out of the way.

702
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,370
Step aside, country
boy. People working here.

703
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,457
Cersei.

704
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,770
You don't deny it?

705
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,316
No. I let him go.

706
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,279
Your mercy saved the boy's life.

707
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,239
You feel good about that?

708
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,824
Aye, I do.

709
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,326
Melisandre: You saved one innocent.

710
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,830
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

711
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,586
There has got to be another way.

712
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,881
What other way?
Tell us about this other way.

713
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,632
Davos: I don't know, your grace.

714
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,634
I can't see the future in the fire.

715
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,641
Very well, ser davos seaworth.

716
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,437
I, Stannis of the house Baratheon,

717
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,957
first of my name, rightful king
of the andals and the first men,

718
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,024
sentence you to die.

719
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,233
Davos: I understand.

720
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,444
But since you haven't
yet unnamed me hand of the king,

721
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,030
it is my duty to advise you against it.

722
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,198
You're gonna need me.

723
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,449
Take him away.

724
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,577
Why am I gonna need you?

725
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,374
My king.

726
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,758
Davos: It's from maesteraemon of the
night's watch. Their lord commander is dead.

727
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,177
Took a ranging party north
and never made it back.

728
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,596
One lad did, though.

729
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,392
What he saw beyond the wall,
it's coming for all of us.

730
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,825
When did you learn to read?

731
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,994
Matthos taught me before he died,

732
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,288
so I could be of better service to you.

733
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,048
This war of five kings means nothing.

734
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,094
The true war lies to the north, my king.

735
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,014
Death marches on the wall.

736
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,600
Only you can stop him.

737
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,019
You can't stop him alone.

738
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,689
You need someone to
rebuild your army for you,

739
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,125
someone to convince
this lord and that lord to fight for you,

740
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,277
to bring sellswords
and pirates to your side.

741
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,445
I've made my decision.

742
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:13,203
He's right. You need him.
He has a part to play in the war to come.

743
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,881
You see, ser davos?

744
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,260
You've been saved
by that fire god you like to mock.

745
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,473
You're in his army now.

746
00:56:56,788 --> 00:57:00,918
They will come, your grace.
When they're ready.

747
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,711
Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.

748
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,633
You didn't conquer
them. You liberated them.

749
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,719
People learn to love their chains.

750
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,560
This is Daenerys Targaryen,

751
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,480
the stormborn, the unburnt,

752
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,525
the queen of the seven kingdoms
of Westeros,

753
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,069
the mother of dragons.

754
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,656
It is to her you owe your freedom.

755
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,128
You do not owe me your freedom.

756
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,215
I cannot give it to you.

757
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,927
Your freedom is not mine to give.

758
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,888
It belongs to you and you alone.

759
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:41,643
If you want it back,
you must take it for yourselves.

760
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:44,438
Each and every one of you.

761
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,948
- Mhysa!
- All: Mhysa!

762
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,200
All: Mhysa! Mhysa!

763
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,911
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

764
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,789
What does it mean?

765
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,625
It is old ghiscari, khaleesi.

766
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,336
It means "mother."

767
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:17,971
It's all right. These people won't hurt me.

768
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,474
All: Mhysa! Mhysa!

769
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,185
- Mhysa! Mhysa!
- Mhysa! Mhysa!

770
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,328
Fly

771
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,599
Let me pass.

772
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,860
- Mhysa.
- Mhysa.

773
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,362
- Mhysa.
- Mhysa.

774
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,613
- Mhysa.
- Mhysa.

775
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,864
- Mhysa.
- Mhysa.

776
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:36,716
All: Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
