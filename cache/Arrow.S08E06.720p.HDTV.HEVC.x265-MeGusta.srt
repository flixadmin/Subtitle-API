1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:02,168
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,336
This place looks exactly
like it did when I was 13.

3
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:06,756
We had planned to come
back here with both of you.

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,340
Yeah. That didn't
really work out.

5
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:09,926
Because I died.

6
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,444
Have you come to doubt
your commitment.

7
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:12,137
To this mission?

8
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:12,637
It might help if I
actually knew why.

9
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,015
The recovery of your universe.

10
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:16,765
Will require a single task.

11
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:19,893
You must betray Oliver queen.

12
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,271
If saving it means going back.

13
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,689
To the person that I used to be,

14
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,399
the what the hell is the point?

15
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,524
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:33,365
Passes it quickly over to the right.
Tark drives the Lane.

17
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,493
Kicks it to aldrich
in the corner for 3.

18
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:39,581
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

19
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:41,582
That's an 8-0 run by the comets,

20
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,417
who have stormed
all the way back.

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,420
To tie it up here
in the fourth quarter.

22
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,088
No way. It tastes the same.

23
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,051
I'm telling you this big
belly burger's just better.

24
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,594
I think he's right.

25
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,304
This is pre-gwespin
foods merger.

26
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,765
Dad, what are you
still doing here?

27
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,432
How did we get here?

28
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,225
What do you mean?

29
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,396
Uh, I was on a roof
with John and Laurel,

30
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,355
and we were tranqed.

31
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:07,067
Yeah. By Lyla.

32
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,319
Dad said it was all just
a big misunderstanding.

33
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,201
Ahem. What did we do with
burov's plan for the weapon?

34
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:19,829
You said we didn't
need it anymore.

35
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,539
Why? The monitor's
still out there.

36
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,040
He's still a threat.

37
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,001
Dad, are you ok?

38
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,253
You... you look like you
don't remember any of this.

39
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,963
I...

40
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,299
I need to talk to John.

41
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:34,259
That should be easy.

42
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:38,139
He's waiting for you at
that fancy fundraiser.

43
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,682
What fundraiser?

44
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:41,725
The one you're very late for.

45
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,478
I mean, you do remember
you're Oliver queen, right?

46
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,031
Hey, queen,
what's the difference.

47
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,991
Between a cop
and the green arrow?

48
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:00,537
A cop doesn't need to play
dress-up to do his job.

49
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,915
Ha. Yeah, sure. Whoa!

50
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:07,376
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Queen.
- It's fine, it's fine.

51
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,836
There you are, man.

52
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:12,298
The party started
an hour ago, Oliver.

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,467
Do you remember getting
tranqed last night?

54
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,263
Yeah.
Uh, Lyla feels awful about that.

55
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,806
By the way,
that wasn't last night.

56
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,015
- That was two days ago.
- What? No.

57
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,977
No, no. That...
John, that is the last thing.

58
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,728
That I remember
before waking up.

59
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,647
In my apartment earlier tonight.

60
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,067
You ok, man?

61
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,945
No. This is... this...
Is this the...

62
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,990
This is the monitor.

63
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,490
- Oliver.
- Your wife is working.

64
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,075
With the monitor, John. What...

65
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,245
I thought we
already settled this.

66
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,831
I have been working with the
monitor but as a double agent,

67
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,125
which I told you on the roof.

68
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,501
I don't... I don't remember that.

69
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,461
I'm not remembering anything.

70
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,688
Oliver, look.
Just maybe you should go home, man,

71
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:53,548
get a little sleep, ok?

72
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,509
Oliver, there you are.
Mayor's looking for you. Come on.

73
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,343
What?

74
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,430
- What happened there?
- Oh.

75
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,806
Can't give a speech
with a stained shirt.

76
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,534
Give a s... what speech?
I'm giving a speech?

77
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:08,937
Very funny.
Your joint remarks with the mayor.

78
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:12,442
Rene, um, serious question.

79
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,110
When did Palmer tech
get rebuilt?

80
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:17,447
You really need to drop
this amnesia routine quick.

81
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,490
This fundraiser is
our only chance to take.

82
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,284
The scpd vigilante
pilot program global.

83
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:23,953
The mayor needs you
to be on point.

84
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,704
- He's waiting for you.
- He who?

85
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,497
Isn't... isn't pollard the mayor?

86
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,334
In her dreams maybe.

87
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,799
What's the matter, Oliver?

88
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,634
You look like you seen a ghost.

89
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,100
Resync from <font color="#D81D1D">kool3ds</font>
- <font color="#00FFFF">RDSop</font> -

89
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,768
So listen. I was
thinking about making.

90
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:48,519
A few changes to the speech,

91
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,189
so I figured I should
run it by you first.

92
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:55,276
This is not possible. This is...

93
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,277
What? Don't tell me
you're scared.

94
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,532
Of a little last-minute
memorization, Oliver.

95
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,951
It's been a while
since I've seen you.

96
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:05,662
Couple of days maybe.

97
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,955
You're looking at me
like it's been years.

98
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,957
No. You're right. A couple days.

99
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:11,918
Right. So listen.
I was thinking.

100
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,711
About adding a line
about, you know,

101
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:16,213
me telling you it was
a bad idea to unmask,

102
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,423
but, you know, maybe
a joke about how.

103
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,009
You'd rather take it
to supermax.

104
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,468
Than take my advice.

105
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,805
Heh. You know?
What do you think?

106
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,932
You know that I went
to slabside?

107
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,016
Uh... yeah. What's that,

108
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,103
your way of saying I should
have come visit more often?

109
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:33,898
Quentin, right before
I turned myself in...

110
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,569
Diaz shot you, right?

111
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,321
Oh. Yeah.

112
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:42,699
That son of a bitch
almost killed me.

113
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,119
Almost died in the O.R.
you don't remember?

114
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,663
I remember it differently.

115
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,832
Well, the doctors
called it a miracle.

116
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,750
I was without oxygen
for so long,

117
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,377
I should have been 6 feet under.

118
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,588
Felt like I escaped
my fate or something.

119
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,466
Hey. There's
something you need to see.

120
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,391
So... there's
a hostage situation.

121
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,144
At the scpd.

122
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,620
The leader's demanding
to meet with the mayor.

123
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,187
No. No. You can't go down there.

124
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,814
We'll call in
a special-ops team.

125
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,942
I'm the mayor. Nobody
does my dirty work for me.

126
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,901
Give my apologies to the guests.

127
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,612
I'm... I'm gonna come with you.

128
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:24,072
Ok, but you might want
to bring a change of clothes.

129
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,617
Because something tells me
we're gonna need the green guy.

130
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,019
Get the feds on the line.
Tell them I need backup.

131
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,836
Here now, right now.

132
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:38,463
What's the situation, captain?

133
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,130
Armed mercs stormed my precinct,

134
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,841
took a dozen of my guys hostage.

135
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,634
How'd they get by your men?

136
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,012
It's a long story that I
don't have time to tell.

137
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,014
The only demand was to
speak to the mayor.

138
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,725
All right. Well, I'll
go talk to them.

139
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,601
I appreciate that,
but there is no way

140
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,228
I'm sending you in there.

141
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:55,812
Listen. I wore the blues
a long time.

142
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,332
Before I wore
this monkey suit, ok?

143
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,774
- I can hold my own.
- I know, sir.

144
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,360
It's not the point.

145
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,985
She's right. It's too risky.

146
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,338
Says the man who risks
his life every day.

147
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,781
For this city?

148
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:07,533
Give me a vest.
I'll go in there,

149
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:09,201
I'll distract
the son of a bitch,

150
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:10,637
and in the meantime,
you sneak around the back.

151
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,538
And do your thing, ok?

152
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,165
The longer this drags on,

153
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,500
the worse it gets.

154
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,877
Let me do this.

155
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,507
I'll have his back.

156
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,925
I want you on comms
the whole time.

157
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:26,134
Sure.

158
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,939
This is mayor Quentin Lance.

159
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,649
I'm unarmed. I'm coming in.

160
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,946
- That's far enough.
- All right.

161
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,240
Just... just take it easy, ok?

162
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,824
Take it easy.

163
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,702
- I'm in position.
- Keep him talking.

164
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,247
You asked for me. Here I am.

165
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:56,850
What do you want to
talk about with me?

166
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,143
You're the mayor. You're a guy.

167
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,168
Who can make things happen.

168
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,896
Why don't you let a few of
these guys go while we talk?

169
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,338
So I can get stormed
by the cops?

170
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,550
No, thanks. I'm not stupid.

171
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,403
But it would show that you
don't want anybody to get hurt.

172
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,886
Because if anybody gets hurt,

173
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,930
you're in real trouble.

174
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,182
Actually,
I think you're already in trouble.

175
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:14,641
I'm the one holding the gun.

176
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,185
Not for long. Put it down.

177
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,146
Agh. Err.

178
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:22,233
This... is... over.

179
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,444
This isn't over until you stop
it, Oliver.

180
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,653
That's the only way out.

181
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,115
What are you talking about?

182
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,324
- No!
- Quentin!

183
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:34,536
Ahh!

184
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,163
Tark drives the Lane.

185
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:38,124
Kicks it to aldrich
in the corner for 3.

186
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:41,334
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

187
00:07:44,004 --> 00:07:45,965
That's an 8-0 run by the comets,

188
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,632
who have stormed
all the way back.

189
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,136
To tie it up here
in the fourth quarter.

190
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,100
88 apiece. What a comeback
for the comets,

191
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,603
and there's a timeout...

192
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,812
No way. It tastes the same.

193
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,583
I'm telling you this big
belly burger's just better.

194
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,024
I think he's right.

195
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,860
This is pre-gwespin
foods merger.

194
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,117
Ooh, dad. What are you
still doing here?

195
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,702
I'm late for a fundraiser.

196
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,161
Yeah. Really late.

197
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:18,875
You want a burger?
Those things never have good food.

198
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:25,757
Did something happen
at the scpd headquarters?

199
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,009
Like what?

200
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,595
Never mind.

201
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,352
Hey, queen.
What's the difference.

202
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,480
Between a cop
and the green arrow?

203
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:43,107
A cop doesn't need to play
dress-up to do his job.

204
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,900
Ha ha ha!

205
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,779
- Ooh! Nice reflexes, Mr. Queen.
- Thank you.

206
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:52,158
There you are. You know the
party started an hour ago, right?

207
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,701
I need to speak with you.

208
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:55,287
Uh, this is gonna sound crazy.

209
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,831
Um... I have been here before.
So have you.

210
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:00,542
What are you talking about?

211
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,311
About the monitor dropping
me into some sort.

212
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:04,921
Of alternate reality
t-t-time loop or something,

213
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,548
where everything is different,

214
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,133
where Lance is still alive.

215
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,842
Oliver, Lance has
always been alive.

216
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,970
No, he hasn't.
You just don't remember.

217
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,681
Because the monitor has done
something to people's memories,

218
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,682
but I... I think I know
the way out of this,

219
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:20,562
but I... I need to stop
a bomb at the scpd.

220
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,438
Oliver, will you just
calm down, man?

221
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,982
If there was a bomb,
we would know about it.

222
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:26,442
Lyla would know about it.

223
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:27,693
Lyla's a part of this.

224
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,361
Part of what?

225
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,715
Oliver seems to
think that he's caught.

226
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:32,157
In some sort of time loop.

227
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,509
If we're traveling back in time,

228
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,993
I'd like to revisit my 20s.

229
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,411
I... I need to speak
with Quentin.

230
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:39,121
They mayor's waiting for me.

231
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:40,581
Yeah. How'd you know?

232
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:42,959
Mr. Mayor.

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,128
Oh. Hey, Oliver. Listen.

234
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,523
I, uh... I made a few last-minute
changes to the speech, so...

235
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:50,759
- We need to talk.
- Sure. Let's.

236
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:53,803
Uh, yeah. I wanted to run
these changes by you anyway.

237
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:56,097
You want to add
a joke about slabside,

238
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,307
about how I would
rather spend time.

239
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,519
In a supermax
than take your advice.

240
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,980
You steal a copy of my
speech or something?

241
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:07,024
We've had this
exact conversation already.

242
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:10,986
What are you talking about?

243
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,323
Fully aware of how
this is going to sound.

244
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:19,037
Quentin, I'm trapped in some sort of...
Time loop,

245
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,832
where the same events just
keep repeating themselves.

246
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:25,000
Like "groundhog day."

247
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:27,837
Sure except this one
ends a lot of people dead,

248
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,048
including the two of us.

249
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,094
Ok. How can I help?

250
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,886
Do you actually believe me?

251
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:38,849
Oliver, I've seen
one daughter die.

252
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,683
And come back to life twice.

253
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:42,537
I've seen another come
from some other earth.

254
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:45,480
I've seen a guy in red run
so fast he can reverse time.

255
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:48,357
This is not exactly
outside the norm, is it?

256
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,653
Also, I'm done learning my
lesson about doubting you.

257
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:53,904
Because that always
bites me in the ass. Heh.

258
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:58,284
What happens now?

259
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,370
Very shortly, we are
gonna learn that.

260
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:03,664
There is a hostage situation
at the scpd.

261
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:07,251
They're going to insist that
they talk to you and only you.

262
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:09,379
And how does it go south?

263
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,715
There's a hidden
explosive device.

264
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,966
That I didn't know about
the first time through,

265
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,011
and judging from the blast,
it's underneath the building.

266
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,264
Ok. So you find it,
you keep us from going boom.

267
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:22,517
- What then?
- I break out of the loop.

268
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,394
Great. Out of the loop.

269
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:27,230
Here you are.
There's something you need to see.

270
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,860
Get the feds on the line.

271
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:33,171
Tell them I need backup now.

272
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:34,696
What's the situation, captain?

273
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:36,239
Armed mercs stormed
the precinct,

274
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,740
took a dozen of my guys hostage.

275
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:43,205
They have a bomb.

276
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,890
We already did a sweep
of the entire building.

277
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:47,459
It's not in the building.
It's underneath it.

278
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,894
How could you
possibly know that?

279
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:53,130
I trust him. Instinct thing.

280
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:54,798
So what do you want to do?

281
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:56,551
This is mayor Quentin Lance.

282
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,346
I'm unarmed. I'm coming in.

283
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,563
Stop right there.

284
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,861
Oh. It's you. Would you relax?

285
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,114
We are both here
for the same thing.

286
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,033
Hey. How did you know
to come down here?

287
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:22,451
I may have learned
about the existence.

288
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:25,205
Of this place as a part
of a former career.

289
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,599
How did you know about the bomb?

290
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:29,000
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

291
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:31,461
Well, actually,
since you're not going to remember anyway,

292
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:35,298
there is a crazy space god who
has me trapped in a time loop.

293
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,634
Yeah? Me, too.

294
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:39,760
It's my second time through.

295
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,136
Same. I wake up in the bunker.

296
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,889
I wake up in my apartment,

297
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,325
so clearly,
the monitor is doing this.

298
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:46,268
- You mean punishing us?
- Yeah.

299
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,645
We are the two people who have
royally pissed him off the most.

300
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,815
In Russia, I disobeyed him,

301
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,692
and you... you tried to
destroy him.

302
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,652
At least we're in it
together now.

303
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,613
I think disarming that
is the way out of here.

304
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,780
How long do you think
until this thing goes boom?

305
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,448
Oh. Your guess is
as good as mine.

306
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,537
Quentin's upstairs
buying us some time.

307
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,538
- Quentin... he's here?
- Yeah.

308
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:11,434
I think we just activated
some kind of failsafe.

309
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,479
Look. We need more time
with the next loop, Laurel.

310
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:15,398
It would probably help if we
found each other faster next time.

311
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:17,107
There's a party at the
Palmer tech building.

312
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,775
- Meet me there.
- Are we talking formal wear or...

313
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,342
Tark drives the Lane.

314
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,511
Kicks it to aldrich
in the corner for 3.

315
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,971
Bingo!

316
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:26,057
No way. It's the same.

317
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,951
I'm telling you.
This big belly burger is just better.

318
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,394
Guess you realized you're late.

319
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:30,477
Something like that.

320
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,457
Hey, queen.
What's the difference.

321
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,025
Between a cop
and the green arrow?

322
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,503
Cop doesn't need to play
dress-up to do his job.

323
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:38,986
Sorry.

324
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,615
Mr. Mayor.

325
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:45,576
Hey, Oliver. Listen.
I made a few last-minute changes.

326
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,162
To the speech.

327
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,722
And you figured you should
run them by me first.

328
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,456
Yeah, exactly.

329
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:53,043
Hey, baby girl.

330
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,836
I didn't think you
were gonna make it.

331
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,672
Me either.

332
00:13:57,714 --> 00:13:59,173
You ok, honey?

333
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,178
I'm just really
happy to see you.

334
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,514
Oh. I'm happy to see you, too.

335
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:09,076
Though I got to say
I'm glad you left.

336
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,410
The black lipstick
at home tonight.

337
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,269
You know that I'm
earth-2 Laurel.

338
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:13,897
Who else would you be?

339
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,416
Look. I'm really sorry
to interrupt,

340
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,067
but you and I need to go.

341
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,902
You're coming with us.
We need your help.

342
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,115
What do you mean there's a bomb?

343
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:25,283
I know how to stop it,

344
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:26,576
but you have to trust me.

345
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:27,994
I'm gonna need a vest.

346
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:29,828
Not this time, Quentin.

347
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,246
This is mayor Quentin Lance.

348
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:36,168
You wanted to talk. Let's talk.

349
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:38,962
The detonator operates
on an oscillating frequency.

350
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,423
If we can find the right one,

351
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:42,801
we should be able to disrupt it.

352
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,344
Vincent, listen to me.

353
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:45,987
I know you don't
really want to do this.

354
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,679
And I know that
if you don't get in here.

355
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,057
These men are gonna die.

356
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,433
I have an idea.

357
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:56,438
We did it.

358
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,774
Ok. Fine. You did it.

359
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:02,004
We stopped the bomb.
What the hell are we still doing here?

360
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:03,947
I don't... I...

361
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:05,532
We must have missed something.

362
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,826
- No!
- No!

363
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,330
No! No!

364
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,125
Tark drives the Lane.

365
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,211
Kicks it to aldrich
in the corner for 3.

366
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:19,504
Bingo!

367
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:33,518
All right.
Quentin's death is the reset point,

368
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,519
which means that.

369
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:37,563
Saving him must be the key.

370
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,481
What kind of sick game
is the monitor playing?

371
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,150
I don't know.
We need to find out.

372
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,110
Who is behind this
hostage situation.

373
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:45,613
If it's just about killing
Quentin, then why plant a bomb?

374
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,407
It seems like a lot
of extra work.

375
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:49,075
Maybe whoever is
behind this wants.

376
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,909
Their involvement kept a secret.

377
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,245
Do you really think there's
a larger conspiracy here?

378
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:54,873
Those were mercenaries, Laurel,

379
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,875
which means that somebody
had to hire them.

380
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,794
Great, and I'm sure they're gonna
be really easy to find, too.

381
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,504
Any idea where to start?

382
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,424
Let's get Quentin out of here.

383
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:06,985
Why don't you take
him to the bunker?

384
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,011
What about you?

385
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,222
I'm gonna go take
a look at that bomb.

386
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,688
Laurel, I didn't think
you'd make it tonight.

387
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,566
I am really not in the
mood for small talk.

388
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,400
With the monitor's bestie.

389
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,195
- Excuse me.
- It turns out tranq darts,

390
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,863
they don't feel so good.

391
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:29,490
I told you that was
a big misunderstanding.

392
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,658
Well, understand this.
The second I get out.

393
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,870
Of this sadistic "edge
of tomorrow" reboot,

394
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:35,746
I am going to make sure
to tell everyone.

395
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:38,249
Exactly what kind of
traitor you really are.

396
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,001
Laurel, I truly have no idea
what you're talking about,

397
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,129
but whatever it is
you're feeling toward me,

398
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:44,755
that's on you.

399
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:47,008
Thank you for
the advice, Dr. Phil,

400
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,967
and now here's some for you.

401
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,946
The next time you decide
to double-cross someone,

402
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,724
don't pick a woman who
specializes in revenge.

403
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,683
You're threatening me.

404
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,437
Yes. Yes, I am, but don't worry.

405
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:01,355
You won't remember anyway,

406
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,273
and by the way, I pull off.

407
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:04,956
The short hair way
better than you do.

408
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,326
What are you doing here?

409
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:19,249
Well, word came down that the green
arrow called in a bomb threat,

410
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,000
so I thought to myself,
"how did he know about that,

411
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,002
and why didn't he call me?"

412
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:26,881
Because the monitor has
me trapped in a time loop.

413
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:28,967
Already told you that.

414
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,819
Ok. Definitely not the
answer I was expecting,

415
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:33,221
but if the monitor's involved,
anything is possible.

416
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,222
Any idea how to break out?

417
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,683
I have to save Quentin's life.

418
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,364
I thought that this
was the key to it,

419
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:41,311
but I'm not finding anything.

420
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:43,314
Well, has to be something.
No case is unsolvable.

421
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,898
This might be impossible.

422
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:46,692
Well, you'll figure it out.

423
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,736
I do wish I was
as sure as you are.

424
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:51,905
You want to know what
makes me so sure? You.

425
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:53,991
You, Oliver.
You always figure it out.

426
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,661
You never stop fighting.
You never give up.

427
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,328
You always keep at it.

428
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,913
Why should this be
any different?

429
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:02,584
Whatever version this is of you,

430
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,127
you still give the best advice.

431
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,897
- Yeah. I'm flattered.
- Well, a.R.G.U.S. Has.

432
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:10,299
Some more sophisticated
analytical equipment.

433
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,011
Any chance you can
get me in there?

434
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:15,930
Yeah. I bet I can make
a few calls.

435
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,268
So you're telling
me we're in some kind.

436
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:23,895
Of a alternate reality based on
the plot of a bill Murray movie?

437
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:27,775
Well, I was gonna go with a
Tom Cruise flick but basically.

438
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:30,694
Also just really glad
that you believe me.

439
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:32,715
Well, it's not the craziest
thing you ever told me.

440
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,449
I mean, I'm just
glad this monitor guy.

441
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,200
Just kept me as mayor, you know?

442
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:42,373
What? What's that look?

443
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:46,376
It... it's just that, uh,
in my world.

444
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:50,757
Or in the real world, uh,
you're not mayor anymore.

445
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,593
Really? Ohh. Pollard.

446
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,220
She always had it
in for me. Heh.

447
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:02,477
There something else?

448
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,895
Laurel. Sweetheart,
I always know when you're.

449
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,314
Hiding something from me.

450
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,582
Please tell me. What is it?

451
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,275
It... it's a year and a half ago.

452
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,318
When Diaz... when he shot you.

453
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:13,904
In... in the real reality
or whatever,

454
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,740
you... you didn't exactly, um...

455
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,829
I didn't recover.

456
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:26,792
No. No. You died to save me.

457
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,423
Best way I could have gone.

458
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,676
What?! I'm sorry.
I basically just.

459
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:39,180
Told you you're a ghost,
and you're completely ok with that?

460
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,557
It doesn't... it doesn't faze you?
You're completely calm?

461
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,019
I always felt like I
cheated death with that one.

462
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,398
Guess that's because I didn't.

463
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,609
Fate's just tricky like that.

464
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:01,243
- It's Oliver.
- Yeah?

465
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,828
He figure out who wants me dead?

466
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,455
Not yet, but he did
figure out the location.

467
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:06,790
Of the mercs' hideout.

468
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,210
Ok. So we better go.

469
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,765
How'd you find this place?

470
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:24,726
Uh, we analyzed the bomb.

471
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,394
And traced the
chemical signature.

472
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:27,686
Back to this building.

473
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:30,064
Interesting.

474
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,481
What?

475
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,317
Your mouth but Felicity's words.

476
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,403
It still doesn't tell us
who hired these bozos.

477
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,029
Maybe this will help.

478
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:53,837
Bomb!

479
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,846
Ohh.

480
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,982
Lyla, what the hell
are you doing?

481
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:16,193
Helping you. You're missing
the point, Oliver.

482
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,278
- What?
- You can't fight this.

483
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:23,910
Lyla!

482
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,561
Passes it
quickly over to the right.

483
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:30,253
Tark drives the Lane.

484
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:32,088
Kicks it to aldrich
in the corner for 3.

485
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:34,967
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

486
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,973
No sign of Lyla anywhere. You?

487
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,683
John just told me
she got called away.

488
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,184
On a last-minute
a.R.G.U.S. Mission,

489
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:47,438
meaning she's never
even been here.

490
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:50,190
Maybe the monitor deleted
her for going rogue.

491
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:51,858
Heh. Wouldn't that
be so, so sad?

492
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,712
She's clearly helping him.
There's no reason for her.

493
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:55,362
To switch sides right now.

494
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:57,573
So why reveal her hand?
It makes no sense.

495
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:59,450
You spoke with her.

496
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,160
Was there anything,
anything at all.

497
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,244
In the conversation
that stood out?

498
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:06,039
She said how I feel
towards her was on me.

499
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,751
Like it's my fault that
I'm stuck here.

500
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:13,547
I told you the monitor's
punishing us.

501
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,257
I'm not so sure.

502
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:17,675
We've had to watch Quentin
die over and over again,

503
00:22:17,718 --> 00:22:19,510
and we can't save him.

504
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:22,388
If I had to design hell,
this would be it.

505
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:25,099
But right before
Lyla disappeared,

506
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:27,435
she told me she was
trying to help me.

507
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:30,939
She also told you
you can't fight this.

508
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,817
It seems pretty clear to me
that we're not supposed to win.

509
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:36,111
The first time
that I met mar novu,

510
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:39,073
it felt... it felt the same.

511
00:22:39,114 --> 00:22:41,426
It was like I was put in a situation
where there was no way out,

512
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,285
but it was a test, Laurel.

513
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:45,412
It was a test just like
I think that this is.

514
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:47,455
- A test of what?
- I don't know,

515
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:49,750
but there is a way out of here,

516
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,667
and I'm gonna find it.

517
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,590
- You just never give up, do you?
- No, I don't.

518
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:56,882
Are you with me?

519
00:22:56,923 --> 00:22:58,842
Fine.

520
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:01,595
What's our play?

521
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:03,471
We go back
to the mercs' hideout.

522
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:04,948
We know where the danger
is this time,

523
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:07,893
so we can do things differently.

524
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:10,686
You grab Quentin,
and I'll meet you there.

525
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:12,064
Ok.

526
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:15,413
So you're telling
me we've been here once.

527
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:17,193
And still came back for more?

528
00:23:17,236 --> 00:23:19,863
At least now we know
what not to do.

529
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:21,406
Ok.

530
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,126
That should disable the bomb.

531
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,170
Well, I certainly hope so
because I am getting.

532
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:37,213
Sick and tired
of getting blown up.

533
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:41,551
Ok. So now what?

534
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:44,471
We find out who hired
those mercs to kill you.

535
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:49,017
Money leads to a man
named Anderson white.

536
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:50,394
Never heard of him.

537
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:52,145
Looks like he's been accused.

538
00:23:52,186 --> 00:23:53,396
Of not too many nice things...

539
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:55,982
Money laundering, racketeering.

540
00:23:56,023 --> 00:23:58,026
Doesn't explain why
he'd want me dead.

541
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,112
Well, that's what we're
gonna find out.

542
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:02,739
Ceo of a company
named global solutions.

543
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,420
They have a warehouse
down by the docks.

544
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,867
Let's go.

545
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:11,957
We need to find white.

546
00:24:19,464 --> 00:24:24,303
No! No! I got you.

547
00:24:24,344 --> 00:24:26,680
Come on, come on.

548
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,809
I'll take care of the rest.

549
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:35,897
Err! Ugh.

550
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,941
Oh, I'm sorry, baby girl.

551
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:39,609
Looks like we lost this round.

552
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:44,780
No. No! I am not
letting you die again.

553
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:47,534
- It's too late.
- No.

554
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:51,163
It... it's... it's time
to say good-bye.

555
00:24:51,204 --> 00:24:53,248
I'm not giving up
on you, Quentin.

556
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:55,625
Quentin, I am not
giving up on you.

557
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,503
You never gave up on me.

558
00:24:58,545 --> 00:25:01,006
You believed in me
when nobody else did.

559
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:05,051
Well, that's what
dads do. They believe.

560
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,929
I want you to know that you.

561
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,765
Are the reason that I'm
trying to be a hero.

562
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:11,557
It's because of you.

563
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:18,315
Sweetheart... you are a hero.

564
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:21,567
You are.

565
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:23,403
Thank you.

566
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:25,905
Thank you.
I never had the chance to tell you.

567
00:25:25,948 --> 00:25:27,699
How much you mean to me.

568
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:32,663
- Well...
- Thank you.

569
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:35,039
I think you just did.

570
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,502
I love you. I love you.

571
00:25:56,185 --> 00:25:58,521
Good-bye.

572
00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:01,275
Damn it.

573
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:04,027
All right. Ok.
All right, Laurel.

574
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:06,363
We fix this next time.
We'll fix it.

575
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:12,702
I can't do this again.

576
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:14,704
I'm done, Oliver.

577
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:17,039
All I have ever wanted
was a chance.

578
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:19,000
To say good-bye to Quentin.

579
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:23,880
Now I have.

580
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:28,384
Tark drives the Lane.

581
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:30,345
Kicks it to aldrich
in the corner for 3.

582
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:33,472
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

583
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:37,644
Laurel?

584
00:26:39,688 --> 00:26:41,522
Laurel!

585
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:53,326
She's not here.

586
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:55,287
- Where is she?
- Gone.

587
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:57,455
What did you... what
did you do, Lyla?

588
00:26:57,497 --> 00:26:59,726
I didn't do anything.
Laurel got what she needed from this.

589
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,500
I don't have time
for these games, Lyla,

590
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:04,171
so whatever this is,
get me out of here right now!

591
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:05,588
I can't do that, Oliver.

592
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:07,298
Mar novu needs you
to understand.

593
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,343
No good will come from struggle.

594
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:11,970
The only way to win is
to accept the inevitable.

595
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:14,221
I have no idea what that means.

596
00:27:14,263 --> 00:27:17,017
Learn that, and this will end.

597
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:21,605
Lyla!

596
00:27:23,027 --> 00:27:25,028
So if me dying is the problem,

597
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,756
maybe bringing me into the
lion's den isn't so smart.

598
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,633
Couldn't think of a better
way to keep you safe.

599
00:27:28,657 --> 00:27:30,241
Yeah. That makes sense.

600
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:31,493
Huh!

601
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:35,623
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Unless you want a hole for a head.

602
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:37,916
Are you Anderson white?

603
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,669
You really think
Mr. White would be here?

604
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,128
He ordered a hit
on my friend. Why?

605
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,385
I guess the clock's ticking.

606
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:53,223
Looks like a list of hits.

607
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:54,974
And clients.
Coded and anonymous.

608
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:56,477
White's just the middleman.

609
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,354
A ceo with a healthy
side business brokering.

610
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:00,021
Hits for wealthy asshats.

611
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:01,981
All right. We're back
to square one.

612
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:03,668
We have no idea how deep
this rabbit hole goes.

613
00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:05,486
We got to get going.

614
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:13,911
Unh!

615
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:31,261
Get down! Get down!

616
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:37,809
Hey. You ok? You all right? Ok.

617
00:28:37,852 --> 00:28:39,353
No time. Come on.

618
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,567
Come on.

619
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:46,443
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

620
00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:47,862
Whoa!

621
00:28:51,615 --> 00:28:53,701
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

622
00:28:58,329 --> 00:28:59,874
Go, go, go.

623
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:21,644
Let's go.

624
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:23,396
Get down, get down!

625
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:34,991
Over there!

626
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:44,876
Ohh. Oh, it's the last one.

627
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:46,711
How many arrows you got left?

628
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:50,883
Not enough.

629
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:53,093
Oh, boy. Aren't we the couple?

630
00:29:53,134 --> 00:29:55,471
We are gonna find
a way out of this.

631
00:29:55,512 --> 00:29:57,347
There has to be a way to fix it,

632
00:29:57,388 --> 00:29:59,141
and we are gonna
find it, Quentin.

633
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:00,869
It doesn't matter how many times.
We're gonna find it!

634
00:30:00,893 --> 00:30:02,769
Heh heh. Yeah? Sure.
What's it gonna be,

635
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:05,021
60 times, 100 times?

636
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:07,273
It's gonna be however
many times it takes!

637
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:14,030
You know, getting
hunted like this.

638
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,574
In a space like this
is kind of like.

639
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:17,451
What I was doing to you
all those years ago.

640
00:30:17,492 --> 00:30:19,036
Remember?

641
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,291
Ohh. Oof.

642
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:27,687
Sort of makes sense I'd go out
like this now, don't you think?

643
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:29,587
Would you please just
save your strength.

644
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:33,384
For what?

645
00:30:33,424 --> 00:30:35,885
Oliver, you take care
of these guys,

646
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:37,136
there'll be more behind them,

647
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:38,406
there will be more behind them.

648
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,723
There is no saving me from this!

649
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:45,311
Ok? You ever think
that's the point?

650
00:30:45,354 --> 00:30:49,023
Maybe you're not supposed to.

651
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:52,653
I'm not giving up...

652
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:55,280
And you're not giving up either.

653
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:58,325
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not giving up.

654
00:30:58,366 --> 00:31:01,202
Maybe I'm giving in.

655
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:04,874
You see, I've been outrunning
death for a while now.

656
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:07,750
The siege, the island,

657
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:11,797
but when Diaz shot me,
that felt different.

658
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:16,634
Like I was finally at the end,

659
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:18,887
and I made my peace with that.

660
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:26,353
And maybe it's time
you did, too.

661
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:37,990
It looks like fate's knocking.

662
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:40,366
Just... just...

663
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:42,912
You just get ready to move.

664
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:58,426
I'll see you
on the other side, Oliver.

665
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:05,058
Quentin.

663
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:13,236
Passes it
quickly over to the right.

664
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:14,820
Tark drives the Lane.

665
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:17,115
Kicks it to aldrich
in the corner for 3.

666
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:20,451
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

667
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:22,327
Drives down the Lane.

668
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:26,207
Beautiful pass
to the big man underneath.

669
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:29,126
Puts it up off the glass,
and it's in for two.

670
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:30,920
Inbound pass to the other p...

671
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:56,278
No way. It tastes the same.

672
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,656
Dad, what are you
still doing here?

673
00:32:59,699 --> 00:33:04,244
Hey, guys.
I'm just heading out the door.

674
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:06,830
Wanted to let you know,
all of you know.

675
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:12,295
What a... just what a gift.

676
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:14,588
Getting to know
you all has been.

677
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:17,133
Dad, you're going
to a fundraiser.

678
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:18,968
It's not like you're
going into war.

679
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:20,511
Heh heh.

680
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:22,888
Although I guess I can
see the similarities.

681
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,766
I think he's talking
about crisis.

682
00:33:29,144 --> 00:33:32,190
I'm just really proud
of all you guys.

683
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:33,775
I'm really proud.

684
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:38,488
I got to go.

685
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:39,864
Dad...

686
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,287
You're gonna be fine.

687
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:48,539
So are you.

688
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,416
All of you will be.

689
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:52,961
Whatever happens.

690
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:00,927
Hey, queen.
What's the difference.

691
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:03,554
Between a cop... hey!

692
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:14,231
Quentin, excuse me.

693
00:34:14,273 --> 00:34:15,775
Yeah.

694
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:17,110
What's the matter, Oliver?

695
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,027
You look like you've
seen a ghost.

696
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,072
Maybe I did.

697
00:34:21,114 --> 00:34:23,199
May I speak with you
for a second?

698
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,867
Sure.

699
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,996
Uh, yeah, you want to
go over the speech?

700
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:30,664
Because I was thinking
about adding a few lines.

701
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:34,876
I have a question for you.

702
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:37,005
Sure.

703
00:34:37,045 --> 00:34:40,675
Back when I was running
around as the hood,

704
00:34:40,717 --> 00:34:42,217
you were trying to arrest me.

705
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,653
- You remember that?
- Heh heh heh.

706
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:45,972
Ah. Yeah. The good, old days.

707
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:48,141
How could I ever forget?

708
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:50,101
The question is...

709
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:54,896
What made you decide
that I wasn't.

710
00:34:54,938 --> 00:34:57,608
Your enemy anymore?

711
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,862
What changed your mind?

712
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:05,699
Heh. Oh, you know,
my daughters for one.

713
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:07,409
Because I didn't raise dummies,

714
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:09,178
and, uh, you know, if
they were ok with you,

715
00:35:09,202 --> 00:35:11,789
then I figured I should be, too.

716
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:16,210
- Yeah.
- They trusted me,

717
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,836
and you trusted them.

718
00:35:17,878 --> 00:35:19,356
Yeah. They got me to listen
to what I always knew.

719
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,632
In my gut, that we were
on the same side.

720
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:23,760
And fighting for the same goal,

721
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,929
and it just took me
a while to get there.

722
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,639
Sorry.

723
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:30,682
It's ok.

724
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:32,309
Oliver, is there
any particular reason.

725
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:34,353
For this trip down memory Lane?

726
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:35,771
Yeah.

727
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:41,610
God, I've been hanging
on to something.

728
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:46,114
Someone told me
just recently that,

729
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:49,994
uh... it's about time
I made peace with it.

730
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:56,668
Ok. Sounds like a smart someone.

731
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:02,215
Yeah.

732
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:09,097
Oh, I shouldn't have to
say good-bye to you again.

733
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:12,516
Good-bye?

734
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:15,603
Evening's just getting started.

735
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:17,230
Yeah.

736
00:36:19,731 --> 00:36:23,360
Thank you, Quentin
for everything.

737
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:26,905
Mr. Mayor.

738
00:36:26,947 --> 00:36:28,591
We're gonna see each other
again, Oliver.

739
00:36:28,615 --> 00:36:30,076
Mr. Mayor!

740
00:36:31,952 --> 00:36:33,413
Ahem.

741
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,125
I hope so.

742
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:04,777
Congratulations, Oliver.

743
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:06,528
Now you understand.

744
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:11,909
I couldn't change
Quentin's fate.

745
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:17,248
I can't change
mine either, can I?

746
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:19,958
No. I'm sorry.

747
00:37:22,961 --> 00:37:24,713
Why did the monitor go to all.

748
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:27,925
Of this trouble just to...

749
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,510
Just to prove a point?

750
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:31,262
You've always been
a man who needed to.

751
00:37:31,304 --> 00:37:33,389
See things for himself.

752
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:36,476
Telling you wouldn't
have been enough.

753
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:38,478
How long have you
worked for him?

754
00:37:38,518 --> 00:37:39,811
A while.

755
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:42,273
You lied to us, Lyla.

756
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:43,858
You...

757
00:37:45,902 --> 00:37:47,402
You lied to John.

758
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:48,905
Keeping this from John has been.

759
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:50,423
The hardest thing I've
ever had to do.

760
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:51,907
Then why do it?

761
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:53,992
The same reason you left
Felicity and Mia.

762
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:57,038
In that cabin...
To protect my family.

763
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,206
Do you honestly
believe that working.

764
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:02,168
With the monitor is the
best way to do that?

765
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,795
It's the only way.

766
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:06,422
The crisis is coming.
There is no stopping it.

767
00:38:06,463 --> 00:38:08,548
All we can do is
try to survive it.

768
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,217
Ok. Help me out here, Lyla.

769
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:12,969
I don't even know what it is.

770
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:18,099
I know, but you will... soon.

771
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:19,811
What I can tell you.

772
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:21,497
Is there is an evil coming
that is greater.

773
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:23,940
Than anything we've
ever had to face.

774
00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:30,403
Can we stop it?

775
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:33,240
I don't know...

776
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:35,576
But you are the only
chance we have.

777
00:38:38,746 --> 00:38:40,831
So everything I've done.

778
00:38:40,873 --> 00:38:44,460
From the moment
I left that cabin,

779
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:47,797
this has all been some...

780
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:49,590
Bigger part of a test?

781
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:51,842
He needed to be sure
you were ready.

782
00:38:51,884 --> 00:38:54,762
He's just been sending
me on useless missions.

783
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:56,179
They weren't useless.

784
00:38:56,222 --> 00:38:58,516
The dwarf star particles,
Dr. Wong,

785
00:38:58,557 --> 00:39:00,434
even the antimatter weapon,

786
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:02,061
they all have a purpose,

787
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:04,396
just not the one
you were expecting.

788
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:13,114
Why did he involve my children?

789
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:15,199
Time is a gift.

790
00:39:20,746 --> 00:39:22,248
What now?

791
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,083
You complete your final mission.

792
00:39:27,168 --> 00:39:29,130
I'll see you there.

793
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:47,188
Ohh.

794
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:48,733
Where are we?

795
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,695
You ok?

796
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:55,864
I have a killer headache.

797
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:59,452
The last thing that I
remember is Quentin...

798
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:02,538
Dying in that warehouse.

799
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,748
I was wearing these on the roof.

800
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:08,793
When we got tranqed,
so does that mean that...

801
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:10,795
We got out.

802
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:13,590
How?

803
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:15,342
We learned our lessons.

804
00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:18,137
I got out after I said good-bye.

805
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,931
Why would the monitor let me
see Quentin one last time?

806
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:25,978
It was a reward
for not betraying me.

807
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:28,563
Didn't really think
rewards were his brand.

808
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:32,443
No. We were wrong about him.

809
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:35,445
And Lyla was right?

810
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:37,572
That's annoying.

811
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:39,909
So why did you have to
learn to let Lance go?

812
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:44,038
Because deep down,
I still believed.

813
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,498
That I could fight my fate.

814
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:51,753
Now I know I can't.

815
00:40:57,385 --> 00:41:00,721
Lyla said we had
one last thing to do,

816
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:03,014
one final mission.

817
00:41:03,056 --> 00:41:05,101
I can't wait to find
out what that is.

818
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:10,106
Where that is.

819
00:41:10,146 --> 00:41:12,190
We're not in star city anymore.

820
00:41:15,402 --> 00:41:16,737
Dad.

821
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:20,907
You ok?

822
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:22,451
Where the hell are we?

823
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:28,373
We're on lian yu.

824
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,000
