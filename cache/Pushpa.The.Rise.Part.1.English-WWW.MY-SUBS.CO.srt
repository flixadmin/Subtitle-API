1
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:18,946
This story begins in Japan

2
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,404
where the sun rises first on the earth

3
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:27,321
This is a rich Japanese wedding…

4
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,779
It’s a custom here for groom to gift something to bride

5
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:36,529
This is not about Japanese wedding or their customs

6
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:39,654
Do you see that violin? It is about this.

7
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:58,696
It's costs is eight lakhs…

8
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:02,237
The reason is, it is made of seldom available wood

9
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:05,821
You will not find this wood anywhere around here.

10
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:20,987
But, it must be smuggled from China by sea.

11
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:23,612
Shanghai port, China.

12
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:27,404
That wood was transported by this ship.

13
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:36,404
It came from Chennai travelling thousands of miles.

14
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:50,946
They were loaded onto ships by these lorries

15
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,779
The place in the world where we can find red sandalwood...

16
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:04,237
Seshachalam forest, Rayalaseema.

17
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:09,696
Surprisingly this plant doesn't grow
anywhere else than here on the earth.

18
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:11,612
That is the reason why it costs so much.

19
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:17,946
This is the gold growing on earth,
it's name is red sandalwood

20
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:41,946
This red sandalwood is being smuggled abroad from here.

21
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,821
Truthfully this story is not about Redsandal wood

22
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:59,321
It's about a labourer who became
a part of smuggling syndicate

23
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:01,196
Are you wondering what is a labourer?
Don't take him lite

24
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:09,862
A guy like you and me would be everywhere,
but a guy like him is rare like the red sandalwood.

25
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:13,821
You are escaping right in front of police…
Who are you?

26
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:16,529
Get down.. get down...
get down.

27
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:41,362
We have met after long time.
How you doing?

28
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,362
Hope you are doing good.

29
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:47,237
That’s ok.

30
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,737
Why trouble between us.

31
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:53,196
I will give you Ten thousand.
Will you leave me?

32
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:54,862
Ten Thousand.

33
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,154
Bribe? Are you trying to bribe
Tamilnadu Police Is It?

34
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:04,654
Sir, he's trying to bribe us ten thousand, sir.

35
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:14,987
Twenty Thousand!

36
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:28,862
Thirty thousand!

37
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:42,321
Forty thousand!

38
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,237
Fifty thousand!

39
00:05:57,612 --> 00:06:00,446
Fifty thousand!

40
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:21,446
One Lakh!

41
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:32,029
I meant is one lakh per head

42
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:36,071
What I’m saying is one lakh per head.

43
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:09,821
Brother… Are you Tamil?

44
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,362
What is your name?

45
00:07:12,654 --> 00:07:13,821
Pushpa!

46
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:16,987
Hardcore Telugu

47
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:34,821
Everyone’s story starts with his birth.

48
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:37,737
But my story has begin after I met him.

49
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:42,946
Don’t stay there gossiping
while you go and have tea.

50
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:45,779
Come fast. We have lots of work. OK?

51
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:09,237
Who is he? Is he your Son in law..
sitting as if he owns the place.

52
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,071
My Name is Kesava... this is the first time I've met Pushpa

53
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:18,196
Who is that guy? Sitting cross legged?

54
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:21,071
Hey…what is this?

55
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,154
How can you sit cross legged,
when owner is asking..?

56
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,446
Don’t you have manners?

57
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:27,196
What?

58
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:33,112
This leg is mine and this leg is mine..
and i kept my leg on my leg.

59
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:34,946
Did I put my leg on the owner or what?

60
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,571
Does he want me to work or give him respect?

61
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:41,321
You must change your behaviour
if you want to work here.

62
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:43,237
You cant behave as you want

63
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:44,529
Is it so?

64
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:48,279
It’s not possible to change my behavior
so how about changing the owner

65
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,279
Give me my wages

66
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,071
I will leave.

67
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:58,196
This is enough for what I have done.

68
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:04,154
Give this to your owner and ask him to go
and buy manners in the market if available.

69
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:07,487
Hold this!

70
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:14,154
This fellow will either rule the world or go to dogs.

71
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:17,862
Hey…Where are you going?

72
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:20,737
I’m also changing the owner.

73
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:23,862
I want to see what he becomes.
-Where are you going?

74
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,904
Hey Parvatamma.
How many days will you escape like this?

75
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:38,654
I gave you money during last Ganga fair.

76
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:40,529
Forget the principle,
till now you haven’t even paid the interest.

77
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,612
Didn’t I tell you Reddappa that I will pay back next month?

78
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:46,571
You are postponing every month saying next month.
How many times should I come to your house?

79
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:51,446
Shameless people…. Shameless people.

80
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:54,279
Reddappa. Don’t shout.
The whole Village is listening.

81
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:56,987
I am shouting so that everyone can listen.
At least then they will feel ashamed and repay.

82
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,571
She is a widow. Is that the way to talk to her.

83
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:00,529
widow? So what?

84
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:01,946
She has a son as grown as a buffalo at home.. right.

85
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:04,029
Isn’t he a man? Doesn’t he have hands and legs?

86
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,529
No Reddappa, My boy has joined for work in the mill.

87
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:08,196
He will pay whatever he earns month after month to you.

88
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:09,237
What will he repay?

89
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:11,821
Everyone in the village know that
your son has left the work long time back.

90
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,196
What is this son?
Is Reddappa telling the truth?

91
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:19,487
Have you really left work at the mill?
How will we survive without work.

92
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:21,321
I am asking you.

93
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,904
Listen Parvatamma. Forget this.
I will come tomorrow morning.

94
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,529
I want you to reapy every penny ,

95
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,154
If not, this time I will not shout
standing in front of your house...

96
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:30,404
will do it from your roof top I will shout in front of everyone.

97
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:33,237
Drink… Neither son is listening nor the buffalo.

98
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:42,654
Principle Three thousand and
Interest Three thousand six hundred.

99
00:10:42,654 --> 00:10:44,362
Total Six thousand six hundred.

100
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:45,571
The account is settled. bye.

101
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:48,654
Glad that your account is settled.
How about mine?

102
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:49,987
Your Account?... What account?

103
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:53,321
Entire village got to know that we have took a loan from you.

104
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,654
Now , Shouldn’t all of them know that we have repaid?

105
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:56,904
Isn’t it simple?

106
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:59,696
Hello Gurappa, Venkatadri Pushpa has repaid his loan.

107
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:01,529
Ok I take leave now

108
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:04,612
Yesterday there were so many people at the Ration Shop.

109
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:06,071
Who will tell all of them?

110
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:07,571
What do you say now?

111
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,612
Gurappa get me the list of Who all were there yesterday?

112
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,946
A total of 106 people were there.

113
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,196
Pakala Ravi

114
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:14,446
Chalapathi

115
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:15,612
Munemma!

116
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:16,446
hey.. Stop.

117
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:18,237
Do you expecting me to inform all of them now?

118
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:19,612
I won’t.

119
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:25,112
Kondal Rayudu!

120
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:28,237
Listen Kondalrayudu… Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

121
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:30,071
Has he repaid?
-Yes. He has repaid the entire loan

122
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:32,487
Bainapalli Subbalakshmi, Batyala Alivelu...

123
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:35,237
Pushpa has repaid his entire loan.

124
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,112
Pushpa... Inform Venkata Subbamma also.
She is leaving for Dubai in the evening.

125
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,237
Hundred rupees work…
-Thousand rupees work.

126
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:44,279
I have to go... I will pay money evening.

127
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,446
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

128
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:50,237
What is this hundred-rupees work?
And what is thousand rupees work?

129
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:52,071
This is legal, so Hundred rupees only.

130
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:54,779
That is illegal. More money and more risk…

131
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,154
Thousand rupees work…Thousand rupees work.

132
00:11:56,154 --> 00:11:57,654
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

133
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:00,154
Come fast.. Thousand rupees work.

134
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:05,362
Hundred rupees work…Hundred rupees work.

135
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:09,404
Hey…why are you going that side? If we go that side,
there is no surety that we will come back home by evening.

136
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:12,487
I don’t have much work in the evening anyway.
So I’m going.

137
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:14,862
Stop... Stop... vehicle stop.

138
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:17,529
Get on to the vehicle... come on...

139
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,321
Hey ... please let our parents know
if I am not coming back.

140
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:45,821
Hey, get down quickly.

141
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,112
Move on... move on...

142
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,237
Move!

143
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:53,654
Move... move...

144
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:00,612
To hell with this rain!
Get going.

145
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,696
Hey, come fast.

146
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:07,654
Quickly... we need to cross over the hill till the evening.

147
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,112
Bro, Is this your first time ?
-Yeah bro.

148
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:10,987
What's your name?

149
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,696
Will they pay us after the work is done?

150
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:18,529
Where are you all going?

151
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:24,237
We put in so much effort to flick this,
and you want to hand over it to the police just like that?

152
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:27,237
I have an idea.
Come here, I will tell you.

153
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:34,697
Taskforce DSP Govindappa!

154
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:37,655
He's nightmare for Red sandal smugglers

155
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:41,322
After he took charge,
coolies realised that life more important than money

156
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:46,530
If anyone has to cut the trees or smuggle the goods out of
the forest it can be only after he takes a nap.

157
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,280
Ey.. What are you people doing here?

158
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,280
We came to graze the sheep... sheep

159
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:01,530
Where are the sheep then?

160
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:04,655
Sheep have gone into the forest to graze…

161
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,530
How many sheep are you grazing?

162
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,364
How many sheep do we have?

163
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:12,322
around two hundred I guess.

164
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:13,905
We will have two hundred sir.

165
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,489
What work does Shepherds have with the axe?

166
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:24,947
They came to graze the sheep
and I came to kill the tiger if it comes...

167
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:29,697
Hey… Is this the way to speak to DSP sir?

168
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:30,947
Don’t you have manners??

169
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:34,822
of course, we have respect, that’s why we hid the logs.

170
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:38,030
Otherwise, we would have moved them out
of the forest in front of you.

171
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,947
Then you would have really lost respect?

172
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,822
Hey what are you staring at?

173
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,405
Tiger is caught. Wrap it!

174
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,530
Don’t act smart? Where are goods?

175
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:52,572
Where are goods?

176
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:57,280
I thought you are man who came to catch the goods

177
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:01,030
Didn't know you came to catch whatever come in your way.

178
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:12,780
Hello Sir.

179
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,530
You have just 6 bullets.

180
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:19,364
I have sixty axes around me.

181
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:22,489
We will OUTNUMBER you.

182
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:26,072
Sir, Look at their faces.
They are all looking like rouges.

183
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:27,614
Not now.
We will come back again.

184
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:30,322
He is giving good advice.

185
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,489
If you listen to him, it will do good for all of us.

186
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,072
I plead you sir... please come back sir.

187
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,197
They are strong only when they are in the forest..
Where can they go, sir.

188
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,822
Let's go sir...
we will nab them when they come out.

189
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:47,822
Look like they will take out the hidden stock in front of us.

190
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:49,114
We will lose our respect it that happens, Lets go sir.

191
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:48,947
Leaf lives on Sunlight to grow

192
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:53,322
The Goat eats away leaves to be alive

193
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,739
And a tiger hunts goat to survive

194
00:17:58,197 --> 00:17:59,864
Isn’t it the power of Hunger?

195
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:02,072
Isn’t it the power of Hunger?

196
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:11,072
The tiger perishes in death
the death dissolves in time

197
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:15,614
And the time surrenders before Kali
This is a great hunger

198
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:24,114
The hunted knows it should run faster
And the hunter knows he should outrun his prey

199
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:29,197
If the hunted wins, it will live another day
And the hunter knows, it should win to survive

200
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:35,905
Life for one
May mean death for another

201
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:40,905
Goat has to find a place to hide
if it doesn’t want to be the next lunch of the tiger

202
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:11,322
A Worm is a bait to catch fish
Grains are used to trap the bird

203
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:16,072
A piece of Meat can lure the dog into danger Survival is the hook for human beings

204
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:24,655
In the festival to please a god
Chicken and sheep gets killed

205
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:29,155
The knife gets smeared with blood
And even a goddess can’t escape from a bait

206
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,364
This is the fate of the world

207
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:43,947
If you are not alert, the bait will catch you
You can only survive if you have a hunger to gobble the bait

208
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:52,864
A hungry man can’t see right or wrong
Only the fittest will survive here

209
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:58,530
Goat has to find a place to hide
if it doesn’t want to be the next lunch of the tiger

210
00:20:22,364 --> 00:20:24,239
Somireddy- 21 kilogram

211
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:25,572
Okay bro.

212
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:30,072
It is the same wage that I paid last time also

213
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:31,405
Go...

214
00:20:32,822 --> 00:20:35,405
Jayachandrudu-28 KG
-Take what I paid for and leave.

215
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:45,489
Brother. I will be with you.

216
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,322
What?

217
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:48,697
I will be with you brother.

218
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:51,989
What do I have with me, except this beedi.

219
00:20:53,155 --> 00:20:54,114
Who are you?

220
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,322
Missing finger.

221
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:56,822
My real name is Kesava.

222
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:59,739
Since I don’t have one finger,
everyone calls me missing finger.

223
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:01,322
What is the matter?

224
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:04,030
Brother, do you remember Muni Madhav
from that timber depot?

225
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,989
He said that you will become a great man.

226
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,030
Is that so?

227
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:12,530
I somehow want to earn lot of money
and go back to my village.

228
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,822
I think I can earn fast if I’m with you.

229
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,280
what ? so you want me to become
a great man for your sake.. uh?

230
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,155
I thought of myself.
But you will become big.

231
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,697
How much do you want to earn?

232
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,114
Ten Lakhs

233
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:34,655
That's it?

234
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:38,655
Ok, go fetch my wages of Thousand rupees

235
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:40,072
Okay Brother.

236
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,239
Hey missing finger, Didn’t you collect your money already?
Why did you come again?

237
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:45,989
Not for me. I came for Pushpa’s wages.

238
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,405
I have loaded his log just now.

239
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:49,239
Pushpa? Who is he?

240
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:56,864
There.. that guy sitting cross legged under
the tree, and smoking a beedi.

241
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,322
He is a coolie him self.
And you are his coolie is it?

242
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:06,489
He could be sitting under a tree today,
The day he gets an opportunity he will rule the country.

243
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,239
Remember that.

244
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,197
Get lost you coolie fellow.
-Hey police.

245
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,947
Hey useless fellows….

246
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:21,322
You have twenty guns and forty bullets around you.
We will OUTNUMBER you.

247
00:22:21,614 --> 00:22:24,697
No one will survive even if one person moves.

248
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:27,822
Stay where you are.

249
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,489
Hey, throw

250
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:39,655
Come on... throw.

251
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:42,072
Hey, they coming closer... throw it.

252
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:58,197
Run.. run... run...

253
00:22:58,197 --> 00:23:01,114
If you are caught by police
no one will come to save you.

254
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,739
I've pinned all my hopes on you.

255
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:08,905
Police are attacking from all sides
Run away from here.

256
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:07,905
Stop it… Stop

257
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:13,905
Where is the Lorry?

258
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,405
What sir?

259
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:18,864
Why do you always catch my collar and not the goods?

260
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,739
Lets go to the station and talk..
It's hot here.

261
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:29,697
I won’t move my leg.
You go.

262
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:39,614
Where is the lorry? speak!

263
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:43,655
Speak, speak out!

264
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:44,947
Water...

265
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,447
Water…

266
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:54,364
He made the Lorry disappear right in front of our eyes.

267
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:56,864
Searched everywhere.
But couldn't find the lorry

268
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:04,239
Not for me Sir.

269
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:06,030
Give it to him.

270
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:08,572
He is so tired of beating me.
Poor guy.

271
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:11,905
Drink Sir.

272
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,489
Where did you hide the goods tell now…?

273
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:21,197
My boss won’t spare me if I tell you.

274
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,405
Boss?

275
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:23,822
Who is that?

276
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:26,989
Who else? It’s me only.

277
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:31,155
No one is born in Chittoor district,
who can tell me..

278
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,780
not yet.

279
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,822
you call yourself Boss.

280
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:40,947
And you are laughing?

281
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,155
Laughing…

282
00:25:42,364 --> 00:25:44,947
You have no respect for Police…

283
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:46,197
laugh...

284
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,572
Are you the boss?
-Sir!

285
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:51,905
I know how to stop his laugh Sir.

286
00:26:00,822 --> 00:26:02,364
What is your name boy?

287
00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:06,905
We need to file the case, right?
What’s your name?

288
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,030
Pushpa!

289
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:12,405
What’s your full name?

290
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:17,239
Pushpa…

291
00:26:17,822 --> 00:26:19,030
Pushparaju…

292
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,489
Then what’s your Surname?

293
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:24,822
Surname? Don’t know?

294
00:26:32,322 --> 00:26:35,405
One that is written in front of the name.
I’m asking what is it?

295
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:37,405
Don’t know?

296
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:39,947
What are you thinking?

297
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,655
We all have it.
Don’t you have one?

298
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:45,447
Surname?

299
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:48,239

00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:03,739

302
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:05,739
Silence!

303
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:08,072
Boy... What is your name?

304
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,739
Pushparaju

305
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:11,072
Pushparaju

306
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:12,114

00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,072
Molleti…

308
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:16,364
Molleti…
-Molleti Pushparaju

309
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:17,364
What is your father’s name?

310
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,239
Molleti Venkata ramana...

311
00:27:27,405 --> 00:27:28,364
What is this?

312
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:31,197
Will you just write whatever anyone says?

313
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:33,697
Won’t you verify the details?

314
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:40,947
Just because my father visited their house
few times, will our surname become theirs?

315
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:51,072
Can’t you differentiate kids born out of wedlock
and the ones born to a mistress?

316
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:55,155
Surname belongs to the ones born legally...

317
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,197
not to hybrid fellows.

318
00:28:03,322 --> 00:28:05,280
Rey... Come here.

319
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,905
What is your name?

320
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,364
Molleti Pushparaju!

321
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,655
Just because my father slept with your mother,

322
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,572
you can’t inherit our surname.

323
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:25,739
You don’t have a surname.

324
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,239
Your name is just Pushparaju.

325
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,197
Pushparaju.

326
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:33,905
Now say, what is your name?

327
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:36,155
Pushparaju!

328
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:38,697
Pushparaju!

329
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:40,280
Say loudly so that everyone can hear.

330
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,697
Pushparaju!

331
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:07,322
What is this brother?
They have beaten you so badly

332
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,572
Won’t they beat if you hide the Lorry?

333
00:29:10,864 --> 00:29:12,947
Am feeling hungry.
Let’s talk while eating

334
00:29:12,947 --> 00:29:14,989
What is this? Look at all those injuries.

335
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:16,447
Hey, be quiet.

336
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:17,989
Go man…

337
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,447
Brother, what is there to eat.

338
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:23,572
Subbanna…
Jakkareddy, Jollyreddy brothers are coming

339
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,364
These are red sandal smugglers…
Brothers of Konda Reddy.

340
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:30,572
Konda Reddy brothers are three.

341
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:32,739
Third one is Jaali Reddy

342
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,530
Unless he feels the feminine air,
he will not be able to breath.

343
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:39,947
If his eyes falls on any girl,
he make sure that se will loss her virginity.

344
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:45,905
It doesn't matter whom the girl marries,
she has to spent her first night with Jaali reddy.

345
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:46,614
Brother...

346
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:52,197
Obulu is very lucky that
Jalli Brother has gifted 5000 rupees to his marriage.

347
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,405
Second one Jakka Reddy…

348
00:29:56,947 --> 00:29:59,072
Amongst the three he's the one with brains.

349
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:03,530
He takes care of the whole business.

350
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:05,864
He is big support to Kondareddy.

351
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,655
He is Kondareddy, the eldest brother.
he is a factionist

352
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:20,447
In the riots at Siddhavatam,
he chased six of them and slayed them.

353
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:24,739
Believes in only Revenge over life
so threw a bomb at them.

354
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,072
After that he takes care of the
whole business with his single hand.

355
00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:31,447
If the police caught us, I thought no body will come to save us.

356
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:34,030
but now I see the owners themselves have turned up.

357
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,739
Now I understood what Pushpa has planned.

358
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:38,072
Hope all is well…

359
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:39,780
I am fine but..

360
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:42,239
Heard that you didn’t tell them whose goods
they are, even after police torturing you badly.

361
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:44,155
Looks like you have a lot of spunk.

362
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:45,655
Bro…

363
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,655
Their salary is less than 5 thousand per month.

364
00:30:48,864 --> 00:30:50,614
What will I get if I tell them?

365
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:54,405
A broken beedi .. but you are different…

366
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,280
Are you asking money to tell where it is…
Coolie fellow…

367
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,197
Jaali?

368
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:02,030
How much do you want?

369
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:04,447
You can’t give me what I want.

370
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,239
just, give me five lakhs

371
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:08,697
Five lakhs!

372
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:11,947
Who will give him 5 lakhs?

373
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:14,780
If we give him some nice thrashing,
he will reveal everything..

374
00:31:15,864 --> 00:31:16,822
What is that laugh?

375
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:18,989
This guy was laughing like this the whole night

376
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:22,864
40 Laathis broke, but the laugh didn’t go away..

377
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:25,822
finally we got fed up and stopped.

378
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:27,447
My thrashing will be different.

379
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:30,030
Jaali, first let him tell the stock whereabouts

380
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,322
You stay silent.

381
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:33,447
Okay!

382
00:31:34,322 --> 00:31:37,114
I will pay the money you want.
Tell me where the goods are

383
00:31:37,489 --> 00:31:41,447
You won’t understand if I say, let me show you…

384
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:48,030
See.. my hands are cuffed..
How can I show like this..?

385
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,114
He is asking us get him a bail..
Did you get it?

386
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:53,947
Looks like your brother is smarter than you...

387
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:57,280
anyways pay for what I ate and call a lawyer.

388
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,739
Hey Jaali

389
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,905
Are you telling us, just because we are not doing anything.

390
00:32:01,072 --> 00:32:02,739
Do you know who are you speaking to?

391
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
Konda Reddy Brothers.

392
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:05,780
I will kill you and burry you.

393
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:10,739
Then who will tell you where the goods are ?
Konda Reddy?

394
00:32:21,197 --> 00:32:23,197
What is this? Why did he bring us here?

395
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,447
can see only fields around.

396
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,489
Rey, looks like these coolie fellows sat in a car
for the first time.. go open the door

397
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,447
Brother, door is struck.
It’s not opening….

398
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,780
What’s the hurry?

399
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:35,489
That's how you door opens?
-This way!

400
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:49,989
Where is the lorry, Bro?
I see nothing but a well here.

401
00:33:13,572 --> 00:33:17,114
What is this? Why did you destroy the Lorry
so badly, it is of no use now.

402
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:21,739
Bro, give us the money, our money

403
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:23,780
Hey, give them the money.

404
00:33:24,114 --> 00:33:26,155
Here is 5 lakhs…

405
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:29,072
go and enjoy with your brother.
have fun…

406
00:33:30,947 --> 00:33:32,697
Never seen so much money bro…

407
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:35,614
Can repay all debts and
bring the buffalo back home.

408
00:33:36,322 --> 00:33:37,864
Whoever had said it, said it right.

409
00:33:37,864 --> 00:33:40,072
‘if I am with you, I can make 10 lakhs just like that brother.

410
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,364
Hey Where are you coming?

411
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,114
I don’t have the habit of sticking to the women once I use her.

412
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:52,072
Take this hundred and come in an Auto Rickshaw

413
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,822
Come bro. We have an auto here.

414
00:33:58,989 --> 00:34:01,655
Hey Driver… will you drop us at Rangampet..?

415
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:03,447
What will be the price of that vehicle?

416
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:05,364
You mean, that Car…bro?

417
00:34:05,364 --> 00:34:06,030
Ya…

418
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,155
It should be around 5 lakhs bro

419
00:34:07,322 --> 00:34:09,114
Does that car cost 5 lakhs!

420
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,155
Isn’t it too expensive.

421
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:11,864
Yes Brother.

422
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:15,280
Go and buy that car.

423
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:17,030
Bro...

424
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,489
Go and buy that car.

425
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,447
What are you talking bro?

426
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,614
We came here in a car when we didn’t have a penny on us.

427
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,364
Would it look good to go in an Auto
when we have so much money?

428
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,947
Go and get that car

429
00:34:31,614 --> 00:34:34,864
Brother, please understand. If we buy the car,
all the money will be spending on the car.

430
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,322
We won’t have anything left with us.

431
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:37,905
Then we will have to go and work for daily wages again.

432
00:34:37,905 --> 00:34:39,447
And will we go for daily wage work in a car or what?

433
00:34:41,197 --> 00:34:45,197
Hey, I came here in car,
and I will leave only in a car from here.

434
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:47,572
Till then I won’t move from here.

435
00:34:47,572 --> 00:34:48,697
Listen to me Bro…

436
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,947
Hey… I will not budge an inch in this matter.

437
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,364
Hey, who is that honking?

438
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:03,030
Do you think your mother owns this road?

439
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,114
Roll down the window.

440
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:06,655
I want to see who the hell you are...

441
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,989
It’s me. Your son from the hell…

442
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:12,280
Oh, is that you… Pushpa

443
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,697
What are those injuries on your body?

444
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:19,864
You are seeing the small, small injuries on my body,
but can’t see the big car in front of you.

445
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:24,489
What kind of work are you doing..?
Whose car is this?

446
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:26,905
It is Parvathamma’s..

447
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:28,739
Which Parvathamma?

448
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,655
Pushpa’s mother.

449
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:32,447
That’s me.

450
00:35:32,614 --> 00:35:34,489
Then, It’s your car.

451
00:35:34,572 --> 00:35:38,489
But, I can’t understand how you bought this car.

452
00:35:38,822 --> 00:35:41,072
Seeing your difficulty in fetching water,
Brother bought this car for you.

453
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,697
Who the hell are you?
-Keshava Aunty.

454
00:35:46,697 --> 00:35:48,155
Pushpa, why did you bring me here?

455
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:53,947
Whose car is this Maa?

456
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:55,530
Hey wait!

457
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,614
Hey wait!

458
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,739
Uncle?

459
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:10,447
Daddy.. Uncle has bought the car

460
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,530
The one who buys a car becomes car owner… not your uncle.

461
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:17,447
Come in

462
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:22,489
Did you see that car, Mohan?
Where did he get so much money to buy?

463
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:26,864
What else can you expect from a ragpicker?
Obviously through stealth.

464
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:31,864
Hey looks like Mangalam Seenu Brother
has come. Go and see.

465
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,114
Brother, Namasthe…

466
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:35,280
Namasthe, Namasthe

467
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,197
Bro, just by spending five lakhs,
I am not only got a car, am also getting respect with it.

468
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:44,405
why are you staring like that, man?
Jakkareddy bro called us. So we came in our car.

469
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:51,030
Sit Bro… Now we are qualified to sit here.

470
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:55,030
don’t want, again have to stand up
when Konda Reddy comes.

471
00:36:55,364 --> 00:36:57,030
I can’t give so much respect to him.

472
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,614
True, bro.

473
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:02,614
How many loads?

474
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,072
Around 12 loads, Brother

475
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:10,697
How could you guys go and surrender
3 crores worth of stock to DSP Govindappa?

476
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:14,530
Don’t we have anyone who can transport
the load by hoodwinking Govindappa?

477
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:16,822
He is catching us in whichever way we go.

478
00:37:17,114 --> 00:37:20,864
It is not possible to send a load when he is around.

479
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:24,239
It’s crazy why you are over-praising Govindappa here.

480
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,739
Like a restless lady who throws in the towel with her neighbor.

481
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:28,072
Leave it - its all beyond your ability.

482
00:37:28,322 --> 00:37:29,489
Who the hell is he?

483
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:30,905
He is a coolie fellow.

484
00:37:31,322 --> 00:37:36,197
What the hell, Just because you came in a car
you think you earned a right to speak in this meeting.

485
00:37:36,197 --> 00:37:36,989
Get out…

486
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:41,572
Brother, he is the same guy whom we got out on bail, Pushpa.

487
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,739
I only asked him to come along.

488
00:37:42,822 --> 00:37:46,322
Are you the one who hid our load
and collected five lakhs from us?

489
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:51,405
Five lakhs are not for hiding the load Sir.
It’s for protecting you and your brothers from going to jail.

490
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:53,405
As if you don’t know…

491
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:56,822
it is not a big deal to get beaten by Police.

492
00:37:57,197 --> 00:38:00,197
Speak if you have guts to transport the load without getting caught.

493
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:03,614
You need an idea for transporting the load.
Not guts…

494
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:06,739
Yes brother.
what our people are doing is...

495
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:11,655
Covering the load with Tomatoes and Watermelons.
They move the fruits, they see the load..

496
00:38:11,864 --> 00:38:16,197
Forget Govindappa, Our load can be found
even by a useless Gurkha also.

497
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:20,822
We have to send the load but no one should know.
I have an idea. Should I tell?

498
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,905
You want to tell us how to transport the load.

499
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,822
Everyone See, who has come to give us ideas.

500
00:38:26,822 --> 00:38:27,780
Coolie fellow.

501
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:30,697
say what you think. Say.. say…

502
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:33,614
Is this a pickle to share with the entire world?

503
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:36,114
Ideas brother...
how can I say it Infront of everyone...?

504
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,405
How dare you?
you are asking, us only to go out.

505
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:41,905
wait Jaali.

506
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:49,530
Hey!..I better like what you say..
if not this kondareddy will deal with you differently.

507
00:38:49,905 --> 00:38:52,197
All of you go out.

508
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:57,530
Hey stop..

509
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:00,447
check him..

510
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,905
what sir.. Looks like you are suspecting me.

511
00:40:03,155 --> 00:40:07,030
After your thrashing, I have stopped all old businesses
and started milk business now.

512
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:10,739
Yes Sir, We have taken contract with Kalahasthi Khova Shop

513
00:40:11,072 --> 00:40:13,155
Yes Sir, there is milk only here sir.

514
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:16,780
we mixed water in the milk,
now don’t tell me you are going to arrest us for that also.

515
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,822
Let him go.

516
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,864
Give some Kalahasthi Khova to Sir.
We will go and come sir..

517
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,072
Where was he hiding all these days?

518
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:29,280
Give him… Give him all the load and
you be around to supervise.

519
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:34,114
I can do the complete the work all alone.
Just tell me what you will pay me.

520
00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:35,239
your rate only Pushpa.

521
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,239
We will pay you what we paid last time..
5 lakhs per load. Is it Ok?

522
00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:43,447
Five lakhs is not okay.
Give me 4 percent.

523
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,822
4 percent would mean 4 lakhs.

524
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:47,655
You will lose one lakh.

525
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:51,030
You can keep that one lakh to yourself,
just pay my 4 percent.

526
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:56,072
What is this bro?

527
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:58,572
He was willing to pay 5 lakhs..
One lakh is our loss.

528
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:03,739
If we had taken five lakhs, we would have been their servants.

529
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:08,739
By taking 4 percent, won’t we become his partners.?

530
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:15,739
Now, Kondareddy and we are Partners..
Partner Pushpa here.

531
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,155
You are very smart brother.

532
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:25,614
Hey, why is everyone looking at the sky like that?

533
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:26,739
Looking for the sparrows.

534
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:28,239
What?

535
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,239
For Sparrows

536
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:30,405
But…Why?

537
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,614
Bro… see that girl sitting there,
wearing a red saree?

538
00:41:33,614 --> 00:41:34,489
That girl…

539
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:37,197
She says she won’t sell milk unless she hears a Sparrow.

540
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:40,114
With such a big work in hand,
what is this sparrow nonsense man?

541
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:41,614
Who is that mad girl?

542
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:43,364
It’s my daughter.

543
00:41:43,822 --> 00:41:46,364
She doesn’t listen to anyone. Even mine.

544
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:50,447
I named her after my mother,
and she is just like her in everything

545
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:55,030
Hey, Srivalli... let's fill the milk into the tank.

546
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:21,530
You turn away both your eyes when I look at you

547
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:26,030
And cover your glances with your eyelids

548
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,072
You stare at even an invisible god without blinking an eye

549
00:42:31,072 --> 00:42:34,989
But you are ignoring me when i’m in front of your eyes

550
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:42,822
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your word has become as rare as a ruby

551
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:51,739
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems

552
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:02,572
What Sir? Why are you pawing with Lathis?
Its only milk, Sir!

553
00:43:02,572 --> 00:43:04,739
What Sir? Can't we do business?

554
00:43:04,864 --> 00:43:06,447
We are a reformed lot now.

555
00:43:20,614 --> 00:43:28,697
Me, who used to lead in everything
Is following you wherever you go now

556
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:37,614
Me, who never bent my head before anyone
Has bent my head to look at your anklet

557
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:42,572
After having lived such a great life,
Am now making rounds of your house

558
00:43:42,572 --> 00:43:47,030
And thought it's enough
even if you look at me for an instant

559
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:51,447
Did She see?
-No bro…

560
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:54,655
Did you see properly?

561
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:57,822
I have seen brother.
She didn’t even see once.

562
00:44:00,197 --> 00:44:01,947
I think you are very happy, right?

563
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:03,614
for what, bro?

564
00:44:03,655 --> 00:44:05,030
because she didn’t see.

565
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:06,405
Why will I be happy bro?

566
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:13,364
No.. you are feeling happy, eating that peanut candy happily
and saying, she hasn’t looked even once.. I noticed it.

567
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:15,489
No bro, I’m feeling bad inside.

568
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:20,405
ok. She didn’t see.
What would you have lost if you had said, she saw once..

569
00:44:20,947 --> 00:44:22,822
at lest I would have felt happy Isn’t it..?

570
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:25,572
I didn’t get that idea bro. Sorry bro…

571
00:44:25,572 --> 00:44:28,280
You won’t get that idea.
Why will you get any idea that makes me happy?

572
00:44:28,322 --> 00:44:35,614
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your word has become as rare as a ruby

573
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:44,530
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems

574
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:21,655
All Your friends are average looking
May be... That's why you look beautiful

575
00:45:22,155 --> 00:45:30,614
And when one becomes 18
It's not just you, any girl would look cute

576
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:35,655
When red sandal wears a saree
Even a stone would look like a princess

577
00:45:35,697 --> 00:45:39,447
And, when a seven stone earring is worn
Any girl would look beautiful

578
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:40,739
Bro...

579
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,322
Now loading is done. Shall we go?

580
00:45:42,947 --> 00:45:43,989
Shall we go?

581
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:45,155
Yes, Bro.

582
00:45:45,447 --> 00:45:48,822
Is that all? Should we go?

583
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:52,572
What else? Loading is done.
So, Let’s go. That’s it

584
00:45:53,947 --> 00:45:55,947
Do you find all this funny?

585
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:57,405
Why bro?

586
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,405
You know it and you are still asking

587
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:00,947
I seriously don’t know brother.
I don’t know

588
00:46:00,947 --> 00:46:04,697
You know I didn’t come for the load,
but came here for that girl.

589
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:06,780
You know it and you are still saying
that we should leave.

590
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,280
Ok.. lets leave then.. come..
-brother.. brother..

591
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,572
you can stay here as long as you want..
I will also stay with you.

592
00:46:12,572 --> 00:46:17,197
I will stay… I will stay and you too stay with me,
and tell me if she is looking at me.

593
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:20,989
Did she see ?

594
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:21,739
Yes, Brother

595
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,155
She is looking at you only while washing the vessels.

596
00:46:24,155 --> 00:46:26,114
Is it true..?

597
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:31,572
You are lying to make me happy, isn’t it?

598
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,697
Yes Brother

599
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,614
How can you agree so fast man?

600
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:40,364
You could have let me feel happy for
some more time...

601
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,905
I think it is better I go and
beg her to look at me instead of dealing with you

602
00:46:43,905 --> 00:46:47,489
Bro, don’t do that brother
-I will go and beg her, to look at me

603
00:46:47,489 --> 00:46:49,780
Please don’t do that brother.

604
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,822
I know, there is no use talking to you..

605
00:46:52,322 --> 00:46:55,572
but for the last time,
tell me if she is looking at me or not

606
00:46:57,197 --> 00:46:58,572
I don’t know what to say brother.

607
00:46:58,572 --> 00:46:59,905
I told you to tell me that she is looking at me…

608
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:07,905
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your word has become as rare as a ruby

609
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:16,780
Your looks have become as pricey as gold Srivalli
Your smile has become as precious as nine gems

610
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,822
Hello Sir!

611
00:47:56,614 --> 00:48:01,364
What happened sir? It’s the usual milk.
Why are you checking today sir?

612
00:48:06,947 --> 00:48:13,030
What is this? I can hear milk sound on the top
and the sound of the wood below.

613
00:48:13,905 --> 00:48:15,739
Are you hiding any load underneath?

614
00:48:16,572 --> 00:48:17,447
Catch him… Catch him

615
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,155
Sir, Sir Leave me Sir. It’s mistake sir..

616
00:48:20,155 --> 00:48:22,489
Sir Leave me Sir. It’s mistake sir.

617
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:26,239
Sir, please leave us sir...
we are just labour sir.

618
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,072
This is all because of Pushpa sir...
We did as Pushpa said.

619
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,030
Please leave us sir.

620
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,280
There is one condition if I want to leave you.

621
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,864
All these days you did as Pushpa said.

622
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,614
Now you must do as I say.

623
00:48:41,655 --> 00:48:42,405
What?

624
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,405
Fifteen for Hundred...
Fifteen for Hundred...Fifteen for..

625
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:48,989
Hello Brother. Please stop.

626
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,655
How much do you have?
-We need six tickets

627
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,864
We have Two hundred and seventy...
We want 6 tickets.

628
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:54,614
270?

629
00:48:54,655 --> 00:48:58,405
For the kind of money you have,
you can only wish to watch. Not watch. Please leave

630
00:48:58,405 --> 00:49:01,822
What should we do? How can we see the movie?

631
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,572
Hey girls, you are the girls from the milk center. Am I right?

632
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:04,697
-Yes we are, So what?

633
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:06,447
Just wanted to check if you could got the tickets

00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,155
Come girls...

635
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:09,489
How can we buy a ticket,
when they sell Fifteen rupees ticket for One hundred rupees?

636
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,489
It is the price one has to pay for big brothers movie..
how much are you short?

637
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:13,905
We are short by four hundred

638
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,655
Is that so, I will give you that money
if you do a work for me

639
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:18,780
What is that? What should we do?

640
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:21,655
You have a friend named Srivalli, right?
-Yes, of course

641
00:49:21,822 --> 00:49:23,447
Ask her to look at our Pushpa once

642
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,572
Hey .. hey.. Srivalli...
Come here.

643
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:27,447
What?

644
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,155
That guy.. Pushpa. can you look at him once?

645
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:30,030
Who is Pushpa?

646
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,197
The guy who keeps sitting at your milk center.
Do you remember?

647
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:35,197
He sits cross legged with a dark guy next to him

648
00:49:35,614 --> 00:49:37,614
Hey girl, his name is Keshava and it’s me

649
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:39,072
Ask her she will see him or not...
-You stop man.

650
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,489
He looks good girl. Please look at him once.
- Is he so good looking?

651
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:46,447
So, if we have to watch chirajeevi,
then I have to look at him.. Ok.. Ok

652
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:47,780
I will.. I will

653
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:49,572
Okay.. okay. She will.
- Yes

654
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:51,155
Ok. Take this

655
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,905
Who is she?

656
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:56,905
Who brother?

657
00:49:56,989 --> 00:49:58,947
You meat that girl in brown color saree??
-Yes

658
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,864
I will find out

659
00:50:01,947 --> 00:50:04,322
Hey girl. One more thing..
- What?

660
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:07,697
You said you will look at him just now.
Why don’t you smile at him too?

661
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:09,864
What is this smile business? I wont smile

662
00:50:09,905 --> 00:50:12,864
If you don’t smile...
- No... No. She will smile It’s only a smile.. right.?

663
00:50:12,864 --> 00:50:13,989
You buy tickets.

664
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:15,447
Where do we met?

665
00:50:15,905 --> 00:50:20,072
Ask him to come the Temple tomorrow
- Smile... ask her not to forget the smile

666
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,030
Bro, the priest said that the girl will look
at you if perform Abhishekam.

667
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,239
That’s why I brought you

668
00:50:27,447 --> 00:50:31,030
I don’t believe in all these

669
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:34,697
Bro, look here.
Srivalli is coming. Our prayers worked

670
00:50:36,072 --> 00:50:39,322
So, what if she comes?
She doesn’t look at me. Come... Let’s go

671
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:40,989
Where do you want to go? Stay back brother.

672
00:50:40,989 --> 00:50:42,697
Hey, getting late ask him to see her.

673
00:50:43,614 --> 00:50:45,697
He is there, look at him once.

674
00:50:45,864 --> 00:50:48,239
She doesn’t look at me. It’s a waste
Let's go.

675
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:50,239
(Girls whispering)
I am looking but he is not looking at me.

676
00:50:50,322 --> 00:50:51,780
Stop bro. I had paid thousand rupees

677
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:52,822
What?

678
00:50:52,864 --> 00:50:55,447
To the priest. Our money will go waste..

679
00:50:55,447 --> 00:50:57,072
Look at him...

680
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:02,280
This is the last time. If she doesn’t look at me,
I won’t look at her ever again in my life..

681
00:51:02,322 --> 00:51:04,864
Ok Bro. This is my last word. Fast & Final

682
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:11,947
Look at him... see him.

683
00:51:12,905 --> 00:51:13,697
You wait!

684
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:18,989
Srivalli is looking at me

685
00:51:19,614 --> 00:51:22,030
Smile at him

686
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,030
Smile!

687
00:51:23,197 --> 00:51:24,822
Is she looking at you?
- yes

688
00:51:24,947 --> 00:51:27,030
Keep smiling...

689
00:51:27,155 --> 00:51:29,155
Girl, are you smiling?
- I’m smiling.

690
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:31,905
Hey.. She is smiling at me too

691
00:51:32,364 --> 00:51:34,614
Did she smile or not ?

692
00:51:34,697 --> 00:51:36,322
She is smiled at me

693
00:51:36,572 --> 00:51:38,197
That’s the power of Thousand rupees

694
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:39,614
you also smile back..

695
00:51:40,947 --> 00:51:41,864
Yes, I too smiled

696
00:51:41,905 --> 00:51:45,364
It’s enough for these faces. Let’s go now
-They paid thousand rupees only. Let’s go

697
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,655
Now I understood.

698
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:54,864
She didn’t see me when I was looking at her.
And I didn’t see her when she was looking at me.

699
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:59,489
When she caught me looking at her,
while she was looking at me.. she burst out laughing

700
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:00,197
Oh! Is it?

701
00:52:00,364 --> 00:52:01,989
I know that she loves me

702
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:03,947
That’s why I was behind her.

703
00:52:04,447 --> 00:52:05,572
Come. Let’s go and speak to her once

704
00:52:05,614 --> 00:52:09,114
Where do you want to go? Don’t forget who you are..
You can’t bend before her

705
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:11,072
We should take first step in these situations.

706
00:52:11,114 --> 00:52:12,905
Don’t go brother
-You don’t know.

707
00:52:12,905 --> 00:52:14,364
You wait, man.

708
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:17,280
Hey Srivalli... Srivalli.

709
00:52:19,114 --> 00:52:20,739
Why were you smiling at me ?

710
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,697
do you like me?

711
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:26,822
When did I like you?

712
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:28,697
Then why were you smiling at me?

713
00:52:28,905 --> 00:52:30,530
Wont I smile when I am paid..

714
00:52:31,072 --> 00:52:32,239
Money?
-Yes

715
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,155
What money?

716
00:52:33,364 --> 00:52:36,280
It seems you were feeling sad, because I was not looking at you

717
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:38,239
was I feeling Sad?

718
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,780
Yes, that’s why your friend Keshava gave me
the money to smile.. so I did..

719
00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:44,822
Did you smile for that?

720
00:52:44,905 --> 00:52:48,739
Whatever it is, We got to see Chiranjeevi movie.

721
00:52:49,364 --> 00:52:51,114
It was very nice.

722
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:55,114
After having soft drinks and Samosa
we are still left with two hundred rupees.

723
00:52:55,364 --> 00:52:59,614
Let me know where you would tomorrow.
I will come and smile at you for that..

724
00:53:00,155 --> 00:53:02,697
Is this what thousand rupees prayer means?

725
00:53:02,822 --> 00:53:05,489
Tell me where I can find you tomorrow...

726
00:53:05,655 --> 00:53:07,905
All my pride and ego has gone to dust..

727
00:53:08,447 --> 00:53:11,489
Hey Keshava. You have destroyed me.

728
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,280
Hey Keshava. Where are you?

729
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:18,114
Oh no! he's coming...
I did all this for your happiness

730
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:20,489
Isn’t it disgusting to ask that girl to smile at me
by paying her for money?

731
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:25,364
You ruined all the feeling of happiness,
that a girl loved me..

732
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:28,614
How can we stoop so low, to pay a girl and ask her to smile at me..

733
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:31,364
Am I like that? Am I like that Jaali Reddy?

734
00:53:31,364 --> 00:53:32,155
No.. no.

735
00:53:33,739 --> 00:53:38,697
You have totally damaged my dignity.
Anyways, How much did you pay?

736
00:53:38,822 --> 00:53:43,447
Thousand
-Thousand... for a smile.

737
00:53:46,405 --> 00:53:51,447
Ok. Anyways since I have already become bad..
I will pay five thousand ask her to give me a kiss me

738
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,864
What are you saying bro?
- I will pay her five thousand. Ask her if she will kiss me

739
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:56,489
I never thought you can behave like this bro

740
00:53:56,655 --> 00:53:59,322
I’m not like this bro. I’m a very good person

741
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:02,447
but you have started this
and now you should take this to the end..

742
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,364
what do you mean by end?

743
00:54:03,697 --> 00:54:06,114
I don't know what is the end ?
Till end . That’s all

744
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,280
Bro...

745
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:09,947
Go and do 5000 rupees worship.

746
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:16,489
ONE thousand tonnes of Syndicate goods!

747
00:54:20,864 --> 00:54:25,114
Approximately two hundred crores!
and halting here instead of enroute Chennai..

748
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,114
That Mangalam Seenu, rotating syndicate goods
That's why we are not able to track the locations.

749
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:37,530
It is possible that the goods will be coming to Kondareddy godowns.

750
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,739
If you tip us off the moment he lands new stuff,
do you know the reward?

751
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,530
Fifty Lakh Rupees.

752
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:02,864
How are you Draccha?
- I’m good Uncle

753
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:07,030
Srinu? What brings you here?

754
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,322
Excellent location Konda Reddy.

755
00:55:11,947 --> 00:55:15,447
Godown is also nice.
Even Draccha liked it.

756
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:18,697
He is Mangalam Seenu.

757
00:55:19,322 --> 00:55:21,489
The boss of the smuggling syndicate!

758
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,947
There may be the likes of Kondareddy snoring
at corners to sweat small stuff...

759
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:31,114
he is the only one man who can navigate
the goods all through the 15 checkpoints to the Chennai Port.

760
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:34,447
That’s why he is the one who calls the shots.

761
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,155
Nobody can go against him and get away with it.

762
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:41,405
I see that you are shifting all the load into my godown.
What is the issue?

763
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:44,739
You know Gowrreddy right...
- Who? Our Gowrreddy??

764
00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:51,322
I dismissed him from job as
he was messing up the with goods.

765
00:55:51,405 --> 00:55:54,322
How could you do that man?
What if he informs the police?

766
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,989
He knows addresses of all your godowns very well.

767
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:02,447
That’s why I brought all the stock to your godown kondareddy.

768
00:56:02,614 --> 00:56:06,489
We still have some time to take it to Chennai.
Please safeguard the stocks. I hope it’s safe

769
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:13,739
What are you talking dear? Did we bring the
stock directly here without trusting Kondareddy uncle?

770
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:15,572
But the problem is that stock is safeguarded by that Jaali Reddy.

771
00:56:15,947 --> 00:56:18,989
And you know that womanizer Jaali reddy is
surrounded always by girls.

772
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:22,614
If we trust and leave our stock with here,
it is like digging our own graves.

773
00:56:22,864 --> 00:56:29,489
You said it right. If Govindappa comes behind a girl,
the entire stock will go for a toss.

774
00:56:29,655 --> 00:56:32,864
Syndicate has trusted me and kept the stock with me

775
00:56:32,864 --> 00:56:33,989
You said it right dear...

776
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:39,239
No need to worry. Now we have a sharp guy called Pushpa.
He is taking care of everything.

777
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,905
After he came, Police are not able to catch even
a stem, forget a log.. there he comes.. see

778
00:56:44,364 --> 00:56:47,780
You are saying he is new. Can we trust him?

779
00:57:27,697 --> 00:57:30,947
I will tell in detail about him some other time Seenu

780
00:57:33,364 --> 00:57:35,280
He doesn’t look like the one to be discussed another time.

781
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:39,155
Anyways, I have to go for a wedding.
I take your leave

782
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:42,697
Pushpa, Srinanna’s stock will be with us
for two days. Take care of it..

783
00:57:42,905 --> 00:57:45,155
Sure, Brother
- Brother, we are getting late. Come fast..

784
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:49,739
What did you do with Gowrreddy?
Are you ignoring him or what?

785
00:57:51,072 --> 00:57:55,072
Don’t look at sky always uncle, look at the earth also sometimes.

786
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:58,614
We get trees from the there only..
wont you put manure to it..

787
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:07,780
Brother, Look there once.

788
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:29,530
No...

789
00:58:30,489 --> 00:58:35,822
He is like my younger brother.
I can’t see him die.

790
00:58:47,364 --> 00:58:51,447
Why does this Mogalesh do incomplete work always ?
Get me the gun...

791
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:54,364
Give me.

792
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,989
Why do we need this garbage in our backyard?
Throw it in the forest

793
00:59:05,989 --> 00:59:07,655
Okay Brother
Go and do that work.

794
00:59:18,364 --> 00:59:18,947
Bro...

795
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:21,697
What is this?
-Cardamom bro.. for a good smell

796
00:59:22,155 --> 00:59:24,114
I have.

797
00:59:24,322 --> 00:59:27,614
Why delay? Where are the girls?

798
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:29,155
They are coming brother.

799
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,530
They are waiting... Go

800
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:40,072
Go... go.
Go and kiss him.

801
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:42,572
I’m scared dear. What if he bites me?

802
00:59:42,572 --> 00:59:45,572
Why are you scared? He looks so handsome.

803
00:59:45,572 --> 00:59:47,739
What is that meeting they are having there?

804
00:59:48,614 --> 00:59:49,447
I don’t know brother

805
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:53,655
Why delay girl? He is waiting since morning.
Send her fast

806
00:59:53,697 --> 00:59:57,364
What is your problem to give a small kiss?

807
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:59,739
If you can’t.. I will go and give him. Tell me

808
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:02,489
You wait, As If we can’t do that.

809
01:00:02,489 --> 01:00:05,280
Bro Should I come and give you the kiss?

810
01:00:05,905 --> 01:00:09,905
Who is that? Calling me brother and offering me a kiss.

811
01:00:10,155 --> 01:00:11,864
Where did you find them?

812
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:14,405
Stop those discussions and send her fast

813
01:00:14,822 --> 01:00:16,905
I am feeling scared
-Shut up and come.

814
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,072
She is coming bro.. she is Coming

815
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,905
He is asking for a small kiss.
Go and give him a kiss, go...

816
01:00:28,822 --> 01:00:30,447
Keshava, close the door

817
01:00:30,614 --> 01:00:32,239
No, keep it open

818
01:00:33,072 --> 01:00:35,530
What are you doing here dirty fellow?

819
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:39,614
I’m noticing you since long.
Why are you shouting? Stop those antics..

820
01:00:39,614 --> 01:00:40,864
I will slap you hard idiot

821
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:44,572
Do it fast Pushpa and let’s go. Girls, turn away.

822
01:00:45,864 --> 01:00:48,072
Okay dear, as you wish!
- No touching!

823
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,364
What is this?

824
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:54,072
What you are chewing?

825
01:00:55,947 --> 01:00:57,739
Cardamom...
do you want?

826
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:00,197
Not there. I will kiss you here

827
01:01:00,614 --> 01:01:01,780
Here?
- Yes

828
01:01:01,864 --> 01:01:04,780
Why should we pay so much for a kiss here?
Hey Keshava

829
01:01:04,864 --> 01:01:06,947
Ok ok. Don’t make it an issue..

830
01:01:08,572 --> 01:01:09,614
Okay.

831
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:12,280
Ok give me..

832
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:13,905
Talk something.

833
01:01:13,905 --> 01:01:18,947
What is there to talk? You took money to kiss me.
Right.. so kiss me..

834
01:01:31,197 --> 01:01:33,072
Why are you crying girl?.. why?

835
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:39,655
I thought it is easy when my friends told me.
But my heart isn’t agreeing.

836
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:43,364
First kiss....

837
01:01:43,572 --> 01:01:48,530
How will I understand if you murmur? Say it clearly

838
01:01:48,655 --> 01:01:52,197
I always wanted to give first kiss to my husband...

839
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,280
To your husband?

840
01:01:53,905 --> 01:01:57,239
If you wanted it to give to someone else,
why did you take money from me?

841
01:01:57,864 --> 01:02:00,114
And why are you crying now?

842
01:02:00,155 --> 01:02:01,947
Stop crying... Stop it

843
01:02:02,697 --> 01:02:04,322
why are you crying now?

844
01:02:04,405 --> 01:02:05,947
What happened dear? My god

845
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:06,864
What did you do brother?

846
01:02:06,905 --> 01:02:10,822
I didn’t do anything brother. I didn’t even touch her
-What did you do? Why is the poor girl crying so much?

847
01:02:10,989 --> 01:02:14,530
Ask Srivalli.
Hey Srivalli. Did I do anything to you?

848
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,780
We trusted and sent our friend and is that what you do to her?

849
01:02:16,864 --> 01:02:17,989
Stop your nuisance for a minute

850
01:02:18,072 --> 01:02:19,489
I didn’t do anything brother.

851
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,697
You all go away... In hurry he would have bite her.

852
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,905
(Indistinct Voices)

853
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:26,697
What happened, bro?

854
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:28,530
She is making ruckus here.

855
01:02:29,197 --> 01:02:31,780
Leave it bro. She said she will kiss her husband only right

856
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:34,780
It’s my kiss man. I paid for it.

857
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:39,030
If I have to marry her and become her husband, I will.
I should only get that kiss..

858
01:02:39,405 --> 01:02:41,447
I won’t compromise on this

859
01:02:50,197 --> 01:02:53,072
Hey what is this? The entire stock is still here.

860
01:02:53,072 --> 01:02:55,947
Didn’t I tell you that we must cross
the check post with this by the night?

861
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:58,239
Jalanna was partying the whole night.

862
01:02:58,364 --> 01:03:02,614
He has stopped the lorries as they might disturb the party.

863
01:03:02,739 --> 01:03:06,447
Have your brains gone dead?
Who is Jaali to stop the stock?

864
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:07,864
Don't know, Brother.

865
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,614
Police are observing us like Jackals for this
address since night,

866
01:03:11,614 --> 01:03:12,947
and you know how risky it is..

867
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:16,364
Where are the keys?

868
01:03:16,405 --> 01:03:18,864
That is Jalanna’s room.
He will kill if we give you the keys

869
01:03:18,947 --> 01:03:20,364
What will he do?

870
01:03:22,322 --> 01:03:23,780
Pushpa, What are you doing?

871
01:03:41,322 --> 01:03:42,780
Don't scare, come sister...

872
01:03:42,864 --> 01:03:43,947
Hey Keshav,

873
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:48,197
please ask our guys to drop her in the village safely.

874
01:03:48,197 --> 01:03:48,947
Okay.

875
01:03:48,947 --> 01:03:49,780
Go...

876
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:53,697
Selva, take her and leave her in the village.

877
01:03:53,739 --> 01:03:54,822
I will be here.

878
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:55,530
Okay.

879
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,322
You go.
-Come...

880
01:03:56,447 --> 01:03:57,822
Hey, do it fast.

881
01:03:57,864 --> 01:03:59,822
Pushpa has sent the girl home

882
01:03:59,989 --> 01:04:02,530
We are loading all the stock in the lorries.

883
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,322
Why did you send the girl?

884
01:04:04,405 --> 01:04:07,030
First tell me why you didn’t you send the stock.

885
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:09,655
Have you converted the godown into your guest house?

886
01:04:09,697 --> 01:04:13,864
Who are you to ask me? This is my godown
you are just a coolie fellow.

887
01:04:13,864 --> 01:04:16,655
How dare you call me coolie?

888
01:04:16,947 --> 01:04:21,197
This is Pushpa.
Partner Pushpa. 4 Percent share.

889
01:04:21,572 --> 01:04:22,572
Give it now

890
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,864
Speak to him brother

891
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,530
Pushpa, Kondareddy brother wants to speak to you

892
01:04:28,864 --> 01:04:31,614
Don’t you use what you have above neck
instead of what you have below the waist?

893
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,405
Bro, please tell

894
01:04:34,864 --> 01:04:38,405
Police have come to know our godown address

895
01:04:40,197 --> 01:04:41,822
What are you saying brother?

896
01:04:46,822 --> 01:04:48,280
Hope all the stock is cleared from the godown

897
01:04:48,322 --> 01:04:52,197
No brother. Your brother Jaali has
stopped all lorries from entering the godown

898
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:58,197
My god! Thousand tons stock. It is worth 200 crores.
We will be done forever if we are caught.

899
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,822
Mangalam Srinu has trusted us and handed over the stock.

900
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:07,197
Do something...

901
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:09,239
You have trusted me and handed over to me..

902
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,614
consider Pushpa is dead, if even one log is caught.

903
01:05:13,447 --> 01:05:15,697
How scared he is, the slave!

904
01:05:15,697 --> 01:05:19,530
Jalareddy, you’ll get it now!
Pushpa doesn’t budge an inch, always gives it back!

905
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,655
How do we tackle this?

906
01:05:44,947 --> 01:05:45,989
Okay bro.

907
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:48,030
Rey... Pick the stock and throw it in the stream.

908
01:05:49,197 --> 01:05:53,780
What are you looking at? Police are coming.
Get up and move

909
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:13,447
Brother, listen to me once.

910
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:14,947
Entire stock is being thrown into water here.

911
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,697
That's all Mangalam Srinu's Stock.

912
01:07:17,322 --> 01:07:21,155
We can put it on Pushpa if Govindappa catches it.

913
01:07:21,322 --> 01:07:23,697
Not good for you to be there now.
Leave from there immediately

914
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:24,447
Pushpa is caught now.
Srinu will not leave him.

915
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:25,614
I am sure his time is over now..

916
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,572
Police are here.

917
01:09:38,947 --> 01:09:41,572
Brother...Log

918
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:21,697
Come fast.

919
01:10:33,489 --> 01:10:34,572
Quickly.

920
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:52,780
Come on, quick rotate...

921
01:11:04,989 --> 01:11:09,905
Sir, They have put towers in the forest too.
They would have known the information by now

922
01:11:12,655 --> 01:11:16,739
Rey...Is stock there?
- Sir, nothing is there here. Total license wood

923
01:11:16,822 --> 01:11:20,072
If Pushpa is there stock will not be there.
If stock is there Pushpa won’t be there.

924
01:11:20,405 --> 01:11:23,864
If you want to see both together,
none of you will be there.

925
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:28,489
We should all be thankful to Govindappa Sir!
- Yes Bro.

926
01:11:28,655 --> 01:11:31,322
Our range has grown because of this sir only...

927
01:11:31,405 --> 01:11:35,197
If he had caught the stock that day,
I wouldn’t have become a partner today..

928
01:11:35,405 --> 01:11:38,197
Don’t say like that brother? Sir may get angry

929
01:11:39,197 --> 01:11:41,155
What sir? Are you getting angry??

930
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:45,697
Alas... I don’t even have shirt for you to hold my collar.

931
01:11:45,905 --> 01:11:50,447
I have given it to a girl just now.
Not just you sir, we also do good deeds

932
01:11:50,489 --> 01:11:53,614
Rey... You are not understanding what you are doing...

933
01:11:55,364 --> 01:11:56,822
You are more cruel than animals... Yak

934
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,530
What is crueler than this world sir?

935
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:04,197
This world has given a gun to your hand
and an axe to my hand.

936
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:06,364
Everyone has his own war to fight.

937
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:12,405
I have won this war also sir

938
01:12:13,322 --> 01:12:15,280
I will take care of whatever comes.

939
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,572
Yes, You have won.

940
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:28,280
But do you know what kind of war you are fighting?

941
01:12:29,697 --> 01:12:34,655
You will lose as much as you are winning today.
You will know as you age..

942
01:12:42,822 --> 01:12:45,572
Losers will always talk about principles.

943
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,822
When does the party start?

944
01:12:50,864 --> 01:12:54,489
Heard about Mangalam Srinu party,
but first time I am seeing it.

945
01:12:54,822 --> 01:12:58,780
Not only smugglers but police,
politicians all have come to party.

946
01:12:58,905 --> 01:13:02,614
When one saw so much money
Pushpa has become hero instantly.

947
01:13:02,655 --> 01:13:06,155
Mangalam Srinu himself personally introduced him to MP

948
01:13:10,114 --> 01:13:13,614
They kill me with their looks if I wear a saree

949
01:13:13,864 --> 01:13:17,489
They scan me with their eyes if I wear a skirt

950
01:13:17,614 --> 01:13:21,280
Forget saree and gown, let me divulge a secret

951
01:13:21,405 --> 01:13:25,114
What is there in the dress when It’s your hold that matters

952
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:28,697
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

953
01:13:32,655 --> 01:13:36,239
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

954
01:13:40,114 --> 01:13:43,655
One becomes upside down if I’m fair

955
01:13:43,864 --> 01:13:47,447
One creates uproar if I’m dark

956
01:13:47,614 --> 01:13:51,239
Forget fair and dark, let me reveal the true color

957
01:13:51,364 --> 01:13:55,030
Color and figure won’t matter once you enter the field

958
01:13:55,072 --> 01:13:58,655
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

959
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:06,155
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

960
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:28,489
One jumps with joy If I’m tall

961
01:14:28,947 --> 01:14:32,322
One shouts and wails if I’m short

962
01:14:32,697 --> 01:14:36,155
Forget tall and short, let me tell you a truth

963
01:14:36,197 --> 01:14:40,114
You will be satiated with what you get

964
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,822
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

965
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:51,114
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

966
01:14:55,072 --> 01:14:58,530
One feels happy If I'm stout

967
01:14:58,697 --> 01:15:02,280
One feel bliss If I'm slender

968
01:15:02,447 --> 01:15:06,197
Forget stout and slender

969
01:15:06,197 --> 01:15:09,989
It is the man's wicked nature who caught me alone.

970
01:15:10,114 --> 01:15:13,697
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

971
01:15:17,614 --> 01:15:21,197
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say No

972
01:15:47,614 --> 01:15:51,197
One person poses like a respected man...

973
01:15:51,197 --> 01:15:55,030
I have a very good heart says one person

974
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,989
There is no good or bad, everyone belongs to the same race

975
01:15:58,989 --> 01:16:01,405
when the lights are off...

976
01:16:06,322 --> 01:16:10,072
when the lights are off...

977
01:16:10,114 --> 01:16:13,697
Will you say yes Dear.
Will you say Yes

978
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:21,114
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

979
01:16:32,489 --> 01:16:36,614
Will you say yes Dear.
Or will you say No

980
01:16:38,989 --> 01:16:42,489
Mangalam Sreenu has arranged a super party

981
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,030
He will get 2 crores from us and give only 25 lakhs to them

982
01:16:47,322 --> 01:16:49,947
Then, not only party, he can do anything.

983
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,197
Figure, liquor...

984
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:03,655
Brother, I want to speak to you urgently.
- What is that?

985
01:17:07,905 --> 01:17:13,655
That Mangalam srinu is cheating us bro.
Mangalam srinu is fooling us.

986
01:17:13,989 --> 01:17:17,614
How much does he give us per ton?
Twenty-five lakhs right.

987
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:20,405
He is selling for Two crores outside..

988
01:17:22,114 --> 01:17:23,739
How do you know?

989
01:17:24,697 --> 01:17:29,989
I have heard from the Murugan's people
when they were talking to each other

990
01:17:31,905 --> 01:17:35,030
Of late I was also getting doubt on him...

991
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:39,947
He is buying lands in lot of places.
What do you say now?

992
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,614
Nothing to say. Let’s go and ask

993
01:17:42,614 --> 01:17:44,739
We are loosing so much bro.

994
01:17:44,739 --> 01:17:48,280
We are all working hard and he is sitting and
enjoying all the fruits. Ask him Brother

995
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,947
What? you want to go and ask Mangalam Srinu, is it?

996
01:17:50,947 --> 01:17:53,364
Yes
-Do you know what he is?

997
01:17:53,447 --> 01:17:55,072
Hey Stop... You stop.

998
01:17:55,780 --> 01:18:01,989
You can go and ask but there are lot of other things
between me and Srinu.

999
01:18:02,405 --> 01:18:05,114
We will get into trouble if anything goes wrong.

1000
01:18:05,989 --> 01:18:07,697
What is this?
-Dry mutton curry.

1001
01:18:07,697 --> 01:18:08,655
Go and get snacks.

1002
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:11,572
Do one thing man.

1003
01:18:12,322 --> 01:18:16,447
You go and ask him that people are talking like this outside.

1004
01:18:16,572 --> 01:18:18,114
You are also partner right.

1005
01:18:18,947 --> 01:18:22,280
If he agrees 50% share...

1006
01:18:23,072 --> 01:18:26,822
else, you didn’t ask me anything.
There is no relationship between us.

1007
01:18:27,947 --> 01:18:28,947
What do you say?

1008
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:31,655
No Brother.

1009
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,947
If anyone has to ask him, it is you brother.
It won’t look good if I ask

1010
01:18:36,155 --> 01:18:37,364
That’s why...

1011
01:18:38,697 --> 01:18:41,572
Hey Muniratnam did you see Pushpa’s range.

1012
01:18:41,905 --> 01:18:44,155
He is having lunch with Kondareddy...
and he also doing business with him

1013
01:18:44,197 --> 01:18:45,155
You said it right.

1014
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,447
He used to come to work for
a wage of hundred, hundred and fifty.

1015
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:49,072
Now he has become very big

1016
01:18:49,364 --> 01:18:53,322
Where will you get a better match
for your daughter than him.

1017
01:18:53,322 --> 01:18:54,530
Why don’t you get her married to our guy?

1018
01:18:55,155 --> 01:18:58,364
How did you say such a big thing
so easily in a serious discussion?

1019
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:01,364
How can I give my daughter
without knowing his caste and gotra?

1020
01:19:01,614 --> 01:19:03,155
Hello... Do you know who he is?

1021
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,030
He is younger son of Molleti Venkata Ramana

1022
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,489
Is that so? Then he is our own.

1023
01:19:07,989 --> 01:19:09,030
Good match

1024
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,822
Munirathnam, The groom family is here.

1025
01:19:14,072 --> 01:19:14,822
Please come in.

1026
01:19:14,947 --> 01:19:16,572
Namaste!

1027
01:19:16,572 --> 01:19:18,530
See, How Muniratnam face is glowing

1028
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:22,322
Our lives are such that we feel happy
if Molleti Venkataramana says hi to us.

1029
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:25,864
A match with such family means…
Its all god grace

1030
01:19:25,864 --> 01:19:26,489
Here!

1031
01:19:28,572 --> 01:19:30,114
What are you looking at?
Move...

1032
01:19:30,114 --> 01:19:30,697
come in please.

1033
01:19:30,697 --> 01:19:32,364
Sit... please sit down.

1034
01:19:32,489 --> 01:19:33,947
Hey, you go.

1035
01:19:33,947 --> 01:19:35,822
What did you guys tell him?
He is talking strangely

1036
01:19:35,822 --> 01:19:37,197
What did you say?

1037
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:40,322
That’s what Bro. I told him that you are
third son of Molleti Venkataramana.

1038
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:41,697
Did you say like that?

1039
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:44,405
I’m somehow getting scared

1040
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:46,947
What’s wrong? Did he not tell what the truth is..?

1041
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:48,489
Not like that my son
-Be silent Mom.

1042
01:19:53,364 --> 01:19:55,072
Bro. Srivalli is coming.

1043
01:19:56,155 --> 01:19:57,489
Bring the girl.

1044
01:19:58,114 --> 01:19:59,197
(Chants)

1045
01:20:23,447 --> 01:20:24,405
The girl is looking beautiful.

1046
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:25,614
Girl, I had told you earlier only.
It was just a small kiss.

1047
01:20:25,614 --> 01:20:27,114
You should have given it to him.
See it has come up to marriage.

1048
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:31,030
Now you have to keep kissing him for life.
That too for free.

1049
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,280
This is all because of that Keshava

1050
01:20:39,405 --> 01:20:40,739
I'll hit you...!

1051
01:20:42,364 --> 01:20:47,405
Pushparaj, the youngest son of
Rangampet resident Molleti Venkata Ramana

1052
01:20:47,405 --> 01:20:49,197
and the resident of Yarravaripalem village…

1053
01:20:49,197 --> 01:20:51,530
We have seen the people
who sell fruits in the name of the tree.

1054
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:57,197
We came here knowing that someone is selling fruits
without even know which tree has given those fruits

1055
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:01,405
They are Venkataramana’s sons.

1056
01:21:02,405 --> 01:21:03,447
Greetings Sir.

1057
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:06,905
It is said that relationship means it has
to have 7 generations both sides

1058
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:09,072
Why is it that you are not looking
at even to one generation?

1059
01:21:09,697 --> 01:21:12,197
Do you know to whom you are giving
your daughter for marriage?

1060
01:21:12,655 --> 01:21:13,780
What are saying sir?

1061
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:16,114
He said he is third son of Molleti Venkata Ramana.

1062
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:17,739
Isn’t he your younger brother?

1063
01:21:17,822 --> 01:21:19,947
Will someone become king just because
he has Raju in his name?

1064
01:21:19,947 --> 01:21:21,905
and my brother if he takes my father’s name?

1065
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:23,947
He is anyways shameless to say it.

1066
01:21:24,322 --> 01:21:26,905
She is a lady shouldn’t she have any shame ?

1067
01:21:28,322 --> 01:21:31,280
Son, you sit quietly.
Swear on me that you won’t get up

1068
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:42,697
Have you seen what is in that?
Did you see any surname?

1069
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:46,364
No Sir, its only written as Pushpa raju

1070
01:21:46,405 --> 01:21:47,614
That’s the story.

1071
01:21:47,947 --> 01:21:52,322
He is surviving by using our surname

1072
01:21:53,989 --> 01:21:56,405
So what if he doesn’t have surname,
what is it that Pushpa doesn’t have..?

1073
01:21:56,405 --> 01:22:00,072
He has a house and earns handful.
Isn’t it enough to take care of your girl?

1074
01:22:00,322 --> 01:22:01,197
What do you say Muniratnam?

1075
01:22:01,197 --> 01:22:02,239
You said it rightly

1076
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,072
what will he take care?

1077
01:22:03,072 --> 01:22:05,239
Do you think wedding is just exchanging vows?

1078
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,864
We get a girl married to change her surname.

1079
01:22:08,072 --> 01:22:10,739
I won’t send her to such house.

1080
01:22:10,947 --> 01:22:11,739
Get up dear.

1081
01:22:11,739 --> 01:22:14,030
You wait... listen to me.

1082
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,530
You sit my dear. Sit.

1083
01:22:17,572 --> 01:22:20,905
Hey Son, you both are brothers and you share the same blood..

1084
01:22:21,155 --> 01:22:25,489
when such good occasions are happening,
one should overlook and move on.

1085
01:22:26,364 --> 01:22:27,447
I agree with you

1086
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:30,364
I agree that my father had an affair with his mother.

1087
01:22:30,364 --> 01:22:33,614
But what is the guarantee that he is born to my father?

1088
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:41,114
My father didn’t tell me.

1089
01:22:42,947 --> 01:22:43,947
What man?

1090
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:46,364
Did your mother at least tell you to
whom you are born? What?

1091
01:22:46,364 --> 01:22:47,822
How dare you?

1092
01:22:52,197 --> 01:22:55,114
(Commotion)

1093
01:22:57,489 --> 01:23:00,405
(Commotion)

1094
01:23:02,614 --> 01:23:03,364
Pushpa!
-Bro, Mother...

1095
01:23:03,822 --> 01:23:04,989
Bro, Mother...

1096
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,322
Mom!

1097
01:23:16,655 --> 01:23:17,572
Mom!

1098
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:21,447
Mom!

1099
01:23:22,155 --> 01:23:23,989
Keshava, get the vehicle.

1100
01:23:48,155 --> 01:23:49,197
Throw her out!

1101
01:23:49,822 --> 01:23:52,447
Please leave me... Please

1102
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:56,489
I plead you...

1103
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:57,905
Leave me alone.

1104
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,072
Mom!

1105
01:24:10,364 --> 01:24:13,364
Please... let me see his face once.

1106
01:24:25,072 --> 01:24:26,405
Father!

1107
01:25:29,155 --> 01:25:36,155
When your father asked me weather I want love
or respect, then I thought love was enough.

1108
01:25:37,447 --> 01:25:40,155
I thought his respect is mine too.

1109
01:25:41,947 --> 01:25:47,030
But I never thought you will face
so many insults because of this.

1110
01:25:50,614 --> 01:25:58,905
Had I known it, I would have taken
some poison when you were in my womb.

1111
01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:02,447
Mom!

1112
01:26:03,489 --> 01:26:05,280
Please forgive me, my son.

1113
01:26:05,489 --> 01:26:08,530
What is this maa? What are you talking?
What happened now?

1114
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:12,197
You have injuries on your head
that’s why you are talking like this.. Sleep now.

1115
01:26:12,489 --> 01:26:14,322
Grandma... Please maker her sleep.

1116
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:18,030
Don’t cry my dear.
Drink some porridge.

1117
01:26:18,614 --> 01:26:19,697
Mom...

1118
01:26:27,905 --> 01:26:30,739
Get some tea. Do you have money?
-I have bro.

1119
01:26:32,447 --> 01:26:33,697
Bro...

1120
01:26:38,572 --> 01:26:43,114
I was just five-year-old then.

1121
01:26:45,405 --> 01:26:47,030
I didn’t even know how to fight.

1122
01:26:49,822 --> 01:26:53,989
These guys have created all kinds of troubles
and took away whatever we had.

1123
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:13,447
My father had given me a gold chain for my birthday.

1124
01:27:14,572 --> 01:27:18,489
In that chain there used to be photo of me and my father.

1125
01:27:19,322 --> 01:27:23,364
That was the only thing I had as a memory in those things.

1126
01:27:25,322 --> 01:27:28,072
They took away that as well.

1127
01:27:39,739 --> 01:27:44,447
I won’t keep silent if they try to take away what I have to get.

1128
01:27:46,114 --> 01:27:49,239
Whether it is 10 paise or 10 rupees.

1129
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:51,530
I won’t spare anyone.

1130
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:56,072
I won’t spare anyone, even if its Srinivasa on
the hill or Mangalam Srinu down the hill.

1131
01:27:56,447 --> 01:27:58,989
I will collect everything with interest.

1132
01:28:01,572 --> 01:28:02,780
This is Pushpa

1133
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,447
Pushparaj here.

1134
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:07,155
I won’t compromise.

1135
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:11,364
Beat him here…not there

1136
01:28:11,364 --> 01:28:12,530
I have already beaten him there bro.

1137
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:14,114
Beat him on his knee?

1138
01:28:14,114 --> 01:28:15,155
On his knee’s bro?

1139
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,947
That hand… Mouth...
Beat him on the mouth.

1140
01:28:19,947 --> 01:28:21,114
Idiot shouldn’t open his mouth again.

1141
01:28:21,114 --> 01:28:23,114
Bro… He is scared

1142
01:28:23,114 --> 01:28:24,364
That’s why I asked you to beat.

1143
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:30,614
How dare he comes directly to me
and ask me to increase the rate?

1144
01:28:37,572 --> 01:28:42,197
It seems, Twenty-five is not enough for him..
he wants fifty lakhs per ton.

1145
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:44,614
Fifty… Do you want Fifty lakhs?

1146
01:28:44,614 --> 01:28:48,072
If I don’t give, you want to deal
with Chennai Murugan directly?

1147
01:28:48,905 --> 01:28:53,239
Why can’t you beat him yourself?
You are sitting happily and ordering him?

1148
01:28:53,614 --> 01:28:57,114
Bro... Stop now.
Drink this and take a breath.

1149
01:28:57,655 --> 01:28:59,447
Haven’t you got tired beating him since morning?

1150
01:28:59,864 --> 01:29:01,989
Unnecessary fuss all the time

1151
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,239
She talks like that only.
You carry on…

1152
01:29:05,155 --> 01:29:06,072
Hello MP Sir.

1153
01:29:06,489 --> 01:29:08,322
Come Pushpa. Sit.

1154
01:29:08,614 --> 01:29:09,614
Yes. Tell me MP Sir

1155
01:29:09,614 --> 01:29:12,364
Hey Srinu. Heard that you kidnapped Nagesh.

1156
01:29:12,572 --> 01:29:15,614
His brother came and is regretting
for the mistake that happened.

1157
01:29:15,989 --> 01:29:17,114
Leave him for this time.

1158
01:29:17,572 --> 01:29:18,780
I will speak to you

1159
01:29:18,905 --> 01:29:21,239
So sad... I just killed him MP Sir.

1160
01:29:21,822 --> 01:29:22,614
Brother…

1161
01:29:23,614 --> 01:29:25,572
You should have called me five minutes ago.

1162
01:29:26,447 --> 01:29:30,447
I’m just washing the knife after cutting his neck
and your call came..

1163
01:29:30,447 --> 01:29:33,072
I had called your PA also in the morning Sir.
He also didn’t say anything.

1164
01:29:33,239 --> 01:29:36,614
Hello MP Sir, please tell me in advance
if there is something like this next time.

1165
01:29:36,822 --> 01:29:38,155
It’s a matter of a person’s life. Isn’t it?

1166
01:29:38,322 --> 01:29:40,489
I don’t want any differences
between you and me unnecessarily.

1167
01:29:40,489 --> 01:29:42,155
That's it sir... I take leave.

1168
01:29:43,405 --> 01:29:45,489
How are you Pushpa?
-I’m fine, Sister.

1169
01:29:46,197 --> 01:29:47,530
That is the matter.

1170
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:48,822
Hey Nagesh.

1171
01:29:49,739 --> 01:29:55,114
I have given a word to the big man on the other side.
I will go wrong if I leave you.

1172
01:29:57,072 --> 01:29:59,447
Hey, Cut him into pieces.

1173
01:29:59,447 --> 01:30:00,322
Okay.

1174
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:08,197
You guys have spoilt the entire floor...

1175
01:30:08,197 --> 01:30:10,739
Hey Venkatesu... make it clean.

1176
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,530
What Pushpa? What made you come to me?

1177
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:14,655
How is Kondareddy?

1178
01:30:14,655 --> 01:30:15,405
He is fine Brother.

1179
01:30:15,822 --> 01:30:17,405
Brother, I have mixed the color.

1180
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:18,989
What is this? Is this black?

1181
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:20,655
Yes, black sir.

1182
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:23,447
Last time also you had said it was black
but had turned brown.

1183
01:30:23,905 --> 01:30:25,697
It was so awkward in front of everyone

1184
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,489
It just happened like that last time brother.
This time it will be black for sure.

1185
01:30:29,614 --> 01:30:33,072
I don’t have confidence in you.
Put on him and show.

1186
01:30:34,447 --> 01:30:35,655
apply on him.

1187
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:40,239
See Pushpa, how he died struggling.

1188
01:30:40,405 --> 01:30:42,947
Else, he wanted Fifty lakhs per ton.

1189
01:30:43,114 --> 01:30:47,322
All you have to do is to cross two check posts
and deliver stocks to me.

1190
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:51,655
I must cross fifteen check posts
to transport the stock to Chennai.

1191
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:52,822
Can you imagine how difficult it is?

1192
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:54,739
I agree brother, It is a very difficult job indeed.

1193
01:30:55,197 --> 01:30:58,447
Even I faced difficulty near fifteenth check post.

1194
01:30:58,614 --> 01:31:02,114
That SI Manikandan you know right.
He asked me for one lakh rupees.

1195
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:03,447
That fellow.

1196
01:31:03,989 --> 01:31:08,947
Somehow, we made sure the
stock reached Chennai safely brother.

1197
01:31:12,447 --> 01:31:14,655
Have delivered the stock to Chennai?

1198
01:31:16,655 --> 01:31:18,530
Who told you to do that?

1199
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:21,155
The twenty-five lakhs you give is not enough.

1200
01:31:21,197 --> 01:31:23,447
If you give one crore per ton,
I will sell to you only.

1201
01:31:23,989 --> 01:31:25,614
Crore?
What is it bro?

1202
01:31:26,322 --> 01:31:27,489
If I say no…

1203
01:31:29,405 --> 01:31:31,072
Whom did he say he will sell brother?

1204
01:31:31,322 --> 01:31:32,614
Chennai Murugan.

1205
01:31:32,739 --> 01:31:34,197
I will sell it to him only.

1206
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,322
Why should I go to a new person?

1207
01:31:35,447 --> 01:31:36,655
Hey, do you understand what you are asking?

1208
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:38,697
We just cut his neck for asking fifty lakhs only.

1209
01:31:38,822 --> 01:31:41,405
And here you are asking for one crore.
Don’t you see what just happened.. ?

1210
01:31:41,655 --> 01:31:42,447
I understand man.

1211
01:31:42,614 --> 01:31:44,697
I came here to ask fifty lakhs only.

1212
01:31:45,072 --> 01:31:47,822
But after seeing him, I understood
how high the risk is..

1213
01:31:47,864 --> 01:31:50,280
that’s why I am asking for a crore...
Am I right brother?

1214
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:54,114
Brother, tell me whether you can one crore per ton.

1215
01:31:54,447 --> 01:31:56,655
Otherwise, I will sell to Chennai Murugesan only.

1216
01:32:02,822 --> 01:32:05,364
All of you think about it and call me.

1217
01:32:05,655 --> 01:32:07,739
Okay?
I take leave brother.

1218
01:32:09,155 --> 01:32:13,322
Oh! What is this bro?

1219
01:32:13,322 --> 01:32:18,072
This is black for sure.
Don’t worry and get it applied.

1220
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:36,739
Brother, why did you leave him like that?

1221
01:32:37,947 --> 01:32:41,197
You are coming and asking me,
half an hour after he left?

1222
01:32:41,572 --> 01:32:44,697
I was in shock that he was speaking like that
even after seeing what death looks like.

1223
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,530
Do you think I was in a dream sequence
with your sister?

1224
01:32:49,614 --> 01:32:51,405
I was also in a shock.

1225
01:32:52,614 --> 01:32:54,655
We have left him unnecessarily bro.
We should have killed him.

1226
01:32:54,655 --> 01:32:55,905
What do you say Singireddy?

1227
01:32:55,905 --> 01:32:56,822
Yes, Brother

1228
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:23,572
Brother, Can I make a call?

1229
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:34,447
Brother…Murugan.

1230
01:33:34,614 --> 01:33:35,405
Greetings Bro.

1231
01:33:36,114 --> 01:33:38,780
This is syndicate member Pushpa speaking.

1232
01:33:40,864 --> 01:33:44,072
This time we don’t want to sell stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1233
01:33:45,989 --> 01:33:47,739
Thinking of selling it to you directly.

1234
01:33:48,739 --> 01:33:50,864
Ok… Ok Brother.

1235
01:33:51,072 --> 01:33:53,239
Stock has already reached Chennai Sir.

1236
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:58,822
I will come to Chennai tomorrow and discuss rate with you.

1237
01:33:59,405 --> 01:34:01,947
Ok. Write down my pager number brother.

1238
01:34:03,197 --> 01:34:05,989
Eight Three…Eight four...

1239
01:34:59,572 --> 01:35:01,489
You fool!

1240
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:04,697
I didn't left because you spared me

1241
01:35:05,864 --> 01:35:08,364
I left because I decided to leave.

1242
01:35:08,739 --> 01:35:09,655
What?

1243
01:35:10,447 --> 01:35:12,822
You thought Pushpa means flower...

1244
01:35:13,530 --> 01:35:14,614
It's Fire!

1245
01:35:15,989 --> 01:35:17,114
Fire!

1246
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:45,072
Who are you?
What do you want?

1247
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:46,530
We have come to meet Murugan.

1248
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:47,114
Is it?

1249
01:35:47,114 --> 01:35:48,864
Hey… who are they?

1250
01:35:49,114 --> 01:35:51,322
Pushpa, Syndicate member.

1251
01:35:51,614 --> 01:35:54,239
Came from Tirupati to discuss business.

1252
01:35:54,489 --> 01:35:57,405
Hey, say Pager No. 8384.

1253
01:35:57,405 --> 01:35:58,572
He will recognize us with that

1254
01:35:58,572 --> 01:35:59,864
Why are you shouting in my ear?

1255
01:35:59,864 --> 01:36:03,822
Hey, Murugan Sir is busy and
he said he can’t meet anyone.

1256
01:36:03,947 --> 01:36:04,864
You heard it right!

1257
01:36:05,197 --> 01:36:07,739
Murugan Sir won’t meet anyone. Leave now

1258
01:36:07,739 --> 01:36:11,405
Let him say that after seeing this piece.

1259
01:36:11,864 --> 01:36:12,614
What is this?

1260
01:36:12,905 --> 01:36:16,447
This is Bro’s visiting card.
He will understand if he looks at it

1261
01:36:25,072 --> 01:36:26,697
Its 07:45 PM

1262
01:36:26,697 --> 01:36:28,280
It's tea time for Murugan sir.

1263
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,739
Quickly go and give a tea to Murugan sir.

1264
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,197
Hey, Tea won’t go anywhere.

1265
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:35,530
Murugan himself will come to tea

1266
01:36:43,697 --> 01:36:44,739
What is this man?

1267
01:36:45,822 --> 01:36:46,655
A grade stock.

1268
01:36:47,489 --> 01:36:50,155
I had seen it long back when I started the business.

1269
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:52,655
I’m seeing it again now.

1270
01:36:53,447 --> 01:36:54,572
This is gold.

1271
01:36:54,739 --> 01:36:57,447
How many hills we have to climb up
to see lord Venkateswara...

1272
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:01,030
Likewise that many hills you need
to climb down to find this kind of stuff

1273
01:37:01,322 --> 01:37:04,197
This is A grade Stuff.

1274
01:37:04,947 --> 01:37:10,239
The smuggler who buys never knows where we can get it
The one who the cuts the tree knows the exact place

1275
01:37:33,155 --> 01:37:33,905
Open the door.

1276
01:37:48,405 --> 01:37:51,239
Two tons…five trucks
We have ten tons of stock

1277
01:37:51,447 --> 01:37:52,489
Super man!

1278
01:37:54,072 --> 01:37:57,614
Will speak to Mangalam Srinu
and fix the rate. You leave.

1279
01:37:57,697 --> 01:38:01,155
Brother, We have decided not to sell
the stock to Mangalam Srinu.

1280
01:38:01,864 --> 01:38:04,072
That is why we came directly to sell it to you.

1281
01:38:04,197 --> 01:38:06,072
That’s why we brought it this far.

1282
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,572
Do you want stock or not?

1283
01:38:14,989 --> 01:38:16,697
Hey, close the door.

1284
01:38:16,822 --> 01:38:18,280
Start the vehicles...
-Bro.. bro...

1285
01:38:18,655 --> 01:38:22,155
Mangalam Srinu is very dangerous.

1286
01:38:22,905 --> 01:38:25,905
Can you do business defying him?

1287
01:38:28,947 --> 01:38:31,697
Can you buy the stock defying him?

1288
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:34,530
Any who came here defying Mangalam Srinu
and they are all dead.

1289
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:37,822
Brother, many would have come to you.

1290
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:42,280
I called from Srinanna’s place only and
told you that I am coming to you

1291
01:38:42,905 --> 01:38:43,947
I’m different bro.

1292
01:38:44,072 --> 01:38:45,947
Who are you? Are you a crack?

1293
01:38:46,905 --> 01:38:49,780
Do you know to whom you are talking to?

1294
01:38:49,989 --> 01:38:51,489
I am Kondareddy’s partner.

1295
01:38:52,155 --> 01:38:54,697
Kondareddy himself sent me here to talk to you.

1296
01:38:54,697 --> 01:38:57,905
Are you Kondareddy’s man?

1297
01:38:58,572 --> 01:39:00,239
You should have told me that earlier.

1298
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,280
Call him.

1299
01:39:03,114 --> 01:39:05,364
Let me speak once.

1300
01:39:05,405 --> 01:39:09,364
That, only after negotiating the price..

1301
01:39:09,947 --> 01:39:11,197
Tell me what is the rate?

1302
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:13,697
Hello!

1303
01:39:13,864 --> 01:39:14,947
Brother Kondareeddy

1304
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,405
Hey Pushpa. Didn’t see you for the last 2 days.

1305
01:39:17,614 --> 01:39:18,447
Where did you go?

1306
01:39:18,655 --> 01:39:19,822
I came to Chennai?

1307
01:39:20,114 --> 01:39:22,280
Chennai? Why??

1308
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:24,614
I came here to meet Murugan.

1309
01:39:24,822 --> 01:39:25,947
To meet Murugan?

1310
01:39:26,364 --> 01:39:28,447
Hey Jakka.
He says he went to meet Murugan

1311
01:39:30,697 --> 01:39:31,905
Whose permission did you take to go to Murugan?

1312
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:33,655
I asked you to go and meet Mangalam Srinu, right?

1313
01:39:33,822 --> 01:39:36,614
What bro? Doesn’t Kondareddy know
that we came here?

1314
01:39:39,655 --> 01:39:43,822
Just because we gave 4% share,
you want to act as you wish?

1315
01:39:45,405 --> 01:39:46,364
One and half crore…

1316
01:39:53,239 --> 01:39:55,905
One and half crore per ton.

1317
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:58,155
I just negotiated the deal with Murugan.

1318
01:39:58,572 --> 01:40:01,697
As usual, do you want me to sell to
Mangalam Srinu for twenty-five lakhs

1319
01:40:01,864 --> 01:40:04,072
or take risk and sell it to Murugan for one and half crore…

1320
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:10,530
Understood bro.

1321
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:18,530
I will tell Muragan brother that
you can’t do business defying Mangalam Srinu.

1322
01:40:18,572 --> 01:40:20,114
I will tell him that we don’t have the guts.

1323
01:40:20,822 --> 01:40:23,364
I held back for all these days not because
I don’t have guts.

1324
01:40:23,655 --> 01:40:26,072
I stopped because I was bound by Syndicate’s decision.

1325
01:40:26,197 --> 01:40:30,614
When we know that Mangalam Srinu is
cheating us, who cares for the syndicate?

1326
01:40:30,822 --> 01:40:32,197
Finalize the deal.

1327
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:37,364
Brother...

1328
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:43,947
50% share to me and 50% to you from the profits.
You remember we agreed on this the other day.

1329
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,447
How dare you information to police
about us.. you idiot?

1330
01:41:02,447 --> 01:41:05,572
What is the point of talking to him brother,
when he was informing everything about us to Police.

1331
01:41:11,614 --> 01:41:13,155
I don’t have anything to do with it.. brother.

1332
01:41:13,572 --> 01:41:14,989
He did everything.

1333
01:41:15,614 --> 01:41:17,405
You knew, that he was doing all this.

1334
01:41:21,655 --> 01:41:22,697
I know, brother.

1335
01:41:22,697 --> 01:41:23,780
Why didn’t you not inform us?

1336
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:29,572
He lured me with money.

1337
01:41:30,822 --> 01:41:33,572
I got greedy in the hope to perform my daughter’s marriage.

1338
01:41:34,489 --> 01:41:35,447
Daughter?

1339
01:41:35,947 --> 01:41:37,030
Who is that?

1340
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:39,114
Does he have a grown up daughter.. ?

1341
01:41:39,572 --> 01:41:42,822
same one brother, the one you saw when she came
to see ‘Choodalani undi’ Movie.. that one..

1342
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:45,405
Is she, his daughter?

1343
01:41:46,697 --> 01:41:49,155
Isn’t she beautiful? I saw her from far.

1344
01:41:49,155 --> 01:41:51,822
She looks just ok bro

1345
01:41:53,489 --> 01:41:56,114
Then ask her to come once.
We shall talk to her

1346
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,030
Lay him down here.

1347
01:42:02,447 --> 01:42:04,697
Rey, You guys go and get his parents

1348
01:42:05,447 --> 01:42:05,947
My...

1349
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,114
Where is my father?

1350
01:42:07,614 --> 01:42:08,905
What happened to him.

1351
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:10,822
I’m asking you.

1352
01:42:10,947 --> 01:42:12,114
What happened to my father?

1353
01:42:12,322 --> 01:42:13,114
Tell me.

1354
01:42:13,614 --> 01:42:14,447
What happened to my father?

1355
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:20,280
Rey Busappa, you said she is just ok.

1356
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:24,030
But she is looking superb like a film heroine.

1357
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:26,655
Your father is alive.

1358
01:42:26,697 --> 01:42:31,947
But go home and have a bath with lux soap.

1359
01:42:32,405 --> 01:42:37,655
wear this saree with jasmine flowers
and come here in the night.

1360
01:42:37,947 --> 01:42:39,614
Then, You can take your father home in the morning.

1361
01:42:40,322 --> 01:42:42,697
Get ready like a bride for Jalanna and come.

1362
01:42:43,572 --> 01:42:47,447
What? Can’t you adjust for one night
for the sake of your father’s life?

1363
01:42:51,447 --> 01:42:52,864
Go…Go.

1364
01:44:11,822 --> 01:44:12,447
Hey!

1365
01:44:12,655 --> 01:44:13,155
Bro!

1366
01:44:13,572 --> 01:44:17,072
Go out and have some beer and biryani.
Come back in the morning.

1367
01:44:17,114 --> 01:44:17,822
Ok bro.

1368
01:44:17,947 --> 01:44:20,822
Rey, we can do this in the morning.
Let’s go. Rey. Let’s go

1369
01:44:23,197 --> 01:44:25,489
(Song)

1370
01:44:46,447 --> 01:44:47,947
How come you came here dear?

1371
01:44:49,405 --> 01:44:50,822
Have you lost your way?

1372
01:44:50,822 --> 01:44:53,280
Jalreddy is saying that he will kill my father

1373
01:44:54,155 --> 01:44:57,155
Why Jalreddy?
Even I would kill him.

1374
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:00,322
How could your father
show loyalty to the Police?

1375
01:45:00,572 --> 01:45:04,364
He said he will spare him,
if I sleep with him tonight.

1376
01:45:10,405 --> 01:45:11,864
You came all decked up right.

1377
01:45:12,405 --> 01:45:15,239
Go there.
Why did you come here?

1378
01:45:17,864 --> 01:45:22,322
If I go there tonight, my father might
return home in the morning...

1379
01:45:23,155 --> 01:45:24,614
but I will not be able to come to your house ever.

1380
01:45:25,030 --> 01:45:27,489
Why do you want to come to the house of
a guy who doesn’t have surname?

1381
01:45:28,072 --> 01:45:29,989
You must have felt happy on the day the relation broke.

1382
01:45:29,989 --> 01:45:32,614
You must have felt very happy
that you have gotten rid of me,

1383
01:45:32,614 --> 01:45:34,072
and you don’t need to see my face ever again.

1384
01:45:35,155 --> 01:45:36,614
Is this what you understood?

1385
01:45:37,822 --> 01:45:39,530
You are like this, from the beginning.

1386
01:45:39,864 --> 01:45:43,072
When did you ever understood the heart
of a girl that you can understand today.

1387
01:45:45,155 --> 01:45:49,197
When my friends told me that you are feeling sad,
because I was not looking at you,

1388
01:45:49,822 --> 01:45:53,989
I felt very happy that this boy likes me so much.

1389
01:45:55,155 --> 01:45:56,614
I liked you as soon as I saw you.

1390
01:46:01,322 --> 01:46:03,197
When you gave me money and asked for a kiss...

1391
01:46:03,405 --> 01:46:08,155
I thought this is your way of expressing love.

1392
01:46:10,697 --> 01:46:13,614
When I said that I want to give first kiss to my husband,

1393
01:46:14,989 --> 01:46:19,114
I gave an indication to you to marry me.

1394
01:46:20,072 --> 01:46:21,739
You didn't understand even that.

1395
01:46:22,989 --> 01:46:25,364
My father doesn’t even start the lorry without my nod.

1396
01:46:25,739 --> 01:46:29,447
Do you think you could come to my house
for marriage proposal without my wish?

1397
01:46:30,947 --> 01:46:37,530
Do you know how bad I felt seeing
you anxious when mother-in-law got hurt?

1398
01:46:37,739 --> 01:46:40,405
You could have understood that,
had you seen into my eyes once.

1399
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:43,197
You left even without looking at me.

1400
01:46:43,322 --> 01:46:46,614
Do you mean to say, that I should
change my heart after hearing whatever you said...

1401
01:46:46,614 --> 01:46:49,072
and go fight with jaali and save your father?

1402
01:46:49,905 --> 01:46:51,405
It is not going to happen.
Leave now

1403
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:54,030
I know that you won’t do anything like that.

1404
01:46:54,989 --> 01:46:56,905
Your money and business are important to you, Isn’t it?

1405
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:00,822
Why will you fight for a stranger like me?

1406
01:47:02,864 --> 01:47:05,697
Anyways, I didn’t come for that.

1407
01:47:05,739 --> 01:47:06,739
Then why did you come?

1408
01:47:15,447 --> 01:47:23,989
I always wanted to share my first kiss and my first night
with someone whom I consider my husband.

1409
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:31,197
Please sleep with me once.

1410
01:47:31,989 --> 01:47:34,572
You will never see me again.

1411
01:47:36,655 --> 01:47:37,822
I will go.

1412
01:47:39,614 --> 01:47:41,739
And after that I don’t care what happens to my life.

1413
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,239
What is this dear?

1414
01:47:49,864 --> 01:47:51,780
Do you love me so much?

1415
01:47:54,322 --> 01:47:57,905
You think I will allow anyone to lay his hand
on you after what you said.

1416
01:48:00,197 --> 01:48:01,780
Whoever it is..

1417
01:48:05,655 --> 01:48:08,239
will not allow

1418
01:48:16,905 --> 01:48:18,114
What Pushpa?

1419
01:48:19,322 --> 01:48:22,030
You only brought the girl to make her sleep with me.

1420
01:48:22,905 --> 01:48:25,239
Are you doing all this for just 4 percent?

1421
01:48:41,947 --> 01:48:43,114
I won't leave her.

1422
01:50:10,822 --> 01:50:14,614
Are you firing?

1423
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:16,655
Dear, Come here.

1424
01:50:17,114 --> 01:50:18,364
Are you firing bullets on to the girl?

1425
01:50:18,655 --> 01:50:20,364
I am going to kill you, idiot.

1426
01:50:40,364 --> 01:50:43,155
How dare you lay a hand on girls?

1427
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:49,280
Muniratnam!

1428
01:50:50,239 --> 01:50:51,489
Muniratnam, get up!

1429
01:51:04,447 --> 01:51:08,197
Look Srivalli, your father is fine.
I made him sit in the car.

1430
01:51:08,822 --> 01:51:13,280
What is this man?
You have hit Jalreddy so badly.

1431
01:51:13,572 --> 01:51:16,655
O Jalanna. I feel pity looking at you.

1432
01:51:17,405 --> 01:51:20,197
What maccha?
You made him incapable for anything.

1433
01:51:20,989 --> 01:51:23,697
If Kondareddy gets to know if this, he will kill you bro.

1434
01:51:24,072 --> 01:51:27,114
Hey, who will tell?
This fellow only should say if at all…

1435
01:51:27,239 --> 01:51:30,739
What man? What will you tell your brother?

1436
01:51:30,739 --> 01:51:35,822
Will you go cry before him and
tell him shamelessly that Pushpa beat you.

1437
01:51:35,905 --> 01:51:40,239
Ey Jaali, Go and complain.
I don’t care.

1438
01:51:40,322 --> 01:51:42,072
Dear, come let’s go.

1439
01:51:42,155 --> 01:51:44,697
We will get it resolved either this way or that way.
I’m ready for whatever happens.

1440
01:51:44,697 --> 01:51:49,989
Pushpa, I’m not an idiot to go
and complain to my brothers.

1441
01:51:51,947 --> 01:51:54,364
This is between you and me…

1442
01:51:56,114 --> 01:51:59,239
and I will deal about this with you directly.

1443
01:52:00,447 --> 01:52:01,947
I won’t leave you.

1444
01:52:01,947 --> 01:52:05,822
This.. This ..This ..
This is what is called as being a man.

1445
01:52:05,822 --> 01:52:11,030
What you did with women
all these days is not like a man.

1446
01:52:11,572 --> 01:52:14,155
Now you have proven that you are a man.

1447
01:52:14,322 --> 01:52:15,947
Now stand on your word.

1448
01:52:16,197 --> 01:52:19,280
Kesava, he has masculinity in him.

1449
01:52:19,655 --> 01:52:21,447
I think he will stand on his word.

1450
01:52:21,947 --> 01:52:24,364
What dear? What do you think?

1451
01:52:24,364 --> 01:52:25,989
I too believe the same

1452
01:52:26,197 --> 01:52:27,572
He will stand on his word right

1453
01:52:27,572 --> 01:52:29,697
How will he stand,
when you have already broken everything.

1454
01:52:38,822 --> 01:52:41,155
Muniratnam, Come... come.

1455
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,114
Pushpa, I will park the car at home and come.

1456
01:53:01,239 --> 01:53:02,655
Srivalli, I will take leave.

1457
01:53:02,655 --> 01:53:03,489
Pushpa!

1458
01:53:03,989 --> 01:53:05,822
Come and have dinner.

1459
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:07,280
No need Aunty.

1460
01:53:07,989 --> 01:53:11,572
My mom is waiting for me... I have to go.

1461
01:53:11,614 --> 01:53:13,030
Pushpa, wait a minute.

1462
01:53:13,364 --> 01:53:14,239
You come.

1463
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:26,239
My mom asked me to give this to you.

1464
01:53:28,697 --> 01:53:29,572
Okay.

1465
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:32,030
You go.

1466
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:37,989
Why are you staring at me?

1467
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:38,822
Go.

1468
01:53:41,989 --> 01:53:42,905
What girl?

1469
01:53:47,239 --> 01:53:48,155
What girl?

1470
01:53:52,614 --> 01:53:56,155
When you call me Dear… Dear,
I feel like I have become your wife

1471
01:53:56,155 --> 01:53:59,072
Darling… My Darling

1472
01:53:59,572 --> 01:54:03,114
When I call you Darling… Darling,
you suit well as my Husband

1473
01:54:03,114 --> 01:54:06,030
Darling… My Darling

1474
01:54:06,322 --> 01:54:08,989
When I walk behind you

1475
01:54:09,739 --> 01:54:11,655
When I walk behind you

1476
01:54:11,697 --> 01:54:14,405
It feels like going uphill
to Venkanna Temple, Darling

1477
01:54:14,864 --> 01:54:16,864
When I sit next to you

1478
01:54:16,905 --> 01:54:19,822
It feels like I got Lord Parameshwara.

1479
01:54:20,072 --> 01:54:23,614
When I look at the path as you leave
It is as if the lake has dried up.

1480
01:54:23,614 --> 01:54:26,530
Darling… My Darling

1481
01:54:26,822 --> 01:54:29,655
My Darling…. Come here Darling

1482
01:54:30,072 --> 01:54:33,405
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1483
01:54:33,530 --> 01:54:36,322
My Darling… Come here Darling

1484
01:54:36,905 --> 01:54:40,239
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1485
01:54:54,864 --> 01:55:00,905
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1486
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:05,072
When you tie lungi above the thighs...

1487
01:55:05,072 --> 01:55:07,447
My breath gets stopped Darling

1488
01:55:08,364 --> 01:55:11,905
When you are chewing a Jarda Pan

1489
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:14,822
My body gets painted Red… Darling

1490
01:55:14,864 --> 01:55:17,614
When I hear your yells and roars…

1491
01:55:25,197 --> 01:55:28,572
When I hear your yells and roars…
It thrills me like hell…

1492
01:55:28,697 --> 01:55:32,072
When you sit cross legged, it mesmerizes me.

1493
01:55:32,072 --> 01:55:35,739
When you take out two buttons and show your chest
Won’t it overflow like a milk Pot

1494
01:55:35,739 --> 01:55:38,864
My Darling… my Darling

1495
01:55:38,905 --> 01:55:41,697
My Darling… Come here Darling

1496
01:55:42,114 --> 01:55:45,447
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1497
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:48,322
My Darling… Come here Darling

1498
01:55:48,739 --> 01:55:52,072
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1499
01:56:06,864 --> 01:56:12,030
When I wear a new saree and you don’t complement

1500
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:17,114
When I wear a new saree and you don’t complement

1501
01:56:17,155 --> 01:56:19,655
Wouldn’t that saree value become zero, Darling...

1502
01:56:20,405 --> 01:56:24,072
When I wear flowers in my hair
And if you don’t smell them

1503
01:56:24,072 --> 01:56:26,655
Wouldn’t the flower mound fall down.

1504
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:30,239
When my saree frill slips down

1505
01:56:37,155 --> 01:56:40,614
When my saree frill slips down,
and you won’t look at me

1506
01:56:40,614 --> 01:56:44,072
The naughty wind would sympathize with me, Darling

1507
01:56:44,114 --> 01:56:47,905
If my beauty doesn’t become yours,
my life as girl would become poor

1508
01:56:47,905 --> 01:56:50,864
Darling…my Darling

1509
01:56:50,864 --> 01:56:53,655
My Darling… Come here Darling

1510
01:56:54,072 --> 01:56:57,405
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1511
01:56:57,489 --> 01:57:00,280
My Darling… Come here Darling

1512
01:57:00,697 --> 01:57:04,030
Darling with Golden Heart…
Darling with Pride. Darling with Emotions

1513
01:57:13,947 --> 01:57:15,989
Bro, Operation to the spine it seems.

1514
01:57:16,322 --> 01:57:19,280
Doctor is saying only after that
he can say if he can walk or not

1515
01:57:23,905 --> 01:57:25,739
He won’t say who hit him.

1516
01:57:26,322 --> 01:57:27,572
And you people don’t know.

1517
01:57:28,155 --> 01:57:29,072
Is that right?

1518
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,114
Yes Brother.

1519
01:57:35,405 --> 01:57:36,905
Bro… Bro… Bro

1520
01:57:36,905 --> 01:57:38,655
Whom did he sleep with last night?

1521
01:57:38,655 --> 01:57:41,197
Muniratnam daughter came… Bro

1522
01:57:41,197 --> 01:57:45,697
Muniratnam daughter came in the night and
went back in the morning with her father.

1523
01:57:45,697 --> 01:57:47,697
Then, who hit him?

1524
01:57:57,655 --> 01:58:01,072
Bro, looks like Kondareddy wants to kill the guy
who thrashed Jalreddy,

1525
01:58:01,072 --> 01:58:04,072
once he gets to know who did it.. ignoring that,
you are looking at Pager and money.

1526
01:58:04,697 --> 01:58:08,114
Only six months? For the trashing I gave him,
He should not get up for one year.

1527
01:58:08,364 --> 01:58:10,864
I think I haven’t given him enough.. .

1528
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:14,989
Bro, Jalreddy still has some masculinity left in him.
That is why he didn’t name you.

1529
01:58:15,364 --> 01:58:17,114
What If Kondareddy gets to know this…

1530
01:58:17,197 --> 01:58:19,447
I lost my count..
How will Kondareddy get to know?

1531
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:24,905
What Pushpa?
Has the stock reached Murugan?

1532
01:58:25,655 --> 01:58:27,780
Reached Bro. He sent the message too.
Just reached it seems

1533
01:58:28,030 --> 01:58:32,114
Ok. we should go to Tirupati tomorrow
and get the money.

1534
01:58:32,530 --> 01:58:35,489
That Hawala slip is with you, only right?
- It is safe with me.

1535
01:58:35,489 --> 01:58:36,614
Be ready in the morning

1536
01:58:38,155 --> 01:58:39,447
what is that injury on your hand?

1537
01:58:39,655 --> 01:58:41,905
This… Our
- That… Got scratched when coming in car.

1538
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:44,239
Be careful man. Ok…

1539
01:58:44,655 --> 01:58:45,780
What Subbareddy?
- Bro…

1540
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:48,114
Did you get the jeep tyres changed?
- got it Changed bro

1541
01:58:50,572 --> 01:58:51,864
What should I do?

1542
01:58:52,322 --> 01:58:56,072
Bro. Do you think he heard?
- No, He didn’t.

1543
01:58:56,322 --> 01:58:59,030
No Bro. I have a doubt that he must have heard..

1544
01:58:59,489 --> 01:59:03,072
I will do one thing.
I will go out and close the door and wait there..

1545
01:59:03,072 --> 01:59:05,447
You speak something.
I will see if can hear it or not

1546
01:59:07,655 --> 01:59:09,322
Bro... Speak.. Speak

1547
01:59:18,155 --> 01:59:19,489
bro, I could not hear anything

1548
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:21,655
I didn’t speak anything

1549
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:28,530
What man… What is this?
- Mosquitos Bro

1550
01:59:28,572 --> 01:59:29,739
What?
- Mosquitos

1551
01:59:30,697 --> 01:59:33,072
Be careful man. Too many mosquitos here.
What if we get Dengue Fever?

1552
01:59:33,072 --> 01:59:37,614
I’m going to Tirupati on work…
Do you want anything?

1553
01:59:38,072 --> 01:59:40,072
Don’t you know what I want?

1554
01:59:40,739 --> 01:59:42,530
Your hands look good.

1555
01:59:43,405 --> 01:59:45,197
Should I bring you gold ring?

1556
01:59:48,739 --> 01:59:51,197
What? Don’t you like gold ring?

1557
01:59:52,614 --> 01:59:53,780
What do you want?

1558
01:59:55,072 --> 01:59:58,447
You are staring at me with eyes wide open.
What happened?

1559
01:59:58,822 --> 02:00:00,239
What are you doing?

1560
02:00:01,155 --> 02:00:02,864
- Going to Tirupati on work

1561
02:00:03,322 --> 02:00:04,989
What are you doing now?

1562
02:00:05,447 --> 02:00:06,822
Looking at you

1563
02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:08,739
Where is your hand?

1564
02:00:08,905 --> 02:00:11,072
what?
- Where is your hand?

1565
02:00:12,364 --> 02:00:15,072
Oh. Did my hand touch you? Sorry dear

1566
02:00:16,697 --> 02:00:19,239
You didn't remove
It is still there.

1567
02:00:19,655 --> 02:00:21,572
I was talking on the phone.. here, I removed it..

1568
02:00:21,864 --> 02:00:24,947
I didn’t realise it because I was busy talking on phone

1569
02:00:25,072 --> 02:00:27,030
You didn’t know, is it?
You didn’t know?

1570
02:00:27,155 --> 02:00:29,530
You didn’t know, is it?
- Hey... Why are you hitting me, dear?

1571
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:31,364
Don’t talk... I'll not come again

1572
02:00:31,364 --> 02:00:33,280
What happened?
-Don't talk.

1573
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,989
I’m leaving now.

1574
02:00:35,447 --> 02:00:38,780
I came here to see your face before
going for money collection.

1575
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:40,530
Do you know how excitedly I came?What?

1576
02:00:41,072 --> 02:00:44,155
Did I come to get hit by you? I will go.

1577
02:00:44,322 --> 02:00:47,780
Stop Darling...
-I'll go...

1578
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:48,822
- This is all waste business.

1579
02:00:48,822 --> 02:00:50,489
Stop Darling
-I will leave

1580
02:00:50,572 --> 02:00:53,405
What Darling?
You only did it and now you are only getting angry.

1581
02:00:54,322 --> 02:00:57,989
Why did you hit me? See… Again,
you are getting angry

1582
02:00:57,989 --> 02:00:59,655
Hold it darling

1583
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:03,489
No, you will again abuse me
- Hold it, Darling

1584
02:01:03,739 --> 02:01:06,322
No, Thanks
- Hold it, Darling

1585
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:09,489
Thanks.

1586
02:01:12,447 --> 02:01:14,780
I will stay, you go dear… go dear…

1587
02:01:20,364 --> 02:01:22,364
Srivalli… Srivalli

1588
02:01:23,697 --> 02:01:25,072
Ok Darling… I leave now

1589
02:01:25,322 --> 02:01:29,572
Hey. What are you doing dear?
They will find it.

1590
02:01:30,697 --> 02:01:34,197
See, if your friend asks, tell her that we were just talking.
Don’t tell her all these things.

1591
02:01:34,905 --> 02:01:35,864
It will spoil my reputation.

1592
02:01:35,864 --> 02:01:37,405
Ok, Darling. I know

1593
02:01:39,822 --> 02:01:41,530
It’s time for work.

1594
02:01:44,405 --> 02:01:46,572
what dear? Looks like a lot happened inside

1595
02:01:46,697 --> 02:01:47,447
Nothing.

1596
02:01:47,447 --> 02:01:50,030
Hey Srivalli.
Ask Pushpa to have tiffin and go.

1597
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:52,530
He had tiffin aunty. He had it just now.

1598
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:54,364
Can’t you see it?

1599
02:01:54,364 --> 02:01:55,239
Srivalli!

1600
02:01:55,572 --> 02:01:56,822
Careful darling

1601
02:01:57,614 --> 02:01:59,030
Darling!

1602
02:02:06,655 --> 02:02:08,114
Someone is coming.

1603
02:02:08,572 --> 02:02:10,239
Pushpa come... please come.

1604
02:02:10,405 --> 02:02:12,322
Shetji, are you fine?

1605
02:02:13,489 --> 02:02:15,280
How are you?
-Fine sir.

1606
02:02:16,322 --> 02:02:17,322
How are you?

1607
02:02:17,447 --> 02:02:18,989
I am fine.

1608
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:57,822
You go... I'll come.

1609
02:02:57,822 --> 02:02:59,280
Pushpa... look, new models have arrived.

1610
02:03:20,322 --> 02:03:22,530
Pushpa, go to new godown.

1611
02:03:33,905 --> 02:03:40,405
If you wear a striking dress and
if we give frightening looks… it scares (Song Humming)

1612
02:03:40,447 --> 02:03:48,530
aa… you get scared. If we come walking with grace
and you stop us for fun… scare… scares..scares

1613
02:03:48,780 --> 02:03:53,197
How did you hear what I was singing to myself?

1614
02:03:53,197 --> 02:03:56,489
Why can’t I hear?
You think we can’t hear whatever you guys speak inside?

1615
02:03:56,780 --> 02:04:03,739
Leave that. When you and Pushpa were talking of beating
Jalreddy, me and Kondareddy sir heard from outside.

1616
02:04:03,905 --> 02:04:06,030
What did you say? Move aside.

1617
02:04:15,822 --> 02:04:17,280
Max Pager Services

1618
02:04:17,780 --> 02:04:20,530
Sister, have to send a message urgently.

1619
02:04:20,739 --> 02:04:21,697
Please tell me the number?

1620
02:05:09,489 --> 02:05:10,489
Get him up.

1621
02:05:12,989 --> 02:05:16,405
What man? Did you forget who we are?

1622
02:05:17,697 --> 02:05:20,864
Just because we gave you four percent share
and a seat next to us,

1623
02:05:20,864 --> 02:05:23,864
do you think we will remain silent
if you lay your hands on our brother?

1624
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:26,614
I will kill you, idiot.

1625
02:05:27,197 --> 02:05:30,280
Hey. He has a 5 crore hawala slip in his pocket.
Search for it.

1626
02:05:31,489 --> 02:05:33,780
Why are you laughing?
- Hit the idiot. Hit him

1627
02:05:34,239 --> 02:05:36,239
My brother is talking and you are laughing at him.

1628
02:05:36,239 --> 02:05:37,822
Else what bro?

1629
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:41,155
I thought you are killing me because of your brother...

1630
02:05:41,572 --> 02:05:43,572
right now I got that you are killing me because of money.

1631
02:05:43,572 --> 02:05:48,572
Now business is good, after killing me
you can takeover all the my share also.

1632
02:05:48,572 --> 02:05:50,822
Hey… to me nothing is bigger than my brother.

1633
02:05:50,989 --> 02:05:54,364
It’s a nice joke bro.
Maybe this is the last joke I will hear.

1634
02:05:54,655 --> 02:05:59,280
What are you searching man?
I keep it in the fold of my hand sleeve right.

1635
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,697
We got the note.

1636
02:06:00,697 --> 02:06:02,822
Kondareddy bro, you have become very commercial.

1637
02:06:02,822 --> 02:06:04,239
Hey Subbareddy. Is it the same note?

1638
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:05,030
Yes Brother. It is the same note.

1639
02:06:05,072 --> 02:06:06,030
On which date do we get our money?

1640
02:06:06,072 --> 02:06:08,989
New title for you. Commercial Kondareddy.
Tag line- No Masculinity

1641
02:06:10,572 --> 02:06:12,072
Hey, take him and throw him in the pit

1642
02:06:12,489 --> 02:06:17,239
I know brother, that these kind of businesses
will definitely see death some day.

1643
02:06:17,572 --> 02:06:22,489
If by mistake, Lord Venkateswara supports me and saves me,

1644
02:06:22,697 --> 02:06:24,864
I will become a very big man for sure.

1645
02:06:25,155 --> 02:06:28,072
I will sit on the top.

1646
02:06:29,614 --> 02:06:32,072
Yes. I can visualize my future.

1647
02:06:36,197 --> 02:06:39,197
Why delay?
Shoot him up.

1648
02:07:24,405 --> 02:07:26,364
Hey, I will kill this Jakkareddy.

1649
02:07:26,364 --> 02:07:28,197
You guys go and kill that Pushpa.

1650
02:10:04,947 --> 02:10:06,072
Cut the rope.

1651
02:10:17,655 --> 02:10:18,697
Quickly.

1652
02:10:22,864 --> 02:10:23,864
Come on cut the rope.

1653
02:10:37,655 --> 02:10:40,739
Pushpa, come fast.

1654
02:10:45,614 --> 02:10:46,489
Pushpa!

1655
02:11:00,489 --> 02:11:01,572
Catch him.

1656
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:04,697
Kill him.

1657
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:14,155
Hold on guys..

1658
02:11:20,697 --> 02:11:22,905
He is getting scared.. he is scared..

1659
02:11:30,614 --> 02:11:33,989
Bro, we found jakkareddy.

1660
02:11:34,072 --> 02:11:36,697
what are you waiting for? Kill him

1661
02:11:36,780 --> 02:11:37,697
I will cut his neck bro…

1662
02:11:37,822 --> 02:11:39,155
then what about that coolie?

1663
02:11:39,155 --> 02:11:42,280
You mean, that Pushpa?
Our men would have killed him by now bro…

1664
02:12:51,405 --> 02:12:53,655
What Jakkareddy?
What are you looking at me like that.

1665
02:12:54,114 --> 02:12:56,030
Is it because I came back?

1666
02:12:56,530 --> 02:12:58,697
You and I may have million things between us…

1667
02:12:58,864 --> 02:13:02,489
but when an outsider comes, you are my partner.
That’s it.

1668
02:13:02,614 --> 02:13:04,030
You think I will sit and watch?

1669
02:13:50,864 --> 02:13:52,239
What man… why are you coming on to me like that.

1670
02:13:53,364 --> 02:13:56,072
If my brother-in-law comes to know of it
he won’t leave you..

1671
02:13:56,239 --> 02:13:57,572
If you something harm to me,
my brother-in-law won’t leave you.

1672
02:14:07,822 --> 02:14:09,780
Why are you taking out the gun? Will you kill me?

1673
02:14:09,905 --> 02:14:12,780
My brother-in-law won’t keep quite if you do anything to me.
He will kill all of you.

1674
02:14:13,030 --> 02:14:16,572
True Pushpa, It will become a big mess if you touch him.

1675
02:14:16,864 --> 02:14:18,947
He is getting scared. He is getting scared.

1676
02:14:19,239 --> 02:14:20,864
Even I want to kill him Pushpa.

1677
02:14:23,947 --> 02:14:26,364
But no… Leave him.

1678
02:14:27,864 --> 02:14:29,197
Let this end with my brother

1679
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:32,239
He is getting scared… Scared.

1680
02:14:32,239 --> 02:14:34,739
That’s all. Everyone should fear my brother-in-law.

1681
02:14:34,864 --> 02:14:36,780
See… here my brother-in-law himself is calling.

1682
02:14:38,655 --> 02:14:40,280
I will go. I will go away.

1683
02:14:40,489 --> 02:14:42,572
Hey Kesava…Start the vehicle.

1684
02:14:42,864 --> 02:14:43,572
Talk..

1685
02:14:44,114 --> 02:14:46,489
Talk to him... you are finished now.

1686
02:14:47,239 --> 02:14:48,989
What man Mogileesu?

1687
02:14:49,197 --> 02:14:50,364
Yeah, Srinu bro…

1688
02:14:51,072 --> 02:14:51,822
Pushpa!

1689
02:14:54,947 --> 02:14:57,655
Bro, they caught Mogileesu.

1690
02:15:00,572 --> 02:15:03,405
Look Pushpa. Listen to what I am saying..

1691
02:15:03,572 --> 02:15:07,947
Let us do business together..
that too at the rate you asked for.

1692
02:15:09,614 --> 02:15:12,864
We will discuss about the rest later.

1693
02:15:12,989 --> 02:15:15,989
Don’t do anything to my brother-in-law.

1694
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:16,989
Okay?

1695
02:15:17,447 --> 02:15:19,739
Areyrey… I just killed him bro.

1696
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:23,655
You should have called me five minutes ego.

1697
02:15:26,155 --> 02:15:32,447
Life will not come back once it is gone. Right, bro.

1698
02:15:32,489 --> 02:15:33,239
Brother in law…

1699
02:15:47,114 --> 02:15:48,489
Why are you silent, bro?

1700
02:15:49,572 --> 02:15:51,280
wondering what that sound is?

1701
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:55,364
You alone know that I am not scared of anyone.

1702
02:15:56,114 --> 02:16:00,780
Now the entire market will know with this sound.

1703
02:16:01,697 --> 02:16:06,030
Bro… Just keep it in your mind

1704
02:16:06,530 --> 02:16:09,530
I didn’t come here to mess with anyone

1705
02:16:10,364 --> 02:16:14,364
I came here to rule.
I won’t compromise.

1706
02:16:30,572 --> 02:16:31,447
Get in Pushpa!

1707
02:17:15,114 --> 02:17:17,405
Bro… That Mangalam Srinu is coming.

1708
02:17:18,614 --> 02:17:21,614
He is coming here to die today.
Hey… Give me the gun

1709
02:17:21,614 --> 02:17:23,322
Hey Jakka .. you hang on,

1710
02:17:24,239 --> 02:17:25,614
I asked Mangalam Srinu to come.

1711
02:17:25,655 --> 02:17:29,239
If you guys fight here, the entire department will be here,

1712
02:17:29,489 --> 02:17:31,114
and I will get everyone killed in an encounter.

1713
02:17:31,239 --> 02:17:33,030
So Let's settle the matter here …

1714
02:18:03,364 --> 02:18:05,989
I will leave if my brother-in-law’s body is given.

1715
02:18:06,030 --> 02:18:08,530
You can go... but, sit first.

1716
02:18:12,114 --> 02:18:14,905
We were like brothers right.
Then What is this?

1717
02:18:14,989 --> 02:18:17,614
You should ask them all that.
It is they who have started all this.

1718
02:18:17,614 --> 02:18:20,072
What is it about starting?
It will not end till you are killed.

1719
02:18:20,114 --> 02:18:22,030
Hey Jakka. You stop …

1720
02:18:22,405 --> 02:18:24,989
Bro, first ask them why they sold stock to Murugan...

1721
02:18:24,989 --> 02:18:28,114
Yes Bro. They sold the stock to Murugan
without Srinanna’s knowledge

1722
02:18:29,114 --> 02:18:32,822
Jakka, shouldn’t everyone stick to the syndicate?

1723
02:18:32,864 --> 02:18:34,530
Why are you guys doing this?

1724
02:18:44,655 --> 02:18:47,239
How much is this?
- Three crores

1725
02:18:48,572 --> 02:18:50,197
How much? How much did you sell a ton for?

1726
02:18:53,655 --> 02:18:54,780
One and half crore.

1727
02:18:57,614 --> 02:19:00,697
What is this?
Is this true?

1728
02:19:00,697 --> 02:19:02,655
I will give all these calculations later

1729
02:19:03,322 --> 02:19:08,780
but what is this man? You not only killed by brother-in-law,
you are also complaining against me

1730
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:13,655
Hey, I didn’t kill your brother-in-law.
I killed the person who killed Kondareddy Bro.

1731
02:19:14,447 --> 02:19:17,905
Do you think I will sit silently and watch
when someone attacks Jakkareddy bro with a knife?

1732
02:19:18,030 --> 02:19:20,322
I shot him.

1733
02:19:20,405 --> 02:19:22,239
You hold on man
- Even I won’t leave.. I will also kill.

1734
02:19:22,239 --> 02:19:24,364
What bro? Looks like both brothers-in-law’s are alike ...
Do you think we are scared?

1735
02:19:24,447 --> 02:19:26,614
What, you will kill? that too in front me.

1736
02:19:27,447 --> 02:19:30,239
Why are you giving the gun?
What is this? Why are you silent?

1737
02:19:30,864 --> 02:19:35,780
Bro .. I called him when he was about to kill
my brother-in-law. Still he killed him.

1738
02:19:35,947 --> 02:19:38,614
Maybe you also called five minutes late like me.

1739
02:19:40,155 --> 02:19:41,655
But anyways, both sides have lost right?

1740
02:19:42,572 --> 02:19:46,197
Hey, put that gun away and first explain the calculations.

1741
02:19:48,155 --> 02:19:50,947
Till now you said, 25 lakhs per ton.. right?

1742
02:19:51,364 --> 02:19:52,989
Then how did he get a crore and half now?

1743
02:19:53,364 --> 02:19:54,614
We also asked him the same Sir?

1744
02:19:54,614 --> 02:19:57,572
Had he answered this, we wouldn’t have gone to Murugan
and things wouldn’t have come to this

1745
02:19:57,697 --> 02:20:00,447
This big man has screwed all of us so badly

1746
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:04,739
What bro Srinu? Why are you silent?
Why don’t you answer when MLA sir is asking you?

1747
02:20:04,864 --> 02:20:07,322
What is this? Should I explain accounts now?

1748
02:20:07,572 --> 02:20:09,530
Have you guys forgotten what all I did so far?

1749
02:20:09,697 --> 02:20:12,739
True Bro. Why are you asking
Srinanna accounts now?

1750
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:14,989
How many people did he manage…?

1751
02:20:14,989 --> 02:20:16,947
How many check-posts he managed?

1752
02:20:16,947 --> 02:20:18,905
Won’t you take all that into account?

1753
02:20:18,905 --> 02:20:21,989
Hello Sir. We are coming there only.

1754
02:20:22,405 --> 02:20:25,364
You are paying off the police.
We are also paying off the police.

1755
02:20:25,447 --> 02:20:28,364
All of you are giving commissions.
Above that, we are also giving commissions

1756
02:20:28,489 --> 02:20:35,114
we are also giving commissions to people
in Forest, revenue, ID,… how will it work out?

1757
02:20:35,447 --> 02:20:37,655
We, together should pay them once only.

1758
02:20:37,947 --> 02:20:40,197
Then see how much will we save?

1759
02:20:40,447 --> 02:20:42,280
Twenty-five percent.

1760
02:20:42,572 --> 02:20:43,989
Which we were wasting.

1761
02:20:45,114 --> 02:20:48,864
Just by bypassing Seenanna and going directly
to Murugan, he paid us one and half crore.

1762
02:20:49,155 --> 02:20:53,489
If we all unite and fix a rate,
he will pay two crores at least.

1763
02:20:53,572 --> 02:20:55,197
What? two crores??

1764
02:20:55,239 --> 02:20:57,530
Bro, the story doesn’t stop here ...

1765
02:20:57,614 --> 02:21:00,697
There is Chatterjee in Calcutta,
and who is that in Mumbai? Ya.. Singh,

1766
02:21:00,697 --> 02:21:03,780
then Agarwal in Delhi.
I kept more people like them, in line.

1767
02:21:04,572 --> 02:21:08,364
Bro, we have the kind of stock
that is not available anywhere in the world.

1768
02:21:08,364 --> 02:21:10,239
We have it here in Tirupati in our Andhra Pradesh.

1769
02:21:10,489 --> 02:21:12,489
The kind that no one on this earth has.

1770
02:21:12,614 --> 02:21:15,405
With that kind of stock we have,
why should we go and ask them.

1771
02:21:15,405 --> 02:21:18,572
We should demand and create competition
amongst the buyers in the market,

1772
02:21:18,572 --> 02:21:20,614
Then they will buy our stock standing in Queue.

1773
02:21:20,697 --> 02:21:23,405
We may get three crores per ton also.

1774
02:21:24,197 --> 02:21:28,405
If we go by that, our MP sir may get
at least 20 crores as commission.

1775
02:21:32,364 --> 02:21:35,447
Yes, Pushpa said it correctly,

1776
02:21:36,405 --> 02:21:39,655
If we hand over the syndicate to a person like this,
our business will be good

1777
02:21:39,655 --> 02:21:43,280
It’s easy to speak sitting on the shore.

1778
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:45,655
You will know the depth when you get into the water.

1779
02:21:47,655 --> 02:21:49,905
Pushpa Come man.
Sit down and tell the whole thing to MP sir...

1780
02:21:55,405 --> 02:21:57,447
Give me one chance, Sir.

1781
02:21:58,030 --> 02:22:00,864
I will make sure that we see the
kind of profits that we have never seen.

1782
02:22:02,822 --> 02:22:04,197
What are you thinking Sir?

1783
02:22:04,739 --> 02:22:06,114
Are you thinking, where is my confidence is coming from?

1784
02:22:06,822 --> 02:22:09,280
None of the stock I have transported so far was ever caught.

1785
02:22:09,864 --> 02:22:12,780
That is my capital.
Trust me, Sir.

1786
02:22:14,030 --> 02:22:16,739
All of you are going with him just because he sold two tons for more.

1787
02:22:17,197 --> 02:22:20,530
Two people are also dead in the last two months
since he has entered the business,

1788
02:22:21,655 --> 02:22:25,822
just think, how many more dead bodies
will we see In the coming days.

1789
02:22:26,655 --> 02:22:30,489
What bro? do you want to believe everything this
youngster said and put the business in his hands?

1790
02:22:30,489 --> 02:22:34,072
Bro, I am not totally convinced.
-If we trust him, we all will go bankrupt.

1791
02:22:34,155 --> 02:22:36,614
Yes bro, Even I’m getting doubts

1792
02:22:38,655 --> 02:22:41,114
Everything he did is right in front of our eyes,
can’t you all see it?

1793
02:22:42,989 --> 02:22:45,572
Pushpa will manage the syndicate from now onwards.

1794
02:22:45,822 --> 02:22:48,822
Everyone should sell their stock to Pushpa only.

1795
02:22:54,489 --> 02:22:56,280
We will have an oath taking ceremony in Kanipakam tomorrow.

1796
02:23:02,364 --> 02:23:03,864
Take this cash and go.

1797
02:23:11,739 --> 02:23:15,155
MP Sir, If they give me my brother-in-law’s body,

1798
02:23:15,739 --> 02:23:17,155
I will go home

1799
02:23:17,489 --> 02:23:21,405
Bro, From the time you came in,
you are sitting on his body only.

1800
02:23:21,405 --> 02:23:23,780
We will send his body safely home if you get up.

1801
02:23:24,447 --> 02:23:26,822
Hey Selva, help Seenanna in the preparations.

1802
02:23:26,822 --> 02:23:28,572
Okay Keshava.
Guys come...

1803
02:23:53,780 --> 02:23:56,364
That side is mine... This side is mine...

1804
02:23:56,697 --> 02:23:59,239
The piece of sky above my head is also mine

1805
02:24:04,739 --> 02:24:07,405
That wrong is mine... This right is mine.

1806
02:24:07,614 --> 02:24:10,280
The fire that burns the right and wrong is also me

1807
02:24:15,739 --> 02:24:20,614
The one who can defeat me is not yet born on the earth
Even If he is born, it would be me again

1808
02:24:21,322 --> 02:24:26,114
There is only one who can grow beyond me
And that’s me, myself in the future

1809
02:24:26,697 --> 02:24:29,572
If I twirl, it’s my mustache
And I hold Axe in my hand…

1810
02:24:29,572 --> 02:24:32,447
Whatever I do is the war
And I never negotiate

1811
02:24:35,155 --> 02:24:37,572
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1812
02:24:40,489 --> 02:24:43,155
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1813
02:24:56,822 --> 02:24:58,489
Will throw you in the lake

1814
02:24:59,614 --> 02:25:01,322
And I return with a fish

1815
02:25:02,364 --> 02:25:04,072
Will stick you to a pole

1816
02:25:04,989 --> 02:25:06,905
And I hoist like a flag

1817
02:25:07,905 --> 02:25:10,530
Will bury you in the soil and make you disappear

1818
02:25:10,572 --> 02:25:14,947
I will be found again as an expensive ore

1819
02:25:16,364 --> 02:25:18,822
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1820
02:25:21,905 --> 02:25:24,364
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1821
02:25:27,197 --> 02:25:29,655
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1822
02:25:39,989 --> 02:25:41,155
Open it.

1823
02:26:14,905 --> 02:26:16,447
What is this Draccha?

1824
02:26:16,864 --> 02:26:19,239
It is six months since my brother died.

1825
02:26:19,614 --> 02:26:24,197
And you are sleeping like a log since then.
How can you?

1826
02:26:24,822 --> 02:26:26,530
What should I do?

1827
02:26:27,197 --> 02:26:30,114
That Pushpa has grown too big,

1828
02:26:30,364 --> 02:26:32,197
and that MP is also in his side.

1829
02:26:32,614 --> 02:26:36,197
We can’t do anything till the government changes ...
We can’t do anything..

1830
02:26:36,739 --> 02:26:41,697
Then you should have waited till the
government changed to send my brother to him.

1831
02:26:42,697 --> 02:26:47,030
Did I send him to get killed? I Sent him to kill ...

1832
02:26:47,364 --> 02:26:50,489
What should I do if he died because of his incapability?

1833
02:26:51,780 --> 02:26:56,530
If so, you also couldn’t kill him ..
Then, why are you still alive?

1834
02:26:56,572 --> 02:26:57,614
What is this Draksha?

1835
02:26:58,030 --> 02:27:00,280
Why are you still alive?

1836
02:27:13,447 --> 02:27:14,947
Hey you idiotic Husband …

1837
02:27:14,947 --> 02:27:16,155
Come back if you are alive

1838
02:27:16,155 --> 02:27:18,280
We will together take revenge..

1839
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:21,405
or else I will go alone and kill him

1840
02:27:21,572 --> 02:27:23,655
Who are you? Who are you?

1841
02:27:24,114 --> 02:27:25,989
I’m the iron I’m the iron

1842
02:27:26,322 --> 02:27:28,780
I will become a knife if I’m put under fire

1843
02:27:32,489 --> 02:27:34,572
Who are you? Who are you?

1844
02:27:34,864 --> 02:27:36,864
I’m the soil I’m the soil

1845
02:27:37,322 --> 02:27:39,947
I will become a brick if you crush me

1846
02:27:43,447 --> 02:27:45,530
Who are you? Who are you?

1847
02:27:45,947 --> 02:27:47,947
I’m the rock... I’m the rock.

1848
02:27:49,989 --> 02:27:53,072
Under these circumstances,
Pushpa's marriage muhurat has been fixed.

1849
02:27:53,572 --> 02:27:55,739
Despite lot of happenings,
his mother's hope never gave up hope.

1850
02:27:56,405 --> 02:27:58,947
To give the marriage card she went to the big house.

1851
02:28:18,739 --> 02:28:20,322
It seems that Puspa is getting married on the 11th

1852
02:28:21,322 --> 02:28:22,780
This is not going to happen.

1853
02:28:23,447 --> 02:28:28,780
I will become the god for sure If you hurt me.

1854
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:31,572
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1855
02:28:34,655 --> 02:28:37,197
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1856
02:28:39,655 --> 02:28:42,197
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1857
02:28:45,489 --> 02:28:48,030
Hey Son… This is my bastion

1858
02:28:59,822 --> 02:29:06,572
With regret, Govindappa resigns and leaves,
claiming responsibility for Bhujanga's murder

1859
02:29:07,864 --> 02:29:12,697
Even though Jalreddy wants take revenge badly,
he was not in a state to get up.

1860
02:29:13,322 --> 02:29:17,530
Burning with vengeance, Dakshayani was left helpless..

1861
02:29:20,155 --> 02:29:23,822
when everyone thought that no one can touch Pushpa.

1862
02:29:25,364 --> 02:29:29,530
The new person arrived.
And the whole story changed

1863
02:29:56,614 --> 02:29:58,155
SP... Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat

1864
02:29:58,530 --> 02:30:01,405
There is nothing to say about him...
you are going to witness him.

1865
02:30:46,114 --> 02:30:47,239
It is strong

1866
02:30:47,905 --> 02:30:49,864
Is it Sheelavathi or what?
- Yes sir ...

1867
02:30:50,697 --> 02:30:51,364
Come!

1868
02:31:04,364 --> 02:31:07,697
Kupparaju, Sheelavathi is strong

1869
02:31:08,072 --> 02:31:09,655
You get good quality here, Sir

1870
02:31:11,614 --> 02:31:13,489
That’s why I got asleep,

1871
02:31:17,405 --> 02:31:22,822
it came and It will come.

1872
02:31:23,864 --> 02:31:26,905
That’s why I’m falling asleep… I will sleep.

1873
02:31:42,364 --> 02:31:44,947
Did you give this to me?
- yes sir

1874
02:31:46,322 --> 02:31:48,739
What is your name?
- Mallesh sir.

1875
02:31:49,114 --> 02:31:50,905
What?
- Mallesh sir.

1876
02:32:16,572 --> 02:32:17,947
What is your name?

1877
02:32:19,489 --> 02:32:23,114
De ... De ...

1878
02:32:25,364 --> 02:32:26,489
Devaraju Sir ...

1879
02:32:30,905 --> 02:32:34,030
Sir…Sir ... Sir ... SP sir ...

1880
02:32:34,447 --> 02:32:37,114
Heard, that you arrested 12 cannabis smugglers.
How,? Sir..

1881
02:32:37,364 --> 02:32:39,739
10 people, not 12 ...

1882
02:32:39,905 --> 02:32:42,239
two fled ...

1883
02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:43,905
They did not run away ...
they were killed.

1884
02:32:43,905 --> 02:32:44,697
Shut up!

1885
02:32:44,697 --> 02:32:46,364
Sir... sir... did you kill them?

1886
02:32:46,405 --> 02:32:51,280
Sir ... he says they were exactly 12 people ...
we also have the same information. Where are the other two?

1887
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:53,072
Sir ... sir ... they were killed sir ... killed sir..

1888
02:32:53,114 --> 02:32:59,905
Didn’t I say that two of them have fled? He is a smuggler...
He doesn’t know the math. I will teach him now

1889
02:33:00,114 --> 02:33:01,530
Sir… what they are saying, is true?

1890
02:33:01,822 --> 02:33:03,072
Sir Media is asking

1891
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:08,239
The new SP has come. I’m going to give him the card.
I will meet you once on the way.

1892
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:10,197
Why do you want to meet?

1893
02:33:10,489 --> 02:33:11,989
I just want to talk

1894
02:33:12,030 --> 02:33:14,572
Just talk?
Will you sit silently once you come?

1895
02:33:14,572 --> 02:33:16,322
A lot will happen after that

1896
02:33:16,697 --> 02:33:19,405
I just want to talk to you and leave.
I will just talk and leave

1897
02:33:19,489 --> 02:33:24,280
What? You will see and go is it,
as if I don’t know what you will do.

1898
02:33:25,739 --> 02:33:30,239
You will tempt me and leave.
I will go sleepless after that.

1899
02:33:30,322 --> 02:33:31,989
Dear, why are you objecting when I say that
I will meet you and once and leave?

1900
02:33:31,989 --> 02:33:32,947
Hey … Where are you going?

1901
02:33:32,947 --> 02:33:33,947
I have a small work

1902
02:33:34,155 --> 02:33:36,947
Hey… You should not go out of home
once we make you a bridegroom.

1903
02:33:36,947 --> 02:33:39,780
Not good for the home.
You tell him, dear

1904
02:33:40,072 --> 02:33:42,322
What ... what is this old woman’s torture?

1905
02:33:42,322 --> 02:33:45,697
Dear… Listen to what I’m telling you ...
I don’t know why but my mind is suspecting harm.

1906
02:33:45,697 --> 02:33:46,405
You talk.

1907
02:33:46,405 --> 02:33:48,697
This is the first holy occasion
happening in my life, my dear son ...

1908
02:33:49,030 --> 02:33:50,405
Pushpa, listen to me.

1909
02:33:52,072 --> 02:33:52,739
Pushpa.

1910
02:33:53,239 --> 02:33:53,947
Come...

1911
02:33:58,280 --> 02:34:00,780
This is the First-time meeting
with the newly appointed SP.

1912
02:34:01,197 --> 02:34:01,655
Sir...

1913
02:34:02,197 --> 02:34:03,239
I brought coffee

1914
02:34:03,239 --> 02:34:04,072
Keep it there

1915
02:34:04,447 --> 02:34:07,197
Had to bend to see him.

1916
02:34:14,405 --> 02:34:15,655
He is only Pushpa Sir.

1917
02:34:15,739 --> 02:34:16,822
I told you about.

1918
02:34:17,114 --> 02:34:19,405
He looks after the entire red sandal syndicate.

1919
02:34:19,947 --> 02:34:22,114
He came to see you, Sir.

1920
02:34:23,197 --> 02:34:26,197
Hello SP…What is your name?

1921
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:30,822
Ban…var sing Skiva…skyavathaa

1922
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:32,905
whatever it is...

1923
02:34:34,114 --> 02:34:37,114
I am getting married on 11th.

1924
02:34:37,197 --> 02:34:38,530
Somehow you…

1925
02:34:40,655 --> 02:34:43,322
should manage and come.

1926
02:34:46,155 --> 02:34:47,405
This is this month’s commission…

1927
02:34:47,822 --> 02:34:48,614
One crore rupees.

1928
02:35:53,697 --> 02:35:56,239
One short!

1929
02:35:58,697 --> 02:36:00,155
One short

1930
02:36:01,114 --> 02:36:01,780
Sir?

1931
02:36:02,572 --> 02:36:04,030
One short

1932
02:36:04,197 --> 02:36:06,197
No Sir, it is all correct.

1933
02:36:12,614 --> 02:36:14,072
One short

1934
02:36:17,489 --> 02:36:18,447
Guys, come on...

1935
02:36:23,072 --> 02:36:26,655
Shall I tell what is the difference
between thief and Police.

1936
02:36:27,072 --> 02:36:30,072
He wore a white shirt… I too wore a white shirt,

1937
02:36:30,155 --> 02:36:34,197
and both look similar… but there is a difference.

1938
02:36:36,239 --> 02:36:39,114
This one has a half-inch sticker. Look…

1939
02:36:40,322 --> 02:36:41,197
It is there sir.

1940
02:36:41,822 --> 02:36:42,947
That is a brand.

1941
02:36:44,572 --> 02:36:45,780
you know what brand is right

1942
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:46,655
Yes Sir.

1943
02:36:47,780 --> 02:36:51,572
In Telugu, you call it (Surname) Illi Peru

1944
02:36:52,530 --> 02:36:53,280
No sir.

1945
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:55,280
Illu Peru

1946
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:56,197
No Sir

1947
02:36:56,905 --> 02:36:57,864
Inti peru (surname)…

1948
02:36:58,155 --> 02:36:58,822
Yes sir.

1949
02:36:59,364 --> 02:37:01,114
It is like a surname…

1950
02:37:02,697 --> 02:37:05,489
It means a stamp that tells who manufactured this...

1951
02:37:06,655 --> 02:37:09,655
who gave birth.
That stamp

1952
02:37:13,114 --> 02:37:16,322
This one has the stamp,

1953
02:37:17,989 --> 02:37:19,197
That’s why it has value.

1954
02:37:20,447 --> 02:37:24,405
That one doesn’t have hence it doesn’t have value.

1955
02:37:26,489 --> 02:37:28,155
The count is right sir.

1956
02:37:29,405 --> 02:37:31,530
There is One short.

1957
02:37:34,655 --> 02:37:39,114
If we have a value, we will know the
value of the other person.

1958
02:37:41,489 --> 02:37:43,280
Tell us your value sir…

1959
02:37:43,489 --> 02:37:44,322
we will pay.

1960
02:37:44,739 --> 02:37:46,572
Mr. Kuppu Raju…
-Sir!

1961
02:37:47,614 --> 02:37:48,572
Handcuff him.

1962
02:37:57,739 --> 02:38:01,155
If I arrest you now and charge you with PD act,

1963
02:38:01,864 --> 02:38:03,614
do you know how many years you will you be jailed?

1964
02:38:03,864 --> 02:38:04,697
Three years Sir.

1965
02:38:04,822 --> 02:38:05,739
Three years…

1966
02:38:06,072 --> 02:38:07,447
Your wedding on the 11th, right?

1967
02:38:07,572 --> 02:38:12,530
If you go to jail now, when will you get married?

1968
02:38:13,697 --> 02:38:15,364
After three years…

1969
02:38:15,739 --> 02:38:21,739
It means when you will get married...
I will decide.

1970
02:38:24,864 --> 02:38:27,280
If your marriage happen…

1971
02:38:28,989 --> 02:38:33,280
When will your wife become pregnant…

1972
02:38:33,947 --> 02:38:36,030
After one month…

1973
02:38:37,447 --> 02:38:38,739
a man

1974
02:38:39,405 --> 02:38:41,072
Pushpa is a man…

1975
02:38:43,197 --> 02:38:46,239
If you go to jail then if she becomes pregnant.

1976
02:38:50,739 --> 02:38:51,905
Are you laughing, right?

1977
02:38:55,114 --> 02:38:57,655
What? tightening fists?

1978
02:38:58,864 --> 02:38:59,947
Getting angry?

1979
02:39:01,489 --> 02:39:02,322
open it… open it

1980
02:39:03,989 --> 02:39:06,614
You don’t have that much luxury with police…

1981
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:09,197
Open your hands… Open your fist…

1982
02:39:10,322 --> 02:39:11,197
Open your fist

1983
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:18,155
Open your fist

1984
02:39:19,989 --> 02:39:20,905
Shh!

1985
02:39:21,489 --> 02:39:23,197
Did you get what was short?

1986
02:39:28,072 --> 02:39:29,697
Hey, you guys hold on.

1987
02:39:35,155 --> 02:39:37,989
Pushpa’s count never wrong.

1988
02:39:41,322 --> 02:39:43,822
Tell me what is short for you sir…

1989
02:39:44,822 --> 02:39:45,572
What?

1990
02:39:47,072 --> 02:39:49,989
What is short for you please tell me sir?

1991
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:51,114
What?

1992
02:39:58,614 --> 02:40:03,947
What is short for you please tell me sir?

1993
02:40:03,947 --> 02:40:04,822
Sir…

1994
02:40:07,030 --> 02:40:08,905
That was short.

1995
02:40:09,697 --> 02:40:19,197
I told you one short; one short right. ‘Sir’, was short.

1996
02:40:20,030 --> 02:40:22,530
shouldn’t say… “You should attend the wedding”.

1997
02:40:23,405 --> 02:40:27,864
You should say “attend the wedding Sir”.

1998
02:40:32,197 --> 02:40:33,905
Mr. Kuppuraju …
-Sir…

1999
02:40:34,322 --> 02:40:35,405
Uncuff him.

2000
02:40:38,489 --> 02:40:39,614
Now the count is correct.

2001
02:40:40,697 --> 02:40:41,864
Bag…bag…bag…

2002
02:40:42,655 --> 02:40:47,072
from now on, along with the cash, sir also should come.

2003
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:55,114
How much sir should take and
how much you will get will be decided by sir.

2004
02:40:55,614 --> 02:40:58,155
Shekhawat sir will decide.

2005
02:41:03,614 --> 02:41:04,239
Pushpa!

2006
02:41:09,322 --> 02:41:10,780
This is my gift for your wedding.

2007
02:41:12,197 --> 02:41:14,572
Buy clothes…branded ones.

2008
02:41:17,114 --> 02:41:18,322
I gave you a gift.

2009
02:41:20,030 --> 02:41:21,405
Won’t you give me a party, Pushpa?

2010
02:41:21,739 --> 02:41:22,947
Don’t know why?

2011
02:41:23,447 --> 02:41:26,405
Pushpa used to do whatever
Shekakavat said from then onwards.

2012
02:41:27,030 --> 02:41:28,739
He used to follow his orders religiously.

2013
02:41:28,739 --> 02:41:31,364
Never seen Pushpa bend before anyone till then.

2014
02:41:31,864 --> 02:41:34,030
This is the first time he was doing so.

2015
02:41:34,447 --> 02:41:36,739
We used to wonder why he is behaving like that.

2016
02:41:37,989 --> 02:41:41,864
That day, a little before Pushpa’s wedding muhurtham,

2017
02:41:41,864 --> 02:41:43,572
Priest called for the bridegroom.

2018
02:41:45,572 --> 02:41:46,697
When we went in to call him,

2019
02:41:48,030 --> 02:41:49,030
Pushpa was not there.

2020
02:41:49,739 --> 02:41:50,822
Even his motorcycle was also not there.

2021
02:42:00,572 --> 02:42:02,989
Wow!!… What is this Sir?

2022
02:42:05,614 --> 02:42:06,905
What is this Sir?

2023
02:42:07,155 --> 02:42:08,989
Never thought you have a funny side too, Sir.

2024
02:42:10,739 --> 02:42:14,989
Singing like a Romeo..

2025
02:42:15,364 --> 02:42:20,280
But that day you scared me with a mask of a tiger.

2026
02:42:20,739 --> 02:42:22,364
Had to scare Pushpa.

2027
02:42:22,947 --> 02:42:26,489
Only then you came know how to behave with me.

2028
02:42:26,947 --> 02:42:30,405
See now we are drinking together happily.

2029
02:42:31,655 --> 02:42:32,655
Where is Pushpa?

2030
02:42:32,655 --> 02:42:35,322
Where did he go?
Auspicious time is nearing..

2031
02:42:38,322 --> 02:42:40,947
Not able to connect. Calling him
-Call him again.

2032
02:42:42,280 --> 02:42:45,197
What Pushpa? Today is your wedding, right?

2033
02:42:45,864 --> 02:42:47,739
And you are here only. Is it ok?

2034
02:42:48,447 --> 02:42:49,447
Sir!

2035
02:42:50,030 --> 02:42:55,280
The wedding can happen.
The bride will be there even if I go half an hour late.

2036
02:42:56,530 --> 02:43:01,322
But you Shekhawat Sir, gave me time to meet you.

2037
02:43:02,197 --> 02:43:04,280
What is more important than that?

2038
02:43:05,114 --> 02:43:07,864
When you referred to the wedding,
I remembered one thing.

2039
02:43:08,072 --> 02:43:14,655
You said, you will decide when my wife should get pregnant,
and at what time she should get pregnant.

2040
02:43:15,947 --> 02:43:18,489
Why did you say that Sir?
I felt very bad.

2041
02:43:20,280 --> 02:43:22,739
Tell me why did you say that Sir?

2042
02:43:23,322 --> 02:43:25,864
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

2043
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:27,614
Why all that now.

2044
02:43:28,530 --> 02:43:29,197
It’s ok sir.

2045
02:43:29,739 --> 02:43:32,364
You must have said that to hurt me.

2046
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:34,239
That’s it, right sir? Leave it.

2047
02:43:35,489 --> 02:43:36,364
But...

2048
02:43:38,197 --> 02:43:44,489
I didn’t like the way you insulted my mother Sir

2049
02:43:44,947 --> 02:43:47,114
What did I say about your mother Pushpa?

2050
02:43:48,280 --> 02:43:52,989
You know that I don’t have a surname right, Sir?

2051
02:43:55,197 --> 02:43:59,114
In spite of that, you insulted me
by saying who manufactured me …

2052
02:43:59,114 --> 02:44:04,405
who gave birth.
Stamp, Stamp… this…that. Right Sir?

2053
02:44:05,239 --> 02:44:07,489
What is this Pushpa?
Why are you spoiling the party mood?

2054
02:44:08,197 --> 02:44:09,489
Why all that now?

2055
02:44:10,739 --> 02:44:15,989
When someone speaks about my surname,
it is like insulting my birth.

2056
02:44:17,155 --> 02:44:19,364
And if someone insults my birth...

2057
02:44:20,905 --> 02:44:22,989
it is like insulting my mother.

2058
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:29,364
Since birth every Idiot has insulted me with this, Sir.

2059
02:44:29,864 --> 02:44:30,655
Pushpa.

2060
02:44:31,489 --> 02:44:33,114
You are drunk and speaking nonsense.

2061
02:44:33,114 --> 02:44:34,447
You are tipsy?

2062
02:44:37,114 --> 02:44:39,989
Yes Sir, I had more.

2063
02:44:41,239 --> 02:44:42,697
In your gun one thing is more.

2064
02:44:42,780 --> 02:44:43,697
What is it?

2065
02:44:44,530 --> 02:44:50,530
Like you, I don’t know how to put
in suspense saying One is more…

2066
02:44:51,114 --> 02:44:52,905
There one extra bullet in that sir.

2067
02:44:56,114 --> 02:44:56,780
In this?

2068
02:44:57,197 --> 02:44:58,030
Yes!

2069
02:44:58,280 --> 02:44:58,905
Give me!

2070
02:45:01,072 --> 02:45:03,155
One, two, three, four.

2071
02:45:03,864 --> 02:45:06,280
There are six Sir…
Did you notice it? One is more

2072
02:45:06,530 --> 02:45:08,155
That is Service revolver Pushpa.

2073
02:45:08,780 --> 02:45:10,489
It will have Six bullets only.

2074
02:45:11,614 --> 02:45:16,780
That day when I tightened my fists hearing your words,
you aimed this gun at me right, Sir.

2075
02:45:17,489 --> 02:45:20,614
The bullet that had to go into this remained in this only.

2076
02:45:20,780 --> 02:45:21,780
That one is more

2077
02:45:49,530 --> 02:45:51,197
Do you know what this is Sir?

2078
02:45:53,072 --> 02:45:55,989
This is my father’s blood which is flowing in my body.

2079
02:45:57,655 --> 02:46:04,572
My father gave me this even before
my brothers could snatch the surname from me.

2080
02:46:06,655 --> 02:46:09,239
No one can separate this from me.

2081
02:46:10,114 --> 02:46:11,405
This...

2082
02:46:12,072 --> 02:46:15,239
This is my brand, Sir…

2083
02:46:30,739 --> 02:46:32,822
Hey, Shekhawat sir… Idiot

2084
02:46:33,280 --> 02:46:36,989
What? did you think I am of a brand
that will get scared of bullet?

2085
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:41,405
This brand has grown with its own attitude.

2086
02:46:42,489 --> 02:46:48,072
Do you know why Pushpa was silent
that day when you said all that?

2087
02:46:49,030 --> 02:46:50,780
My mother didn’t have a wedding in her life.

2088
02:46:51,905 --> 02:46:56,114
This is the first wedding happening in our house.

2089
02:46:57,322 --> 02:47:01,614
I stopped myself till this hour,
thinking my mother will feel bad if anything happens.

2090
02:47:03,364 --> 02:47:05,947
Now I won’t hold myself back.

2091
02:47:06,114 --> 02:47:07,155
Greetings!

2092
02:47:07,905 --> 02:47:09,155
Jakka, Sit down.

2093
02:47:14,322 --> 02:47:16,655
Keshava, Where is Pushpa?

2094
02:47:16,697 --> 02:47:20,655
you are not understanding what you are doing

2095
02:47:20,864 --> 02:47:24,239
What is there to understand?
I'll strip you.

2096
02:47:24,739 --> 02:47:26,489
Take it off.

2097
02:47:29,905 --> 02:47:32,322
Pushpa, do you know with whom you are confronting ?

2098
02:47:33,864 --> 02:47:35,655
Bhanwar Singh.

2099
02:47:36,114 --> 02:47:38,405
Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat

2100
02:47:38,739 --> 02:47:39,780
Is it?

2101
02:47:40,530 --> 02:47:41,989
Then remove your pants also

2102
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:43,197
Why this?

2103
02:47:43,197 --> 02:47:49,697
Pushpa stripped Shekhawat sir’s clothes
and made him stand stark naked..

2104
02:47:49,947 --> 02:47:52,114
imagine how great feels..

2105
02:47:53,447 --> 02:47:55,030
Take it off.

2106
02:48:26,905 --> 02:48:30,655
Did you understand now ? Everyone will feel
the same way when you strip them.

2107
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:35,405
Either it is Shekhawat Sir or Pushpa.

2108
02:48:36,572 --> 02:48:39,697
You don’t have clothes on your body.
I don’t have clothes on my body.

2109
02:48:39,697 --> 02:48:41,864
But there is one difference, do you know it?

2110
02:48:42,614 --> 02:48:45,197
Pushpa started his life like this.

2111
02:48:45,947 --> 02:48:49,405
Do you know what was his range when he was a coolie?

2112
02:48:54,739 --> 02:48:56,322
This was his range

2113
02:48:57,072 --> 02:49:00,030
The range that was then is the same now.

2114
02:49:00,239 --> 02:49:03,655
See, If I go on the road like this also,
they will call me Pushpa.

2115
02:49:03,739 --> 02:49:07,822
If you go on the road like this without a police uniform…

2116
02:49:08,030 --> 02:49:10,989
even your dog won’t recognize you.

2117
02:49:12,905 --> 02:49:17,155
Brand is not in the clothes you wear.
It is in your living

2118
02:49:21,989 --> 02:49:23,447
Hey Shekhawat Sir...

2119
02:49:23,780 --> 02:49:25,530
please keep this in your mind

2120
02:49:26,614 --> 02:49:30,280
The load that has to go will go and the
money 'has to come will keep coming

2121
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:31,905
You won’t get a rupee.

2122
02:49:32,697 --> 02:49:36,780
You will have just the uniform on your body
but you won’t have work to do.

2123
02:49:37,572 --> 02:49:43,405
You will only have ‘Sir’.
I will remove everything else

2124
02:49:43,989 --> 02:49:45,155
See you.

2125
02:50:04,530 --> 02:50:09,530
(Sanskrit Sloka)

2126
02:50:49,655 --> 02:50:51,780
Sorry, Sir… Your dog is not recognising you.

2127
02:50:52,072 --> 02:50:53,489
Hey, keep quiet.

2128
02:51:09,239 --> 02:51:10,239
What, dear?

2129
02:51:10,655 --> 02:51:12,697
What is this attire?
Why did you come like this?

2130
02:51:12,780 --> 02:51:13,905
What happened?

2131
02:51:35,197 --> 02:51:38,197
Someone thought Pushpa means flower.

2132
02:51:42,572 --> 02:51:45,030
I showed him that Pushpa means fire.

2133
02:51:45,947 --> 02:51:48,364
Ok. It’s all over, right?

2134
02:51:51,739 --> 02:51:53,530
Just started

2135
02:51:54,114 --> 02:51:54,989
What happened sir?

2136
02:51:56,989 --> 02:51:58,280
Pushpa!

2137
02:52:02,780 --> 02:52:04,822
Whoever comes...

2138
02:52:07,155 --> 02:52:08,905
Will not budge.
