1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,378
-(indistinct chatter)
-(siren blaring)

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,843
(camera shutter clicks)

3
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:20,895
THREE HOURS AGO

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,192
(grunts)

5
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,948
SEJIN: Chanmi! Ok Chanmi!

6
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,200
Huh?

7
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,161
Sejin!

8
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,333
(light music)

9
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,218
This is...

10
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,679
How do you have this?

11
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,849
Honestly, I knew
you were Wonseok's younger sister.

12
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,227
I didn't want to tell you
that I knew before you told me about it.

13
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,355
Did my older brother tell you about me?

14
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,316
Yes.

15
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,901
He also shared this photograph with me.

16
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,027
Ah...

17
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,572
Seems like he trusted you a lot.

18
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,866
But hey...

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,576
What are you doing here so early
in the morning?

20
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,746
Oh... The day I leave for the States
has finally been set.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,206
My flight will be ten days from today.

22
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,916
I guess there really isn't much time left.

23
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,752
We don't have much time.

24
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,214
That's why I thought
I should tell you everything I know.

25
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,843
I was the one who...

26
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,012
left the note in your locker.

27
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,556
What?

28
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,643
Th... that was you?

29
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,603
I wanted to tell you the truth earlier.

30
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,814
But you ended up finding out
about the Piano Café on your own

31
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,273
and making your way there.

32
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,693
How did you know
I had transferred to Seoul?

33
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,863
SEJIN: <i>It was three or four days
into the semester.</i>

34
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,826
-DAYEON: Hey, Chanmi, Chanmi! Hurry up.
-Oh, okay, I'm coming.

35
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,077
SEJIN: <i>After I dropped out of school,</i>

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,370
<i>I came to pick up some paperwork
at school that day.</i>

37
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,247
<i>That's when I saw you.</i>

38
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,042
Ok Chanmi?

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,295
SEJIN: <i>Since then,
I loitered in front of the school a lot.</i>

40
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,881
I even saw you riding your scooter
to school.

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,301
I thought a lot about if I should, like,
approach you to introduce myself.

42
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:20,807
Then I thought to myself, what's the point
of introducing myself to you now?

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,808
But then...

44
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,268
Then?

45
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,019
Ah, there's...

46
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,065
There's something
I need to tell you first.

47
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:34,154
That video of Wonseok falling
that was played in the auditorium...

48
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,614
it was me who played the video.

49
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,616
What?

50
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,453
(gasps)

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,292
How... where did you get
ahold of that video?

52
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,836
I recorded it myself with my cell phone.

53
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,633
DECEMBER 23RD, LAST YEAR

54
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,010
SHARED STUDY CAFÉ

55
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,640
(soft chuckle)

56
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,150
(chuckle continues)

57
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,280
(grunts)

58
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,199
(soft chuckle)

59
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,867
(body thuds in distance)

60
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,374
(ominous music)

61
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,295
(groans)

62
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,713
(Sejin gasps)

63
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,089
(whispers)
Wonseok...

64
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,425
(breathes deeply)

65
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,053
SEJIN: <i>I was so scared.</i>

66
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>I was so scared
and heartbroken at the time.</i>

67
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,059
(sighs)
<i>So, I just ran away.</i>

68
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,604
Why didn't you...

69
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,066
tell the police about the video
from the beginning?

70
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,567
Why didn't you tell them
it was a murder, not a suicide?

71
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,736
I also thought it was a suicide.

72
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,655
(sighs deeply)

73
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,491
I couldn't bear to think that Wonseok
would kill himself.

74
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,409
That's why I dropped out of school,

75
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,620
got a new cell phone,
and a new number, too.

76
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,081
I stopped contacting anybody I knew
and meeting up with them after that.

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,252
Honestly, I couldn't bring myself to watch

78
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,921
the video on that phone again.

79
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,049
(sighs lightly)

80
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,638
I'm not going to ever come back
once I leave.

81
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,890
So, I wanted to resolve things
before I left.

82
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,103
SEJIN: <i>After hesitating
and agonizing for a while,</i>

83
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:37,110
<i>I took out the phone I had put away
and rewatched that video.</i>

84
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,736
YJ
TELECOM

85
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,822
(shaky breathing)

86
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,658
<i>It was already agonizing
to watch that video again, but then...</i>

87
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,331
(gasps)

88
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,000
<i>I saw that someone
had pushed Wonseok out the window,</i>

89
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,127
<i>and I was even more shocked...</i>

90
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,837
(gasps)

91
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,881
That's when I thought
I should let you know right away.

92
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,385
SEJIN: <i>I also thought I should let
the other students and the teachers know.</i>

93
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,928
That's why I played the video
in the auditorium.

94
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,472
-(students scream)
-STUDENT 1: It's Park Wonseok!

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,642
(ominous music)

96
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,063
If the police find the murderer
before we do,

97
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,858
we won't even have a chance
to get our revenge on the murderer.

98
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,402
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

99
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,988
One way or another,
let's find the murderer before they do.

100
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,906
Sejin.

101
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,618
You already have a suspect in mind,
don't you?

102
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,083
Who do you think did it?

103
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,131
(inhales deeply)

104
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,507
Ji Sooheon.

105
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,512
Ji, Ji Sooheon?

106
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,231
Did everything go okay last night?

107
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,274
Everything went well.

108
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,442
(sighs)

109
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,860
Okay.

110
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,071
Ah!

111
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,203
That bastard

112
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,954
will visit the hospital today
to apologize.

113
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,332
(sighs)
Though that punk really deserves to die.

114
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,169
Good work.

115
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,838
(light music)

116
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,228
Hey, Sooheon!

117
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,855
Huh? Hey, Jaebum.

118
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,110
Hey, what's up?
What happened to you last night?

119
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,569
I'm so sorry.

120
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,240
I had an urgent matter.
I'm really, really sorry.

121
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,743
Hey, you should've messaged me,
or at least given me a call.

122
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,120
I was so frustrated
I didn't think I could stand it.

123
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,037
But I sent you a text message
letting you know

124
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,955
I couldn't go to the game.

125
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,290
Really? I didn't get a text message.

126
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,503
Yeah, look, no message.

127
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,546
Ugh, how annoying.

128
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,297
I turned my cell phone off
without checking

129
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,424
to see if the message went through.

130
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,759
Wow, we were about to become arch enemies
because of a simple misunderstanding.

131
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,094
I'm so sorry, seriously.

132
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,805
It's fine. It wasn't your fault.
Things just happen sometimes.

133
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,432
(sighs)

134
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,808
SOOHEON: I'm really sorry, truly.

135
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,144
JAEBUM: It's really fine.
Let's go see another game next time.

136
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,105
SOOHEON: I'm seriously so sorry.
Why don't we have lunch together?

137
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,648
Are you at least
going to have lunch with me?

138
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,983
(chuckles)
Oh, come on.

139
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,359
Now it's

140
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,695
Ji Sooheon...

141
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,948
JAEBUM: Hey, Osung.

142
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,951
THE DAY BEFORE

143
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,036
-JAEBUM: Gi Osung!
-(Osung sighs)

144
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,588
LITERATURE

145
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,843
What's going on with you?
Is there anything wrong with this photo?

146
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,094
Jaebum.

147
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,846
Don't you know that detectives
are all over the place

148
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,514
to work on Park Wonseok's case?

149
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,934
What's so bad about having
taken a photo once with Park Wonseok?

150
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,437
Is it a problem that I used
to know Park Wonseok?

151
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,732
Let's say you naïvely
brought this picture to school

152
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,650
and the other students saw
that you had this.

153
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,110
And that that caught
the attention of the detectives.

154
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,739
Then a detective might ask you
how you were so close to Park Wonseok

155
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,449
even though you were in different grades.

156
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,160
How will you answer that question?

157
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,663
If you say you don't remember,

158
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,665
do you think the detectives
will leave it at that?

159
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,125
They'll start contacting students
who graduated,

160
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,627
people who were in your grade,
and start digging around.

161
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,545
(sighs)

162
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,881
It won't do you any good
if you get involved with the police.

163
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,133
Jaebum.

164
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,177
Don't trust anyone else but me
and remember what I said.

165
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,805
You never even knew Park Wonseok.

166
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,142
(ominous music)

167
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,444
(lighter clicks)

168
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,584
(siren blaring)

169
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,226
(camera shutter clicks)

170
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,062
(ominous music)

171
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,494
This reminds me of the incident
in the dark room at Yongtan High.

172
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,829
(camera shutter clicks)

173
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,290
He was bound to the chair with tape
and then beaten up.

174
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,001
-(sighs)
-(camera shutter clicks)

175
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:51,757
REVENGE OF OTHERS

176
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,639
TEACHER: "The red sun is over
the tip of the western mountain."

177
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,642
It's evening, and the sun's
about to go down.

178
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,603
The image of the downward movement
of the sun

179
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,229
reinforces the atmosphere of mourning.

180
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,648
Like this, sunsets are often used
as metaphors

181
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:12,361
for descent, disappearance,
destruction, or death.

182
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,740
Now take a look at the next sentence...

183
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,992
(shaky breathing)

184
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:23,080
Is there any reason
why you think Sooheon is the culprit?

185
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,045
I saw him.

186
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,422
(exhales deeply)

187
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,716
(shaking)
You saw...

188
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,302
Sooheon?

189
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,804
(suspenseful music)

190
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,726
(breathes shakily)

191
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,231
(suspenseful music continues)

192
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,279
TEACHER: What we know for certain
is that the speaker,

193
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,906
who is watching the deer, is sad.

194
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,994
And we can say the speaker is projecting
their sadness on the deer.

195
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,538
That's why some people say
that this is the part

196
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,625
where the speaker's sadness starts
to expand throughout the world.

197
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,293
In the first and second paragraphs...

198
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,545
(indistinct chatter)

199
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,634
-DAYEON: Wow, this is incredible news.
-NARIN: What?

200
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,344
It's about Ok Chanmi.
This is an incredible update.

201
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,096
(groans)
Wow.

202
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,889
Ok Chanmi and Park Wonseok
are actually siblings.

203
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,807
What?

204
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,933
Apparently, somebody heard this

205
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,393
from the detective
working on Park Wonseok's case.

206
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,560
They're siblings.

207
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,229
Wow, that really hit a nerve.

208
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,357
So, she's been keeping that a secret? Why?

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,150
(indistinct chatter)

210
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,532
SEJIN: <i>It was Ji Sooheon.</i>

211
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,867
<i>I saw him.</i>

212
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,122
<i>I saw the red shoelaces on his shoes,
I swear.</i>

213
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,834
-Hey.
-(gasps)

214
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,669
I heard you're Park Wonseok's
younger sister?

215
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,504
(laughs)
Seriously, you're...

216
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,047
(sighs)

217
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,173
You've got me.

218
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,592
Bitch, I mean, seriously?

219
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,760
You're the one that went
around telling everyone

220
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,345
that Osung and I are siblings.

221
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,889
I already told you
it wasn't me who blabbed.

222
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,142
-Just stop.
-Stop what?

223
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,601
I haven't even started yet.

224
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,271
Why did you keep it a secret?

225
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,231
Did you do that
so that you could sniff around

226
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,024
to learn more about Park Wonseok's death?

227
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,109
Did you have fun playing detective

228
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,527
and pretending
you had nothing to do with him?

229
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,029
It must have been a ton of fun
turning this school upside down, huh?

230
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,239
Hey, Jihyun.

231
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,286
How could you even say that?

232
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,539
-AJUNG: A classmate died.
-JIHYUN: Oh.

233
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,875
So you're siding with her
because she's your ex-boyfriend's sister?

234
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,710
Why don't you two just hug and cry it out?

235
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,254
Shut up. That was low.

236
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,548
Get lost, or I might smack you,
and you might end up sobbing...

237
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,632
-(screams)
-(indistinct chatter)

238
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,302
(groans)
Hey! Let me go!

239
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,888
STUDENT 1: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

240
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,639
-(Jihyun groans)
-Fucking bitch!

241
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,600
Leave me alone!
(screams)

242
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,143
-Hey!
-STUDENT 2: Stop them!

243
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,353
-(groans)
-(student grunts)

244
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,855
(grunts)
You!

245
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,814
-(grunts)
-(screams)

246
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,191
-(student groans)
-(breathes heavily)

247
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,609
-STUDENT 3: Get up.
-(groans)

248
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,486
(grunts)

249
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,029
(indistinct chatter)

250
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,823
(Chanmi grunts)

251
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,367
(both grunt)

252
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,411
-(breathes deeply)
-(grunts)

253
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,205
Shit! Ha, fuck!

254
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,165
Hey, hey, Chanmi, Chanmi,
don't do that, Chanmi.

255
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,249
-This fucking...
-(Nakjun groans)

256
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,334
Hey, stop! Stop it.

257
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,294
-(grunts)
-Just calm down.

258
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,922
(grunts)

259
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,970
HYEJEONG: Mr. Jo, what's going on
at school these days?

260
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,013
(sighs)

261
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,807
Can't you see what happened
to my daughter's face?

262
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,350
DEOKHYEON: I'm so sorry, ma'am.

263
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,103
It wasn't a fight.
Clearly, she was beaten up.

264
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,564
Yes, that's what the other students
are saying as well.

265
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,774
Expel her from school.

266
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,901
If you don't,
you'll have bigger problems to face.

267
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,027
Uh... I...

268
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,489
I heard that Mr. Gi,
Osung's father, is part of your family.

269
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,449
I heard about it recently.

270
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,993
So, since her father
is the chief of the police station...

271
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,663
That's why
I'm not just going to let this go.

272
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,706
Expel her from school.

273
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,753
(breathes deeply)

274
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842
SOYEON: Are you feeling okay?

275
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,009
I'm eating so much.

276
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,553
When are you going to show me
your husband's face?

277
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,512
(chuckles awkwardly)

278
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,306
Give it some time.
I'll show you when the time comes.

279
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,977
Ugh, no matter how much I think about it,
you are one crazy bitch.

280
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,896
I would agree.
I'm kind of all over the place.

281
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,690
(laughs)

282
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,652
Uh...

283
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,237
What did the teacher say?

284
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,198
He told me to stay home for a few days
and not get into any more trouble.

285
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,701
Meanwhile, he'll do his best to make sure
I'm not suspended or expelled.

286
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,911
Oh, wow, he's such a nice human being.

287
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,331
Well, he's kind of a weasel,
but he's a nice person.

288
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,750
Of course, since he's so ugly,
he has to at least be nice.

289
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,169
-(Soyeon laughs)
-(scoffs)

290
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,053
AJUNG: No wonder.

291
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,472
I thought it was weird how you were
so curious about Wonseok.

292
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,976
In any case,
you must have gone through a lot.

293
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,978
Uh, it's just...

294
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,564
Do you mind if we talk about him?

295
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,525
No, of course not.

296
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,568
I only hid the fact
that I'm his younger sister

297
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,903
because I was afraid people
wouldn't talk to me about him.

298
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:08,115
You see, Wonseok was
a pretty nice guy up to sophomore year.

299
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,658
I heard that too.

300
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,369
That he was strong
but never bullied anybody.

301
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,455
If anything,
he protected other students from bullies.

302
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,918
During junior year,
he made a complete 180 like he went crazy.

303
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,378
He started beating up other students,
hanging out with bullies,

304
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,504
and bullying other kids himself.

305
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,006
In any case, if something
didn't go his way,

306
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,841
he'd create a total mess
out of the situation.

307
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,094
But as far as I know,

308
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,055
it was all because of Gi Osung.

309
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,473
Gi Osung?

310
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,225
Oh, so, are you saying
Gi Osung turned Wonseok into a bully?

311
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,270
I mean, Gi Osung is the
class president posing as a good guy.

312
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,521
But Wonseok was the top dog
in the entire school.

313
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,982
Wonseok was a much better fighter,

314
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,609
so why would he ever take orders
from Gi Osung?

315
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,236
I'm telling you the truth.
He did whatever Gi Osung told him to do.

316
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,949
I've never told this to anyone before,

317
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,786
but what happened is, Gi Osung
was manipulating Park Wonseok.

318
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,455
It was when I started

319
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,125
my secret relationship with my hubby.

320
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,006
AJUNG: <i>So, we were having
an intimate moment together, when...</i>

321
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,763
WONSEOK: Hey, Gi Osung!

322
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,723
(gasps)

323
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,142
What is it that you needed to tell me?

324
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,186
Hey, Wonseok.

325
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,981
Did you think I was joking?
Why didn't you do what I told you to?

326
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,651
You bastard. I told you to do
whatever it took to stop Im Somi

327
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,444
from spreading lies
that I got her pregnant.

328
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,656
How can I possibly stop her
from blabbing to people?

329
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,366
Since I broke up with that bitch Im Somi,

330
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,995
she's been trying to drag me down
by telling everyone that she's pregnant.

331
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,705
Whether you kill her
or tear off her mouth, I don't care.

332
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,123
Just make sure she keeps her mouth shut.

333
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,333
This is your last warning.

334
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,628
(sighs)

335
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,800
Fine. Then this will be the last time.

336
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,677
That all depends on how you handle this.

337
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,811
(sighs)
Yeah, that's right.

338
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,688
So, it's true that Osung
had something on Wonseok

339
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,981
and manipulated him.

340
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,150
Ah, I did have some vague sense
that that was the case.

341
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,401
What did he have on Wonseok?

342
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,610
Huh?

343
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,656
I don't really know
what that might've been, but...

344
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,243
I mean, what exactly did he use
against my brother

345
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,953
to do anything he wanted?

346
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,329
What kind of weakness would he have had
that would've made my brother

347
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,831
do all those bad things?

348
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,083
Oh, but something
that really confuses me is...

349
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,003
Later, towards the end
of the second semester,

350
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,173
it was Wonseok
that had the upper hand over Osung.

351
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,384
Like the situation had changed completely.

352
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,470
(sighs deeply)

353
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,099
The picture on the left
is from the body shop murder case,

354
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,893
which we received this morning.

355
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,103
The one on the right
is from the assault case,

356
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,481
which was reported from Yongtan High
on March 17th of this year.

357
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:50,486
The commonality between these two cases
is that the victims were former assailants

358
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,029
in school violence cases.

359
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,741
Also, the victims were bound
to chairs with tape.

360
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,912
We've yet to receive the lab results,

361
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,540
but there's a possibility
that it's the same tape.

362
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,959
In one case, the victim died.

363
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,797
In the other,
the victim was seriously injured.

364
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,842
In the assault case,
the victim's toes were crushed to pieces.

365
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,970
The direct cause of death
in the body shop case

366
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,140
is currently presumed
to be suffocation from strangulation.

367
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,769
Sir, we'll determine
if there's a clear connection

368
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,771
between the cases as we investigate them.

369
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,982
Well, since this is a homicide case,
the homicide division should work on it.

370
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,153
But I do think
there's a connection between the cases.

371
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,780
So I want Jin Sojeong's team
to join as well.

372
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,573
Yes, sir.

373
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,286
ENGINE OIL - WHEEL ALIGNMENT

374
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,914
JUNGGYEONG: <i>I don't remember anything
since I couldn't see his face.</i>

375
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,207
I can't recall anything either

376
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,708
because I was getting beaten up
like crazy.

377
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,876
YOUNG STRONG TIRE
JUNGGYEONG

378
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,296
But in any case,
I think he had a distinct smell.

379
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,048
Could you elaborate?

380
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,677
Well, it smelled like oil and alcohol.

381
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,221
What kind of oil?
Like the oil you smell here?

382
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,348
Or like the oil you smell
at a barbecue restaurant?

383
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,684
Or gasoline from a gas station,
lubricant oil from a factory,

384
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,852
engine oil from a body shop,
cooking oil from a chicken restaurant...

385
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,019
I think it was lubricant oil
from a factory.

386
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,564
It smelled like oil from a machine.

387
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,898
Oil from a factory machine...

388
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,483
How about the alcohol?

389
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,693
Are you sure
it wasn't the smell of liquor?

390
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,863
It smelled like the alcohol you
would find in a hospital.

391
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,447
Alcohol found in a hospital...

392
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,700
(inhales deeply)

393
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,744
Can you describe the moment
you first encountered the assailant

394
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,371
in the dark room again?

395
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,290
Well, you couldn't even call it a moment.

396
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,250
Shit, it's kind of embarrassing.

397
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,879
I was knocked out in a single punch.

398
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,172
Anyways.

399
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,757
Ugh, well, shit,
he's got a hell of a punch, eh?

400
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,551
The culprit might be a pro.

401
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,219
So you mean like a professional boxer?

402
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,387
(laughs)
Nope.

403
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,597
(scoffs)

404
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,891
Not a pro athlete.
More like a pro gangster.

405
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,851
How about the way he talked?

406
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,311
Other than the fact
that he used a voice modulator.

407
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,562
Other than that I can't really...

408
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,231
Did he have an accent,
or talk like a gangster?

409
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,150
(inhales deeply)

410
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,777
Well, now that I think about it,
I don't think he talked like a gangster.

411
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,823
Oil, alcohol, a lightning-fast punch,
a normal accent.

412
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,908
(sighs)

413
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,285
Doesn't this feel like a mystery
from a detective novel?

414
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,786
(tongue clicks)

415
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,791
You mean the assault in the dark room?

416
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,085
Are you talking about Sa Junggyeong?

417
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,630
You ran into Ji Sooheon
in an alley that night.

418
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,048
Can you remember anything
in particular from...

419
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,592
Wait, hold on a moment.
Hold on a moment, detective.

420
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,928
Weren't you investigating
my older brother's case?

421
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,722
There's a connection between the cases,
so that's why I'm questioning you.

422
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,932
Are you saying...

423
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,476
that it's the same culprit?

424
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,603
No...

425
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,355
That's not what I meant.

426
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,315
What I meant is that
I'm carrying out my investigation

427
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,733
and leaving it open to all possibilities.

428
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,403
Hey, try to remember what happened
when you ran into Ji Sooheon that night.

429
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,696
Even the tiniest thing might be helpful.

430
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,740
Now, it goes without saying that
our conversation here will be classified,

431
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,450
so this stays between us.

432
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,329
-Chanmi...
-Is the perpetrator in my brother's case

433
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,123
and the perpetrator
in the dark room assault case

434
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,876
the same person?

435
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,003
That's why, if you want
to catch your brother's murderer,

436
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,171
you have to think hard about

437
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,632
whether there was anything strange
with Ji Sooheon that night.

438
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,678
Sa Junggyeong?

439
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,681
I didn't have any issues
with him at school,

440
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,057
nor did I have any interest in him.

441
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,351
Do you usually work out over there?

442
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,436
-Sorry?
-That night,

443
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,357
you ran into Ok Chanmi in the alley
on your way back

444
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,193
after working out
at the Unmacheon walkway.

445
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,237
Yes, occasionally.

446
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,739
I was under the impression
that you usually work out at this gym.

447
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,826
But you worked out
at the Unmacheon walkway that night?

448
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,829
I didn't say that I worked out
at the Unmacheon walkway that night only.

449
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,706
What I mean is that I work out
over there occasionally.

450
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,710
When did you start
practicing martial arts?

451
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,087
Since I was in 9th grade.

452
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,548
Oh, you must be really good by now.

453
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,757
With a strong punch.

454
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,134
Are you planning to become
a professional athlete?

455
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,260
(chuckles awkwardly)

456
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,720
It's just a hobby.

457
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,764
I'm only asking because it's something
I've been curious about.

458
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,561
Is it possible to knock someone out
with a single bare-fisted punch?

459
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,022
If the person's struck
at a pressure point, it might be possible.

460
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,606
Like on the jaw or the temples?

461
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,442
Yeah, well, probably.

462
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,528
Have you ever managed to do that yourself?

463
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,488
No.

464
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,493
(sighs)

465
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,288
On March 17th,

466
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:16,126
the night Sa Junggyeong
was assaulted in the dark room,

467
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,503
there were witnesses
standing in front of the student center.

468
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,589
A boy and a girl.

469
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,676
They testified that someone
in a mask hopped over a wall.

470
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,554
If you were to have jumped over the wall,

471
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,974
you'd find yourself in the alley
where you and Chanmi ran into each other.

472
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,978
Did you see anyone else in the alley?

473
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,564
Anyone suspicious?

474
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,233
Chanmi was the only person I ran into.

475
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,780
The shoelaces on your sneakers,

476
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,865
are those the ones that are normally
on your shoes?

477
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,200
They look nice.

478
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,369
I switched them out recently.

479
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,497
Because I have some kind of a jinx.

480
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,374
Can I ask about the jinx?

481
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,128
I'd rather not talk about that
unless it's related to the investigation.

482
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,546
Ah...

483
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,006
Sorry.

484
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,841
I'm sorry.

485
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,304
(light music)

486
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,352
(suspenseful music)

487
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,194
(footsteps approaching)

488
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,993
(suspenseful music continues)

489
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,188
Mother, it's me.

490
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,735
I'm fine.

491
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,739
I'm sorry. Please don't worry.

492
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,493
But mother...

493
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,539
I'm not sure where I am right now.

494
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,711
(birds chirping)

495
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,357
The kids started eating first.

496
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,694
(clatters)

497
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,117
Osung, what were you doing while Jihyun
was being beaten up like this?

498
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,369
-(Wangdo clicks tongue)
-Oh, why are you blaming Osung?

499
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,288
Do you really think Osung
would've let this happen if he were there?

500
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,706
He wasn't there to stop it.

501
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,042
In any case, I'm not going to let
this girl get away

502
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,418
with just an expulsion
for doing this to Jihyun.

503
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,961
I'm going to pursue criminal charges.

504
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,047
Please be firm with the school
when you speak to them.

505
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,381
Of course I will.

506
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,925
Oh, also, there seems to be a lot going on

507
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,927
at Yongtan High these days, so be careful.

508
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,304
In fact, the assailant
from the dark room case

509
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,014
is a student at your school!

510
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,434
Isn't it better not to catch the culprit
from the dark room case?

511
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,145
Sa Junggyeong got what he deserved,
so it was just justice being served.

512
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,313
What are you talking about?

513
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,898
Justice is enforced by the police.

514
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,068
Because we didn't pursue that guy,
he ended up even committing murder!

515
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,988
Did someone die?

516
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,242
(clears throat)

517
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,495
Don't tell anyone at school about this.

518
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,872
Of course the kids know not to do that.

519
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,626
But still, just be careful what you say.

520
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,254
I guess somebody
had better be extra careful, then.

521
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,550
(sighs)

522
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,686
Hey!

523
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,938
Aren't you supposed to go that way?

524
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,233
Why should I take a detour?
Everyone knows by now.

525
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,443
This route is much shorter.

526
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,198
Shit, my reputation is ruined
because of that bitch Ok Chanmi.

527
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,575
Are you going to get her
kicked out of school?

528
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,244
Whether it's expulsion or suspension,
we can't let her leave the school.

529
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,706
Better that I keep her near me
to make her behave like a good girl.

530
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,166
A good girl who will tremble in fear
whenever she sees me.

531
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,751
I'll teach her a real lesson.

532
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,005
I guess you'll have a lot on your hands
teaching her a lesson and all.

533
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,340
Now that I think about it,
it's fucking outrageous.

534
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,218
The fact that Ok Chanmi
and Park Wonseok were siblings.

535
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,680
She must've been spying on us,
like we're the suspects.

536
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,183
Damn, I really can't forgive her.
Seriously I'm going to kill--

537
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,728
(groans)
Shit.

538
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,729
Hey, Jihyun.

539
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,481
Don't even think about
calling up your cronies to beat her up.

540
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,650
If something goes wrong,
that'll be on your student record.

541
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,736
-And then you can kiss college goodbye.
-Do you think I'm an amateur?

542
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,279
Just don't do anything.

543
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,655
I'll handle this one.

544
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,450
In a way you'll see fit.

545
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,826
What a joke.

546
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,329
(birds chirping)

547
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,464
YONGTAN HIGH
YONGTAN HIGH SCHOOL

548
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,758
(suspenseful music)

549
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,762
(gunshot)

550
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,816
AJUNG: <i>Osung was manipulating Wonseok.</i>

551
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,943
<i>Osung was behind
all the bad things he did.</i>

552
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,236
You're working so hard.

553
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,992
Well, the school
is offering me a scholarship,

554
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,286
so I guess I have to at least pretend
to be working hard.

555
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,746
Don't you have class?

556
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,415
I have something else
that's more important than class.

557
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,375
I'm here because your case
has been opened up

558
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,417
by the school violence committee.

559
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,505
-Did you come for an apology?
-No, no.

560
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,714
I'll apologize first.

561
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,176
Sorry, I know Jihyun
has been an ass to you.

562
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,221
This is just a possibility for now, but...

563
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,764
things are going to get complicated
for you if you're expelled

564
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,849
or suspended from school.

565
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,977
My father...

566
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,480
I mean, Jihyun's father,
is a police chief.

567
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,484
If he gets mad and overreacts,
things might get complicated for you.

568
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,404
This is why I'm saying this to you now.

569
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,823
I'll do my best to make sure
you're not expelled from school.

570
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,203
And why would you do that?

571
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,249
I guess I consider myself indebted to him

572
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,209
for the things I couldn't apologize for.

573
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,963
Though I'm not sure
if I can make up to him in this way...

574
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,383
Regardless, I'm being genuine,
so I hope you'll take it that way.

575
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,927
Hope you have a good practice.

576
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,850
Oh, one more thing.

577
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,104
I'll help you find Wonseok's murderer.
I'll do whatever I can.

578
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,066
(light music)

579
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,409
(birds chirping)

580
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,919
(water sloshing)

581
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,888
(light music continues)

582
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,941
(sighs deeply)

583
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,461
GI OSUNG

584
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,063
JUNGGYEONG: Ji Sooheon,
you motherfucker. Come here.

585
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,314
Eh?

586
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,066
I said, come here, you son of a bitch.

587
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,818
My bros wanted to pay you a visit,
you fucker.

588
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,985
(Junggyeong tongue clicks)

589
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,287
Is it possible to knock someone out
with a single bare-fisted punch?

590
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,331
Have you ever knocked someone out?

591
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,210
-MAN 1: Bastard!
-(Sooheon groans)

592
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,795
-(Sooheon groans)
-(grunts)

593
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,296
-MAN 1: Get up.
-MAN 2: You.

594
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,131
(Sooheon groans)

595
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,758
-Hey, hey!
-(breathes heavily)

596
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,219
-Where are your balls, you son of a bitch!
-(breathes deeply)

597
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,304
-Crush him.
-(grunts)

598
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,014
Fuck.
(grunts)

599
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,684
Bro, I think that's enough.

600
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,561
I bet the other fuckers already
reported this when they passed by.

601
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,272
He's a pile of mush.
Does he even know how to punch?

602
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:01,109
Agh, what's wrong with him?
Was he just amped in the gym that day?

603
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,778
-(grunts)
-I thought he was a good fighter.

604
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,904
-He doesn't seem like one, does he?
-Fuck.

605
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,406
(sighs)

606
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,199
(groans)

607
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,627
MOK JEONGHYEON OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

608
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,755
He came here four days ago.

609
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,842
May I ask what this is concerning?

610
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,428
It's about a homicide case.

611
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,221
Excuse me?

612
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,642
(shaking)
Did he kill someone again?

613
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,020
No. He was murdered.

614
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,479
What?

615
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,399
He's dead?

616
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,319
I know it may be traumatic to recall

617
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,906
the details of your daughter's case,
but may I ask you a few questions?

618
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,116
Sure.

619
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,952
When Ju Hyeokgeon was here four days ago,

620
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,329
what did he say to you?

621
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
He told me to drop the civil lawsuit.

622
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,667
He stabbed my daughter to death
and finished his sentence,

623
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,294
but he was still only 16 years old.

624
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,297
He's reintegrated back into society

625
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,591
and living a normal life
as if nothing had happened.

626
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,427
At 18 years old.

627
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,555
So...

628
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,849
as a mom...

629
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,019
I needed to do something.
(sobbing)

630
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,105
In order to make sure he'll never forget
that he stabbed my daughter,

631
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,649
I filed a civil lawsuit against him

632
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,401
so that I could drag it out
for as long as possible.

633
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,487
He came here to tell me to drop it.

634
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,115
He threatened me saying I'll have to pay
a price if I don't drop the case...

635
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,412
Did anything else happen?

636
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,665
That was it.
(sobbing)

637
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,999
It must be hard.

638
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,752
YONGTAN POLICE STATION WOMEN & JUVENILE
DIVISION/LIEUTENANT JIN SO JUNG

639
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:46,798
SOJEONG: If you remember anything else,
please let us know.

640
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,728
Why didn't you file a police report,

641
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,523
when you were threatened to drop the suit?

642
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,983
(breathes deeply)

643
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,038
(sobs)

644
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,764
-(indistinct chatter)
-STUDENT 1: Leave our hero alone!

645
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,932
-STUDENT 2: Please don't catch him!
-STUDENT 3: Leave!

646
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,434
-Can't you just leave?
-Just go!

647
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,977
(water sloshing)

648
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,062
(suspicious music)

649
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,319
Excuse me?

650
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,073
Yes?

651
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,201
-SOJEONG: Your purse.
-Ah...

652
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,911
Thank you.

653
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,749
(light music)

654
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,714
(car alarm beeps)

655
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,139
(suspicious music)

656
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,495
Come in.

657
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,257
You made the appointment
under a fake name, right?

658
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,300
Yes.

659
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,136
I'll take care of the medical records.

660
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,222
I guess we won't have
to see each other again.

661
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,683
Were the cops here?

662
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,437
-Did something happen?
-Didn't you know?

663
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,314
What do you mean?

664
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,691
I guess you're here
because you didn't know.

665
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,196
Ju Hyeokgeon is dead.

666
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,948
Excuse me?

667
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,870
(gasps)

668
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,375
(pants)

669
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,879
(breathes deeply)

670
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,257
Sooheon...

671
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,761
JI SOOHEON

672
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,389
(continues breathing deeply)

673
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,273
-Hello.
-Oh, you're here? Take care, boy.

REPORTER: JU DAEWOONG (MALE, 47)

OWNER OF INNO MOTORS,
FATHER OF THE VICTIM, JU HYEOKGEON

678
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,450
2. LOCATION OF INCIDENT

679
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,077
INNO MOTORS BODY SHOP,
DONGYEONG-DONG, YONGTAN-GU, SEOUL

680
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,330
3. DETAILS OF THE VICTIM
NAME: JU HYEOKGEON AGE: 16

681
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,211
(door opens)

682
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,504
Hey.

683
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,596
You never saw that, okay?

684
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,806
Just forget you ever saw this.
Do you understand?

685
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,016
Yes, I do.

686
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,601
(strained groan) Good.

687
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,186
What is it?

688
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,937
Anything else you can't talk to me
about at home?

689
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,606
You know the girl who beat up Jihyun?

690
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,691
Please punish her
without getting her expelled from school.

691
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,234
Huh, what are you talking about?

692
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,486
She's going to be expelled
and charged as a criminal!

693
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,281
Why are you saying things
that will upset Jihyun?

694
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,283
Dad.

695
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,368
She's kind of poor.

696
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,537
And to be honest,
Jihyun's not completely innocent either.

697
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,165
If I can persuade Jihyun
to make up with her,

698
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,751
it'll be beneficial
for Jihyun's reputation as well.

699
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,882
So do you really think
you can persuade Jihyun?

700
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:58,799
Yes.

701
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,760
All you have to do is just pretend
you don't know anything about this

702
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,178
and not do anything.

703
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,638
Hmm...

704
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,682
So you want to resolve this on good terms.

705
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,104
NOTE: ASSAILANT IN A MURDER CASE
INVOLVING A MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT IN 2019.

706
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,648
-DOCTOR: Hello, sir.
-INSEON: Good work today.

707
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,815
DOCTOR: Thank you.

708
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,943
-SOJEONG (on phone): <i>Hello?</i>
-Hey, honey.

709
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,653
Can you get off work on time today?

710
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,113
Yes, I'll leave on time today.
How about you?

711
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,324
INSEON (on phone):
<i>Then I should get off work when you do.</i>

712
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,159
What time can you be
at that bowling alley?

713
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,286
Um, in about 40 minutes?

714
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,413
INSEON (on phone):
<i>Okay, I'll see you in 40 minutes.</i>

715
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,958
Okay, see you then. Bye.

716
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,419
That looks like the culprit,

717
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,004
but it's peculiar
that he's wearing a backpack.

718
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,674
He used a lot of tools
to carry out the crime.

719
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:44,428
A mask, tape, gloves,
urethane foam used to block the camera.

720
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,181
It smelled like oil and alcohol.

721
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,976
How did I miss this?

722
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,477
Excuse me?

723
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,147
The smell of oil, the smell of alcohol...

724
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,317
It's the bowling alley.

725
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,236
It's the oil on the bowling pins

726
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,988
and the alcohol
that's used to wipe it off.

727
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,991
(exhales deeply)

728
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,043
OWNER: Sooheon! Sooheon!

729
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,379
Your friend's here.

730
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,589
Dead?

731
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,677
-What? Why would Ju Hyeokgeon be dead?
-(breathes shakily)

732
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,472
-Are you sure you're not mistaken?
-The cops were at the doctor's office.

733
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,598
Shit.

734
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,559
(breathes shakily)
Hey, it wasn't me.

735
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,102
I didn't do it.

736
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,478
Hey, Sooheon.

737
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,022
You'd better pull yourself together.

738
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,318
I... I'm fine with whatever you did.
(breathes shakily)

739
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,486
We just need to decide
how we're going to deal with this.

740
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,655
Agh, I just hit him a few times.
I didn't do anything else.

741
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,990
Think about it carefully.

742
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,200
Are you saying
I got carried away and killed him?

743
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,580
(sighs)

744
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,248
(inhales deeply)

745
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,666
How did he die?

746
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,752
I don't know.

747
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,628
(breathes deeply)

748
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,590
When I left the body shop,

749
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,426
Ju Hyeokgeon was shouting,
asking for forgiveness!

750
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,845
He was alive!

751
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,931
Then should we turn ourselves in?

752
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,976
Do you want to just go ahead and confess
to the police that you only hit him?

753
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,812
No, that won't work.

754
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,065
It's better
than being labeled as a murderer.

755
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,191
(exhales)

756
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,443
I can't go to jail right now.

757
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,570
(sighs)
Agh, I can't right now.

758
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,946
(Soyeon inhales deeply)

759
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,782
(both sigh)

760
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,116
(sighs)

761
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,286
(shouts)
Shit!

762
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,874
(Sooheon groans)

763
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,543
(ominous music)

764
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,516
(laughs)
Yes.

765
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,186
We're from Yongtan Police Station.

766
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,646
Well, how can I help you?

767
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,272
Ji Sooheon works here part-time, right?

768
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,108
Where does he store his personal items?

769
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,486
His personal belongings are in his locker
since he has to lock them up.

770
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,737
I'll be taking a look through his things.

771
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,658
Excuse me, what's going on?

772
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,827
Did-did Sooheon get into some trouble?

773
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,870
Why are you searching his belongings?

774
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,748
(ominous music)

775
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,464
What's going on?

776
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,394
Don't you need a search warrant?

777
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,230
Ji Sooheon.

778
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,733
-(exhales nervously)
-If you don't open this for us,

779
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,820
you'll be escorted to the police station,
and we'll break this locker open.

780
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,822
We can secure a search warrant
under exigent circumstances.

781
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,533
It's your call.

782
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,540
(clatters in distance)

783
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,798
(ominous music)

784
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,847
(gun clicks)

785
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,577
(breathes deeply)

786
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,459
(lock rattles)

787
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,339
(ominous music continues)

788
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,027
WORLD GEOGRAPHY

789
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:13,989
What?

790
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,991
It's just a uniform and a backpack.

791
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,201
For a student?

792
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,454
May I close this?

793
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:27,211
Excuse me,
what exactly are you searching for? Huh?

794
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,754
If you have reason
to believe he's a suspect,

795
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,506
you should at least be able to explain
what's going on to us!

796
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,050
-What did Sooheon do wrong?
-Detective Hyun.

797
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:37,137
Go get the master key
and check every locker here.

798
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,681
Including the machine room.

799
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,599
I'll check inside the bowling alley.

800
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,351
JONGGUK: Yes, ma'am.

801
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,853
Wait...

802
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,898
Did you say you're going to check
every single locker?

803
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,150
May I search the machine room first?

I'm heading to Ji Sooheon's gym right now.

00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,351
Don't say anything
and just hold him there for a while.

811
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,728
Yes, okay, will do.

812
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,569

Hold on a second.

831
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,318
Isn't this too much even
for a police officer?

832
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,904
Rushing in with a bolt cutter
to cut open a lock? Do you have a warrant?

833
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,740
When there's a risk that the evidence
may be destroyed,

834
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,324
we can secure a warrant afterwards.

00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,661
(sighs)
That's enough. Just get out of here.

837
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,829
Get out of my gym right now.

838
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,831
So what if you're a cop? Get out!

-It's a homicide case!
-(groans)

842
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:57,921
Don't mess with me.

Wow, seriously.

850
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:57,731
This is so ridiculous. What the hell?
I think you're seriously mistaken.

851
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,691
What exactly is she looking for?

852
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,777
Sooheon, she said she's investigating
a murder case.

853
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,947
(scoffs)
Wow, she's making me lose it.

854
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,949
Wow, seriously. Shit!

855
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,828
Can I see your room?

856
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,998
You need to first tell me what's going on.

857
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,210
What is it you want from me?

858
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,045
What is this about a murder case?

859
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,130
If you're not good at your job,

860
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,216
why don't you make a career change?

861
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,386
And stop bothering me.

(sobbing continues)

881
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,831
I was here...

882
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,750
last night.

883
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,045
Jaebum.

884
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,296
Did you suddenly remember

885
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,798
the horse riding course
you used to come to?

886
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,258
(chuckles)
No.

887
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,344
It's not that I remembered this place.

888
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:20,392
I woke up and found myself alone
in the stables in the middle of the night.

889
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,646
When I called my mom and told her
there was a horse next to me,

890
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,273
she came here and brought me back home.

891
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,152
I guess I took a taxi
and came here at night.

892
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,824
Standing alone in a stable
in the dark at night.

893
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,827
As if I'd been abandoned.

894
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,413
It was scary.

895
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,497
Of course, man.

896
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,876
If you remember something
and want to take a visit,

897
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,252
just give me a call first.

898
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,839
Sure, thanks.

899
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,842
But last night,

900
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,471
I was able to retrieve a memory
in the midst of my fear.

901
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,603
I wasn't injured in a traffic accident.

902
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:11,485
It wasn't a traffic accident that kept me
in the hospital for six months.

903
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,320
Jaebum.

904
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,404
I...

905
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,368
I tried to kill myself here
at the stables.

906
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,539
(scoffs)

907
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,042
Everyone lied to me.

908
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,253
Isn't that right?

909
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,671
Jaebum!
(inhales sharply)

910
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,174
-I...
-I know that you...

911
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,426
were just trying your best to do
whatever my mother told you to do.

912
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,471
I'm grateful for that.

913
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,811
But Osung...

914
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,356
can you promise me
you'll be honest with me?

915
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,651
Of course, Jaebum.

916
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:58,323
I'm always on your side.
I'm always genuine with you.

917
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,033
Osung.

918
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,250
Was I the one

919
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,504
who killed Park Wonseok?

920
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,589
(ominous music)

921
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,189

00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,318

00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,866

00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,202
Chanmi.

925
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,413
Can we talk for a moment?

926
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,293
About what?

927
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,336
Don't you have something to tell me?

928
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,006
What do you mean?

929
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,465
You're the one that wanted to talk.

930
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,095
The cops came today to search my locker.

931
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,350
Aren't you curious why they came for me?

932
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,189
Sa Junggyeong's case, the dark room case.

933
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,150
You're being investigated as a suspect.

934
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,194
The police came to question me as well.

935
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,655
They kept asking me about
the night I ran into you in the alley.

936
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,450
Isn't that the reason
why the cops came for you?

937
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,287
-That's right.
-When the cops searched the place,

938
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,915
did anything happen?

939
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,792
-No
-Then it's all good.

940
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,420
-What was it you wanted to tell me?
-Ah...

941
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,714
It's nothing.

942
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,758
I just wanted to ask is all.

943
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,260
-It's late. Get some rest.
-Okay.

944
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,262
Get some rest.

945

00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,370
Then why didn't you come a bit earlier?
Oh, here's the package you sent.

954
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,580
Thank you, Jiwon.

955
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,874
How have you been?

956
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,794
Oh, well, I'm doing just fine.
How about you?

957
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,796
Yes, I'm doing fine as well.

959
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,513

00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,613

Ok Chanmi...

973
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,845
Ok Chanmi.

974
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,514
Chanmi?

975
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,864
Are you not here yet?

976
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,074
Chanmi.

977
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,576

Chanmi, what are you doing?

981
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,547
Hey, come out.

982
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,882
Just hear me out.

983
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,717
Stop right there. Don't move.

984
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,053
(sighs, tongue clicks)

986
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,932
Why are you doing this?

987
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,642
I'll explain. Just come out.

988

00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,330
Chanmi.

991
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,958
I didn't kill him.

992
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,710
I'm being honest.

993
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,924
(breathes shakily)

994
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,009

Hey, Chanmi.

What are you doing?

1000
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,441
I think you're misunderstanding something.

1001
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,778
You can take the bag to the police.

1002
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,114
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him.

1003
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,032
