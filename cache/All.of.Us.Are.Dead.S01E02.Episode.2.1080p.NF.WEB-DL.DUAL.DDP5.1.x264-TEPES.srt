1
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,406
Hey. Start recording.

2
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,241
I'll defeat you,

3
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,785
and rule as most powerful! Hah!

4
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,662
Not a chance.

5
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,417
Asshole! It hurts like hell! Shit!

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,671
Don't come near me! Aah! Stop! That hurts!

7
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,175
What the hell?

8
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,260
Run!

9
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,555
Shit!

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,893
Shit. Shit. Shit. Fuck.

11
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,728
Aah, you must be mistaken.

12
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,022
Our students are required
to check in their phones.

13
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,523
None of them could've called you.

14
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,524
Yeah.

15
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,278
Yes, of course. Everything is just great.

16
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,613
Have a nice day.

17
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,036
Didn't I tell you to make sure
to take away their phones?

18
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,580
I even got you safes,
and they're saying zombies!

19
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,165
What the hell is wrong with you all?

20
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,928
You can't deny
there's a problem out there.

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,834
It's complete madness.

22
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,021
We need the police and rescuers
to get the kids out...

23
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,088
Are you the only teacher?
Are you that special?

24
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,650
Whatever happens inside this school
must be handled internally!

25
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,760
Go! Put the kids in their classrooms.

26
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,470
But, sir, I don't think the students

27
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,806
are in the situation
where they will listen to us at all.

28
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,649
What are you still doing here?
Get out there!

29
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,185
And if you'd go out right now,
you can see for yourself

30
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,079
- that it's total chaos.
- Just do as you're told.

31
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,564
I made you the dean
to discipline them, so do that!

32
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,109
Where are you going, Sun-hwa?
Don't do anything stupid. Stay here!

33
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,713
I'm going to make an announcement
to tell all the kids to leave.

34
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,075
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

35
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,293
Hey, kid.

36
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,504
What's up with your leg?

37
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,839
Hey, stop that!

38
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,049
Hey! What are you doing?

39
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,717
Cut that out!

40
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,430
Ah...

41
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,531
What's with you?

42
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,658
Help! Help!

43
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,063
On-jo. Are you good?

44
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,232
Hey!

45
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,904
Get up.

46
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,788
Are you okay?

47
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,054
Go! Haste! Let's undo this.

48
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,816
Hurry and get up there!

49
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,652
Let's go over there!

50
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,361
Come on.

51
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,029
Fuck!

52
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,200
Fuck!

53
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,672
Come on.

54
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,716
You go first.

55
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,924
Oh, shit!

56
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,563
Get out. No!

57
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,194
Cheong-san!

58
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,411
Why aren't you coming? Come on!

59
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,622
On-jo.

60
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,958
Hurry up!

61
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,811
Run!

62
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,490
HYOSAN BUILDING MATERIALS

63
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,380
Come. This way. This way.

64
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,970
Wait up for me!

65
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,350
Stay away. Stay away, son of a bitch.

66
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,734
You should've stayed away, fucker!

67
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,828
Shit. What's going on?

68
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,790
Don't open the door. Don't open it!

69
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,124
Let go.

70
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,794
Hurry up! Lock the door! Go!

71
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,003
I need to open it.

72
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,421
You open it!

73
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,548
Move!

74
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Are you okay?

75
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,220
On-jo!

76
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,015
Are you okay?

77
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,186
How's the campus? Are we dead or what?

78
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,115
Hey.

79
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,576
- What the hell? Who are you?
- Asshole. Brother...

80
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,244
- Brother-in-law.
- Oh, come in.

81
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,872
Holy shit.

82
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,833
They're so aggressive.

83
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,793
What happened to your face, huh?

84
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,713
I don't know, some crazy jerk sprayed me
with a fire extinguisher.

85
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,048
- A fire extinguisher?
- Yeah, damn it.

86
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,551
What's happening?

87
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,635
Who knows?

88
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,845
Train.

89
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,973
<i>- Train to Busan</i>.
- The movie?

90
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,684
Aren't they zombies? It's the same thing.

91
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,228
Zombies are at school?
You watch too much TV.

92
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,939
Watch this. It's true.

93
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,028
Really?

94
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,821
The door! Door!

95
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,780
Right.

96
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,160
Shit. What the hell?

97
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,870
What the fuck is that?

98
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,414
- Bare-su! It's Bare-su! Help him up!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

99
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,999
Get in here. Hurry, man. You okay?

100
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,168
- Nam-ra! Hurry!
- Come on!

101
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,712
Hurry! Come on! Jump!

102
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,090
Close it. Quick.

103
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,508
Are you okay?

104
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,475
It's that, isn't it?

105
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,602
Zombies.

106
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,910
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

107
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,286
AMBULANCE

108
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,582
One, two, three.

109
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,545
- What happened to her?
- She came from the school.

110
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,840
She was bleeding when we got there.
But we're not sure exactly what caused it.

111
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,551
- When was she injured?
- We got the call about 30 minutes ago.

112
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,136
Why is she lethargic?

113
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,180
She seemed to be
having seizures at first,

114
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,473
but she calmed down now.

115
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,657
You received the PhD
in cell biology in the US,

116
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,783
returned to Korea.

117
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,620
You were a pharmaceutical researcher
and quit, then teaching.

118
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,666
You should be a college professor
with this résumé.

119
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,876
Definitely not
some lousy high school teacher.

120
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,755
The hospital needs to put Hyeon-ju
to quarantine, nothing less.

121
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,552
Why would a teacher decide
to chain a student?

122
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,595
If I were a college professor...

123
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,182
If I were a prosecutor, or a reporter,
would you have listened?

124
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,018
Ah, that's why you did it.

125
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,939
Because no one listened to you
or understood how you felt?

126
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,525
You were lonely, maybe saddened.
Is that it?

127
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,317
Fine.

128
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,737
Let's do nothing.

129
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,406
Everyone will die.

130
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,660
This world and all those damned imbeciles.

131
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,922
I hate you assholes. You're a sick kind.
Can't stand you.

132
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,094
You commit the crime,
but you blame others, society, everything.

133
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:47,641
When you reported your son missing,
you said, "The world swallowed my son."

134
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,454
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
What, is the world an anaconda?

135
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,772
It didn't swallow him.

136
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,234
Tell me what really happened to him.

137
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,819
You killed your son.

138
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,325
But you reported him missing
to avoid being a suspect. Am I right?

139
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,495
Your son isn't missing, is he?

140
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,581
What happened to him, huh?

141
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,046
Jin-su is dead.

142
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,888
I placed the mouse and cat together.

143
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,765
MINSONG GYMNASIUM

144
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,934
<i>Most of the mice sat in a corner,</i>

145
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,478
<i>and were frozen, trembling in fear.</i>

146
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,524
<i>But once in a while,</i>

147
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,401
the mouse would lose its senses
due to the overwhelming fear

148
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,861
<i>and attack the cat.</i>

149
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,282
<i>When this happens,
its testosterone level shoots up.</i>

150
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,661
<i>I extracted that hormone and refined it.</i>

151
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,580
For all the mice in this world
living in fear, trembling.

152
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,431
<i>I thought if fear turned into rage,</i>

153
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,098
<i>he'd become stronger than anyone.</i>

154
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,646
<i>He bit his mom.</i>

155
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,235
Infection, day 17.

156
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,655
I gave him benzodiazepine
and stopped the haloperidol.

157
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,199
He'll be awake in less than ten minutes.

158
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,417
You killed your son, didn't you?

159
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,748
- What the...
- Get her! Get her!

160
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,772
Turn it off!

161
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,827
Hold her down!

162
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,878
Oh...

163
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,975
- What's that sound?
- What's going on?

164
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,397
Is something going on in there?

165
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,401
Please help me.

166
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,029
Call the police! Please hurry!

167
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,273
God, I almost run her over.

168
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,441
What's the girl's problem?

169
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,536
People, you know what happens
when you perform like that?

170
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,123
Jang Ha-ri, get up.

171
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,457
Okay.

172
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,587
Take a good look.

173
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,047
She's your future.

174
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,718
Ha-ri's a senior...

175
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,304
without a single gold medal.

176
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,891
Forget the nationals
if she can't even make the reserves.

177
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,352
Couldn't even pass
today's regional qualifier.

178
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,938
What will you do, hm?

179
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,818
She can't get into college,
a corporate team...

180
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,446
No civil service exam. You didn't study.

181
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,992
Listen here. Do you know
how cruel this field is?

182
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,954
The CSAT top 100 kids get
into Seoul, yeah.

183
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,291
But if you're top 100 in archery,

184
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,377
you can't get anywhere near the Olympics.

185
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,463
You're the tritest rot.

186
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,214
Wasting away. Got it?

187
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:30,966
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

188
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,514
Shit. Fucking nut...

189
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,563
What the...

190
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,546
- See if it's there.
- It's not here, either.

191
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,531
Hey, Joon-yeong! I think you're right.
They can't open doors.

192
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,784
Uh... Let's hold it shut for now.

193
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,036
- Did you find one?
- There's nothing here, either.

194
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,263
- Damn it.
- Any luck, Dae-su?

195
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,413
Are you okay?

196
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,290
Look over there.

197
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,128
- It's not here, either.
- Here!

198
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,297
I found one!

199
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,510
Whose is it?

200
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,512
This is Yeong-ju's desk.

201
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,971
Shit. It's locked.

202
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,557
Do something.

203
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,267
What do you want me to do? It's locked.

204
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,478
Maybe it's her birthday.

205
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,384
When is that?

206
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,440
I don't know. Hmm...

207
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,237
She's over there. Give it.

208
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,287
SWIPE UP FOR FACE ID OR ENTER PASSCODE

209
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,293
You're gonna have to get closer.

210
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,968
For emergency calls,
you don't have to do that.

211
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,386
Just call 112.

212
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,558
AT THE SCENE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

213
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,522
- Hello. What is your emergency?
<i>- Hello?</i>

214
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,023
This is Hyosan High School.

215
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,110
A ton of zombies showed up at lunch,
and they're eating people.

216
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,611
Don't say zombies.

217
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,195
<i>Then what?</i>

218
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,781
<i>They won't believe you.</i>

219
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,325
Did you happen to see
the movie <i>Train to Busan</i>?

220
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,452
<i>Okay. Hyosan High, zombies.</i>

221
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,038
Please give me your name and phone number.

222
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,809
You know you'll get in trouble
for making these false reports, right?

223
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,418
This isn't a joke.

224
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,253
Everyone's...

225
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,881
Anyway, come quick.

226
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,964
Okay.

227
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,718
Lee Cheong-san.

228
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,430
Your number is 010-4362...

229
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,224
Get somewhere safe,
so that you don't get bitten. Okay?

230
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,059
We'll be there soon to check. Okay?

231
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,855
These brats think they're so damn clever.

232
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,774
Zombies are attacking.

233
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,109
Hyosan High, right?

234
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,945
They must be celebrating or something.

235
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,697
I just got a call about zombies too, sir.

236
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,500
Hello. What is the nature
of your emergency?

237
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,160
You're cutting out.
A patient is attacking people?

238
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,913
Does the person have some type of weapon?

239
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,457
She's biting them?

240
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,918
Zombie girl?

241
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,730
Hey. Go and call the school and verify.

242
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,756
Okay.

243
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,090
Hello. What's your emergency?

244
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,894
Hello. What is the nature
of your emergency?

245
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,737
- A person is biting people?
- What did you say?

246
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,933
SCHOOL MOTTO
HAPPY STUDENTS, SAFE SCHOOL

247
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,352
CLASS MOTTO
SUN-HWA IS WATCHING

248
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,729
No!

249
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,608
Whoa, what's going on?

250
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,777
- Where are they going?
- Why are they leaving?

251
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,283
- What are you doing, moron? Close it.
- Okay, fine.

252
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,493
You scared me.

253
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,786
And the police?

254
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,080
He said they'll come.

255
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,956
Did they believe you?

256
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,834
What if they think it's a prank
and decide not to come?

257
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,962
Well, then try again!

258
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,256
- And tell them to hurry up!
- Shh. Stop yelling.

259
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,632
What if those zombies come back?

260
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,633
Give me that.

261
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,246
<i>Fire Department.
What's the nature of your emergency?</i>

262
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,521
Hi. Hello, sir.

263
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,107
Do you know Captain Nam So-ju
from Rescue Team One?

264
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,609
<i>I'm afraid I don't.
We have many firefighters.</i>

265
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,693
<i>What is this about?</i>

266
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,822
Captain Nam So-ju is my father.

267
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,241
Please tell him
to hurry over to my school.

268
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,386
- Who is she calling?
<i>- Sorry. This is the call center.</i>

269
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,930
<i>You should call his station
if you want to reach him personally.</i>

270
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,622
There's a fire.

271
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,582
<i>- Fire?</i>
- Hyosan High School, classroom 2-5.

272
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,293
Hurry up. The fire is massive.

RESCUE

276
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,672
No one's coming?

277
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,604
I think something's happening at the gate.

278
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,055
Let's call the cops again.

279
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Get them to listen.

280
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,184
I am, but they won't pick up.

281
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,897
Hey.

282
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,983
Do something.

283
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,360
Tell Miss Park to come and help.

284
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,947
Do something.

285
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,199
Do what exactly?

286
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,451
I don't know. Anything!

287
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,497
What have you done as class president?

288
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,915
- Stop it.
- Huh?

289
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,513
Teacher's office?
So you just want me to leave now?

290
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,558
Well, if you're offering.

291
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,519
You told me to do something.

292
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,896
Do you want me to leave?

293
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,731
Stop it, you two.

294
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,151
She's only saying that
because you're the class president.

295
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,822
- Yeah. You are, right?
- So just be patient, okay?

296
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,702
So stupid. Typical.

297
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,287
What's typical?

298
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,337
Now that we are in this mess,
I'm your class president?

299
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,385
We called the police,
so I'm sure we'll be fine soon.

300
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,929
But no one's coming!

301
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,224
- Enough already. We're all scared too!
- That's why I'm telling them to call!

302
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,934
Why don't you do it, then?

303
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,353
Ladies, ladies,
can you just stop the whining?

304
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,689
Oh, now you're butting in, shithead?

305
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,482
What? Did you just call me a shithead?

306
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,985
Call me a shithead, you shithead?

307
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,739
- Let it go.
- Stop it.

308
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,033
Hold the door. I said hold the door.

309
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,327
Who the hell does she think she is?

310
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,745
Stop it.

311
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,915
- Did you hear what she said?
- Gyeong-su. Come on. Hold the door.

312
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,750
Let it go. It's nothing new.

313
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,104
- Enough already. I'm going.
- Block it. Just go block it.

314
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,547
- Fine. Seriously... Whoa!
- Shit!

315
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,552
Coach Kang.

316
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,763
Are you guys okay?

317
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,606
What about you? You weren't bitten?

318
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,276
No. Of course not. I'm, I'm all right.

319
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,279
Hey, guys. Let's block the door first.

320
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,407
Get moving. Hurry.

321
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,451
I'm fine. Let's move this.

322
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,534
Like this?

323
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,872
Yes, yes. Stack them high. High. High.

324
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,292
Coach Kang? You called the cops, right?

325
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,045
- You and the teachers. Help's coming.
- Yeah, sure.

326
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,923
What are you doing? Move quickly.

327
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,091
Stack it high. High.

328
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,218
Here.

329
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,637
- Stack it high.
- Higher?

330
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,264
Push it closer. Much closer.

331
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,517
On-jo, look.

332
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,601
What?

333
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,980
There. His arm.

334
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,985
Coach Kang.

335
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,071
Your arm.

336
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,156
What are you doing? Come help us.

337
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,509
- You have a bite mark on your arm!
- Is this...

338
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,910
What?

339
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,041
- What is it?
- I wasn't bitten.

340
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,787
- He said he wasn't bitten.
- No, no. I...

341
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,544
I, I wasn't bitten.

342
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,256
It's a bite mark.

343
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,549
I said it isn't.
Don't talk back to me. Okay?

344
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,633
- It looks like you were really bitten.
- I wasn't!

345
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,512
How many times must I tell you?

346
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,306
Then why the hell are you hiding it?
Just show it to us.

347
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,978
I think you should leave right now.

348
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,772
- What?
- Get out of here immediately.

349
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,608
You want me to go out there?

350
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,195
After all I did to get here?
You want me to go back out?

351
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,655
You were bitten.

352
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,532
Come on. Get out.

353
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,160
I said get out now!

354
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,412
Cocksucker!

355
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,248
How dare you yell at me like that?

356
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,416
You little...

357
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,001
Get over here.

358
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,586
Come here.

359
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,714
Now!

360
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,385
- You won't come? Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

361
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,513
- Stop. Stop. Stop it.
- He was bitten.

362
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,640
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Whoa, stay back.

363
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,308
Look.

364
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,351
Let go.

365
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,698
- You fucking bitch.
- Watch it!

366
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,451
Wait, wait.

367
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,220
- Holy shit.
- I think he really was bitten.

368
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,284
Guys, we should get out of here
as soon as possible.

369
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,831
Hey. Hey. He's turning.

370
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,711
Get him out of here! Hurry!

371
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,671
Hurry. Throw him out.

372
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,597
Do something!

373
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,767
No! Dae-su!

374
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,319
Min-ji...

375
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,408
Dae-su. I can't...

376
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,036
I don't want to die.

377
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,044
Get him... Get him out of here!

378
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,101
Cheong-san!

379
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,482
I don't want to die.

380
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,692
Help me.

381
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,797
Don't come closer.

382
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,675
Get away from me. No!

383
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,197
Stop it. Step out of the club, please.

384
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,490
We gotta go.

385
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,494
Get out! Get out!

386
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,165
- Let's go!
- Go, Cheong-san! Dae-su!

387
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,502
Hurry!

388
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,547
Hurry!

389
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,507
Get out!

390
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,591
Gyeong-su!

391
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,111
Watch your hands!

392
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,280
Watch out!

393
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,535
Hey! Get out of the way!

394
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,068
Hey! Come!

395
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,072
Come on, girls! Come on!

396
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,700
Push it!

397
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,826
Let's go!

398
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,203
Keep pushing!

399
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,414
Push!

400
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,335
Get out of here!

401
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,920
Girls, upstairs!

402
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,754
Let's go!

403
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,052
Hurry up!

404
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,524
No! No! Get back!

405
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,653
Back! Back! Back!

406
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,462
- Su-hyeok!
- Get to the lab!

407
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,339
Hurry!

408
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,143
Dae-su! Watch out!

409
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,483
Help me. Help!

410
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,609
Push!

411
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,945
Push!

412
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,617
- Push!
- Harder!

413
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,304
It's locked. Gotta go somewhere else!

414
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,913
Nowhere to go! We're surrounded!

415
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,156
- It's locked! Didn't you hear me?
- What now?

416
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,877
Try to open it!

417
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,801
- Can't you see it's locked?
- Hey, block the hole!

418
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,214
Dae-su, push!

419
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,925
Push!

420
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,897
Hey, hey, hey! Careful!
Watch your hands!

421
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,651
Why is it taking so long?

422
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,696
Hey!

423
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,074
- Above you!
- Hey, it's climbing over!

424
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,205
I can't hold them off
much longer. Hurry up!

425
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,249
It's open!

426
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,127
- Go!
- Push!

427
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,878
Push!

428
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,759
Hurry! Hurry! Go in!

429
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,139
Hurry!

430
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,705
Oh, shit.

431
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,248
Oh, damn it!

432
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,900
Get a desk!

433
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,818
Block it!

434
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,783
Block it.

435
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,884
Give me the phone.
I'm gonna try calling again.

436
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,594
Sorry, I lost it.

437
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,721
How could you lose it?

438
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,474
Who cares? We got a secured room now.

439
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,769
Like you can talk.

440
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,398
- What?
- It's because you didn't lock the door.

441
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,610
If you had done that, the gym teacher
wouldn't have gotten to us.

442
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,362
We almost died because of you.

443
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,364
Then why didn't you do anything yourself?

444
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,741
You're so fucking annoying.

445
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,368
Gyeong-su, no, no, no. Hey, don't.

446
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,079
- You bitch.
- Don't you touch me!

447
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,415
Fight after you move these.
This is not the time.

448
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,167
She's right. Stop it.

449
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,336
Yeah, fight after we finish this.
Gyeong-su.

450
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,424
Ugh! This is so fucking annoying!

451
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,858
Su-hyeok?

452
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,152
Has anyone seen him?

453
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,114
You were with him, right?

454
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,909
He was behind me.

455
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,327
Then where is he now?

456
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,707
I don't know.

457
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,446
They've all turned.

458
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,701
I think everyone except us turned.

459
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,287
We're outcasts again.

460
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,129
And this is still hell.

461
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,634
I hope everyone dies.

462
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,178
Every single one of them.

463
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,686
Shh! Shut the fuck up!

464
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,349
We should stay here a bit longer.

465
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,809
Right. Okay.

466
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,912
Do you think they're gone?

467
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,564
What do we do?
Shouldn't we go out and call the cops?

468
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,985
We can't go out now.
I'm sure they're still out there.

469
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:05,741
Also, who the heck is smoking
in here right now?

470
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,494
And who are you that you're hiding
in the girls' bathroom, huh?

471
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,289
Be a man. If you can even do that.

472
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,499
You... Who are you?

473
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,836
Leave her alone. It's Mi-jin.

474
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,796
Mi-jin? Park Mi-jin?

475
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,879
Yeah.

476
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,884
Joon-seong. I'm really dizzy.

477
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,470
Is it bad?

478
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,974
- Oh, no.
- I don't know. It's weird.

479
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,644
Everything sounds muffled,
and I'm dizzy.

480
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,648
Don't worry,
it's probably just from the shock.

481
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,109
We'll go to the hospital
when things calm down, okay?

482
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,694
Okay.

483
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,572
What is it? Who is it?

484
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,740
Hey, open up.

485
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,285
- Open up. Come on!
- What do you...

486
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,662
- Get out.
- What's wrong with you?

487
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,331
Stay still.

488
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,790
What's going on?

489
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,007
- What are you doing?
- I said to stay still, you moron!

490
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,383
Mi-jin.

491
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,594
Listen carefully.

492
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,305
You know how to play tag?

493
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,807
We hide.

494
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,435
We run to get away from someone.

495
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,019
Now...

496
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,025
Now, you are it.

497
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,559
Don't stand there! Help!

498
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,311
But Ha-lim's in there.

499
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,272
She was bitten. You got that? Now, help.

500
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,901
Mi-jin, don't do this.

501
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,820
I'm okay.

502
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,322
Let me out.

503
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,658
Shut up, zombie fucker!

504
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,243
Joon-seong, don't do this.

505
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,494
Let me out.

506
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,540
We ran away together earlier. I saved you.

507
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,002
If you let her out, we all die.

508
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,804
Shit. Shit!

509
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,474
Get it together. Look up.

510
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,393
What do you want from me?

511
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,146
- We have to kill her.
- Kill Ha-lim?

512
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,357
She's not Ha-lim. She's a... zombie.

513
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,818
Still, I don't wanna.

514
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,028
Do we have any other options?

515
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,282
I don't know.

516
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,995
Mi-jin. I hear you.

517
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,163
I know.

518
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,458
Do you really have
to do that to me?

519
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,876
You're going to turn, eventually.

520
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,882
I know. But you...

521
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,469
I will kill you first.

522
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,221
I'll kill you before anyone else.

523
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,347
Bitch.

524
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,059
Mi-jin.

525
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,856
I... I'm so scared.

526
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,125
Get ready.

527
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,171
I said to get ready.

528
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,380
For what?

529
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,132
We gotta kill her.

530
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,389
Are you gonna hold that forever?

531
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,451
Damn it.

532
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,869
What are you doing?

533
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,125
Why won't she die?

534
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,461
I don't know.
Maybe it's not the right spot.

535
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,290
What...

536
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,768
Stop. Not us. We're fine.

537
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,105
Not us, jackass!

538
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,067
Hey, I think they're okay.

539
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,193
Zombies don't curse.

540
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,194
Shoot if they turn.

541
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,490
You crazy bitch. We're fine...

542
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,329
Students and teachers
of Hyosan High School.

543
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,540
I'm Park Sun-hwa, the English teacher.

544
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,377
Something strange is happening
throughout the school.

545
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,049
<i>Some students
are attacking others indiscriminately.</i>

546
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,511
<i>So please flee and find a safe place.</i>

547
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:21,724
And if any student
or faculty hears this and is able to,

548
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,393
please call the police
and the fire department.

549
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:30,441
<i>Students, hide somewhere safe
until help arrives.</i>

550
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,236
<i>If you can get out of the school,</i>

551
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,155
<i>please get out.</i>

552
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,407
I'll say it again.

553
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,577
Some students are...

554
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:53,964
Hey, everyone...

555
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,676
You're okay, right?

556
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,678
<i>You're not hurt?</i>

557
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,765
I don't know

558
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,894
what's going on in here
or how this whole thing happened, but...

559
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:11,523
<i>Still, find a safe place and hide.</i>

560
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,241
<i>I... I'm sorry...</i>

561
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,204
<i>I can't help.</i>

562
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,791
<i>Don't get hurt, okay?</i>

563
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,253
<i>Please, let's stay alive and meet again.</i>

564
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,213
<i>Okay?</i>

565
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,477
<i>Rescue Team Three,
head to Hyosan Hospital.</i>

566
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,771
<i>Team Four, head to the accident
at Hyosan Intersection.</i>

567
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,065
<i>Team Two, you have another call.</i>

568
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,901
<i>Fire, Hyosan High School.
Please head there right away.</i>

569
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,112
<i>Ambulance One, stay where you are.</i>

570
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,615
Team One. We've arrived at the accident.

571
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,369
<i>Rescue Team Two. We'll head
to the accident at Hyosan High School.</i>

572
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,793
<i>Accident reports keep coming in.</i>

573
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,289
<i>All units, standby where you are.</i>

574
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,066
Let's go.

575
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,581
Fuck you!

576
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,268
- Why'd you do that?
- There was a fly.

577
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,593
You talked to On-jo, right?

578
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,887
She told Su-hyeok she likes him.

579
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,138
Okay, so?

580
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,725
Why don't you go and comfort her?

581
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,478
I keep trying, but you know.

582
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,353
No, forget it.

583
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:16,940
Why are you getting annoyed?

584
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:20,527
What does it have to be
my business who she likes?

585
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,324
Never mind.

586
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,666
On-jo.

587
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,669
Don't worry too much.

588
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,298
I'm sure Su-hyeok will be just fine.

589
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,134
He's a great athlete and super fast.

590
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,221
Mm-hm.

591
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,730
But...

592
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,901
Cheong-san's being super weird.

593
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,444
He's so annoying.

594
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:07,908
I think... he's so into you.

595
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,369
It's totally obvious!

596
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,747
I don't think so.
He doesn't feel things like that.

597
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,125
He's too busy teasing me all the time.

598
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:30,973
I-sak.

599
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,141
Why are you so cold?

600
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,393
So cold?

601
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,065
Your hand is really...

602
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,362
What about my hand?

603
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,497
I-sak.

604
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,794
- What's wrong? Are you...
- Really. I wasn't bitten.

605
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,424
I mean it. I really wasn't bitten.

606
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,468
She was bitten.

607
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,558
What's going on?

608
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,101
Did you get bitten?

609
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,312
I said I wasn't!

610
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,443
Hey. Are you okay?

611
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,370
On-jo.

612
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,748
I-sak.

613
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,842
No, right?

614
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,053
I'm not, right?

615
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,519
I'm not.

616
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,647
I'm not one of them.

617
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,616
What are you doing?
Get her out of here right now!

618
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,994
Shit. They're going to climb over.

619
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:17,995
No.

620
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,165
Come on. I said I'm okay.

621
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:32,803
On-jo.

622
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,680
Let go.

623
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,061
Hurry up! Do something!

624
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,356
Throw her out the window.

625
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,358
No. Let go.

626
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,485
Hurry! She's turning into a zombie!

627
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,614
I-sak, please don't.

628
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,339
I-sak.

629
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,592
I-sak, don't do this.

630
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,055
Stop it!

631
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,683
Stop it, please!

632
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:25,897
Cheong-san!

633
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,160
Are you crazy?

634
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,078
- Let go.
- I-sak.

635
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,496
You have to let go.

636
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,427
You want some glitter?

637
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,489
- It's fine. I can do it, okay?
- Go on.

638
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,514
I'll do it for you.

639
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,517
It's good. Look.

640
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,863
It looks great on you!

641
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:16,948
Get ready.

642
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,228
Hey!

643
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,813
Here!

644
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:49,957
On-jo.

645
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,606
Come block this!

646
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:24,969
Let's go.

647
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,430
We're not gonna last here longer.

648
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,598
Where would we go?

649
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,892
The hose from earlier.

650
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,976
Gyeong-su.

651
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,061
Yeah?

652
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,107
What?

653
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,610
What is it?

654
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,321
Open it just a few inches.
Enough for the hose to fit.

655
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,633
Isn't it better to wait
for the rescuers to come save us?

656
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,297
We might all die by the time they arrive.

657
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,411
This will kill us faster.
It's just gonna be...

658
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,814
Is waiting for someone to save us
the best thing we can do?

659
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,207
Oh, whatever.

660
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,835
If I turn into zombie... You're so mad.

661
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:47,926
Did you get it?

662
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,637
Hey!

663
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,809
Nam-ra, the door.

664
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,734
Help me make some knots.

665
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,444
How do you want it?

666
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:50,573
Wrap it and tie it.
So a hand or foot can fit.

667
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,033
You said big enough for a foot?

668
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,370
Zigzag. Make it a zigzag.
Big enough increments.

669
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,497
- Zigzag.
- Is this right?

670
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,164
We need more.

671
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,919
This is good, right?

672
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,174
Let's go.

673
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,019
Are we gonna make it down there?

674
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,481
I'll go down and check the empty rooms.
I'll call when it's clear, okay?

675
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,565
Okay.

676
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,024
Be careful.

677
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,527
Hold it.

678
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,489
What are you doing?

679
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,076
What is it?

680
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,745
Come on. Go down, dude.

681
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,623
What?

682
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,044
Gyeong-su, you go first.

683
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,921
Why? Did you see something?

684
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,756
No. But you go first.

685
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,133
What's down there?

686
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:52,427
Just go.

687
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,263
- You go. Go up there.
- Go already.

688
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,346
You should go.

689
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,640
Then you go, okay?

690
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,724
No. You can do it.

691
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,477
- Man, you can do it.
- Fuck.

692
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,605
But why... why am I...

693
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,856
Grab it and go.

694
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,859
Rock, paper, scissors?

695
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,028
- Just go. Come on.
- I mean...

696
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,529
Cowboy. Shit. God.

697
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,365
Where is it? Hold on.

698
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,201
Wait, I can't reach it.

699
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,495
- Put your foot in.
- Oh, I got it.

700
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,954
- Ohh.
- Careful.

701
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,331
Okay.

702
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,511
Damn it. Where is it?

703
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,775
Oh, shit. Okay, shit. Fuck.

704
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,944
Damn it.

705
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,406
I'll go down.

706
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,465
I wanna go down first.

707
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:16,511
One person at a time.
You might fall if it shakes too much.

708
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,179
Well, I won't shake it then.

709
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,808
- How long do you want me to wait?
- Just a little bit.

710
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,900
Shit. Why won't it come out?

711
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,696
Gyeong-su! Gyeong-su!

712
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,822
Ms. Park!

713
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,156
Gyeong-su!

714
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,075
- Are you okay?
- Quickly. Hurry.

715
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,785
- Be careful.
- Oh, right.

716
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,620
Cheong-san!

717
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,289
Hey, guys! Miss Park is here!

718
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,499
Miss Park is on the second floor.

719
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,543
The second floor? Broadcasting room?

720
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,253
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

721
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,338
Were you with the other kids
by any chance?

722
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,882
They're in the science lab.
They'll come down now.

723
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,968
Come down! Okay?

724
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,845
Come down!

725
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,054
Seriously!

726
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,472
What?

727
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,102
Careful. Careful. I got you.
Hold on. Hold on.

728
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:09,647
You're so heavy.

729
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,190
- Dae-su.
- Miss Park.

730
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:14,694
Be soon.

731
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,252
Grab the window frame. Okay.

732
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,337
- Grab her.
- I got you.

733
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,671
Let go.

734
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:34,881
- I have a cramp!
- You okay?

735
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,634
- Ah, shit.
- Straighten your knee.

736
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,510
- Not my legs!
- Watch out for your neck!

737
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,347
Good. You did great. You did great.

738
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,125
Go down.

739
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,006
I-sak...

740
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,549
You have to get it together.

741
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,803
Everyone in here lost a friend, On-jo.

742
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,180
Do you know how many people died?
Why are you so...

743
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,349
There's just no one left that I like.

744
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,523
Well, there are people who like you.

745
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:35,942
Like your dad.

746
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,989
You have to stay alive for them.

747
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,581
Let's go.

748
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,772
SU-HYEOK, WE'RE IN THE
BROADCASTING ROOM, NAM-RA

749
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,223
Oh...

750
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,794
Hurry.

751
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:18,711
Hurry up.

752
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,213
Grab her. Okay.

753
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,966
Careful. Okay. Okay.

754
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:52,109
