1
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:07,467
Ah, there you are.

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,889
You good, ancestors?

3
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:15,767
I don't wanna think about
what Nate and Zari were doing in there

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,090
to make you fall off my wrist
in the middle of the night.

5
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:19,914
Actually, after several rounds

6
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:21,332
of me kicking your butt
in <i>Mortal Kombat,</i>

7
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:23,191
you complained of your totem being too...

8
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:25,151
Too tight on my gaming arms.

9
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,986
So I loosened it up a little.

10
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:28,655
Oh, thank goodness.

11
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:31,533
That's why you spent the night
underneath the couch.

12
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,537
Before you go, B,
I have an important message.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,704
It's cool, G.

14
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:38,623
We can skip my morning horoscope.

15
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,250
Running late for another team meeting,

16
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,918
and misplacing my totem

17
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,420
couldn't be more obvious
that Mercury's in retrograde.

18
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:48,550
According to the temporal
chronometer, today is your birthday.

19
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,343
Whoa.

20
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:51,970
I'm a quarter century.

21
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,221
Happy birthday.

22
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,099
<i>Okay.</i>

23
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:58,768
Thanks to Kayla's pod tracker,
we have a new advantage

24
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,063
in preventing displaced aliens
from screwing with the timeline.

25
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:05,226
- Gideon, can you please run a scan?
- Right away, Co-captain Sharpe.

26
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:09,988
I'm all in 'cause mind melding
with that giant sandworm

27
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,614
left me with a nasty migraine.

28
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:12,824
But...

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,285
I souped up my <i>pequeño amigo</i>

30
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:18,246
with a special surprise
for the next space vermin.

31
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,624
- No need for surprises, guys.
- Ah, called it.

32
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,793
Shows up late
wearing the clothes that he slept in,

33
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,295
but still had time for breakfast,

34
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:29,215
which means I am out of bathroom
cleaning rotation for a month.

35
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,884
Yeah. No, no surprises.

36
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:34,429
Just slowly losing
all of our free will to Astra.

37
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:35,512
Oh, good.

38
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,807
'Cause who needs surprises
when smoking a few bowls,

39
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,100
watching your favorite sitcom

40
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,019
on Buzzflix
with friends and fam will do.

41
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,018
Mmm.

42
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,314
That sounds like a very romantic evening
for you and Nate,

43
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:45,690
but, oh, yeah, that's right,

44
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,335
we don't know which of our totems
he decided to have a sleepover in.

45
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,445
Pardon me,
but the pod's projected path

46
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:53,239
is Vancouver, British Columbia, 2023.

47
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:54,532
All right, everybody.

48
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:57,201
Put on your toques and Canada goose

49
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,662
because we are going
to the third largest

50
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:02,040
metropolitan area in Canada.

51
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,211
Oh, Raincouver, babe.
It was right there.

52
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,379
But it makes sense.

53
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:10,381
- It's, like, accurate information.
- It's okay.

54
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:12,175
Oh, Zari, you might just
want to call Nate,

55
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:15,338
because even in the preventing business,
we could still use all hands on deck.

56
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,471
Got it, girl.

57
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,186
<i>Dad?</i>

58
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,939
<i>Dad, is that you? Are you okay?</i>

59
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:29,108
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

60
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,570
<i>I... I need to see you right now.
Where are you?</i>

61
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:37,367
Uh, hold on. I keep losing track
of my stupid portal thingy.

62
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,534
I'll grab one.

63
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:43,122
Not how I thought my day would go,
but it's all good.

64
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,832
Universe has bigger plans.

65
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,167
What's so special about today?

66
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,711
It's a day that only comes around
once a year.

67
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,088
Aw. Cute affirmation.

68
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:52,924
Anyway, if these bae-cations
between Nate and 1.0

69
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,985
are gonna become the yoozh,
we need to work out a schedule.

70
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,428
I did not sleep a wink this weekend
because I was afraid

71
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,931
he was just gonna sneak attack
and pop out of the totem.

72
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,475
Look, I want Nate back today
of all days...

73
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,702
- Hey, Mick.
- Hey, Mick.

74
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,496
But we don't know
what's going on in the totem.

75
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,939
What if he's, you know,
<i>in flagrante delicto?</i>

76
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,148
This is what I'm saying.

77
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:12,110
Do you not care that he's doing
God knows what on your wrist?

78
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,451
Really? Come on, guys.

79
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,595
- Oh... This is what I told you.
- No.

80
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,619
What...

81
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,622
Oh. Huh?

82
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:27,333
- Yeah, yeah.
- Did you...

83
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,794
- Well, hello. Rory?
- What are you doing?

84
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,379
You should see her.

85
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:42,724
How long was I in that totem?

86
00:03:57,697 --> 00:03:58,906
She's pregnant.

87
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,576
Uh, yeah, Rory, we time jumped to 2023.

88
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,077
Opened a portal to Lita's future.

89
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,037
Lita, honey! It's so good to see you.

90
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,165
You look beautiful. Congratulations.

91
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,708
Thanks, Aunt Ava.

92
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,668
She's pregnant.

93
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:13,713
It's family reunion time!

94
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,632
Yes, refereed by Auntie Ava.

95
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,634
Mick!
You're gonna be a grandpappy.

96
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,934
I can't believe you went
and got yourself knocked up!

97
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,396
Got myself knocked up?

98
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:34,400
What do you call what you did with mom
in my high school gym supply closet?

99
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:36,486
- Conceiving.
- Really?

100
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,196
I haven't seen you in over a year.

101
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,032
You don't answer any of my calls
and that's all you have to say.

102
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,700
What the hell are you talking about?

103
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,911
You know what?
Here I thought the worst had happened

104
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:47,371
and that my baby would never
get to meet their grandfather,

105
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:50,833
but it turns out I was only half right
because you're totally fine.

106
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,587
And you're still the same Mick Rory,
a deadbeat.

107
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,296
Uh...

108
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,341
I am not a... I am not a deadbeat!

109
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,884
Come back here, young lady!

110
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:00,967
Okay, okay, okay.

111
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,690
Maybe let's just try
a little less shouting

112
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,531
and a lot more listening
so that we can figure out

113
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,200
why you disappear
from your daughter's life, Mick.

114
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,224
I'm not shouting.

115
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,735
Okay, the pod
should make landfall soon. Ish.

116
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,418
Wait.

117
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,258
You guys here
for the <i>Bud Stuy</i> taping?

118
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,260
- Here you go.
- What the...

119
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,344
What? Little...

120
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,888
I knew that was Imran Sayed
in the back of that car.

121
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:49,058
What? Who is Imran Sayed
and what is <i>Bud Stuy?</i>

122
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,561
Like you didn't already know
it's my favorite sitcom

123
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,938
- created by the Sayed brothers.
- Oh, right.

124
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,399
Gratitude overload.

125
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,277
Faking a mission and pretending
like you forgot today was my birthday

126
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,071
so you could spring
<i>Bud Stuy</i> tickets on me.

127
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,614
Too good.

128
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:08,828
Gang.

129
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,080
Thank you for keeping it under wraps.

130
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:14,250
It is so hard to pull this stuff off.

131
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,544
Um, actually...

132
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:20,047
Yeah. It was all Zari's idea.

133
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,758
The pod tracker doesn't even work.

134
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,094
We love you so much. Happy birthday.

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,392
Yeah, so you better
get in there, birthday boy,

136
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,394
before I change my mind.

137
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,646
Come on!

138
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,691
What are we doing?

139
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,610
Wait, Spooner, not you. Come on.

140
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:44,030
Okay. The pod's further out this way.

141
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:48,576
What is so special about this show?
It doesn't look popular.

142
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,204
Well, that's because it only lasted
two seasons in high school.

143
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:55,541
Behrad used to stay up all night,
get high, and watch reruns on Buzzflix.

144
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,003
Within pot culture,
<i>Bud Stuy</i> had more of a cult following.

145
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,463
Oh. Sounds like a lame cult.

146
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,840
People with low ambition
going nowhere in life.

147
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,425
Take it easy on B.

148
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,427
Wasn't like any of us
were saving the world

149
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,887
when we were in high school.

150
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,890
I mean, technically, I was
becoming a global brand

151
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,813
and building a Fortune 500 company.

152
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,394
But it's your birthday,
so who's keeping track?

153
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,440
Figured it was stressful enough having
one global superstar in the fambam.

154
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,735
<i>Bud Stuy's</i> charm was that
it wasn't trying to appeal to everyone,

155
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,153
but it meant a lot to me.

156
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,322
And wait till you see Imran Sayed.

157
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,407
My all-time favorite actor.

158
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:32,078
Oh! Show's starting. Time to get hyped!

159
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:33,496
Whoo!

160
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,789
Yeah!

161
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:38,209
The pod should be entering
our atmosphere any minute now.

162
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:41,462
Speak of the devil.

163
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,635
Bud Stuy <i>was filmed
in front of a live studio audience.</i>

164
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,101
Bro!

165
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,477
Whoo!

166
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,562
I got a DJ-ing gig.

167
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59,646
It's tonight.

168
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,154
Wait. Aren't you supposed to be working
a shift at your parents' bakery tonight?

169
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,699
No, no. My days of pimping jalebis

170
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:12,552
- to hipsters in Bushwick are over.
- To hipsters in Bushwick are over.

171
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,997
I'm not missing out on spinning
at little Joshy Steinberg's bar mitzvah.

172
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,165
Tonight he enters adulthood,

173
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:21,043
as well as the <i>36 Chambers</i>
of the Wu-Tang Clan.

174
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:22,753
They're kids.

175
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:26,173
Just play something young and pop-y
and dumb like Dragon Girl.

176
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,883
- Rude.
- Damn.

177
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:30,302
How are you gonna tell your parents
you're skipping work?

178
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,764
I'm gonna honestly explain
that I'm pursuing my passion.

179
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,267
I have a dream.
It's up to me to follow it.

180
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,770
And then I'm gonna get smacked.

181
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,359
- What do you think you're doing?
- Preventing.

182
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,577
Damn.

183
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,079
Sleeping gummies, reading gummies,
naughty gummies.

184
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:58,706
You're really gonna get high

185
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,918
to tell your parents you're quitting
the family business to pursue DJ-ing?

186
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,420
<i>Bismillah!</i>

187
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,299
How else would I get through

188
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:12,053
such a deep, meaningful conversation?

189
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:18,642
Life's a trip... if you got the right
accoutrement for the ride.

190
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,563
This sounds like a terrible ride.

191
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,608
This show is too niche.
We need something to make it a mass hit.

192
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:31,280
Finally, something interesting
happens on the show.

193
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,740
This is not supposed to happen.

194
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,333
Aw!

195
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,965
Uh...

196
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:54,345
Am I tripping or did my personal stash
get mixed up with the prop stash again?

197
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,722
Go, go.

198
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,189
That was a classic!

199
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,152
And cut.

200
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,451
So, this surprise
is really starting to give off

201
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:19,995
"an improvised lie that backfired" vibe.

202
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,164
- Listen...
- It's cool.

203
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:23,916
Little trope-y but...

204
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,169
I guess we're doing a sitcom mission.

205
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,472
Hey, little guy.

206
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:41,725
Yeah, yeah, you.
You know, the camera loves you.

207
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,435
Just come on over.

208
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,331
Come here, little guy.

209
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,649
You're ruining
one of my favorite episodes.

210
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,778
Look, Kam, I know we've had
our creative disagreements,

211
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,739
but crashing the taping
with an animatronic alien?

212
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,116
Right.

213
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,618
Hey, buddy.

214
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:00,702
Come here.

215
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,203
Wow.

216
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,540
Look at him. He's so cute.

217
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,127
It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

218
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,088
There you go.

219
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,592
Well, this animatronic
alien is adorable,

220
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,885
and the audience ate it up.

221
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,696
So if we're ever going to be more
than a cult show,

222
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,239
we need a gag
that's a little less foreign.

223
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,266
Less foreign?
It's a freakin' alien, man.

224
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,309
I want broader appeal.

225
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,518
You want less Muslim?

226
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,242
You don't know
what religion the alien is.

227
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,772
This thing is freaking me out.

228
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,943
The puppeteer is going really method
because this thing is way too life-like.

229
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,321
Remember how we got here?

230
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,198
I was your first audience,

231
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,117
the one who encouraged you
and drove you to all your stand-up gigs.

232
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,411
Have I ever steered you wrong before?

233
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,543
Can we at least reshoot the ending?

234
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:50,628
Help get some VFX money,

235
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,546
make that crash look
a little more convincing.

236
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,923
We'll fix it in post.

237
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,305
Aw!

238
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,850
That thing's adorable. See, Spooner?

239
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:06,810
I think I'm going to need a smaller gun.

240
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:10,022
Hey! What are you still doing here?
Come on.

241
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,774
Oh, we're just...

242
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,568
Hi, there, buddy. How's it going?

243
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:16,695
Ow!

244
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,241
You're no animatronic.

245
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,704
Okay, Micky, I get that
Lita's pregnancy's unexpected.

246
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:28,350
You know, it feels like only yesterday
that we were watching her grow up.

247
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,085
But if I have learned anything
co-captaining the team on this ship,

248
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,796
it's that being a parent
is really just about being cool

249
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,631
when things
aren't really that cool, yeah?

250
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,651
Okay, where we at with listening, Mick?

251
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:40,928
Captain Sharpe, you want another try at
a sassy send-off attempt for the record?

252
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,305
- No.
- Ooh. Why are we power walking?

253
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,520
Oh, look, she's studying.
It's excellent, right?

254
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,565
Mmm. Hi, Lita, honey.

255
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:56,193
See, she's still in school.
That's great, right, Mick?

256
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,987
Yeah. I have a big test coming up

257
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,990
in my intersectionality
and feminist activism class.

258
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,533
It's where I met Niko.

259
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:07,371
You got knocked up by some creep
taking a class for women?

260
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,540
Let's see what else you've missed.

261
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm vegan.

262
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,044
I'm over my Sabbath phase,
more into Fiona Apple,

263
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,297
and I'm donating all the money
you left me in the shed

264
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,620
- to AOC's future presidential run.
- Wow.

265
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,593
Is there anything else
you want to judge me for?

266
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:25,889
You know what? Why don't you tell us
how you and Niko plan to raise the baby?

267
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,100
We're co-habitating.

268
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,062
The institution of marriage
is too inherently patriarchal.

269
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,698
Stupid swollen fingers.

270
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,074
Here.

271
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,159
No, I got it.

272
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:50,497
You know, Gideon could have
made you something.

273
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:54,001
Yeah, well, I don't have Gideon
at school just to make my life easier.

274
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,921
And, usually, Niko helps me
with this stuff.

275
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,302
Okay.

276
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:07,431
I am rational enough to accept defeat,

277
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,975
hangry enough to accept your help.

278
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:15,689
You know, uh, some jars are like
old stubborn bastards.

279
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,276
They eventually open up.

280
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:27,117
Tell me about Niko.

281
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,211
Would it have killed Kamran
to lock his office door

282
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,421
so the baby alien didn't escape?

283
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,549
I can't believe you cut
my sexy totem time short for this.

284
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,804
Oh, by the way, she'd kill me
if I forgot. She said, "Hey."

285
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,222
Hmm. That's sweet.

286
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,515
Hey, girl.

287
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:54,561
What does she do in the totem
for, like, you know, self-care?

288
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:55,938
Mostly be at peace.

289
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,107
School the ancestors in poker,

290
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,750
but mainly, she'd want to talk about B.

291
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,567
Really?

292
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,464
Yeah. She'd want to know
his current hair length,

293
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,489
is he dating, did he beat
any of her high scores.

294
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,282
And, for whatever reason,

295
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,843
she asked me to keep
an eye on him tonight

296
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,467
to make sure he didn't party too hard...

297
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,537
Oh...

298
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:13,539
I just got it.

299
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,250
Of course, even though
she's stuck in mystical limbo,

300
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,377
she didn't forget his birthday.

301
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,550
There. You happy?

302
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,718
Yeah. Maybe one with the both of us?

303
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:27,970
I can snap it.

304
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,555
- Long arms.
- Behrad.

305
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
Let's go.

306
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,934
You know, by catching this alien,

307
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,229
we're actually preventing capitalism
from creating another monster?

308
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,772
Yeah, a monster hit.

309
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,858
You sound like Zari.

310
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,152
Don't tell me you think
the baby alien's cute too?

311
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,321
No, I don't think it's cute,
but there is no accounting mass taste.

312
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,574
Well, no disrespect
to the past six years,

313
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,534
but this is the biggest mission ever.

314
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,911
I'm not gonna let this alien
ruin my favorite show.

315
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:53,953
Don't be so dramatic.

316
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,714
All I'm saying is,
your sister's got a point.

317
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,708
If it doesn't make money,
it doesn't make sense.

318
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,846
You the new PA?

319
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,266
Yeah.

320
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,853
Good, because all we have around here
are those little coffee pods,

321
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,646
and we can't do that to Mother Earth.

322
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,356
Totally.

323
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,152
<i>Appeareat coffea.</i>

324
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,265
Well, don't be shy. Get in there.

325
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,991
Maybe your hero knows
where his brother hid that thing.

326
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,663
Astra Logue, Labor Relations.

327
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:40,626
Don't mind me.
I am just here to observe your... labor.

328
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:44,713
What if the baby alien
is in, like, Alien WITSEC?

329
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:48,342
Hiding out on earth from the big bad
that destroyed his home planet?

330
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,970
Sounds like a season of backstory
and mythology.

331
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,740
Just to pitch it,

332
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,934
the baby alien was sent to Earth
on a rumspringa,

333
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,521
and is just trying to find
the perfect party pad.

334
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,022
That's just what we need.

335
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,608
More aliens on the show.

336
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,778
I don't know if caffeine
is so good for the process,

337
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:12,032
but we could get you something groovier
to help get the creative juices flowing.

338
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,909
This guy knows what's up.

339
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,537
Oh, uh, bro, Labor Relations.

340
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,122
Mr. Sayed, where did your brother
stash the baby alien?

341
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,124
You mean that stupid puppet?
I don't know.

342
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,168
Then we're done here.

343
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:28,882
- <i>Any luck?</i>
- Negative.

344
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,902
But I did get a peek behind the curtain
in the writer's room.

345
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,010
<i>Trust me,</i>

346
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,429
<i>you do not wanna know
how the sausage gets made.</i>

347
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:36,807
Oh, good.

348
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,058
I think we found it.

349
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,810
Meet us by the stages.

350
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,104
Oh, hey, little guy.

351
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,233
Hey, I can promise you,
alien hybrid-to-alien,

352
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,485
bananas, they're overrated.

353
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,612
Everything bagels.

354
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:51,905
This is where it's at.

355
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,450
Mmm!

356
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,160
Yeah, you wanna try it?

357
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:58,869
Come on.

358
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,706
There you go.

359
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,165
Yeah, I know.

360
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,585
Let's get out of here.

361
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:08,713
Astra.

362
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,424
I don't think he likes that.

363
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:23,936
Oh!

364
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:32,988
There you are.

365
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,995
I'm gonna talk to props
about leaving things lying around.

366
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,077
Somebody could get hurt.

367
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,830
What?

368
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,088
All right. Rise and shine,
everyone. We need a new strategy.

369
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,923
Where is Behrad?

370
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,342
Late again.

371
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,969
Let's sweeten the pot
on the earlier bet.

372
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,804
If he doesn't show
in the next five minutes,

373
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,432
loser becomes my personal
Fluff and Fold.

374
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,726
Relax, relax.

375
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:04,895
I'm right here.

376
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,897
Is that my brother?

377
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,609
That's my pomade.

378
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,110
I'd know that sheen anywhere.

379
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,005
Communal bathroom.
Thought it was up for grabs,

380
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,073
and I just felt like shaking things up.

381
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,408
I knew you had leading man hair in you.

382
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:19,910
All Tarazis have the gene.

383
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,329
Okay, let's just show Gary the...

384
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,623
Wow, it really is mesmerizing.

385
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,124
Thank you.

386
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,336
Oh!

387
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,962
A gusarax.

388
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,674
Baby Gus-Gus.
It's got a nice ring to it.

389
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,718
You're coining merchandisable
nicknames now?

390
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:41,306
Why was Imran's brother able to grab Gus
without causing a Category Five tantrum?

391
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,351
Well, gusaraxes are bonded
to their parents

392
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,186
during the developmental phase.

393
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,357
So if Gus-Gus...
is bonded to Imran's brother,

394
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,001
you'll have to get him
to bond with one of you,

395
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,425
but good luck with that.

396
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,422
They're attached
to their parents at the hip,

397
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,740
because that is where the teat is.

398
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,742
Oh, don't say "teat."

399
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,453
Captain Lance, I've detected
that a new <i>Bud Stuy</i> draft

400
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,722
has been submitted to the studio.

401
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,124
Episode titled "First Contact High."

402
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,666
New cup?

403
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,001
Hmm. Weird.

404
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,755
Wharton is the business school
my <i>Mâmân</i> and <i>Bâbâ</i> think I attend.

405
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,816
"Wharton is the business school
my <i>Mâmân</i> and <i>Bâbâ</i> think I attend"?

406
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:19,928
What's happening to me?

407
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,974
I think the change in your favorite show
is having an effect on you.

408
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,768
He's better groomed, better caffeinated.

409
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,562
I'd say Behrad got a free upgrade.

410
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,106
No. No, no, no. This is not good.

411
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,150
The butterfly effect
from one small change

412
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,713
in the timeline is too unpredictable.

413
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,571
That's how we lost Zari 1.0.

414
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:41,324
Okay, they're looking for
the role of nosy landlord.

415
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,287
It's obviously me.
I'm the trained actor.

416
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,209
I'm just going to be
a nosy, glamorous landlord,

417
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,292
but, Nate, come with, run lines.

418
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,186
All right, let's get you
ready for that close-up.

419
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,170
Okay, great.

420
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:54,337
Zari, once you book the part,

421
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,214
you'll be in position
to separate Gus-Gus

422
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,966
from Imran's brother and bond with him.

423
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,301
Astra and B,

424
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,845
make sure that this new script
doesn't make it to air.

425
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,680
We have to ensure
that Imran stays the star

426
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,391
so that Behrad can stay himself.

427
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,358
What do you mean
I'm not a right fit for the role?

428
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,611
You don't seem super great at your job.

429
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,738
The writers had
a very specific vision in mind.

430
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,032
Someone who fits
the new direction of the show.

431
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,492
- Oh, did they?
- Hey, Z.

432
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,161
The sign by the complimentary mints
said "only take one,"

433
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,371
so keep this on the DL.

434
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,376
Nathaniel Heywood.
Don't need to lie about my height.

435
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,797
I am 6'2".

436
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,966
Currently living? Here and there.

437
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,510
I travel a lot for work.

438
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,678
Is this for the CW?

439
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,098
<i>So much for Plan Z.
But Nate's getting his big break.</i>

440
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:50,227
Finally, a win for a straight white man.

441
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,272
If I was rebooting a show with
a flop first season, he'd be my pick.

442
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,567
Who says stuff like that?

443
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,904
I don't want to become
some materialistic jerk with a Roth IRA,

444
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,491
driving a car that burns gas
and pounding red-eyes.

445
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,201
If this show is going off the rails,

446
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,079
you need to talk to the person
at the top of the food chain.

447
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,797
"Faiz, it's the nosy landlord.
Hide all the bongs.

448
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,924
And the baby alien."

449
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:28,390
As your boss, I got to tell you,
I'm good on the pharmaceuticals, bro.

450
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,268
- At least until this makeup sets.
- You can't sell out, man.

451
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,314
Growing up, my mom and dad looked at me

452
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,775
and saw a future
business school graduate.

453
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,362
The world saw a weird Muslim kid
they couldn't bother to figure out.

454
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:47,659
But seeing you on TV, Imran,
was the first time I saw me.

455
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,497
That's great.

456
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,375
But I got to do
what my brother tells me.

457
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,002
No, you don't.

458
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:58,545
Dude.

459
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,423
I flipped burgers, spun signs.

460
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:05,677
But the gig I have now,
it's the sweetest gig ever.

461
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,807
I just had to let you know.
I wouldn't have ended up here

462
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,977
if I hadn't seen you
on <i>Bud Stuy</i> so carefree.

463
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,980
It's like you gave me permission
to leave home

464
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,858
and go on
the craziest adventure of my life.

465
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,278
Please, don't change your show.

466
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,655
It's perfect the way it is.

467
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,952
You must really love being a PA.

468
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,454
Like, a lot.

469
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,133
Come on.

470
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,222
Imran.

471
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,451
The studio loves
the baby alien in the new draft,

472
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,369
and you're gonna love the casting
for the nosy landlord.

473
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,937
Kam, this isn't working out.

474
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,271
I promise, the new guy pops.

475
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,902
This show was supposed to be
about the things that make us laugh.

476
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,236
My life.

477
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,115
I know it's not for everyone,
but to the people who get it,

478
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:11,952
it's life changing.

479
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,206
You really not believe in that anymore?

480
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,959
What about the people who pay us
to make a hit?

481
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,961
The studio's threatening to cancel us.

482
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,763
Yeah, well, I'd rather have one person

483
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,057
laughing in the audience
than be a complete sellout.

484
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,060
- Don't do this.
- I quit.

485
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,243
You okay?

486
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,206
Oh, yeah. I'm just trying to wrap
Behrad's birthday gifts.

487
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,310
You know, the edges have to be perfect
or the whole presentation is thrown off,

488
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,334
that's all.

489
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,966
I'm so sorry, honey.
Are you okay?

490
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,677
Yeah, I'm just looking for my dad.
I should head out soon.

491
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,721
So I take it
you two buried the hatchet, then?

492
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,849
Well, you know Mick. Runs a little hot,
but he cools down eventually.

493
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,518
Oh, really?

494
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,604
Yeah. He's even asking
all these questions about Niko.

495
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,482
Like, where he grew up
and his class schedule and...

496
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,646
He's really interested
in his cross-country training.

497
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,486
Even down to the hours and the routes.

498
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:32,449
Niko wants to compete in the Olympics.

499
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,412
Aw. See,
I knew he'd come around.

500
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:37,579
So, should we start
planning a baby shower, then?

501
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,039
Or a funeral.

502
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,583
Take it from a trained assassin.

503
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,793
You want to murder somebody
without a trace?

504
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,379
You gather as much intel as possible.

505
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,132
Lita, your dad
is gonna kill your boyfriend.

506
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,774
What do you mean,
"Mr. Sayed's booked for the day"?

507
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:07,358
- Un-book him.
- And make it quick,

508
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,319
because she's the nice one.

509
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,112
- You don't want to upset me.
- It's true.

510
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:13,448
Good girl.

511
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:16,701
Where's Behrad?

512
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,662
Relax. He's just pulling himself
together after Imran quit.

513
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:22,373
- The timeline hasn't changed that fast.
- Hmm.

514
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,545
<i>For real</i>

515
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,423
<i>Just let that money talk</i>

516
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,009
<i>Take it to the head</i>

517
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,136
My parking needs validating.

518
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,432
I didn't know you had it in you.

519
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,102
Try to keep up.

520
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,021
<i>I just let that money talk</i>

521
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,023
Wow, that is...

522
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,235
Kidding me?

523
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,570
Possibilities are endless.

524
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,032
Let me call you back. Excuse me.
Can I help you?

525
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,702
You're gonna want to try, Kam.
We're members of the puppeteers union.

526
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,330
Yeah. We're gonna need to see proof

527
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:07,001
that you're using union-certified
puppeteers to operate the baby alien.

528
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:09,254
I mean,
unless you have something to hide.

529
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,383
Okay, it's not a puppet.

530
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,511
I swear I was just waiting
to get publicity all lined up

531
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:17,720
before I broke the news.

532
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:21,099
The world's first alien TV star's
a gold mine.

533
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,310
You're just willing to stab your brother
in the back for success?

534
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:25,770
Well, he does have a point.

535
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:30,191
Gus-Gus is a vertical
integration vehicle.

536
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:32,819
I'm talking dolls, branding deals.

537
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:36,239
You can build an entire universe
out of this little guy.

538
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,616
- The synergy's all there.
- I like the way you think.

539
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,034
And we are leaving.

540
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:43,121
Thank you so much for your time.

541
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,415
What the hell was that?

542
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:48,585
You want to make something of your life?
Takes a little ambition.

543
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:49,711
Speak.

544
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,297
Uh...

545
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,261
Come on, Niko. Pick up.

546
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,099
Oh, my God, Lita. Look.

547
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,726
Rory's strangling him.

548
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,896
Wait, are they hugging?

549
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,231
Huh.

550
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:16,237
I really want to thank you for looking
after my daughter while I was...

551
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,198
Away.

552
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,241
Dad.

553
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,368
I thought you were gonna kill him.

554
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,494
I was.

555
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:26,581
- Dad!
- No, no. It's okay. We talked it out.

556
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,167
Mr. Rory came around to
seeing how bad it would look

557
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,711
if the author of
<i>Post Feminism Empowerment</i>

558
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,796
killed his daughter's boyfriend.

559
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,506
Oh, really?

560
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,012
I want my grandchild
to have something I didn't.

561
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,306
Two loving parents.

562
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,853
You see? You never told me
your dad was this cool.

563
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:51,731
He totally understands
how we got caught up in the moment.

564
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,733
Said the same thing
happened to him and Kayla.

565
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,319
You mean, you and Mom.

566
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:59,948
Wait. You and Kayla?

567
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,538
Are you okay?

568
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,000
Are you crying?

569
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,878
- No.
- It's okay, Mr. Rory.

570
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,964
Let those toxic man tears flow.

571
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:19,884
Rest in peace, Kayla.

572
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,725
Um... Okay. I'll see you later.

573
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,519
I'm just gonna make sure
he gets home okay.

574
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,896
He's been acting really strange lately.

575
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:36,150
Yeah, real strange.

576
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:42,865
Your key, sir.

577
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,621
Behrad, wait.

578
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:50,945
We're trying to get the timeline
back on track, remember?

579
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,376
- Who's this tool?
- What?

580
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:57,380
Hand over the keys.
Unless you want to take a ride, babe.

581
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,591
If you call me "babe" one more time...

582
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,510
Okay, that's enough.
You need to come with us.

583
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:05,305
- Come on.
- That's a lawsuit, bro.

584
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:07,015
Sure you can afford that?

585
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:08,182
Where's your totem?

586
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:11,185
Totem? It's a Rollie.

587
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:17,108
Nate.

588
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,277
What happened? Where'd it go?

589
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,155
When he joined the team,
he stole the totem from home.

590
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,157
If he never did that, then...

591
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,035
You're coming with us.

592
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:29,370
My girlfriend's in that totem, you tool.

593
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,165
Who lives in this dump?

594
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,542
It's kind of hard to explain,

595
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,337
but I need you to chill
while I go take care of something.

596
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,714
Chill? I don't chill.

597
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,341
I got money moves to make.

598
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,092
"Money moves"?

599
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,554
Is that why you sabotaged
the meeting with Kamran?

600
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,891
You're not the only one
who understands mass appeal.

601
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:52,727
Gus-Gus is going to be
a global superstar.

602
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,480
I'm bringing <i>Bud Stuy</i>
to a whole new audience.

603
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:56,773
Jealous?

604
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:02,070
No. Because the Behrad I know
isn't some calculating business bro.

605
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,781
Yeah, well,
maybe you don't know me at all.

606
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,535
Zari, what's going on?

607
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,375
I'm sorry, Behrad.

608
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,918
You can't leave me in here, Zari.

609
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,087
I'm not leaving you. I'm fixing this.

610
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,885
It's going to be all right.

611
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:26,968
Is it?

612
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,723
At least when your Zari lost Behrad,
it wasn't her fault.

613
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:32,767
Enough with the "your Zari" stuff.
You're my Zari, too.

614
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,519
No, Nate. Your Zari is gone.

615
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:35,602
And without the totem,

616
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,081
so is everything
she sacrificed her life for,

617
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,415
a decision I doubt she would have made

618
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,067
if she knew she was being replaced
by a version of her who...

619
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,904
Who didn't realize how a sitcom
literally changed her brother's life.

620
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,448
Z, we all messed up.
But we gotta get moving.

621
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,158
When this timeline catches up to Behrad,

622
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,327
there's no telling
who we're going to be without him.

623
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,918
So, when were you gonna
tell me about Kayla?

624
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,392
It sounds like you really
cared about her.

625
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,589
And do not leave out any details.

626
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:06,509
Like, when you got caught up
in the moment...

627
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,719
Cover your ears, Lita.
...were there any, uh,

628
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,181
tentacles involved?

629
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,683
Whoa!

630
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,309
You dated an alien?

631
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:19,439
We didn't date. We almost died.

632
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:21,941
But then we... Then I...

633
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:23,985
Gross, Dad.

634
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,070
So there were tentacles involved?

635
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:28,156
Yeah, lots. It was mind-blowing.

636
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,158
You jealous? Now get out of here.

637
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,368
I want to spend some more time
with my daughter.

638
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,706
Kamran.

639
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,040
Oh, now what?

640
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,836
Listen, I know you worked your ass off
for this moment,

641
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:48,009
and our hard work is rarely celebrated.
So I get how badly you want to be seen.

642
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:49,552
But you know this isn't right.

643
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,512
Have you ever seen the show?

644
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:54,474
My brother wasn't exactly making
television that we could be proud of.

645
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:59,246
You know what? He doesn't have to be
a torchbearer for all of us.

646
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,648
That expectation is honestly unrealistic
and, frankly, annoying.

647
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,026
Your brother inspired people

648
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:09,405
not by trying to inspire people
but just by being himself.

649
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,699
Well, then, too bad that he quit.

650
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,453
And that's how you wanna leave things?

651
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:18,432
Don't let this be the fight
that changes things between you.

652
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:19,790
Because once that happens,

653
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:22,668
you could lose him forever.

654
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:25,254
Which diaper do you want to go with
for the baby alien?

655
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,338
Picture's up.

656
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:28,382
Two. I like the extra cushion.

657
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:31,677
Look, picture's up. Like, right now.
There's nothing I can do.

658
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,480
Instead of lighting up
in the dark all alone,

659
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,316
you need to get your ass in there
and take back your show.

660
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,610
You know, you're really
pushy for Labor Relations.

661
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:49,737
You can't make me go back.

662
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:04,210
Bud Stuy <i>was filmed in front
of a live studio audience.</i>

663
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,051
Oh, no. It's the nosy landlord.

664
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,136
I have to hide the bong
and the baby alien.

665
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:19,518
Sorry, buddy.

666
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,188
I didn't know it was inspection day.

667
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,433
"That's why it's called
a surprise inspection."

668
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,366
That's why it's called
a surprise inspection.

669
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,164
I'm Nick Hunter.

670
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:46,210
Intergalactic alien law enforcer.

671
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:48,838
What the hell is
the nosy landlord doing?

672
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,048
No...

673
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,842
You're the nosy landlord.

674
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,886
It's called a plot twist, amateur.

675
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,430
Now, where's Gus-Gus?

676
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,224
A-ha!

677
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,584
Set this bad boy to stun.

678
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:31,839
Hey, hey!

679
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:40,306
And this won't hurt a bit.

680
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,475
Ow!

681
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:08,584
Caught you, you little finger biter.

682
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,880
No, no no. Don't cry. Don't cry.
This is not a problem.

683
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:23,724
Good.

684
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:28,104
You beautiful alien baby.

685
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,147
Aw.

686
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:36,779
Faiz, what did I tell you
about having the right accoutrement?

687
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,201
Take a couple of these for the road,
nosy landlord.

688
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:46,914
Have a nice trip, Gus-Gus.

689
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:59,343
I'm just glad things are back
to normal around here.

690
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,355
It looks like the audience hated it.

691
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:13,482
But that's why I believed in you
in the first place.

692
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,333
You guys!

693
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:33,544
Shh!

694
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,381
Shh.

695
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:41,802
Happy birthday.

696
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:45,722
Thanks.

697
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:52,897
<i>My first time using a cell phone
was the day Behrad was born.</i>

698
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,779
<i>I was trying to take a selfie,
but my annoying baby brother photobombed.</i>

699
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,408
<i>Every Eid,
he wanted to be in the kitchen.</i>

700
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,537
<i>And he wasn't just sneaking</i>
Mâmân's <i>fesenjoon.</i>

701
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,874
<i>He was learning.</i>

702
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,421
<i>No wonder he cooks
the best team dinners.</i>

703
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:24,595
<i>He's on his own weird
and special wavelength.</i>

704
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,226
<i>I love him just the way he is.</i>

705
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:33,729
<i>He is priceless.</i>

706
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:41,695
And somehow I forget
that someone really amazing

707
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,531
gave up everything for him to be here.

708
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,995
For me,
Behrad's birthday became a reminder

709
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,705
of everything he missed out on.

710
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,918
It makes me happy to see
he's had a chance to really live.

711
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:01,507
Well, you know, we're throwing
a party for him right now,

712
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,093
and you should really get going
before all the cake is gone.

713
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,719
I know how you love cake.

714
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,931
What about the timeline?

715
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,893
Well, I heard that finding loopholes
is kind of your thing.

716
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:14,377
So I had a chat with the ancestors.

717
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:18,357
Turns out two Air Totems have
never existed at the same time before.

718
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,652
They think if only one of us is out
at a time, Behrad should be safe.

719
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:23,612
I say we try it out for a few weeks.

720
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:29,577
What are you waiting for?

721
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,914
Behrad's probably looking for someone
to take shrooms with as we speak.

722
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:37,585
Oh... You know how to imitate
<i>Mâmân's</i> disapproving death stare, right?

723
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,671
Yeah, yeah.

724
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:41,964
Good.

725
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:45,759
Thank you.

726
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,930
Look at this guy. Look at him.

727
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,810
I heard you committed grand theft auto.

728
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:56,145
Yeah.

729
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:57,730
Did all that for little ol' me?

730
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:58,981
I did it for everyone.

731
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,941
We couldn't breathe
around the douchier you.

732
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,192
Too much cologne.

733
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,739
Is that sandalwood and frankincense?

734
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:10,034
I like sandalwood and frankincense.

735
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,455
All right.

736
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:16,832
My little brother is all grown up.

737
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,417
Oh. Oh!

738
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,128
Happy birthday.

739
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:27,676
No.

740
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:43,359
So Ava Lance is engaged. Congrats.

741
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:46,820
Sara has a new set
of healing powers. Sweet.

742
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:50,407
Gary's been an alien this whole time.
Not at all surprising.

743
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:54,578
Lita's expecting. Oh, and a baby alien
imprinted on my boyfriend.

744
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:55,746
Cool, cool, cool.

745
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:59,124
Hmm. Well, guess I can count on you
to never change, Mick.

746
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:00,208
Cheers.

747
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,795
Whoa!

748
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:05,506
The hell are you doing?

749
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,360
When you and Kayla got caught up
in the moment,

750
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:10,779
her tentacle entered your ear canal
and she laid eggs in your head,

751
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:12,513
and now you're growing a brood...

752
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,390
Pouch.

753
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,520
So you're saying my dad is...

754
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,896
Pregnant?

755
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,481
Yep.

756
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:26,652
Gideon.

757
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:30,406
Sorry, I can't help it.
This is the laugh I was programmed with.

758
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,199
Wow.

759
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,451
That I did not see coming.
