That's when Wells will be back.

173
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,283
Why would Wells want
the particle accelerator to work again?

174
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,744
<i>I don't know.
It's not like it was a success the first time.</i>

175
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,832
-It made me the Flash.
-That's not all it did.

176
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,377
CAITLIN: So, what happens
if the particle accelerator turns on...

177
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,588
...while the metahumans are in containment?

178
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:53,922
They're toast.

179
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,050
We put them there.
Now their lives are in danger because of us.

180
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,637
Look, I think you all know I've never been
a fan of this arrangement here.

181
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,975
I thought the whole plan
was to rehabilitate them and set them free.

182
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,686
It was. We've been a little busy.

183
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,149
Well, if they stay in there, they die.
And if we let them go, they destroy the city.

184
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,277
-We're gonna have to move them.
-Move them where?

185
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,071
-Iron Heights can't handle metahumans.
-You're right.

186
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,489
But Lian Yu can.

187
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,451
What the hell's a Lian Yu?

188
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,495
Lian Yu's the island where Oliver
was stranded for five years.

189
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,873
A.R.G.U.S. built a covert military prison on it.

190
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,791
It's where we sent Captain Boomerang.

191
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,212
Oliver keeps his worst criminals there.
They won't be able to escape.

192
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,380
More importantly, they won't hurt anybody.

193
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:36,798
JOE:
Great.

194
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,134
So we ship them
from one illegal black site to another.

195
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,221
Yeah, I guess so. Yes.

196
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:47,308
How do we move them
to Oliver's own private Alcatraz?

197
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,268
I'll call him. Maybe he can help.

198
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,314
And, Cisco, if we do this,
nobody can get loose.

199
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,150
I might have a way
of getting them out safely.

200
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,818
All right, get on it.

201
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,154
Barr, this is insane.

202
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,572
Joe, we have to do this.

203
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,618
You don't think that if we start bussing
supervillains through downtown...

204
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,993
...nobody's gonna notice?

205
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,537
Oh, they'll notice.
That's where you'll come in.

206
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:14,417
Oh.

207
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,378
Cecile.

208
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:19,673
Aw. Mwah. How's my favorite DA?

209
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,426
-Thanks for stopping by.
-Hey, anything for my favorite detective.

210
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:31,101
Hey. So, what can I do for you?
You sounded a little cryptic on the phone.

211
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,604
Yeah, I wanted your opinion on something.

212
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,983
These people with powers?
The metahumans?

213
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,110
Is that what they're calling them?
People love their labels.

214
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:47,032
Yeah. So let's say, hypothetically,
I know a prison, of sorts.

215
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,702
A place that can do what Iron Heights can't...

216
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,579
...where these metahumans, the bad ones...

217
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,207
...are being locked up.

218
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,709
I'd be very concerned.

219
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:01,795
Especially if, hypothetically,
you had anything to do with it.

220
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,673
Why are you asking me about this?

221
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,634
Well, because Singh's on his honeymoon...

222
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:11,346
...and you're the only other person
I can trust to know this.

223
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,517
Okay, what are you asking me to do?

224
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:19,061
I need to clear a route through the city.

225
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:23,189
-Barricades, police cars. The works.
-What am I to tell people? President's in town?

226
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:26,651
-I don't know. You think they'll believe you?
-No, Joe. They wouldn't.

227
00:14:27,527 --> 00:14:31,156
What you're doing, it's called unlawful
imprisonment and human smuggling.

228
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:33,158
Joe, those are very bad things.

229
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:37,037
These are some bad people, Cecile.

230
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,079
But their lives are in danger.

231
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:42,708
I can't. I can't get involved in this, Joe.
I can't.

232
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:50,007
And as your friend, and possibly the attorney
who will one day be prosecuting you...

233
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:53,719
...I am telling you,
get as far away from this as possible.

234
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:08,233
Okay, so A.R.G.U.S. has a transport plane
that can take the metahumans to Lian Yu.

235
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,612
-We need to get them to Ferris Airfield.
-Oliver Queen came through.

236
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:14,907
No, actually. It was not him.
Apparently he's in Nanda Parbat.

237
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:17,368
-What?
-Wherever that is. I don't know.

238
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,370
I called Lyla, Diggle's wife.

239
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:21,747
She's gonna hook us up.

240
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:24,166
So, what about C.C.P.D. giving us an escort?

241
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,378
Man, it ain't happening.
You saw me talking to the DA.

242
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:29,046
She was very clear.

243
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:32,382
I could lose my badge. I could go to jail.
We could go to jail.

244
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,759
We are protecting people.

245
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:39,722
We are, Barry, but I'm a cop.
There's a certain set of rules I need to follow.

246
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,433
And this year, I broke all of them.
Lying to my boss...

247
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,811
-I know.
-...ignoring the law.

248
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,314
At what point do we become no different
than the people we're fighting?

249
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,981
-We are way different.
-How?

250
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,734
We only break the rules to help people.

251
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:03,787

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,387
We need to talk.

You want anything? Beer? Food?

257
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:33,357
Pickled eggs here are fantastic.

258
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:36,235
No, I'm good.
I need your help with a problem.

259
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:40,698
Must be pretty desperate to come
asking for my assistance, but I'll bite.

260
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:42,032
What do you need?

261
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,535
Help transporting
some people out of the city.

262
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:45,786
How many?

263
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:47,829
Five.

264
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:52,208
Five very bad, very angry people...

265
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:53,877
...who have powers.

266
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:56,087
Powers, hmm?

267
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:58,715
So you want me to, what,
freeze the problem?

268
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:01,551
Protect you from them
if anything goes wrong?

They're not just my enemies.
They're yours too.

272
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,021
I doubt it.

273
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:19,318
They will destroy Central City.

274
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:21,320
It's not my problem.

275
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:23,614
You said you love it here. That this is home.

276
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,156
I do, and it is.

277
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:26,741
Well, guess what.

278
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:30,578
These people get loose,
there won't be a city to love anymore.

279
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:34,499
You won't be able to rob anyone
if everybody's dead.

280
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:39,629
It's a compelling argument.

281

If I'm gonna help you out...

282
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:47,512

-Then I can't help you.
-There has to--

You were kidnapped for two weeks,
and your first thought is to go back to work?

I just needed something constant in my life.

He didn't do anything to me, Iris.
It's what he showed me.

What could he have shown you

I asked him for help.

314
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,478
Why would you do something so stupid?

315

Because, Joe,
we have already tried everyone else.
