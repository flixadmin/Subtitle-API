I'D DRINK TO THAT.

475
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,296
JUST AS LONG AS IT'S NO MORE
OF THAT GODAWFUL VODKA.

476
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,553
OK. COOL. SO...
YOU'RE MOVING ON.

477
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,137
SO WHAT'S NEXT
FOR YOU?

478
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,390
LYLA ACCEPTED A PROMOTION
IN METROPOLIS,

479
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,143
SO WE'RE ALL GONNA MOVE
THERE AFTER THE FUNERAL.

480
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,354
SO AM I.

481
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:53,065
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE
THE PROMOTION.

482
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,276
JUST NO POINT BEING POLICE
IN A SAFE CITY,

483
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,655
AND THERE ARE LOTS
OF CITIES THAT STILL
NEED SAVING.

484
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:04,076
DAMN, AND HERE I AM
GETTING TO BE ELECTED
IN A FEW MONTHS,

485
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,912
AND YOU GUYS DECIDE
TO MOVE AWAY.

486
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,748
KIND OF HARD NOT TO
TAKE THAT PERSONALLY.

487
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,710
DON'T WORRY, RENE.
YOU ARE GONNA BE
A GREAT MAYOR

488
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,878
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A GREAT MAN.

489
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,464
I LEARNED
FROM THE BEST.

490
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,049
OLIVER.

491
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,800
AND THE TWO
OF YOU.

492
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,562
WHO'S GETTING
THE LIGHTS?

493
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:32,812
I WILL.

494
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,087
I'M GONNA MISS
THIS PLACE.

495
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,591
WE ALL WILL.

496
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,400
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

497
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,237
FOR A LONG TIME...

498
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,950
I HATED OLIVER QUEEN.

499
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:33,582
I BLAMED HIM FOR THE DEATH
OF MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER,

500
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:38,337
I BLAMED HIM FOR THE VIOLENCE
IN MY CITY,

501
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,466
I INTERROGATED HIM,
I HUNTED HIM,

502
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,301
PERSECUTED HIM.

503
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,432
I'VE NEVER BEEN
MORE WRONG IN MY LIFE.

504
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:53,101
OLIVER QUEEN WASN'T JUST A HERO.

505
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,565
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

506
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,276
HE WAS AN HONORABLE PERSON.

507
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,153
THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T
START OUT THAT WAY

508
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,365
MAKES HIM, IN MY BOOK,

509
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,242
EVEN MORE HONORABLE.

510
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,121
HE STANDS AS A REMINDER
TO ALL OF US

511
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,207
THAT ANYONE CAN CHANGE.

512
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,713
SO WILL THIS.

513
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,843
[CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING]

515
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,006
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

516
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,675
IF OLLIE COULD
FIX EVERYTHING,

517
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:10,763
THEN WHY COULDN'T
HE FIX THIS?

518
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,474
I THINK THAT OLIVER
COULD ONLY CHANGE
THE THINGS

519
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,102
THAT DIDN'T CHANGE HIM,

520
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,814
AND IF NOT
FOR YOUR FATHER AND...

521
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,443
WHAT HE DID FOR OLIVER,

522
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:28,029
YOUR BROTHER WOULD NEVER
HAVE BECOME THE MAN
THAT HE WAS.

523
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,534
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
OLLIE'S REALLY GONE.

524
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,453
I KNOW, SWEETHEART.

525
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:41,000
AHEM. I'M SORRY
TO INTRUDE,

526
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,045
BUT I WANTED TO MEET YOU.

527
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,172
-I'M...
-MY SISTER.

528
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,216
OLIVER TOLD ME A LOT
ABOUT YOU.

529
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,093
I'M SORRY THAT IT TOOK
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

530
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,720
FOR US TO
FINALLY MEET.

531
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:56,182
YES. EMIKO, YOU ARE
WELCOME HERE ANYTIME.

532
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,684
THANK YOU.

533
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:04,858
SO YOU'RE FROM
ANOTHER EARTH,
IS THAT IT?

534
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,360
I KNOW IT'S A LOT
TO TAKE IN.

535
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,613
WELL, I JUST FOUND OUT
THERE'S A REALITY
WHERE I WAS DEAD,

536
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,574
SO THAT'S THE CURVE I'M
GRADING ON THESE DAYS.

537
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:19,998
THE LAUREL OF, WELL,
THIS EARTH, UM...

538
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,083
SHE WAS MY WIFE.

539
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,088
SO IT MUST BE
STRANGE SEEING ME.

540
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,801
HO! YEAH. WELL, STRANGE
ENOUGH TO BLOW THE CURVE...

541
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,805
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
NICE ABOUT IT, TOO.

542
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,940
MY CONDOLENCES
ON YOUR HUSBAND'S PASSING.

543
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:47,693
I HAD OUR MARRIAGE
ERASED.

544
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,653
FEELINGS CANNOT
BE ERASED.

545
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,738
I HAD NO FEELINGS
FOR HIM.

546
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,407
OUR MARRIAGE WAS
FATHER'S PERVERSE JOKE,

547
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,827
MEANT TO TORMENT ME.

548
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:01,122
OUR FATHER ONLY EVER
MEANT FOR YOU TO HAVE
A NORMAL LIFE.

549
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,124
I HAVE LIVED A LIFE
FAR MORE NORMAL

550
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,419
THAN THE ONE FATHER
DESIGNED FOR ME.

551
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,965
HEY. THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

ELSE I'D BE.

MY SISTER TALIA.

554
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,223
-HI.
-HELLO.

555

HI.

559
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,743
OH. HI.

-I'M...
-I KNOW.

WERE TEETHING,

AND NOW YOU'RE...
I MEAN, WOW.

563
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:52,173

REACTION WHEN HE FIRST SAW ME.

564

YOU MET YOUR FATHER.

565
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,639
YEAH. HE TRAINED ME.

566
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,225
HE TAUGHT ME
TO BE A HERO,

567
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,477
HOW TO BE LIKE HIM.

568
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,731
I CAN TELL YOU'RE
A LOT LIKE HIM.

569
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,441

-THANK YOU.
-HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

573
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,337
I WAS THERE
AT THE END, AND...

574
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,006
EVERY DAY, I'M TORTURED
WITH THE THOUGHT

575
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,758
THAT I COULD HAVE
DONE MORE,

576
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,509
SHOULD HAVE
DONE MORE.

577
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:40,973
NO. YOU DID EVERYTHING
THAT YOU COULD, BARRY.

578
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,975
HOW COULD YOU
KNOW THAT?

579
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,893
WELL, BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOU.

580
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,022
I'M SORRY.

581
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,027
HEY. HEY.

582
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,076

583
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:03,161
I'M SO SORRY.

584
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,955
THERE IS NO BODY
DOWN THERE, NO?

585
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,539
NO.

586
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,250
WE BURIED A CASKET
FULL OF MEMENTOS.

587
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,962
DOES ANYBODY WANT
TO SAY A FEW WORDS?

588
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:14,089
I'M BARELY KEEPING IT
TOGETHER AS IT IS.

589
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,882
I THINK THAT OLIVER WOULD
HAVE BEEN WORRIED

590
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:19,678
THAT I'D SAY SOMETHING
TACTLESS ANYWAY, SO...

591
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,889
-I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
-YEAH.

592
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:27,310
WORDS SEEM...
MEANINGLESS.

593
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,606
HEY.

594
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,232
SHOULD BE YOU.

595
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,914
THE OLIVER THAT I MET
8 YEARS AGO

596
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:52,127
IS NOT THE ONE THAT WE SAY
GOOD-BYE TO TODAY.

597
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:56,173
OLIVER ALWAYS TOLD ME
THAT IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS CITY,

598
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,257
HE HAD TO BECOME SOMEONE ELSE,

599
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,302
HE HAD TO BECOME
SOMETHING ELSE.

600
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,596
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT MEANT
BECOMING THE GREEN ARROW,

601
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:08,935
BUT...TODAY, I REALIZED
THAT MEANT BECOMING

602
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,521
A BETTER MAN,

603
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,192
THE BEST MAN HE KNEW
HOW TO BE,

604
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:20,446
AND HE TOOK ALL OF US
WITH HIM ON THAT JOURNEY.

605
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,324
HE CHANGED EVERYTHING.

606
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,868
OLIVER BROUGHT HEROES
INTO THE WORLD,

607
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,369
HE INSPIRED HEROES,

608
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,039
HE INSPIRED ALL OF US HERE.

609
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,544
I WAS HIS BROTHER,

610
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:39,049
AND OLIVER QUEEN
WAS MINE.

611
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,888
JOHN: OF COURSE,
LIFE WILL GO ON.

612
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,520
IT ALWAYS DOES,

613
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:56,566
BUT HOW, WHAT TWISTS
AND TURNS IT WILL TAKE,

614
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,193
I CAN'T SAY.

615
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,781
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS...

616
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,376
EXCEPT TO SAY TO EXPECT
THE UNEXPECTED.

617
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:30,433
OLIVER MAY BE GONE,

618
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,727
BUT HIS MISSION ENDURES.

619
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,398
THAT MISSION LIVES ON,

620
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,025
OLIVER LIVES ON

621
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,986
IN THE PEOPLE HE INSPIRED.

00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,738
[REVVING ENGINE]

623
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,741
SOME WILL TAKE THAT MISSION
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD...

624
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,165
MAYBE EVEN BEYOND THAT...

625
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,426
BECAUSE IF THE PAST 8 YEARS
HAS SHOWN US ANYTHING...

626
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,348
IT'S THAT THIS UNIVERSE IS

627
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:16,604
FAR BIGGER THAN ANY OF US
COULD HAVE DARED IMAGINE...

628
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:26,364

TAKING YOU,

THERE IS NO RETURN.

I HAVE WAITED
A VERY LONG TIME
TO SEE HIM.

00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,724
I'M READY.

GLAD YOU COULD
FINALLY MAKE IT.

THIS IS SO NICE.

641
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,997
NOT TO COMPLAIN.
I JUST THOUGHT

642
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,623
THAT THE AFTERLIFE WOULD
LOOK A LITTLE LESS

643
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,251
LIKE YOUR OLD OFFICE.

644

IT'S MY MOM'S OFFICE.

I WANTED TO BE
WHERE I FIRST SAW YOU.

IT'S TOO BAD YOU'RE,
YOU KNOW, DEAD,

650
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:07,566
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY
A LOT WORSE FOR YOU
THAN IT IS FOR ME.
