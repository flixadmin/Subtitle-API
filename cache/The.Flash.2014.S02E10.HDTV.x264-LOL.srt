1
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:03,929
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,666
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:09,735
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:12,805
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:16,375
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,377 --> 00:00:18,277
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,647
but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:25,017
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,953
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:29,488
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,891
When my mother left us, she was pregnant.

12
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:35,227
Dad, I'm so sorry that
I didn't tell you sooner.

13
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:37,963
Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

14
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,999
You want Barry to get faster?

15
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:44,603
The more power he has, the more I can take.

16
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,573
- Don't let him take me back there.
- I won't.

17
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:49,208
You're going to help me

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,545
in return for your daughter's life.

19
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:55,448
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.

20
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,785
I know I'm moving pretty fast,

21
00:00:59,787 --> 00:01:01,721
but stop me if you've
heard this one before.

22
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:03,989
Boy meets girl. Happens every day.

23
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:05,558
Except this boy was struck by lightning

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,660
and became the fastest man alive.

25
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:11,364
So nothing is ever that simple.

26
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:12,565
- Ho!
- Oh, my...

27
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,700
Oh... ah... Careful!

28
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:16,202
- Oh, boy.
- Sorry!

29
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:17,503
It's all good.

30
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:19,438
It's all good.

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,607
Those weren't for me anyway, right?

32
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:24,543
They were. I didn't realize
roses were so flammable.

33
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:26,245
Oh, my gosh.

34
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:28,280
Well, it's the... it's
the thought that counts.

35
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:30,983
And, you know, and proper
fire safety management,

36
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:32,651
- that... that counts most.
- Yes.

37
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:36,255
I have spent most of my life

38
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:38,057
feeling very unlucky.

39
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:40,025
Yeah, and now?

40
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:42,294
Feels like I've been
struck by lightning twice.

41
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:48,501
Aah!

42
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,808
Help!

43
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:59,078
Help me...

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,284
Flash, everything you have will be mine.

45
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:06,952
- No!
- No!

46
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:09,522
- No!
- Aah!

47
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,122

48
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:23,202
Okay, so there's my desk.

49
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:25,771
Upstairs is anti-crime and the CSI lab...

50
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:27,006
that's where Barry works.

51
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:29,742
And we have the open files...

52
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:31,210
And that is a pencil.

53
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:33,179
That: stapler.

54
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:35,214
Okay. Sorry, Wally.

55
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:37,116
Obviously, your sister got the funny genes.

56
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:39,718
Captain. I want you to meet somebody.

57
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,287
This is my son Wally West.

58
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:42,822
Handsome young man, Joe.

59
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,523
Hey, he's a West. He can't help that.

60
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:46,425
Your pops here is a hell of a detective.

61
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:49,261
Obviously not.

62
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:52,298
Well, pleasure to meet you, Wally.

63
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:57,136
Anyway, I'm glad you're here, Wally.

64
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:59,972
Yeah, I've always wanted a baby brother.

65
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,774
What about the White Shadow?

66
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:05,144
You're joking, but yeah,
we did call Barry that.

67
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:06,912
Well, he's been pretty busy.

68
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:08,681
He's doing a whole lot of running around.

69
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:11,584
But why don't we do
dinner? The whole family.

70
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:13,419
I, uh, I got plans.

71
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,753
Oh, Iris'll cook.

72
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:16,055
Dad, we just met the kid.

73
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:17,256
We don't want to kill him.

74
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:18,724
All right, we do takeout. Chinese.

75
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:19,992
Whatever. Come on.

76
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:22,094
Where are your cuffs, taillights?

77
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:24,630
Come on, let's go.

78
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:26,065
You know that kid?

79
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,900
Uh, no... no.

80
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,935
You know, it's just what they say.

81
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:33,072
I got one of those faces.

82
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:35,307
I'll see you guys at dinner.

83
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:36,609
Uh, okay.

84
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,514
Any chance I could chat
with you for a minute?

85
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:43,082
Yeah, what's up, Detective?

86
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:46,352
Oh, uh, I... I meant Iris.

87
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:48,888
Yeah, you're not needed.

88
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,590
I am needed... somewhere.

89
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:52,958
I'ma... go there.

90
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:57,096
What can I do for you?

91
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:01,133
Uh, I just wanted to talk with you, um,

92
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:04,970
about Barry.

93
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:07,373
I know that Barry's...

94
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,174
you know, practically your brother.

95
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:10,943
So I understand that your loyalty

96
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:13,012
is obviously to him, not me.

97
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:16,148
But I was just hoping that
maybe you think I'm good for him,

98
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,117
so you'd want to help me figure him out.

99
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,886
Well, I mean, if you did that, you...

100
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:22,454
you would be the first.

101
00:04:22,456 --> 00:04:23,956
Wonderful. That gives me tons of hope.

102
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:28,494
It's just, um...

103
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:32,064
he's being not distant, but...

104
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,198
Guarded.

105
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah. He's being guarded.

106
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:37,269
And he's waking up from these bad dreams

107
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,871
and not telling me about them.

108
00:04:38,873 --> 00:04:42,141
And I know that we got close really quick.

109
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:46,645
It's just... it's like there's
something holding him back.

110
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,981
Here's the thing about Barry.

111
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:51,750
He has a bad habit of

112
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:54,453
carrying the weight of
the world on his shoulders,

113
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:57,056
burdens that aren't even his to bear.

114
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:58,757
But he doesn't have to do that with me.

115
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,759
Which is exactly what you should tell him.

116
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:19,478
Hey... no! Absolutely not!

117
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,180
You don't get to throw
somebody else's stuff

118
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:22,982
when you're pissed off.

119
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:27,019
Thank you.

120
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,060
What is this?

121
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:38,030
Wrong answers.

122
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:39,732
Maybe you're asking the wrong questions.

123
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:41,433
What does that mean?

124
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:43,636
I've been thinking about
this a lot recently.

125
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:46,271
We keep trying to come up
with ways to make Barry faster,

126
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:49,408
but I still think we can figure
out a way to make Zoom slower.

127
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,876
We tried that already, remember?

128
00:05:50,878 --> 00:05:52,544
Those darts didn't slow him down at all.

129
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:54,279
Yeah, I know... I'm not
talking about the darts, okay?

130
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,582
The darts clearly didn't
work. They just pissed him off.

131
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,550
I'm talking about something else...

132
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,419
a way we can steal Zoom's speed.

133
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,326
How?

134
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:09,094
The Turtle.

135
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:11,530
As some of you may well know,

136
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:14,767
I've been deeply embroiled
in a secret, one-sided battle

137
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:15,934
with an invisible enemy.

138
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:17,369
No, not the Turtle again.

139
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:19,304
What? What is the...

140
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,407
- Or who is the Turtle?
- It's Cisco's white whale.

141
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:22,574
Half whale, half turtle.

142
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:23,909
No.

143
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:25,077
Do you see what you're doing, Caitlin?

144
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,078
Everybody's confused now.

145
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,379
Get to it.

146
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,947
I stumbled upon a few of these cases

147
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,683
when we were looking for the Reverse Flash,

148
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:32,985
robberies that were seemingly
committed at high speed...

149
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:35,354
people holding their
beloved items one second.

150
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:37,222
Those items were gone the next.

151
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:38,424
Tell me what you see.

152
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:46,165
So he can... what? Stop time?

153
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,000
No, no, no. Look at the time code.

154
00:06:48,002 --> 00:06:51,236
It's still running.

155
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:53,105
Yeah, okay. So if he's not stopping time,

156
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:54,573
what is he doing?

157
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:57,543
He's slowing down everything around him.

158
00:06:57,545 --> 00:07:00,779
And that is why we call him the Turtle.

159
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:03,015
Why have you never mentioned
this guy to me before?

160
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,583
Oh, I don't know, I think we've just been

161
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:06,518
a little distracted, you
know, what with Captain Cold

162
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,986
and the Weather Wizard and Gorilla Grodd.

163
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:09,188
Do I need to go on?

164
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,489
Okay, so if we can catch him,

165
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,257
figure out how he uses his powers...

166
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,094
Maybe we can show Zoom what
life is like in the slow lane.

167
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:16,729
How would you even know where to find him?

168
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,197
Well, the robberies in the videos

169
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,765
all correspond with police reports

170
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:21,934
that were dismissed as
lost or missing items

171
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:23,102
instead of thefts.

172
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:24,269
The suspect's M.O. being...

173
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:26,472
Items of immense personal value.

174
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,413
Uh...

175
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:38,250
oh, it appears that there's
a press conference at CCPD,

176
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:41,019
because the Vandervoort diamonds
have just been recovered.

177
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:46,458
"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee."

178
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,827
The perpetrators who
committed this heartless crime

179
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,230
have been apprehended and
are now in our custody.

180
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:53,699
And we're happy to report that
the famed Vandervoort diamonds

181
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,601
have been returned to their rightful owner.

182
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:59,071
The real gem is the return of
my great-grandfather's ring.

183
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:00,706
Getting that returned to the family

184
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,508
is what's most priceless to me.

185
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,243
Gotcha.

186
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:32,471
The ring is gone. What happened to it?

187
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:34,873
Lock this place down.
No one leaves this room.

188
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,141
Sweep the precinct!

189
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:43,771
Well, the good new is
whatever the Turtle did,

190
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:46,197
it only affected you temporarily.

191
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:47,398
Yo.

192
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,233
What was it like being in Turtle Time?

193
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:50,368
Yeah, no, it was weird.

194
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,403
It was like waves of inertness...

195
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:54,138
like all the energy was
suddenly sucked out of my body,

196
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,940
and then it would return.

197
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,675
That's because that's
exactly what was happening.

198
00:08:57,677 --> 00:08:59,176
He has the ability to transfer

199
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:01,112
all the surrounding
kinetic energy into himself.

200
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:02,680
Leaving everyone else in a temporary state

201
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:03,682
of potential energy.

202
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:05,483
That's right.

203
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:06,817
So why could I still move?

204
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,219
Your speed.

205
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,720
Your speed allows you to change positions

206
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:11,222
faster than anyone else.

207
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:13,190
So you can convert your
stored potential energy

208
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:14,358
back to kinetic energy.

209
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,660
Excuse me, where are you going?

210
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:16,894
Trying to figure out

211
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:18,863
how to use this against Zoom.

212
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:21,499
You remember Zoom?

213
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,267
"Cisco, please join me.

214
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,003
"We'll use your idea and take
it to new scientific heights

215
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,138
and save the world."

216
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,973
Yes, I'd love to!

217
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,908
Okay.

218
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,144
Facial recognition
software found us a match

219
00:09:33,146 --> 00:09:35,046
from the press conference footage.

220
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:38,115
The Turtle's name is Russell Glosson.

221
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:40,885
He was a small-time
thief who stopped thieving

222
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:42,787
after the particle accelerator explosion.

223
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,288
All right, I'm gonna head to work...

224
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,623
catch Joe up.

225
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,525
Let me know if you find anything else.

226
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:53,831
You okay?

227
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,399
Yeah, yeah, it's just, um...

228
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,703
It's hard to... look at that

229
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:01,205
and not think about how I
can't help people anymore.

230
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:04,675
Well, we have lots of technology here.

231
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:07,878
Why don't we figure out
how to get your speed back?

232
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,081
I'm a scientist too, Caitlin.

233
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,482
When I first got here,

234
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:14,318
all I did was work on
how to get my speed back.

235
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,356
Believe me, whatever test you could run...

236
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:19,657
I've already done it.

237
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:28,065
The Turtle.

238
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,801
Cisco's been looking for this guy forever.

239
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:32,536
Singh just put an APB out on him.

240
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:35,239
Um, how did everybody know
about Glosson before I did?

241
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:36,707
Mm-mm.

242
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,010
Cisco's got a whole list
of unidentified metas.

243
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:40,444
The boys around here are calling him

244
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:41,779
Cisco de la Mancha.

245
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:46,951
Are you good? You seem a little jittery.

246
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:48,919
A little anxious.

247
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:50,554
Let's be honest.

248
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,757
I'm really nervous about
this whole dinner tonight

249
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,025
with Wally.

250
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,626
Come on, why... why are you nervous?

251
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:57,495
You're, like, the best dad ever.

252
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:59,230
He'll see that.

253
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:01,499
It'll be a whole lot
easier, you being there.

254
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:03,401
Joe, I wouldn't miss it.

255
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:07,004
- See you tonight.
- All right.

256
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,108
Hey, you.

257
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,610
- Hey.
- You got a sec?

258
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:14,078
Yeah.

259
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,579
I just, um...

260
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:18,249
I just want to make sure everything's okay.

261
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:19,417
Yeah.

262
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,951
Yeah, I'm... I'm... I, uh...

263
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,219
don't want to nag.

264
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,421
That's not, you know, who I am.

265
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:25,489
I just, uh...

266
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:28,826
I don't... I don't want you
to feel burdened by anything.

267
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:30,127
No, I don't.

268
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,329
Okay.

269
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:35,700
Hey, wait. Patty, uh...

270
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:37,601
The New Years was always
a hard time for me.

271
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:40,438
Um... that's when my mom died,
so it's just those memories

272
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,006
all come out, and they're hard to put away.

273
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:43,407
So if it feels like I
haven't been communicating...

274
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,675
I'm sorry, Barry. I'm sorry.

275
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:45,710
I... I didn't know.

276
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:48,112
No, no, no, no, no.

277
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:53,784
Look, um, we haven't had a
romantic night in a while.

278
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:57,054
What do you say tomorrow night
we get some dinner and drinks

279
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:59,523
and maybe a little... kissing?

280
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,158
That sounds like what we need.

281
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,127
Okay. All right, I'll see you later.

282
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,962
Okay.

283
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:12,403
Okay, I think we can call it.

284
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:14,672
Wally is not coming.

285
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm sorry, Joe.

286
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:17,508
I know how much this meant to you.

287
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:22,880
He's a kid, right? I get it.

288
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:24,315
He could have at least called.

289
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:25,883
Well, there could be a number of reasons

290
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:28,052
why he didn't.

291
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:30,387
Thank you for being here.

292
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,223
I love you.

293
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:34,191
- Love you.
- Mmm.

294
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:37,228
See you in the morning, Bar.

295
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,629
Yeah.

296
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:48,139
Well, West family 2.0 is not
really off to a great start.

297
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,708
You've been quiet all evening.

298
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:54,211
The Turtle?

299
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:55,546
How do you know about him?

300
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:59,750
No, um...

301
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:02,620
no, I've just had a lot on my mind.

302
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:04,822
Patty?

303
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:08,392
We... we may have met for coffee.

304
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:09,627
Iris...

305
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,462
She really cares about you, Barry,

306
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:14,698
and she's just wondering
why you've been so guarded.

307
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,133
And what did you tell her?

308
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:18,769
I told her to talk to you.

309
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,938
Oh, that's not cool.

310
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,041
You know, she did mention that...

311
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:27,278
you've been having nightmares.

312
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,781
About Zoom...

313
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:33,617
killing her.

314
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:34,919
Look.

315
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,854
I know that things have

316
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:39,256
been moving pretty fast

317
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:41,559
between you two.

318
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:45,029
But you realize you can't keep
things from her forever, right?

319
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:48,098
One day, you're gonna
have to tell her the truth.

320
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,434
That I'm the Flash?

321
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,536
I can't do that.

322
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:56,440
Barry, I wish a year ago
you had told me the truth.

323
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:58,475
So, what, you think that
I should just tell her?

324
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:01,645
I think that if you are serious

325
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,981
about being with her,

326
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:06,050
you have to.

327
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,325
All right, then that's what I'm gonna do.

328
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:16,927
I'll tell Patty I'm the Flash.

329
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:27,713
Hey.

330
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:28,948
You guys got anything?

331
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,783
I think we found the next target

332
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:33,986
for our 30-something,
meta-human, not-a-Ninja-Turtle.

333
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:36,021
How long did it take you
to come up with that one?

334
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:37,890
It just came out of my
mouth... did you see that?

335
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:39,158
- That was amazing.
- That was nice.

336
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,559
Central City Museum

337
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:41,927
is hosting a special
black tie event tonight

338
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:44,196
showcasing "The Crystal Ball."

339
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:46,065
It's a famous painting, apparently,

340
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,900
recently recovered from Markovia.

341
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,502
The painting is on loan to the museum

342
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:50,803
from the Silverberg family.

343
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,505
Jacob Silverberg himself said,

344
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:55,241
"The painting's safe
return means more to us

345
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:57,042
than all the money in the world.

346
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:58,944
It's like they're begging Turtle to rob it.

347
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:01,180
Okay, yes. This is a plan.

348
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:04,216
So the Turtle will make his move,

349
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:07,453
and we can be there
waiting to take him down.

350
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,321
How do you look in a tux?

351
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,257
Come on, he's 6'2", he's
square-jawed, and he's jacked.

352
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,392
I think he looks fine.

353
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:14,527
I'm 6'4".

354
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:15,861
Oh, crap!

355
00:15:15,863 --> 00:15:17,630
Problem?

356
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:20,166
No.

357
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,667
No.

358
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,036
An opportunity, maybe. Hold on.

359
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:28,874
Hey, you.

360
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:31,043
- I'm excited to see you tonight. 
- Yeah, me too.

361
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,946
Actually, about that...
um, so I know I said

362
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:35,881
"let's have dinner," but, uh,

363
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:37,416
you've been wanting me to share more.

364
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:39,785
So I thought that I would share that

365
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:42,555
I love art.

366
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,557
- Okay, interesting.
- Yeah.

367
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,625
No, I just, you know, I
can't get enough of art.

368
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:48,494
Anyway, there's this event

369
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,596
at the Central City Museum tonight.

370
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,431
They're showing this really famous painting

371
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:53,933
that I've always loved.

372
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:57,536
Actually, I don't know anything about art,

373
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:58,671
but what's the saying?

374
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,306
I know what I like,

375
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:01,707
and I like you,

376
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,142
so count me in.

377
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:05,444
All right, great. I'll see you at 8:00.

378
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:06,979
7:00!
- Or 7:00.

379
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:09,748
- I'll see you at 7:00.
- Okay, 7:00 it is.

380
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,317
Bye.

381
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,185
You know, you're a
really great superhero...

382
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:14,653
- Thanks.
- A really great superhero...

383
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:16,522
- Thank you.
- But do you think

384
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:18,290
it's a good idea when you're fighting crime

385
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,825
to bring a date?

386
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:23,229
I'm gonna tell Patty that I'm the Flash.

387
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:27,066
Is that a bad idea? What do we think?

388
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:30,970
I will say, she put bullets
in King Shark and Harry.

389
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,338
- Yeah.
- So as far as I'm concerned,

390
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,606
that's Team Flash material to me.

391
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,641
All right, yes. Thank you, Cisco.

392
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,676
Yeah, thank you. Cool.

393
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,278
I'm gonna do this...

394
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,046
I'm gonna tell her.

395
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:46,285
Don't tell her.

396
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:47,720
Huh?

397
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:54,126
You care for this woman.

398
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:55,594
That's nice.

399
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:58,597
Then keep her as far away
from this as possible.

400
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,099
And here's why.

401
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:03,802
If Zoom finds out who you care for,

402
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,771
who you love,

403
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,240
who you live for,

404
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,909
he'll take them from you.

405
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:32,564
All right.

406
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:34,800
Keep your eyes open for the Turtle.

407
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:36,735
A sentence I never thought I would say.

408
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:52,751
Cisco, are you and Harry in position?

409
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:54,386
I'm the security feed.

410
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:56,155
I've got the facial
recognition software running,

411
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,424
so we'll be able to spot
Turtle before he makes his move.

412
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:00,359
Turtle.

413
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,194
Why do you insist on giving them

414
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:03,662
ridiculous nicknames?

415
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:05,197
Me?

416
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:08,300
Who's the genius that
came up with "Zoom"?

417
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:13,205
Yeah, well...

418
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:20,179
I'll tell you, about two years ago...

419
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:22,848
this is on Earth-2, now.

420
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,384
The CCPD there...

421
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:28,053
they got a 911 call

422
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:30,189
about a hostage situation,

423
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,858
but when the SWAT team got there,

424
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,994
there were no hostages.

425
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:37,162
It was a trap.

426
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:38,931
Zoom set a trap

427
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:43,635
in order to show the police
that they could not stop him.

428
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:47,606
And he killed 14 officers.

429
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,943
Men and women. Slaughtered them.

430
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:55,080
Left one alive to tell what happened.

431
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:58,250
That officer described

432
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:00,452
blue lightning

433
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:02,654
"zooming" all about

434
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:06,859
as his comrades, brothers
and sisters in arms,

435
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:09,194
were murdered.

436
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:12,097
That officer...

437
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,767
considered himself to be a lucky one,

438
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,369
spared in order to tell the tale.

439
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:23,509
Until Zoom went to his house
that night and killed him too.

440
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:28,113
Anyway, that's how he got
the nickname "Zoom""

441
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:39,124
If you ever need me to Vibe...

442
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:40,626
so you can know if she's still alive...

443
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:44,263
She's alive.

444
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,365
Right.

445
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,075
- No!
- No!

446
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,246
You have a really weird look on your face.

447
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:03,782
- Do I look weird?
- No, no.

448
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:07,453
You... look... like a dream.

449
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:09,822
You look very handsome.

450
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:13,759
I can't wait to see this painting.

451
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:15,094
What painting?

452
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,595
The painting. Uh, yeah.

453
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:19,364
Me too, um, yeah.

454
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:22,868
How about we talk first?

455
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,503
I thought you'd never ask.

456
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,944
I can't figure you out, Barry Allen.

457
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,513
That is because I work hard

458
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,682
to hide who I really am.

459
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:39,852
You don't have to hide with me.

460
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:41,653
I just have to

461
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:44,623
really trust someone

462
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:48,160
if they're gonna know the truth.

463
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:49,461
Do you?

464
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:53,565
I trust you, Patty.

465
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:58,704
I trust you, too.

466
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,973
Patty, um...

467
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:06,311
After I was struck by lightning,

468
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:09,915
when I woke up...

469
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,553
We've got eyes on Turtle.

470
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,425
Barry, you were saying?

471
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,094
I have to go. I'm sorry.

472
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:23,762
What? What?

473
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:25,197
But Barry...

474
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,601
CCPD! Freeze!

475
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:36,208
What?

476
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:43,849
Are you as fast as the Flash?

477
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:46,518
Oh, no. He is much slower.

478
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:49,721
This is a trap?

479
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:51,223
I'm slow...

480
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:52,925
not stupid.

481
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:26,491
Oh, my God!

482
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,596
I got it. Come on.

483
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,935
Your pupils are normal.

484
00:22:49,937 --> 00:22:51,503
Your heart rate's a little low.

485
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,772
But other than that,
no concussive symptoms.

486
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:55,941
I really do feel fine. What about Turtle?

487
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:58,410
- No sign of him.
- Or the painting.

488
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:01,113
He, uh, must have gotten
away with it in the chaos.

489
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:02,214
Yeah, things went a little sideways

490
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,782
after your girlfriend decided

491
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:06,018
to go all "Lethal Weapon"
1 through 4 on Turtle.

492
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,352
Oh, my God.

493
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:08,987
Patty's gonna think I ditched her.

494
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:10,822
I... no, I got to go.

495
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,324
Where are you...

496
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,359
finding Turtle is what's
important right now.

497
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:16,862
Yeah, uh, this is important to me too.

498
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:19,498
But we need to see if
your speed still works.

499
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,199
I think... I think it still works.

500
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:24,403
We still have to find out
how Turtle drained him of it.

501
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:29,107
Can I talk to you...

502
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:30,509
for a second?

503
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:42,087
You never got your champagne.

504
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,122
I couldn't find any flutes.

505
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:45,924
Hope that's okay.

506
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,225
Of course.

507
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:48,593
Here you go.

508
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,202
Mmm.

509
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:03,642
Let me go see if I can make myself useful.

510
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,045
Mmm.

511
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,849
I was right.

512
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:47,285
I thought that you would
look mad, and you do.

513
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:50,288
What happened?

514
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,656
Um...

515
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,194
I don't really have a good excuse.

516
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:57,462
Nothing?

517
00:24:57,464 --> 00:24:59,197
Nothing? I mean, come on, Barry.

518
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:02,067
Anything is better than nothing.

519
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,702
I mean, come on.

520
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:06,371
Holy crap, I've been a
really, really cool girlfriend.

521
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:08,373
Most girls don't have the self-esteem

522
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,475
to handle the... .plans?

523
00:25:10,477 --> 00:25:12,411
Oh, no plans. That's cool.

524
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:13,945
Or the... or the...

525
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,748
waking up in the middle of
the night screaming again.

526
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,483
Fine, whatever.

527
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:21,119
And then... and then the
really, really fancy plans...

528
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:22,554
which were awesome.

529
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:25,957
And then you ditched me
right before I almost died.

530
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,727
I mean, when you put it that way, it...

531
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:31,630
I'm actually really upset.

532
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,265
Yeah, I know.

533
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,233
Look, we've been having fun.

534
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:37,502
And fun has been so great.

535
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:40,338
But... I'm moving past fun

536
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,407
to the close part.

537
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:44,443
That's what I want, okay?

538
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:46,178
That's where I'm going.

539
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,914
You need to figure out
what it is that you want.

540
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,683
And do it fast.

541
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,623
Fast is my specialty.

542
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:05,390
Yo, pay up.

543
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:24,809
What?

544
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,845
You got someone tailing me now?

545
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:29,848
Why didn't you show up
for dinner last night?

546
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,483
Couldn't make it.

547
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,219
You tell someone you're gonna be somewhere,

548
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:36,488
you show up.

549
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,525
Guess I didn't have my
dad to teach me that, huh?

550
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:43,295
Is this why you came to Central City?

551
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:45,363
Not to get to know me or your sister,

552
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:47,499
but this nonsense?

553
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:50,068
No one in Keystone will race me anymore.

554
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,004
But I don't actually have
to explain myself to you.

555
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,073
Actually, you do.

556
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:57,442
This is illegal. I'm a cop, remember?

557
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,010
Oh, yeah. Yes.

558
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,279
The detective who didn't know he had a son

559
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:03,481
and who doesn't know anything about me.

560
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:06,785
I am trying to get to know you, Wally.

561
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:08,353
These races... that car...

562
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:11,590
that I won?

563
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:14,159
That's the only way that I can
pay for my mom's hospital bills,

564
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:15,994
get her the help that she needs.

565
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:17,862
You don't have to do this.

566
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,998
I have money saved. I
can dip into my pension.

567
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,433
I don't need your money.

568
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:25,270
I can take care of myself and my mom, okay?

569
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:28,306
I'm the man of our house.
That position has been filled.

570
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:34,679
Go home to your family, Joe.

571
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,693
Barry?

572
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:49,894
Hey...

573
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:54,399
Uhh!

574
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:09,849
What?

575
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:14,452
What do you want from me?

576
00:29:14,454 --> 00:29:17,322
The thing most precious to the Flash...

577
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:18,957
you.

578
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:28,950
Patty?

579
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:42,630
No, no, no, no, no.

580
00:29:42,632 --> 00:29:44,666
No.

581
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:47,568
Come on.

582
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,538
No... Joe!

583
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,274
Joe, um, I think the Turtle has Patty.

584
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:57,145
I... Look, just meet me at
S.T.A.R. Labs, all right?

585
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,937
What do you want from me?

586
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:24,839
I want you to stop moving...

587
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,109
Forever.

588
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:29,610
What do you get out of killing me?

589
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:31,512
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.

590
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:35,149
That's much too... fast and messy.

591
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:38,386
I like to take things nice and slow.

592
00:30:38,388 --> 00:30:40,555
You don't have to hurt me
to try to prove a point.

593
00:30:40,557 --> 00:30:43,358
This isn't about hurting you.

594
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,894
This is about hurting
someone who values you.

595
00:30:46,896 --> 00:30:49,530
Who, Barry?

596
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:51,532
No.

597
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:52,934
The Flash.

598
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,869
What does he have to do with this?

599
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:00,875
I saw the way he saved you.

600
00:31:00,877 --> 00:31:02,910
Yes, that's what he does.

601
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,978
He's a hero.

602
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,047
He saves people who need saving.

603
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:08,483
That's a waste of time...

604
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:09,650
saving people.

605
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:15,623
They take everything for granted.

606
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:19,160
So you take the things
that matter most to them.

607
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:23,031
My wife Rosalyn took me for granted.

608
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:25,166
She wanted to leave me...

609
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:26,601
the thing I valued most.

610
00:31:26,603 --> 00:31:28,603
So that's what this is about?

611
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:31,139
You're hurt because your wife left you?

612
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:35,076
I couldn't let that happen.

613
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:39,280
So I made her mine.

614
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:42,984
Forever.

615
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,313
I do hope I spelled your name right.

616
00:32:15,118 --> 00:32:16,717
Bar... we'll find her.

617
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:18,386
I'm not getting any leads on this guy.

618
00:32:18,388 --> 00:32:20,088
It's like he's totally fallen off the grid.

619
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,223
You know, it... any of
the stuff he's stolen,

620
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:24,725
- I can't find it.
- He keeps them.

621
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:27,495
He keeps them the way a serial
killer collects trophies.

622
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:29,063
He's stolen a lot of stuff.

623
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:31,666
Which means he needs a lot
of space to store it, right?

624
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:32,800
That's where we start.

625
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:35,203
See if he rented any storage spaces.

626
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:37,338
No, no...

627
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,373
I'm not getting anything.

628
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,942
Wait a minute.

629
00:32:40,944 --> 00:32:44,345
His ex-wife used to be an
archivist for antiquities

630
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:47,048
at the Naydel Library before it shut down,

631
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,617
and it shut down three months
after the accelerator exploded.

632
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,619
That place is big enough
to hold Turtle's stuff.

633
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:53,087
Okay, all right.

634
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:54,489
Wait, Barry... we haven't even figured out

635
00:32:54,491 --> 00:32:56,224
how to neutralize the Turtle's power.

636
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:58,359
Well, I'm gonna have to power through it.

637
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:05,299
All right, I'm outside the library.

638
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:07,201
Barry, the only way to save Patty

639
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:09,303
is if you grab her in between
each of the Turtle's pulses.

640
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:11,172
You'll only have 2/10ths of a second

641
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:12,173
to make your moves.

642
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:13,641
I got it.

643
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:21,549
No!

644
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:47,942
Uhh!

645
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:50,178
Uhh...

646
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,079
Ugh!

647
00:33:53,016 --> 00:33:55,082
Ugghh!

648
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:03,891
I guess he doesn't care about you

649
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:06,827
as much as I thought.

650
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:08,296
No...

651
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,669
No, no... please!

652
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:49,837
Ooh!

653
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:56,644
No, it's all right.

654
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,483
Thank you. Thank you.

655
00:35:02,485 --> 00:35:04,485
Thank you, whoever you are.

656
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:08,556
It's okay.

657
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:10,558
It's okay.

658
00:35:21,017 --> 00:35:22,750
Hey, Turtle.

659
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:28,489
So you want to know my
new definition of irony?

660
00:35:28,491 --> 00:35:31,959
Now you... are our most prized possession.

661
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:37,064
Arrrhhhh!

662
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:41,569
- Patty okay?
- She is, yeah.

663
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:55,115
Jay?

664
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:57,084
Yeah?

665
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:01,121
I know.

666
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:03,591
Why didn't you tell me that you're sick?

667
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:07,761
The champagne.

668
00:36:07,763 --> 00:36:09,997
You took my DNA off the glass.

669
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:11,932
You know I lost my husband...

670
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:15,102
how hard that was for me to move on.

671
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:16,637
How could you let me get close to you

672
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,239
knowing that soon I'd lose you too?

673
00:36:21,477 --> 00:36:22,943
I just...

674
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:27,181
I didn't expect... this.

675
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:28,315
I didn't expect you.

676
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:31,852
Then help me find a cure.

677
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:33,821
There is no cure.

678
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:37,491
The only way to save me
is to get my speed back.

679
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:41,061
And the only way to do
that is to stop Zoom.

680
00:36:41,063 --> 00:36:43,831
Then let's stop him.

681
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:47,234
Yeah.

682
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:57,945
Hey.

683
00:36:57,947 --> 00:37:00,280
I think I left my sweater
here the other night.

684
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:02,082
It's green.

685
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:04,218
Oh, yeah.

686
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,687
I thought that didn't look like Barry's.

687
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:13,994
Heading back to Keystone tonight.

688
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:15,329
That's a fast trip.

689
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:17,197
Yeah, well, it's getting a little hot

690
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,232
in Central City for me.

691
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:19,800
Don't worry.

692
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:22,703
I'll try not to run too
many lights on the way there.

693
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:30,044
You know, if you're waiting for an apology,

694
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:31,178
it's not coming.

695
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,347
No.

696
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:35,482
No, I'm... I'm the one that should be

697
00:37:35,484 --> 00:37:38,218
apologizing to you.

698
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,754
I felt bad

699
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:44,258
not being there while you
were growing up, and...

700
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,661
I was pushing this whole father-son thing.

701
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:49,730
I'm sorry.

702
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:51,865
Let's just slow down a bit.

703
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:53,667
I won't try to be your instant dad,

704
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:55,502
and you won't have to pretend that

705
00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:57,404
you want to be my son.

706
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:03,110
Deal?

707
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:05,579
All that food for you?

708
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:07,181
Doesn't have to be.

709
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:09,249
You like chow mein?

710
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:10,617
No.

711
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:15,289
But I like kung pao chicken.

712
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:28,702
Initial and sign.

713
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:30,938
There you go. Thank you, guys.

714
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,339
Patty.

715
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:33,741
- Hey.
- Hi.

716
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:36,310
Um, can we talk... like, really talk?

717
00:38:36,312 --> 00:38:37,878
Yeah, uh, no.

718
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,546
Now's not really an awesome time.

719
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:41,281
I have a mound of paperwork
on my desk I need to finish,

720
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:42,516
so I'm sorry, I can't.

721
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:43,984
No, no, okay. Real... really quick.

722
00:38:43,986 --> 00:38:46,053
Um, so you were right.

723
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:48,288
You were right about everything.

724
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,090
Um, I've been closed off and weird,

725
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:53,060
and, um, all the things
that you said I was.

726
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:56,997
But mostly, I have not been honest.

727
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,967
Barry, um...

728
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,668
I'm leaving Central City.

729
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:06,673
What?

730
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:11,011
Um, before Mardon, and before my dad...

731
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:12,713
before everything...

732
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:15,649
I always wanted to be a CSI.

733
00:39:15,651 --> 00:39:17,284
And four years ago, I was accepted

734
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:18,619
into the Forensic Science program

735
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:22,256
at Midway City University.

736
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:23,991
That's a really great school.

737
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:25,058
Yeah.

738
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,127
Yeah, I know, I just, uh...

739
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:28,495
I didn't go.

740
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:31,064
You know, I deferred to become a cop and...

741
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:34,067
catch my dad's killer.

742
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:36,870
And I've done that.

743
00:39:36,872 --> 00:39:39,506
So, um...

744
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:42,643
so it's time to move on.

745
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:44,645
From the job?

746
00:39:47,082 --> 00:39:49,016
From everything.

747
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:54,955
Patty. Patty...

748
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,356
Pat...

749
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:09,036
Journal log entry number 113.

750
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:14,041
Jess...

751
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:17,344
I'm coming for you soon.

752
00:40:17,346 --> 00:40:19,446
I promise.

753
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:21,615
I was thinking earlier today about the time

754
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:23,584
that you were four.

755
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:26,053
I took you to the
planetarium, just you and me.

756
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:27,788
I remember because it was the first time

757
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,790
I took you out all by myself.

758
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,725
The planetarium was crowded,

759
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:34,428
and you held my hand for dear life,

760
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,630
or maybe it was the other way around.

761
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:39,366
But it was in the Mars
exhibit that I lost you.

762
00:40:39,368 --> 00:40:40,868
Panic.

763
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,636
I had that place locked down in one minute.

764
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,571
I had every security guard looking for you.

765
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:47,608
And I could feel the fear
rise in the back of my throat

766
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,310
and something else rising also,

767
00:40:50,312 --> 00:40:55,182
some... dark instinct inside me

768
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:58,051
about what I would do

769
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:00,354
to the person who had taken you...

770
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:02,456
the things I would do...

771
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:06,760
Unspeakable things.

772
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:10,931
And it was in that moment that I realized,

773
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:12,566
for certain,

774
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:18,205
that I would do anything to get you back.

775
00:41:49,538 --> 00:41:52,005
- Gideon.
- Yes, Professor Thawne?

776
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:54,474
Where the hell am I?

777
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,520
