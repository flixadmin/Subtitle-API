1
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,823
Can I persuade you
to take a sandwich with you, sir?

2
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,409
I'll get drive-through.

3
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:40,662
You're counting on the winged avenger
to deliver you from evil...

4
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,539
...aren't you, my friend?

5
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,458
Are you gonna kill me?

6
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:50,129
Maybe, maybe not. You can say
we're of two minds on the subject. Ha!

7
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,008
Are you a gambling man?

8
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,262
What say we flip for it?

9
00:02:58,096 --> 00:03:01,015
One man is born a hero,
his brother, a coward.

10
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,769
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...

11
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:08,982
...holy men are martyred,
and junkies grow legion.

12
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:13,611
Why? Why? Why?

13
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:15,446
Luck.

14
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:21,870
Blind, stupid, simple, doo-da, clueless luck.
Ha-ha-ha.

15
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,457
The wrath of toss.

16
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,460
The only true justice.

17
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:33,548
Let's see what justice has in store...

18
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,258
...for you.

19
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:43,725
Oh! It's like the touch of God.
Wait, wait, wait.

20
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,145
Oh-oh!

21
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:49,564
Fortune smiles,
another day of wine and roses.

22
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,108
Or, in your case, beer and pizza. Ha!

23
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,443
Out of here!

24
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,822
- But you said you'd let me live.
- Too true, and so you shall.

25
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:00,742
Nothing better than live bait
to trap a bat.

26
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:05,496
What if we could get
some kind of a horn?

27
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:17,634
Hot entrance.

28
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,344
Two-Face?

29
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,763
Two guards are dead.
He's holding a third hostage.

30
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,682
- Didn't see this one coming.
- We should have, though.

31
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,434
The Second Bank of Gotham on the...

32
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,645
Second anniversary
of the day I captured him.

33
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,188
How could Two-Face resist?

34
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,814
I'm Chase Meridian.

35
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,859
I asked Dr. Meridian to come to Gotham
to consult on this case.

36
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,486
She specializes in...

37
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,822
Abnormal Psychology,
multiple personalities. I read your work.

38
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,659
Insightful. Naive, but insightful.

39
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:46,871
I'm flattered. Not every girl
makes a superhero's night table.

40
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:49,874
Can we reason with him?
He's holding innocent people up there.

41
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,211
It won't do any good.
He'll slaughter them without thinking twice.

42
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:57,423
A trauma powerful enough to create
an alternate personality leaves the victim...

43
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,718
In a world where normal rules
of right and wrong no longer apply.

44
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:03,638
- Exactly.
- Like you.

45
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,807
I could write a hell of a paper...

46
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:08,935
...on a grown man
who dresses like a flying rodent.

47
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,397
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.

48
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,525
Really? I didn't know that.

49
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:17,151
You are interesting.

50
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,906
And call me Chase.

51
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:27,578
By the way, do you have a first name
or do I just call you Bats?

52
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,877
Let's start this party with a bang.

53
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,764
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.

54
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,308
Boys, kill the bat.

55
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:53,896
Ha, ha. Ha.

56
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,321
Blast him.

57
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:16,794
Open sesame.

58
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,277
It's a trap.

59
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,375
Oh, no!

60
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,064
<i>Attention, citizens of fair Gotham.</i>

61
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,737
When we open that safe,
we'll have everything we ever wanted.

62
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,407
Enough cash
to rain down upon fair Gotham...

63
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:12,160
<i>...a glorious flood of chaos.</i>

64
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:16,330
<i>And, of course, you, my boy, dead.
Ha-ha-ha.</i>

65
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:22,086
Oh, no, it's boiling acid.

66
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,755
For your dying pleasure we're serving
the same acid...

67
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,884
...that made us the men we are today.
Ha-ha-ha.

68
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,387
- No.
- Hold on.

69
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,597
Yes.

70
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,517
Haul away.

71
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,270
Yes, haul away.

72
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,611
- Give me your hand.
- Don't let go.

73
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,866
Oh! Oh.

74
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,285
- I'm gonna have to borrow this.
- Aah!

75
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:59,207
Hey. Hey, that's my hearing aid.

76
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,625
Thanks.

77
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,423
My shoes are melting. Oh!

78
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,183
Oh, oh.

79
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,392
No more!

80
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,770
Aah!

81
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,403
Oh! Ah!

82
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,494
- Hang on.
- Hang on?

83
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:40,748
Whoa!

84
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,352
Get him down. Get him down.

85
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,230
Hey, take it easy with him, fellows.

86
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:09,568
You'll be all right, young man.
Just stay calm. Easy, just easy.

87
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,663
This will fix him. Ha-ha-ha.

88
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:29,797
Hang on, Batty! Ha-ha-ha.

89
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:49,025
Ah.

90
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,735
Let's see.

91
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:52,695
Yes.

92
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,865
Yes, yes, yes. Oh, happy day.

93
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:02,163
Farewell forever
to that pointy-eared night rat.

94
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:05,750
Face.

95
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,962
- Hey, Face!
- Hmm?

96
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,215
- Die!
- No!

97
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:28,939
Oh!

98
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,234
You need help, Harvey. Give it up.

99
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,636
Have the good taste to die.

100
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,805
See you.

101
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,848
<i>Despite a valiant effort
last night by Batman...</i>

102
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,726
<i>...Harvey Two-Face is still at large
and extremely dangerous.</i>

103
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,229
<i>And in other news today,
billionaire Bruce Wayne...</i>

104
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:53,107
<i>...has extended his trend-setting
profit-sharing program...</i>

105
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:56,402
<i>...to the employees of the highly successful
Electronics Division...</i>

106
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:57,862
<i>...of Wayne Enterprises.</i>

107
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:11,250
- Mr. Wayne.
- Hello, Fred.

108
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,627
Your inspections
are a departmental highlight.

109
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:17,339
Oh, my God, it's him.

110
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:22,094
I am a winner. I am a winner.
I am a winner.

111
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,721
I am a winner.

112
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,809
Bioremediation. Alternative fuel.

113
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,561
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.

114
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:35,065
Perhaps we should get to R&D
as soon as possible.

115
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,067
Mister...

116
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,154
Ohhh... Bruce Wayne.

117
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:43,240
No, that's my name. And you are?

118
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:46,619
Nygma. Edward. Edward Nygma.

119
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,915
You hired me personally.
Just like I tell everyone.

120
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:55,294
We've never actually met,
but your name was on the hiring slip.

121
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:58,672
- I have it.
- I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.

122
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,260
Oh. Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

123
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,429
It's just that...

124
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,348
...you're my idol.

125
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:08,724
Back to work, Edward.

126
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,478
And some people have been trying
to keep us apart.

127
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:15,189
- Back to work, Edward.
- It's okay.

128
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,608
So, Mr. Nygma, what's on your mind?

129
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:21,612
Precisely. What's on all our minds?

130
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,572
Brain waves.

131
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:31,789
The future of Wayne Enterprises...

132
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,542
...is brain waves.

133
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:39,338
I'm gonna have to apologize. I personally
terminated his project this morning.

134
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,548
It's okay.

135
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,716
I have it.

136
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,179
<i>Voilà.</i>

137
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,141
Huh?

138
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,815
My invention beams any TV signal
directly into the human brain.

139
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:01,318
By stimulating neurons,
manipulating brain waves, if you will...

140
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:07,241
...this device makes the audience feel
like they're inside the show.

141
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,202
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?

142
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:13,455
Did you say, "Manipulating brain waves"?

143
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,958
Well...

144
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,460
- Yes.
- Hmm.

145
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,920
But...

146
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,257
...someone like you would never need it.

147
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,175
Someone so...

148
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,721
...intelligent, witty and charming.

149
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,475
I just need a bit of additional funding
for human trials.

150
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,520
- Let me show you, please.
- Now, listen, Ed...

151
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,690
...I want a full set of technical schematics
on this, okay?

152
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,484
I want you to know
we'll be full partners in this, Bruce.

153
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,446
Look at us. Two of a kind.

154
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,032
You call my assistant, Margaret.
She'll set something up.

155
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,825
Ahhh...

156
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:53,495
That's not gonna be good for me.

157
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,373
I need an answer now.

158
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,043
I think I deserve it.

159
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,879
I'm sorry, Ed, then the answer is no.

160
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:07,301
Tampering with people's brain waves,
mind manipulation...

161
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:12,056
It just raises too many questions.
Sorry.

162
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,267
Thanks, everybody, keep up the good work.
Factory looks great.

163
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,103
All right, everyone, back to work.

164
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,856
We'll discuss this later.

165
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,572
You were supposed to understand.

166
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,579
I'll make you understand.

167
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,250
Lock.

168
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,758
Chair.

169
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,602
- Alfred.
- I saw the signal, sir.

170
00:16:58,769 --> 00:16:59,937
All is ready.

171
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,896
- Commissioner Gordon?
- He's at home.

172
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,650
I sent the signal.

173
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:48,819
What's wrong?

174
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:54,992
Last night at the bank
I noticed something about Two-Face.

175
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,243
His coin.

176
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,412
It's his Achilles' heel.

177
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,832
- It can be exploited.
- I know.

178
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,417
You called me here for this?

179
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,669
The Bat-Signal is not a beeper.

180
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,298
Well, I wish I could say
that my interest in you...

181
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,175
...was purely professional.

182
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,677
Are you trying to get under my cape,
doctor?

183
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:16,847
A girl can't live by psychoses alone.

184
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,475
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.

185
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,729
What is it about the wrong kind of man?

186
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,939
In grade school,
it was guys with earrings.

187
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:30,152
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.

188
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,779
Now...

189
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,907
Oh.

190
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,034
...black rubber.

191
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,703
Try a fireman. Less to take off.

192
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,501
I don't mind the work.
Pity I can't see behind the mask.

193
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:50,631
- We all wear masks.
- My life's an open book. You read?

194
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,884
I don't blend in at a family picnic.

195
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:58,347
Oh, we could give it a try.
I'll bring the wine...

196
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,642
...you bring your scarred psyche.

197
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,355
- Direct, aren't you?
- You like strong women.

198
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,357
I've done my homework.

199
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:11,401
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?

200
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:15,239
I haven't had that much luck
with women.

201
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,575
Maybe you just haven't met
the right woman.

202
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,333
I saw the signal. What's going on?

203
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,627
- Nothing.
- Ahem.

204
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:29,878
False alarm.

205
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,422
Are you sure?

206
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,067
Women.

207
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,035
Okay...

208
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,580
...now I've got it! Hah.

209
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,793
Too many questions.
There's too many questions.

210
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,169
There's just too many...

211
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,631
I'll show you it works.

212
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,301
What the hell is going on here?

213
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:22,014
I told you this project is terminated.
I'm calling security.

214
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,814
Caffeine will kill you!

215
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,695
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.

216
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,656
What are you doing, Nygma? Untie me.

217
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,158
This won't hurt a bit.

218
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,160
At least, I don't think it will.

219
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,456
What are you doing? Nygma.

220
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,334
- You touch that switch and...
- Which one? This?

221
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,424
Uh-oh. Ooh.

222
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:02,846
Ah.

223
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:09,436
- Losing resolution. More power.
- Ooh.

224
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,712
Edward Nygma, come on down...

225
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:40,717
...you're the next contestant
on <i>Brain Drain.</i>

226
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,052
Um-chee-uh-ah.

227
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:45,180
I'll take what's inside
thick skull number one.

228
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,391
- What have we got for him, Johnny?
- Oh.

229
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:51,770
Ooh-hoo-hoo.
Stickley, I'm having a breakthrough.

230
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,814
And a breakdown? Maybe!

231
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,149
Nevertheless, I'm smarter. I'm a genius.

232
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,069
No, several geniuses.

233
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:04,157
A gaggle, a swarm,
a flock of freaking Freuds.

234
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,577
Riddle me this, Fred.

235
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:12,082
What is everything to someone
and nothing to everyone else?

236
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,418
Your mind, baby.

237
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,587
And now mine pumps
with the power of yours.

238
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,716
<i>I'm sucking up your IQ</i>

239
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,010
<i>Vacuuming your cortex</i>

240
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,845
<i>Feeding off your brain</i>

241
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,934
Fred!

242
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,790
What a rush.

243
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,792
What the hell just happened?

244
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:01,757
A very surprising side effect.

245
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:05,302
While you were mesmerized
by my 3-D TV...

246
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,388
...I utilized your neural energy
to grow smarter.

247
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,308
Bruce Wayne was right.

248
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:17,272
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad.
It is brain manipulation.

249
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,483
I'm reporting you to the FCC...

250
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:23,820
...the Human Experimentation Board,
the AMI, and the police.

251
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,823
You are going up on charges, to court...

252
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,994
...to jail, and then to a mental institution
for the rest of your twisted little life.

253
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,997
But first and foremost, Nygma,
you are fired.

254
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:37,125
Do you hear me? Fired!

255
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,212
Mmm.

256
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:45,425
I don't think so.

257
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,524
Oh!

258
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,528
Hang on!

259
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,534
Fred, babe...

260
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,494
...you are fired.

261
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:16,706
Or should I say terminated?

262
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:25,423
Surf's up, big kahuna!

263
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:30,387
Ooh. Nice form,
but a little rough on the landing.

264
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,056
He may have to settle for the bronze.

265
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:45,026
Questions, Mr. Wayne?
My work raises too many questions?

266
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:48,238
<i>Why hasn't anybody...</i>

267
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,408
<i>...put you in your place?</i>

268
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,495
<i>Harvey Dent,
once Gotham's District Attorney...</i>

269
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,832
<i>...was horribly scarred
by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.</i>

270
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:02,043
<i>Although Batman tried to save him,
Dent's left-brain damage...</i>

271
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,087
<i>...transformed him
into a violent criminal...</i>

272
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,007
<i>- ...who blames Batman...</i>
- Wayne Manor.

273
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,426
<i>...and who has vowed to destroy
the Dark Knight.</i>

274
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,845
<i>- Harvey Two-Face is extremely dangerous.</i>
- Ah.

275
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,096
<i>Repeat, extremely...</i>

276
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,056
That was the Commissioner Gordon, sir.

277
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:18,602
There's been an accident
at Wayne Enterprises.

278
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,438
- Horrible way to die.
- Yes.

279
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:23,648
The video surveillance cameras
are down here.

280
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:28,445
Good. We'll dredge the river, but with that
current, I doubt we'll ever find the body.

281
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:36,077
Why? Oh, why?

282
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,289
I just can't believe it.

283
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,792
Two years working in the same office.

284
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,546
He was like my father, my brother...

285
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,965
...or a cousin that visits all the time.

286
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,885
Get a grip, Edward.

287
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:54,971
I found this in my cubicle.

288
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,474
You'll find the handwriting
matches his exactly...

289
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,559
...as does sentence structure
and spelling.

290
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,441
I couldn't possibly continue on here.

291
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:09,694
The memories...

292
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,074
This is last night's security log.

293
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,700
There's Stickley.

294
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,875
Pretty cut-and-dry.

295
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,634
Yep, definitely suicide.

296
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:36,179
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
We'll be in touch.

297
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,560
Stickley's suicide.
It doesn't make sense. Thanks.

298
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,437
I want full benefits for his family.

299
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:47,190
Suicide's not covered
by our corporate insurance policy.

300
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,942
I know. Full benefits.

301
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,152
Gossip Gerty has called a record 32 times.

302
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,198
- Who are you taking to the charity circus?
- I'll let you know. What's this?

303
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:59,744
I don't know. I didn't see anyone.

304
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,721
That's hideous. What does it mean?

305
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,055
It's a riddle.

306
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:22,058
"Numbers on my face, 13."

307
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,395
One through 12.
The answer is a clock.

308
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,731
Who would send you a riddle?

309
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,984
That, Maggie, is the riddle.

310
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,280
Guess what I did today.

311
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,394
Wayne Manor.

312
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,687
Hmp!

313
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:58,321
See you soon.

314
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:31,187
Dr. Meridian, please. Thank you.

315
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,718
I...

316
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,803
I...

317
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,889
...guess I'm early.

318
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:09,184
I have an appointment. I'm Bruce Wayne.

319
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:12,979
Good.
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.

320
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:16,149
I... Sorry.

321
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,234
I...

322
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:23,531
You sounded like you were in...

323
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,366
In...

324
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,496
You know, trouble.

325
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:34,250
I prefer healthy expressions of violence
as opposed to breaking and entering.

326
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:39,255
- Hmm.
- So how can I help you, Mr. Wayne?

327
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,135
Oh. Someone's been sending me
love letters.

328
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:48,389
One at my office,
and one last night at my home.

329
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:53,269
I... Commissioner Gordon thought
you might give me your expert opinion.

330
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,400
Clock.

331
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,110
Clock.

332
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,582
A match.

333
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,923
My opinion,
this letter writer is a total wacko.

334
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:25,760
Wacko? That a technical term?

335
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,805
Patient may suffer
from obsessional syndrome...

336
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:33,226
...with potential homicidal tendencies.
Does that work better for you?

337
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:37,272
So, what you're saying
is this guy's a total wacko.

338
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,315
Exactly.

339
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,151
He's obsessed with you.

340
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,238
His only escape
may be to purge the fixation.

341
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,616
To kill me.

342
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,953
I think you understand obsession
better than you let on.

343
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,749
You have a thing for bats?

344
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:01,421
Oh, that's a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.
An inkblot.

345
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:03,631
People see what they want.

346
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:07,427
I think the question would be,
do you have a thing for bats?

347
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,181
Still playing with dolls, doctor?

348
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,268
She's a Malaysian dream warden.

349
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:18,521
Some cultures believe
she protects you from bad dreams.

350
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:21,649
It's silly to you, I'm sure.

351
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,364
You look so sad.

352
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:30,783
Do you need one?

353
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:33,995
Me? No. Why would I?

354
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,042
You're not exactly what you seem,
are you, Bruce Wayne?

355
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:42,712
What is it you really came here for?

356
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:46,966
Yikes, time's up.

357
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,428
That's usually my line.

358
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:54,766
- Listen, I'd love to stay here chatting...
- Mm. Would you?

359
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,476
I'm not so sure.

360
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,729
I've really gotta get you
out of those clothes.

361
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,900
- Excuse me?
- And into a black dress.

362
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,153
Tell me, doctor, do you like the circus?

363
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,591
Ladies and gentlemen...

364
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,968
...boys and girls of all ages...

365
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:33,680
...welcome to the greatest show
on Earth.

366
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,766
Bruce, who is this beautiful young woman
you're with?

367
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:41,270
- Dr. Chase Meridian.
- A doctor? What kind of doctor?

368
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:43,606
<i>...for Gotham Children's Hospital.</i>

369
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:48,778
<i>Let's thank our largest single donor:
Bruce Wayne!</i>

370
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:53,032
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

371
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:55,785
...70 feet above the ground...

372
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:59,872
...performing feats
of unimaginable aerial skill...

373
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,709
...the Flying Graysons.

374
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,848
Listen, I'm going rock climbing
this weekend.

375
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,600
Would you like to join me?

376
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,185
Oh, um...

377
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:06,981
I'd like to, I love climbing.
I mean, I really love it.

378
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:10,276
- But?
- I've met someone.

379
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,696
That's fast work. You just moved here.

380
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:17,533
Well, you could say he just kind of
dropped out of the sky...

381
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,286
...and bang!

382
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:22,872
I think he felt it too.

383
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,792
- Sure did.
- What?

384
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:28,628
Well, who wouldn't?

385
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,171
And now...

386
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,719
...Richard, the youngest Flying Grayson...

387
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:41,057
...will perform the awe-inspiring
death drop...

388
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,394
...without the safety of a net.

389
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:07,416
- Okay, let's go.
- You'll be all right.

390
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,039
Ladies and gentlemen...

391
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:49,750
...the new management
of the Circus International...

392
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:53,421
...invites you to forget this good, clean,
wholesome all-American fun...

393
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:59,051
...and join us in a celebration
of absolute chaos and true jesters.

394
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:02,889
Bring it on. Bring it on, now.

395
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:16,485
Tonight, a new act
for your personal amazement.

396
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:21,741
- We call it Massacre Under the Big Top.
- Ha-ha-ha.

397
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:25,536
If we may direct your attention
to the middle of the center ring.

398
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:29,123
Inside this harmless-looking orb are two...

399
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,919
That's 200 sticks of TNT.

400
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:37,840
And in our innocent hand,
a radio detonator.

401
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:41,677
- What the hell do you want, Harvey?
- Want, Mr. Mayor?

402
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,638
One simple thing: Batman.

403
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:47,683
Bruised, broken, bleeding.
In a word: dead!

404
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:55,691
- Batman.
- Who do we have before us?

405
00:37:55,858 --> 00:38:02,281
Gotham's finest, well-to-do, influential.
Surely one of you knows who Batman is.

406
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,953
Hell, odds are, one of you pasty-faced twits
is Batman.

407
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,705
You have two minutes.

408
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,296
Harvey.

409
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,298
I'm Batman!

410
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:26,889
Bruce.

411
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:29,225
Whoo-hoo! Ha-ha-ha.

412
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,903
We could stop them.
If we go out on the rigging.

413
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,905
- Be careful, boys.
- Don't worry, Mom.

414
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:02,758
Go to work, boys. Ha, ha.

415
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,108
Oof!

416
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,488
Ha!

417
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,907
Our kind of day.

418
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,251
Reach for it. Stop it.

419
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,551
Oh, my God.

420
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:58,939
Ha!

421
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:24,900
Bruce.

422
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:28,195
It's good of you to take him in.
He hasn't anyone now.

423
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:32,575
We've had him filling out papers all day.
He hasn't slept, he hasn't even eaten.

424
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,881
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.

425
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,175
How you doing, Al?

426
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,052
There's a room for you upstairs...

427
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:54,763
...but perhaps you'd like to get
something to eat first.

428
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,101
Okay, I'm out of here.

429
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:01,937
Excuse me?

430
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:04,106
I figured telling that cop
I'd stay here...

431
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:07,943
...saved me a truckload
of social service interviews and charities.

432
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,446
So, no offense, but no thanks. See you.

433
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:12,907
Take it easy, Al.

434
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,002
Where will you go?

435
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:27,796
The circus must be
halfway to Metropolis by now.

436
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:31,634
I'll get a fix on Two-Face.
Then I'm gonna kill him.

437
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:36,222
Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away.
It'll make it worse.

438
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,641
Look, spare me the sermons,
all right, Bruce?

439
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:42,102
I don't need your advice
and I don't need your charity.

440
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:46,982
- That's a nice bike.
- Hang out at a lot of biker bars, Bruce?

441
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:52,488
You're almost on empty.
Why don't you fill up in the garage?

442
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:54,990
There's not a gas station around here
for miles.

443
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:04,583
Pump's over here.

444
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,920
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?

445
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:12,341
Oh, wow.

446
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:19,640
- It's a 1917 Harley.
- Yep.

447
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:22,726
Indian classic, fully restored.

448
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:27,022
This is a Vincent Black Knight.
They only made, like, a hundred of these.

449
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:30,192
A hundred and one, actually.
She's my favorite.

450
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,153
- You've got two of them.
- Yeah, that one doesn't run, though.

451
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:36,657
Throttle sticks on this one.

452
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:41,954
Alfred's actually a very good mechanic,
but some of these need a lot of work.

453
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:45,499
If someone were to fix them up,
they could keep one as a fee.

454
00:43:47,668 --> 00:43:50,587
Anyway, have a nice trip.

455
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,382
I'm sure you'll land on your feet.

456
00:43:56,343 --> 00:44:00,055
Is the young master leaving? Pity.

457
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:04,351
I'll just toss this away, then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry.

458
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,523
Hey, Al, wait up.

459
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,924
"That where there is hatred,
I will bring love.

460
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:22,554
That where there is wrong,
I may bring the spirit of forgiveness.

461
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:26,058
That where there is despair,
I may bring hope.

462
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:30,270
That where there are shadows,
I may bring light.

463
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:33,982
That where there is sadness,
I may bring joy.

464
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:39,196
Lord, grant that I may seek
rather to comfort than to be comforted.

465
00:45:39,363 --> 00:45:42,324
To understand, than to be understood.

466
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:45,661
To love, than to be loved."

467
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:04,805
Master Bruce?

468
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,184
Master Bruce?

469
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:12,020
Just like my parents.

470
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:14,273
It's happening again.

471
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:18,944
A monster comes out of the night,
a scream, two shots.

472
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:24,074
- I killed them.
- What did you say?

473
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:29,204
He killed them. Two-Face.
He slaughtered that boy's parents.

474
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:34,418
No. No, you said, "I."
"I killed them."

475
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:49,433
- Take care of the kid.
- Certainly, sir.

476
00:46:57,149 --> 00:47:00,235
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?

477
00:47:00,402 --> 00:47:01,862
No.

478
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,490
Thanks, I won't...
I won't be staying long.

479
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:06,241
Oh.

480
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:09,578
Is this a robin?

481
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,043
My brother's wire broke once
and I swung out and grabbed him.

482
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:19,755
My father said I was his hero.

483
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:23,217
I flew in like a robin.

484
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:27,930
Some hero I turned out to be.

485
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:33,936
But your father was right.
You are a hero. I can tell.

486
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,987
Throw this away, will you, Alfred?
I won't be needing it anymore.

487
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:48,283
I think I'll just put it in here.

488
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,626
Broken wings mend in time.

489
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:03,215
One day Robin will fly again. I promise.

490
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:45,465
Aah-aah!

491
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:52,472
Whoa!

492
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:03,692
Aah! Ah-ha.

493
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:26,757
We'll drive, thank you.

494
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:45,961
Aah!

495
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,226
The Puzzler?

496
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:07,941
The Gamester?

497
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:16,116
Captain Kill?

498
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,164
Question Mark Man?

499
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:24,332
No, no, no.

500
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,848
Ohhh...

501
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:42,267
Thank you. Thank you so much.

502
00:51:56,406 --> 00:52:00,410
The Bat's stubborn refusal to expire...

503
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:03,705
...is driving us insane.

504
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:07,793
Don't worry, baby.

505
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:11,880
You'll kill him soon.

506
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:19,888
Besides, I made your favorite tonight.

507
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:22,390
- Sparkling champagne...
- Oh.

508
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:26,728
...yummy poached salmon
with little itty-bitty quail eggs...

509
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:31,566
...and a creamy, dreamy lemon soufflé.

510
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:34,444
No, I made your favorite.

511
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:37,072
A charred heart of black boar...

512
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:40,200
...a side of raw donkey meat...

513
00:52:40,367 --> 00:52:44,579
...and a Sterno and grain alcohol,
straight up, baby!

514
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:49,417
Perfect. Ladies, you spoil us.

515
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:53,505
We're of two minds
about what to eat first.

516
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:56,091
- What?
- I hope you made extra.

517
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:58,593
Who the hell are you?

518
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:00,762
Just a friend.

519
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:03,056
But you can call me...

520
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:05,433
...the Riddler.

521
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:11,523
I'll call you dead, is more like it.
How did you find us here? Talk.

522
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,983
But then if I talked...

523
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:15,944
...what would keep you from slaying me,
O Segregated One?

524
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:20,031
By the way, that's never gonna heal
if you don't stop picking.

525
00:53:21,116 --> 00:53:23,618
- Let's see if you bleed green.
- Harvey...

526
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:27,038
- Ha-ha-ha.
- ...I don't think it's me you wanna kill.

527
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:31,376
That's just too easy
for someone as powerful as you...

528
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:33,920
...and you.

529
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:35,380
But Batman...

530
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:39,217
...there's a challenge.

531
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,887
- Kill the Bat! Sounds like a good idea.
- Ha-ha-ha.

532
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,638
But have you thought it through?

533
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:48,184
A few bullets, a quick splash of blood,
and then what?

534
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:50,270
Wet hands.

535
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:53,565
Post-homicidal depression.

536
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:59,821
- Why not humiliate him first?
- Yeah.

537
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:03,575
Expose his frailties.
And then, when he is at his weakest...

538
00:54:03,742 --> 00:54:06,828
- ...crush him.
- Heh.

539
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:12,000
- I see that sparkle in your left eye.
- Heh.

540
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:15,921
I can help you get Batman.

541
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:23,637
That is, if you'll spare my life
for just a few moments.

542
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:26,806
Heh.

543
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,024
Thank you.

544
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:38,693
I simply love what you've done
with this place.

545
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,404
<i>Heavy Metal</i> meets <i>House and Garden.</i>
Ha-ha-ha.

546
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:43,740
Beautiful.

547
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:46,660
It's so dark and Gothic...

548
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:49,871
...and disgustingly decadent.
Ahhh...

549
00:54:50,747 --> 00:54:53,875
Yet so bright and chipper...

550
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:56,378
...and conservative.

551
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,634
It's so you.

552
00:55:02,801 --> 00:55:04,803
And yet, so you.

553
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:10,976
Very few people
are both a summer and a winter...

554
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,187
- ...but you pull it off nicely.
- Hah!

555
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,566
What's the point, big boy?

556
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:24,239
Has anybody ever told you
you have a serious impulse-control problem?

557
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,326
This is the point.

558
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:41,965
This is how I found you.

559
00:55:42,132 --> 00:55:44,217
Let me demonstrate.

560
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:51,891
This is your brain on the Box.

561
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,935
- Aah!
- This is my brain on the Box.

562
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:56,855
Does anybody else feel like a fried egg?

563
00:55:57,022 --> 00:55:58,773
I'll have a bit more. Thank you.

564
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,944
Oh, there's more.
But only the first one's free.

565
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:04,571
Here's the bargain.

566
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:10,368
You will help me steal production capital
so I can put a Box on every TV in town...

567
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:15,623
...and become
Gotham's cleverest carbon-based life form.

568
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,876
And in return...

569
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:21,796
Is everybody paying attention?

570
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:24,674
...I will help you solve
the greatest riddle of all.

571
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:27,761
The mother of all riddles:

572
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:32,348
- Who is Batman?
- Hmm.

573
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:35,268
You have broken into our hideout.

574
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:38,688
- You have violated the sanctity of our lair.
- Oh!

575
00:56:38,855 --> 00:56:41,357
For this, we should crush your bones
into powder.

576
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:43,818
However, you pose
a most interesting proposition.

577
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:48,740
Therefore, heads, we accept, and tails,
we blow your damn head off.

578
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,215
Here's a good one.

579
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:07,675
No, no, no.

580
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:09,677
There is a good one.

581
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:13,098
Leave that, Master Dick. I'll attend to it.

582
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,266
Ahem.
I'm not used to being waited on, Al.

583
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:44,879
- Don't shoot me, please.
- Don't you eyeball me! Give me that!

584
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:50,343
Hey, Two-Face,
show me how to punch a guy.

585
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:51,803
It's dirt-simple, my boy.

586
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,389
Ball up the fist, reach way back
and assert yourself.

587
00:57:55,431 --> 00:57:56,891
- Aah!
- Ooh!

588
00:57:57,058 --> 00:58:00,436
- That looks like fun. Let me try, let me try.
- Ball up the fist...

589
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:03,356
- Ball up the fist, way back...
- ...reach way back, assert yourself.

590
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:05,066
Aah! Ow!

591
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:13,408
One hundred thousand, two hundred
and twenty... One hundred and...

592
00:58:13,575 --> 00:58:14,868
I lost count!

593
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:18,621
<i>In Gotham, last night...</i>

594
00:58:18,788 --> 00:58:21,583
<i>...another robbery perpetrated
by the city's green-suited menace...</i>

595
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:25,211
<i>...resulting in millions in diamonds stolen,
with no sign of Batman.</i>

596
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:26,921
<i>Teamed with Two-Face...</i>

597
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,924
<i>...this new criminal's pattern
of marking his crimes with puzzles...</i>

598
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:33,094
<i>...has Gothamites calling him the Riddler.</i>

599
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:36,931
Apparently, you and Batman
have a common enemy.

600
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:39,184
That was with the morning mail.

601
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:52,113
Chess pawns. Clock. Match.
All physical objects, man-made.

602
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,909
- Small in size, light in weight.
- What's the connection?

603
00:58:56,075 --> 00:59:00,038
With all due respect, sir,
I think that's why they call him the Riddler.

604
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,459
May I help you, Master Grayson?

605
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:07,295
How come this the only locked door
around this museum?

606
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:09,047
What have you got back there?

607
00:59:09,214 --> 00:59:12,133
Master Wayne's dead wives.

608
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:14,969
The silver closet. On your way.

609
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:21,809
Now you can be part of the action.

610
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:24,687
Nygmatech brings
the joy of 3-D entertainment...

611
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:27,106
...into your living room.

612
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:30,443
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...

613
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:32,820
...my vision.

614
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:36,574
The Box in every home in America...

615
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:38,451
...and one day, the world.

616
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:41,955
<i>In local news, Edward Nygma's 3-D Box...</i>

617
00:59:42,121 --> 00:59:44,499
<i>...has become the rage of Gotham.</i>

618
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:48,753
<i>Rioting occurred last night
at electronics stores, which were sold out.</i>

619
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:53,174
<i>There is hardly a home
without the Nygmatech Box.</i>

620
00:59:53,341 --> 00:59:56,719
<i>Critics have claimed
the Box turns Gothamites into zombies.</i>

621
00:59:56,886 --> 00:59:58,554
<i>But Edward Nygma just shrugs:</i>

622
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:01,849
<i>"That's what they said
when TV was invented."</i>

623
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:46,519
Master Dick?

624
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:48,855
Up here, Al.

625
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:52,567
Just checking, young sir.

626
01:00:57,155 --> 01:00:58,573
Now.

627
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:14,756
Aah!

628
01:01:21,054 --> 01:01:23,348
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

629
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,892
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

630
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,378
Oh, I have something for you.

631
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:54,837
It's on the table.

632
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:57,173
I hope you like it.

633
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,269
Call it clinical intuition.

634
01:02:10,645 --> 01:02:13,481
I thought your dreams
might need changing.

635
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:18,653
My parents were murdered
in front of me...

636
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,947
...when I was just a kid.

637
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:24,909
I don't...

638
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:28,579
...remember a lot of what happened.

639
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:34,001
What I do comes to me in my dreams,
flashes.

640
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:37,797
There's a new element now, though,
I haven't seen before.

641
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:40,508
It's a red leather book.

642
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:43,344
Something else.

643
01:02:43,511 --> 01:02:46,514
My dreams are coming to me
when I'm awake now.

644
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:51,310
Bruce, you're describing
repressed memories.

645
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:55,815
Images of a forgotten pain
that's trying to surface.

646
01:02:57,984 --> 01:02:59,861
Oh, damn. Wait, I'll be right back.

647
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:21,007
Is it possible...

648
01:03:21,174 --> 01:03:24,218
...there's an aspect of your parents' death
that you haven't faced?

649
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:27,096
And you were so young
when it happened.

650
01:03:28,097 --> 01:03:30,475
Maybe I'll leave you two alone.

651
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:35,730
This goes way beyond
taking your work home, doesn't it, doctor?

652
01:03:38,441 --> 01:03:39,484
All right.

653
01:03:41,736 --> 01:03:43,988
I think he's fascinating.

654
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:45,740
Clinically.

655
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:47,992
Why does a man do this?

656
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:51,245
It's as if he's cursed
to pay some great penance.

657
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:56,083
Now, what crime could he have committed
to deserve a life of nightly torture?

658
01:03:56,918 --> 01:03:58,836
It's more than just...

659
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,590
...professional interest, isn't it, Chase?

660
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:05,426
Bruce, are you jealous?

661
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,428
No, I...

662
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:10,640
I can't be jealous of Batman.

663
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,977
I wanna be close,
but you won't let me near.

664
01:04:16,312 --> 01:04:18,773
What are you protecting me from?

665
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:21,609
You wanna know me?

666
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,529
You wanna know who I am?

667
01:04:26,197 --> 01:04:27,782
I guess...

668
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:30,451
...we're all two people.

669
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:34,705
One in daylight,
and the one we keep in shadow.

670
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:39,252
Rage, violence...

671
01:04:39,919 --> 01:04:41,504
...passion.

672
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:47,134
Excuse me.

673
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,554
I'm kind of busy.

674
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,055
<i>I'm sorry to bother you, sir.</i>

675
01:04:51,222 --> 01:04:53,975
<i>I have some rather distressing news
about Master Dick.</i>

676
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,184
What, is he all right?

677
01:04:55,351 --> 01:04:58,896
<i>I'm afraid Master Dick
has gone traveling.</i>

678
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:00,773
He ran away?

679
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:03,818
<i>Actually, he took the car.</i>

680
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:09,073
- He boosted the Jag?
<i>- Not the Jaguar. The other car.</i>

681
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,492
- The Bentley?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

682
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:14,620
<i>The other car.</i>

683
01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:47,778
Come for a little ride
in my love machine, babies. Whoo!

684
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:52,158
Whoo!

685
01:05:53,034 --> 01:05:54,702
Chill, dudes, it's Batman.

686
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:57,705
Open up, Batman.

687
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:00,708
Wait a minute. That's not Batman.

688
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:03,210
- What are you talking about?
- That's Batboy.

689
01:06:04,712 --> 01:06:06,631
It ain't the Bat.

690
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:23,856
Go, go!

691
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:31,405
Hey! Hey, let her go!

692
01:06:31,572 --> 01:06:33,282
Oooh.

693
01:06:38,871 --> 01:06:40,331
Who the hell are you?

694
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:41,999
I'm Batman.

695
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:47,088
Hey, so I forgot my suit, all right?

696
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,293
Ahh.

697
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,462
- Come on, run!
- Wait.

698
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:31,215
Doesn't Batman ever kiss the girl?

699
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:35,928
- Go.
- Thanks, you saved my life.

700
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:39,306
I could definitely get into
this superhero gig.

701
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:03,080
Batman!

702
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:05,082
Batman!

703
01:08:18,387 --> 01:08:19,805
Bastard!

704
01:08:19,972 --> 01:08:22,892
It should've been you! It's your fault!

705
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:25,478
If you'd told Two-Face
who you were at the circus...

706
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:27,688
...they'd still be alive!

707
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:34,862
If Bruce Wayne could have given his life
for your family, he would have.

708
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:44,288
All I can think about every second
of the day is getting Two-Face.

709
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:47,374
He took my whole life.

710
01:08:49,335 --> 01:08:51,253
When I was out there tonight...

711
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,506
...I imagined it was him
that I was fighting.

712
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:55,800
Even when I was fighting you.

713
01:08:57,051 --> 01:08:58,469
And all the pain went away.

714
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,349
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I do.

715
01:09:03,516 --> 01:09:07,269
Good.
Because you gotta help me find him.

716
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:09,230
And when we do...

717
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:11,649
...I'm the one who kills him.

718
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:15,736
So you're willing to take a life?

719
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:18,239
As long as it's Two-Face.

720
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:23,953
Then it will happen this way:

721
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,913
You make the kill.

722
01:09:27,498 --> 01:09:30,459
But your pain doesn't die with Harvey,
it grows.

723
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:33,587
So you run out into the night
to find another face...

724
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:36,924
...and another and another...

725
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:40,845
...until one terrible morning
you wake up and realize...

726
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:43,848
...that revenge has become
your whole life.

727
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:46,183
And you won't know why.

728
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:49,228
You can't understand.

729
01:09:49,395 --> 01:09:51,522
Your family wasn't killed by a maniac.

730
01:09:52,982 --> 01:09:54,733
Yes, they were.

731
01:09:55,943 --> 01:09:57,570
We're the same.

732
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:02,449
Well, if we're the same, Bruce, help me.
All right? Train me, let me be your partner.

733
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:05,703
No.

734
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:07,705
I can't.

735
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:10,374
You still have a choice.

736
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:14,837
Look, Bruce, I'm a part of this,
whether you like it or not.

737
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:35,900
<i>And tonight,
all of Gotham society has turned out...</i>

738
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:41,322
<i>...for Edward Nygma's gala unveiling
of his new, improved Box.</i>

739
01:10:41,739 --> 01:10:43,616
- Thanks, Al.
- My pleasure, sir.

740
01:10:43,782 --> 01:10:47,912
<i>They'll be dining and dancing
the night away on the glamorous roof...</i>

741
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:50,372
<i>...of the Ritz Gotham.</i>

742
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:02,301
Mr. Nygma,
what's it like to have your face...

743
01:11:02,468 --> 01:11:04,511
...on the cover of every magazine
in Gotham?

744
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:05,888
Ah! Ha!

745
01:11:06,055 --> 01:11:10,476
Edward, how does it feel to be
the city's newest, most eligible bachelor?

746
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:14,063
Gotham must know. Oh!

747
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:17,441
There's Bruce Wayne. Brucie.

748
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:19,068
- Over here.
- Mr. Wayne.

749
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:22,571
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute.

750
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:24,865
How come you don't look so good
in that suit?

751
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:27,993
Shut up. You're here to work.

752
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,453
- How's my mole?
- Fine.

753
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,871
Mr. Wayne, Mr. Wayne.

754
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:33,916
What about rumors of a Nygmatech
takeover of Wayne Enterprises?

755
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:37,294
Nygmatech's stock is outselling
Wayne Enterprises' 2-to-1.

756
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:41,048
- Are you yesterday's news, Bruce?
- Yes, yes, yes.

757
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:43,092
Bruce, old man.

758
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:48,722
The press were wondering what it feels like
to be outsold, outclassed, out-coiffed...

759
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:52,059
...and generally outdone in every way.

760
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:54,061
Hello, Edward. Congratulations.

761
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:57,189
Great party. Nice suit.

762
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:59,441
Wit. Good.

763
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:02,486
- And you are?
- Chase.

764
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:07,241
And what a grand pursuit you must be.

765
01:12:09,785 --> 01:12:11,245
I'm Bruce Wayne, Miss...?

766
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:12,955
Oh.

767
01:12:13,122 --> 01:12:16,208
You can call me anything you want.

768
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:21,255
Ladies and gentlemen, the future.

769
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:26,552
My new, improved Box offers
fully interactive holographic fantasies.

770
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:49,867
Edward, you're dashing and a genius.

771
01:12:50,034 --> 01:12:52,953
How do you create these images, hon?

772
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,873
That, my dear, is my little secret. Ta!

773
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:04,965
Fully interactive holographs.

774
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:08,802
Only a high-frequency carrier wave
beamed directly into the brain...

775
01:13:08,969 --> 01:13:10,596
...could create such images.

776
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:12,639
Yeah, and you wish you thought of it.

777
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:17,478
Yes, don't be a sore loser, Brucie.
Step inside. Give it a try.

778
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:21,899
Edward, if you can introduce images
into the mind...

779
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:26,153
...what prevents you from extracting images
out of the mind?

780
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:27,863
Oh...

781
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:31,325
Too timid to try my machine?
Just say so.

782
01:13:34,203 --> 01:13:35,496
Shall we dance?

783
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:58,852
Naughty, naughty.

784
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:00,854
Looking for something?

785
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:04,399
Well, I was just...
Just wondering how you turn it off.

786
01:14:06,527 --> 01:14:09,113
Ah. Clever.

787
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:12,574
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

788
01:14:41,228 --> 01:14:43,730
<i>Good evening, Mr. Wayne.</i>

789
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:46,650
<i>Relax.</i>

790
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:52,865
<i>Tell me your dreams.</i>

791
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:57,870
<i>Tell me your fantasies.</i>

792
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,747
<i>Tell me your secrets.</i>

793
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,710
<i>Tell me...</i>

794
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:11,675
<i>...your deepest, darkest fears.</i>

795
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:29,610
No, no, no.

796
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:42,456
Relax, folks.

797
01:15:42,623 --> 01:15:45,876
It's only an old-fashioned,
low-tech stickup.

798
01:15:46,043 --> 01:15:51,465
We're interested in the basics:
cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.

799
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:55,552
Hand them over nice and quietly
and no one will be hurt.

800
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:04,728
- Emergency, Alfred.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

801
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:09,650
Be calm, everybody. Just be calm.

802
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,318
Excuse me.

803
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:18,242
You're ruining my big party.
Are you insane?

804
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,953
We're sick of waiting for you
to deliver the Batman.

805
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,121
Patience, O Bifurcated One.

806
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:25,165
Patience, hell, we want him dead!

807
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:28,919
And nothing brings out the Batman
like a little murder and mayhem, baby.

808
01:16:29,086 --> 01:16:31,338
The least you could do
is let me in on the caper.

809
01:16:31,505 --> 01:16:35,467
We could have organized this, planned it,
pre-sold the movie rights.

810
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:42,849
Batman.

811
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:52,109
Your entrance was good, his was better.

812
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:03,537
The difference? Showmanship.

813
01:17:10,961 --> 01:17:12,546
Emergency, Alfred.

814
01:17:12,713 --> 01:17:16,341
Oh, sir. I could be fired for this, sir.

815
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:19,720
Perhaps they'll have me back
at Buckingham Palace.

816
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:35,444
- Ow!
- All right, boys! Phase 2!

817
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:38,655
Mmm!

818
01:17:38,822 --> 01:17:41,700
My place, midnight.

819
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:05,265
Ha! Ha-ha!

820
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:09,478
Ha-ha.

821
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:54,940
Nothing like a bad case of gas.
Ha-ha.

822
01:19:21,049 --> 01:19:22,509
Oh-ho.

823
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:30,767
Why can't you just die?

824
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:24,112
Hi.

825
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:34,998
- What did you think you were doing?
- You got a real gratitude problem, Bruce.

826
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:38,960
I need a name. Batboy? Nightwing?
I don't know, what do you think?

827
01:20:39,127 --> 01:20:40,545
What's a good sidekick name?

828
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:42,672
How about,
"Dick Grayson, college student"?

829
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:45,634
Screw you. I just saved your life.
You owe me.

830
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,678
You were out of control.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

831
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:50,722
- You're looking at your new partner.
- No.

832
01:20:50,889 --> 01:20:53,391
Bruce, whenever you go out at night,
I'll be watching.

833
01:20:53,558 --> 01:20:56,269
And wherever Batman goes,
I'm gonna be right beside him.

834
01:20:56,436 --> 01:20:58,939
I mean, how are you gonna stop me?

835
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:00,941
I can stop you.

836
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:07,239
Al, hang this next to the Batsuit.

837
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,407
Where it belongs.

838
01:21:13,495 --> 01:21:15,997
And you're encouraging him.

839
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:20,377
Young men with a mind for revenge
need little encouragement.

840
01:21:20,544 --> 01:21:22,796
They need guidance.

841
01:21:23,797 --> 01:21:28,635
You, above all, should know
the consequences of the life you choose.

842
01:21:35,642 --> 01:21:38,812
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.

843
01:21:39,271 --> 01:21:41,898
Perhaps the lady
is just what the doctor ordered.

844
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:44,985
She seems lovely and wise.

845
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:47,737
I've never been in love before, Alfred.

846
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,990
Go to her.

847
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,826
Tell her how you feel.

848
01:21:52,993 --> 01:21:55,453
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

849
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,664
Let the lady decide.

850
01:22:51,676 --> 01:22:53,219
I'm sorry.

851
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:55,847
I... I can't believe this.

852
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:59,809
I... I've imagined this moment
since I first saw you.

853
01:22:59,976 --> 01:23:03,313
Your... Your eyes.

854
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,649
Your lips.

855
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:08,568
Your body.

856
01:23:10,236 --> 01:23:13,031
And now I have you...

857
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:16,743
...and I'm wishing
you were somebody else.

858
01:23:22,082 --> 01:23:25,251
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.

859
01:23:26,795 --> 01:23:29,005
I've met someone.

860
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:31,091
He's...

861
01:23:33,134 --> 01:23:36,137
Well, he's... He's not you.

862
01:23:38,098 --> 01:23:40,767
I hope you can understand.

863
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,607
I understand.

864
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:53,738
Well.

865
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:17,929
That's just what I said.

866
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:21,474
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:

867
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:23,643
How to map the human mind.

868
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:27,981
Would you like to see what our old friend
Bruce Wayne has in his head?

869
01:24:30,692 --> 01:24:31,985
W-w-woo!

870
01:24:41,369 --> 01:24:43,663
Riddle me this.

871
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:47,834
What kind of a man
has bats on the brain?

872
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:54,257
- Go ahead. You can say it.
- You're a genius.

873
01:24:54,424 --> 01:24:55,800
Oh, stop.

874
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:01,848
So from this day on...

875
01:25:02,015 --> 01:25:04,267
...Batman is no more.

876
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,688
You can't just quit.
I mean, there's monsters out there.

877
01:25:08,855 --> 01:25:11,191
Batman has to protect the innocent.

878
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:15,195
I've dedicated my life
to helping strangers I've never met.

879
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:17,572
Faces I've never seen.

880
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:22,118
Well, the innocent aren't faceless
anymore.

881
01:25:22,744 --> 01:25:25,663
You can't tell me what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

882
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:28,875
Lookit, my dad told me
that every man goes his own way.

883
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:31,377
Well, my way goes to Two-Face.

884
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:33,546
You gotta help me.

885
01:25:33,755 --> 01:25:39,135
And if you do find Harvey
and then you kill him, what next?

886
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:44,307
Exactly.

887
01:25:44,474 --> 01:25:47,477
Then you'd be alone, like me.

888
01:25:49,729 --> 01:25:51,898
No, you've got to let this go.

889
01:25:52,065 --> 01:25:53,775
Listen to me, Dick. I'm your friend.

890
01:25:53,942 --> 01:25:56,736
I don't need a friend right now, all right?
I need a partner.

891
01:25:56,903 --> 01:25:58,947
Two-Face has gotta pay.

892
01:26:00,156 --> 01:26:01,699
Please.

893
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:07,497
Chase is coming over for dinner.
I'm going to tell her.

894
01:26:07,789 --> 01:26:09,499
Everything.

895
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:13,711
Come on upstairs. We'll talk.

896
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:31,104
- Good evening, Dr. Meridian.
- Good evening, Alfred.

897
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:34,732
- Happy Halloween.
- Heh. Happy Halloween to you.

898
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:10,476
Well, I asked you here tonight...

899
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:13,730
...because there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

900
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:17,066
I wanted to tell you something too.

901
01:27:17,317 --> 01:27:18,985
- What I wanted...
- It...

902
01:27:19,485 --> 01:27:22,614
- Go ahead, you go first.
- All right, okay.

903
01:27:26,284 --> 01:27:27,952
Trick or treat!

904
01:27:29,662 --> 01:27:32,498
All my life, I have been...

905
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:35,168
I've been attracted
to a certain kind of man.

906
01:27:35,335 --> 01:27:36,711
The wrong kind of man.

907
01:27:36,878 --> 01:27:40,131
And...
I mean, look what I do for a living, right?

908
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:47,722
And since... Since I met you, I...

909
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:50,475
Oh, God.

910
01:27:50,642 --> 01:27:52,810
Why am I so nervous? Oh!

911
01:28:00,318 --> 01:28:02,070
And don't eat too much tonight...

912
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:04,864
- ...or you'll be sick in your beds.
- Thank you, Alfred.

913
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:38,773
Happy Halloween.

914
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,076
Oh.

915
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:52,870
Bruce, what's wrong?

916
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:54,998
It's happening again.

917
01:28:55,164 --> 01:28:59,085
Flashes. My parents' death.

918
01:28:59,711 --> 01:29:02,463
Your memories are trying
to break through, don't fight them.

919
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:04,507
I want to tell you something.

920
01:29:04,674 --> 01:29:07,885
- Something I've never told anyone.
- It's all right.

921
01:29:08,052 --> 01:29:10,138
It's all right. I'm here.

922
01:29:16,269 --> 01:29:17,353
<i>I'm here.</i>

923
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,858
"That where there is wrong,
I may bring the spirit of forgiveness."

924
01:29:22,025 --> 01:29:24,736
<i>The night of my parents' wake...</i>

925
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:27,864
<i>...the priest's words gave no comfort.</i>

926
01:29:29,115 --> 01:29:31,034
<i>Of course.</i>

927
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:35,830
<i>There, on my father's desk, the red book.</i>

928
01:29:35,997 --> 01:29:39,959
<i>His journal.
He'd written in it every day of my life.</i>

929
01:29:40,918 --> 01:29:43,588
<i>But now he'd never write in it again.</i>

930
01:29:44,422 --> 01:29:48,134
<i>At that moment,
I knew my life would never be the same.</i>

931
01:29:55,016 --> 01:29:57,727
<i>I raced out into the storm...</i>

932
01:29:57,894 --> 01:30:01,522
<i>...trying to outrun the rage. The pain.</i>

933
01:30:02,273 --> 01:30:03,816
<i>And then I fell.</i>

934
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,653
<i>I fell forever.</i>

935
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,574
<i>The cave was monstrous.</i>

936
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:14,744
<i>It must have been there for centuries.</i>

937
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:20,833
<i>And there, deep in the shadows...</i>

938
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:23,878
<i>...I saw...</i>

939
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,341
<i>It was coming toward me.</i>

940
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:31,928
<i>I was scared at first, but only at first.</i>

941
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:36,432
<i>The figure in the dark was my destiny.</i>

942
01:30:37,183 --> 01:30:39,685
<i>It would change my life forever.</i>

943
01:30:41,521 --> 01:30:46,067
<i>I would use its image to strike terror
into the hearts of those who did evil.</i>

944
01:30:46,234 --> 01:30:50,738
<i>I would ensure what happened to me
would never happen to anyone else again.</i>

945
01:30:51,823 --> 01:30:53,658
<i>I would have my revenge.</i>

946
01:30:57,495 --> 01:31:00,039
Bruce, what are you trying to tell me?

947
01:31:00,957 --> 01:31:03,543
Chase, I... I'm...

948
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:40,246
Twick or tweet!

949
01:31:46,878 --> 01:31:48,004
Trick.

950
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:59,140
Remember the plan. Seize and capture.

951
01:31:59,307 --> 01:32:03,436
- No killing.
- That goes double for you.

952
01:32:05,438 --> 01:32:11,277
If I was a superhero, where would I hide?

953
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:12,570
Uh...

954
01:32:14,739 --> 01:32:17,700
Spank me.

955
01:32:29,462 --> 01:32:31,714
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

956
01:32:31,881 --> 01:32:34,884
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

957
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:37,220
"Intruder alert. Intruder alert."

958
01:32:37,386 --> 01:32:39,472
Shut up!

959
01:32:49,148 --> 01:32:53,110
Now, that's impressive.

960
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:12,964
You know, it's always risky
introducing a tamed animal into the wild.

961
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:30,398
They may have trouble adapting
to their new environment.

962
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:40,950
Aah!

963
01:33:41,117 --> 01:33:42,535
Hmm.

964
01:33:58,009 --> 01:33:59,552
Yah!

965
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:11,147
Somebody tell the fat lady
she's on in five.

966
01:34:29,415 --> 01:34:32,376
Joygasm!

967
01:34:53,272 --> 01:34:55,274
Get the girl!

968
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:05,284
No!

969
01:35:06,577 --> 01:35:09,288
Don't kill him.

970
01:35:10,206 --> 01:35:11,707
If you kill him...

971
01:35:20,591 --> 01:35:22,218
...he won't learn nothing.

972
01:35:30,768 --> 01:35:35,231
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

973
01:35:35,898 --> 01:35:38,984
Bruce! Bruce!

974
01:35:57,753 --> 01:35:59,672
Master Bruce.

975
01:36:02,675 --> 01:36:04,510
Master Bruce.

976
01:36:07,138 --> 01:36:09,348
How are you, young man?

977
01:36:10,349 --> 01:36:13,352
You haven't called me that
for a long time.

978
01:36:13,519 --> 01:36:16,063
Old habits die hard.

979
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:17,356
Are you all right?

980
01:36:18,524 --> 01:36:22,153
- Where's Chase?
- I'm afraid they've taken Dr. Meridian.

981
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:24,947
Master Dick has run away.

982
01:36:25,114 --> 01:36:26,991
The cave has been destroyed.

983
01:36:27,992 --> 01:36:30,870
And there's another riddle.

984
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:43,549
I'm coming, my sweet.

985
01:36:47,386 --> 01:36:48,888
Like the jacket?

986
01:36:49,263 --> 01:36:53,559
It keeps me safe
when I'm jogging at night.

987
01:36:54,101 --> 01:36:55,686
Batman will come for me.

988
01:36:56,979 --> 01:36:58,898
Batman?

989
01:36:59,482 --> 01:37:01,734
Batman, you say?

990
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:04,820
Coming for you? Hoo-hoo-hoo.

991
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,072
Brrrr! Brrrr!

992
01:37:07,239 --> 01:37:11,577
I'm counting on it!

993
01:37:15,748 --> 01:37:18,667
What is that? Where's that coming from?

994
01:37:19,752 --> 01:37:22,755
- There.
- Who the hell's doing that?

995
01:37:22,922 --> 01:37:24,840
The Riddler.

996
01:37:33,432 --> 01:37:34,600
In.

997
01:37:34,767 --> 01:37:38,229
A, E, I, O, U. Vowels.

998
01:37:38,395 --> 01:37:39,897
Not entirely unclever, sir.

999
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:42,650
But what do a clock, a match...

1000
01:37:42,816 --> 01:37:44,735
...chess pawns and vowels
have in common?

1001
01:37:44,902 --> 01:37:48,322
- What do these riddles mean?
- Every riddle has a number in the question...

1002
01:37:48,489 --> 01:37:53,369
...and they arrived in this order:
Thirteen, one, eight and five.

1003
01:37:53,536 --> 01:37:56,330
Thirteen, one, eight and five.

1004
01:37:56,497 --> 01:37:59,124
- What do they mean?
- Perhaps letters of the alphabet?

1005
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:01,877
Of course, 13 is M.

1006
01:38:02,044 --> 01:38:05,130
One would be A, eight would be H
and five would be E.

1007
01:38:05,297 --> 01:38:08,008
M-A-H-E.

1008
01:38:08,175 --> 01:38:11,345
Perhaps one and eight are 18.

1009
01:38:11,512 --> 01:38:13,722
Eighteen is R.

1010
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:16,433
M-R-E.

1011
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:20,145
How about Mr. E?

1012
01:38:20,312 --> 01:38:22,565
- Mystery.
- And another name for mystery?

1013
01:38:22,731 --> 01:38:23,774
Enigma.

1014
01:38:24,441 --> 01:38:27,945
Mr. E. Nygma. Edward Nygma.

1015
01:38:28,487 --> 01:38:32,366
Stickley's suicide was obviously
a computer-generated forgery.

1016
01:38:32,533 --> 01:38:36,245
You really are quite bright,
despite what people say.

1017
01:38:36,745 --> 01:38:38,622
Are all the Batsuits destroyed, Alfred?

1018
01:38:38,789 --> 01:38:41,834
All except the prototype
with the sonar modifications you invented.

1019
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:44,461
But you haven't tested it yet.

1020
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,672
Tonight's a good night.

1021
01:38:58,392 --> 01:39:00,853
What do you suggest, Alfred? By sea...

1022
01:39:02,438 --> 01:39:04,189
...or by air?

1023
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:10,029
Why not both?

1024
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:20,372
Who's your tailor?

1025
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:22,875
I took the liberty, sir.

1026
01:39:25,544 --> 01:39:28,672
"R"? What's that stand for?

1027
01:39:30,341 --> 01:39:31,383
Robin.

1028
01:39:32,968 --> 01:39:35,638
Riddler and Two-Face
can make a pretty lethal combination.

1029
01:39:35,804 --> 01:39:37,556
I figured you could use a hand.

1030
01:39:37,723 --> 01:39:39,642
Two against two are better odds.

1031
01:39:40,392 --> 01:39:42,895
I can't promise I won't kill Harvey.

1032
01:39:43,312 --> 01:39:45,731
A man's gotta go his own way.

1033
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:47,566
A friend taught me that.

1034
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,444
Not just a friend.

1035
01:39:52,529 --> 01:39:53,906
A partner.

1036
01:40:27,106 --> 01:40:31,235
He's not coming. Shut it down.

1037
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,789
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1038
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:52,756
Go, go.

1039
01:40:55,634 --> 01:40:58,137
Go, go.

1040
01:41:22,327 --> 01:41:23,662
A-14.

1041
01:41:28,834 --> 01:41:29,835
Hit.

1042
01:41:30,002 --> 01:41:32,838
- Sweet.
- B-12.

1043
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:39,261
Hit.
And my favorite vitamin, I might add.

1044
01:41:41,847 --> 01:41:43,056
Oh.

1045
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:53,192
- Oh, that sinking feeling.
- I like this game.

1046
01:41:53,358 --> 01:41:54,735
C-9.

1047
01:42:03,786 --> 01:42:05,204
Aah!

1048
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:08,207
You sunk my battleship.

1049
01:42:08,373 --> 01:42:10,209
- Who, me? Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha!

1050
01:42:34,233 --> 01:42:35,609
This is your captain speaking.

1051
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:40,072
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.

1052
01:42:45,744 --> 01:42:47,329
Aah!

1053
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:49,206
I got him.

1054
01:42:56,004 --> 01:42:58,715
I hope they can find the little black box.

1055
01:43:43,802 --> 01:43:45,679
Now...

1056
01:43:47,097 --> 01:43:51,685
...the real game begins.

1057
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:59,359
- Holy rusted metal, Batman.
- Huh?

1058
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:04,656
The ground, it's all metal.
It's full of holes, you know? Holey.

1059
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:05,949
Oh.

1060
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,413
Robin, wait.

1061
01:44:13,457 --> 01:44:15,626
The whole island's moving.

1062
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:03,465
Looking for us?

1063
01:45:03,632 --> 01:45:05,884
Ha-ha. Wah!

1064
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:09,763
That was for my mother!

1065
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:12,099
My father!

1066
01:45:14,142 --> 01:45:15,310
My brother!

1067
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:18,230
And this is for me.

1068
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:52,055
Finally, justice is served.

1069
01:45:53,432 --> 01:45:55,183
Let us die.

1070
01:46:03,358 --> 01:46:06,445
You're a man after our own heart, son.

1071
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:08,780
I'll see you in hell.

1072
01:46:14,494 --> 01:46:16,288
I'd rather see you in jail.

1073
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:23,086
Oh, good boy.

1074
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,005
The Bat has taught you very well.

1075
01:46:25,172 --> 01:46:30,135
Noble. Stupid, but noble.

1076
01:47:14,346 --> 01:47:18,141
Riddle me this, riddle me that.

1077
01:47:18,308 --> 01:47:21,686
Who's afraid of the big black bat?

1078
01:47:21,853 --> 01:47:23,355
No more tricks, Edward.

1079
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:26,024
Very well, then.

1080
01:47:30,487 --> 01:47:32,197
Let's get real.

1081
01:47:32,364 --> 01:47:34,699
Release Chase.
This is between you and me.

1082
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:38,036
And me. And me!

1083
01:47:40,664 --> 01:47:45,460
You've been sucking Gotham's brain waves.
Now you've devised a way to read minds.

1084
01:47:47,629 --> 01:47:49,047
You betcha.

1085
01:47:49,214 --> 01:47:53,885
Soon my little Box will be
on countless TVs around the world...

1086
01:47:54,052 --> 01:47:58,640
...feeding me credit-card numbers,
bank codes...

1087
01:47:58,807 --> 01:48:03,228
...sexual fantasies and little white lies.

1088
01:48:03,395 --> 01:48:05,564
Into my head they'll go.

1089
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:08,275
Victory is inevitable.

1090
01:48:08,483 --> 01:48:11,069
For if knowledge is power...

1091
01:48:11,778 --> 01:48:15,532
...then a God am...

1092
01:48:15,699 --> 01:48:17,701
...I.

1093
01:48:23,456 --> 01:48:26,293
Was that over the top? I can never tell.

1094
01:48:29,629 --> 01:48:33,175
By the way, I've seen your mind, freak.

1095
01:48:33,341 --> 01:48:35,260
Yours is the greatest riddle of all.

1096
01:48:35,427 --> 01:48:39,222
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman
ever truly coexist?

1097
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:41,433
We'll find out today.

1098
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:46,438
But first, let's meet our contestants.

1099
01:48:46,605 --> 01:48:50,859
Behind Curtain Number 1...

1100
01:48:54,154 --> 01:48:58,033
...the absolutely fabulous
Dr. Chase Meridian.

1101
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,452
She enjoys hiking,
getting her nails done...

1102
01:49:00,619 --> 01:49:04,206
...and foolishly hopes to be
the love of Bruce's life.

1103
01:49:05,290 --> 01:49:08,084
- Ha!
- Ha.

1104
01:49:08,293 --> 01:49:10,795
And behind Curtain Number 2...

1105
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:17,510
...Fatman's one and only partner.

1106
01:49:17,677 --> 01:49:19,012
This acrobat turned orphan...

1107
01:49:19,179 --> 01:49:23,350
...likes Saturday morning cartoons
and dreams of one day being...

1108
01:49:23,516 --> 01:49:26,102
...bare naked with a girl.

1109
01:49:29,481 --> 01:49:33,944
And below these contestants,
my personal favorite:

1110
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:37,948
A watery grave.

1111
01:49:38,114 --> 01:49:41,868
Just one little touch
and five seconds later...

1112
01:49:42,035 --> 01:49:45,830
...these two day-players
are gull feed on the rocks below.

1113
01:49:46,581 --> 01:49:47,916
Ha!

1114
01:49:48,333 --> 01:49:50,919
Not enough time to save them both.

1115
01:49:51,086 --> 01:49:53,588
Whooo-ooo-ooo.

1116
01:49:54,965 --> 01:49:57,133
Which one will it be, Batman?

1117
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:58,677
Bruce's love?

1118
01:49:58,843 --> 01:50:01,972
Or the Dark Knight's junior partner?

1119
01:50:04,683 --> 01:50:08,186
There is no way for me to save them
or myself.

1120
01:50:08,353 --> 01:50:11,022
This is all one giant deathtrap.

1121
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:13,066
Judges? Eh!

1122
01:50:13,233 --> 01:50:16,319
I'm sorry. Your answer must be
in the form of a question.

1123
01:50:16,486 --> 01:50:19,030
- But thank you for playing.
- Wait.

1124
01:50:20,699 --> 01:50:23,910
- I have a riddle for you.
- For me?

1125
01:50:25,203 --> 01:50:27,414
Really?

1126
01:50:29,582 --> 01:50:31,334
Tell me.

1127
01:50:34,546 --> 01:50:35,964
I see without seeing.

1128
01:50:36,798 --> 01:50:40,051
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.

1129
01:50:41,553 --> 01:50:42,595
What am I?

1130
01:50:44,222 --> 01:50:48,685
Please. You're as blind as a bat.

1131
01:50:48,852 --> 01:50:49,978
Exactly.

1132
01:51:27,182 --> 01:51:29,059
Bummer.

1133
01:52:31,913 --> 01:52:32,956
Hah.

1134
01:52:33,123 --> 01:52:34,499
Thanks.

1135
01:52:48,304 --> 01:52:50,098
All those heroics for nothing.

1136
01:52:50,265 --> 01:52:53,017
No more riddles,
no more Curtains 1 and 2.

1137
01:52:53,184 --> 01:52:54,978
Just plain curtains.

1138
01:52:57,063 --> 01:52:59,190
Aren't you forgetting something, Harvey?

1139
01:52:59,357 --> 01:53:00,483
Your coin.

1140
01:53:02,318 --> 01:53:05,196
You're always of two minds
about everything.

1141
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:07,740
Yes, of course. You're right, Bruce.

1142
01:53:08,074 --> 01:53:10,034
Emotion's always the enemy
of true justice.

1143
01:53:10,201 --> 01:53:13,288
Thank you.
You've always been a good friend.

1144
01:53:59,751 --> 01:54:01,753
Why?

1145
01:54:02,128 --> 01:54:07,342
Why can't I kill you?

1146
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:12,514
Too many questions. Too many questions.

1147
01:54:13,264 --> 01:54:15,016
Poor Edward.

1148
01:54:15,308 --> 01:54:17,519
I had to save them both.

1149
01:54:17,769 --> 01:54:20,897
You see,
I'm both Bruce Wayne and Batman.

1150
01:54:21,272 --> 01:54:23,233
Not because I have to be.

1151
01:54:23,399 --> 01:54:27,445
Now, because I choose to be.

1152
01:54:50,468 --> 01:54:54,847
Thank you for responding to my
request for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.

1153
01:54:55,014 --> 01:54:57,976
Edward Nygma has been screaming
for hours...

1154
01:54:58,142 --> 01:55:02,939
...that he knows the true identity
of Batman.

1155
01:55:15,952 --> 01:55:17,495
Edward?

1156
01:55:17,662 --> 01:55:22,000
Who is it?

1157
01:55:23,751 --> 01:55:26,504
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase.

1158
01:55:27,463 --> 01:55:29,424
Do you remember me?

1159
01:55:31,009 --> 01:55:33,344
How could I forget?

1160
01:55:34,512 --> 01:55:37,181
Dr. Burton tells me...

1161
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:40,101
...you know who Batman is.

1162
01:55:40,268 --> 01:55:43,855
I can't tell you if you don't say, "Please."

1163
01:55:44,897 --> 01:55:49,861
Edward, please. Who is Batman?

1164
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:54,073
I'm Batman.

1165
01:56:20,266 --> 01:56:21,976
Your secret is safe.

1166
01:56:22,143 --> 01:56:24,729
He is definitely a wacko.

1167
01:56:25,647 --> 01:56:28,232
Wacko. Is that a technical term?

1168
01:56:29,609 --> 01:56:30,860
Listen.

1169
01:56:34,113 --> 01:56:36,658
I won't be needing this anymore.

1170
01:56:39,744 --> 01:56:43,122
Thank you for giving me a new dream.

1171
01:56:59,222 --> 01:57:01,391
Don't work too late.
