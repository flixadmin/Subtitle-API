We have orders to guard the prisoner.

Well, in that case,
as Hand of the Queen,

195
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,407
I outrank whomever gave your order.

196

Did you consider taking it off?

199
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,372
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."

200

You're going back to her,
to die with her.

201

You've underestimated her before.

202
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,376
She's going to die.

203
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,714
Unless you can convince her
to change her course of action.

(EXHALES SHARPLY)

When have I ever been able
to convince Cersei of anything?

207
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,566
Try.

208
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,570
If not for yourself, if not for her,

209

then for every one
of the million people in that city,

innocent or otherwise.

211
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,531
To be honest,
I never really cared much for them.

212
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,328
Innocent or otherwise.

213
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,665
You do care for one innocent.

214
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,160
I know you do.

215
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,745
And so does Cersei.

216
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,998
She has a reason now.

217
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,087
The child is the reason
she'll never give an inch.

218
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,928
All the worst things she's ever done,
she's done for her children.

219
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,767
It's not impossible that she'll win.

220
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,186
She won't.

221
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,606
Her enemy's forces have been depleted,
as she said they would be.

222
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,309
Two of the three dragons are dead.

223
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,565
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.

224
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,612
She has the Lannister army,
the Golden Company...

225
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,531
I defended the city
last time it was attacked.

226
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,985
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.

227
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,195
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow,
if not before.

228
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,405
Why?

229
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,746
Escape.

230
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,832
The two of you, together.

231
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,633
Remember where we met,

232
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,006
where they keep the dragon skulls,
beneath the Red Keep?

233
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,055
Take her down there.

234
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,179
Keep following the stairways down,
down as far as they'll go.

235
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,602
You'll come out onto a beach
at the foot of the keep.

236
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,099
A dinghy will be waiting for you.

237
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,311
Sail out of the bay.

238
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,064
If the winds are kind,
you'll make it to Pentos.

239

Start a new life.

240
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,787
Sail right past the Iron Fleet
and into a new life?

241
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,081
Sounds a lot less likely
than Cersei winning this war.

242
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,625
There won't be an Iron Fleet
for much longer.

243
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,415
Do it.

244
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:28,294
If you don't,
you'll never see Cersei again.

245
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,597
Swear to me.

246
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,889
You have my word.

247
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,517
If it works,

248
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,400
give the order to ring all the bells
in King's Landing and open the gates.

249
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,426
That will be our signal
that the city has surrendered.

250
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,450
I'll try.

251
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,404
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.

252

Remember, ring the bells
and open the gates.

Your queen will execute you for this.

If Daenerys can make it to the throne

255

without wading through
a river of blood,

256
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,250
maybe she'll show mercy
to the person who made that possible.
