I'm not the person that I used to be.

they are going to help us find William.

{\an8}Laurel Lance?

158
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,829
{\an8}I'm so sorry that
you're going through this, Samantha.

159
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,331
{\an8}We will help you get William back.

160
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,085
{\an8}Look, Laurel, it was one time.

161
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,549
{\an8}And, I knew that you and Oliver
were together,

162
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,343
{\an8}but I was young and stupid and selfish.

163
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,013
{\an8}And I should have been honest with you.

164
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,015
No, Oliver should have been.

165
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,519
Come on.

166
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,941
Does CCPD have anything?

167
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,776
No. It was a clean grab.

{\an8}(SIGHS) Do we have any other angles
we can work? Other than Malcolm.

169
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,199
Finding William isn't the problem.
Beating Damien Darhk is.

170
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,910
Every time we've faced him,
we have been beaten. Thoroughly.

171
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,745
It's because
we can't go against his magic.

172
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,372
We just need to fight harder,
we need to fight smarter...

Animated encounter last year
and we've stayed in touch ever since.

How are you going to help me find my son?

211
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,799
With magic.

212
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,968
Magic?

213
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,386
Yeah. It's a long story

214
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,514
but the short version is that
this totem gives me the ability

215
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,642
to channel the ashe
or the spirit of any animal.

216

Do you have anything
of William's with you?

Yes, I do. Just this. It's his favorite.

Don't you dare tell Barry about this.

He's in the city. I think I can find him.

He said her name was Felicity.

and I wouldn't let him.

Mari, this is not on you.

don't know about Darhk's power.

361
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,163
We don't... We don't even know
what the source of it is.

362
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,209
Wait. I get my powers from this necklace.

363

has had some sort of a totem like mine.

367

What if Darhk has an object
that helps him with his magic?

00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,097
I think he does.

369
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,476
I walked in on him once or twice
in front of this cabinet thing.

370
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,480
And inside, there's some kind of,
I don't know, idol.

-Can you draw it for me?
-Well, yeah, I'll give it a whirl.

it was because no one else

for you to be a part of his life.

I should've made more of an effort
to be a part of William's life.

would've been to keep him close.

It's not Darhk. It's Mari.
She has something.

420
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,950
I emailed Captain Lance's
drawing of Darhk's idol

421
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,660
to a friend of mine at Detroit University.

422
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,953
THEA: And did he recognize it?

423
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,831
It's a khushu idol.
Very rare. Very powerful.

424
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,999
But its power requires
a constant connection

425
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,459
to one of the Earth's ley lines.

426
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,003
I never thought I'd say this but, huh?

427
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,924
Okay. Think Wi-Fi for magic.

428
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:53,384
And the idol is his Internet connection.

429
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,888
If Professor Macalester's theory
is correct, and this map is accurate...

430
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,683
Then Darhk must be holed up
near one of these ley lines,

431
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,309
in order for him to
get the strongest signal.

432
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:04,104
I'll start cross-referencing all the
locations that we've encountered Darhk...

433
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,232
You pulled out of the race.
Why isn't this man giving me my son back?

434
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,067
He will, and everything will be fine.

435
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,152
You keep saying that
but it hasn't been yet.

436
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,499
You're doing everything you possibly can.

437
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,377
You can't beat yourself up about it.

438
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,462
Well, you don't know me very well, do you?

439
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:37,428
Just before Christmas, Darhk took Thea,
Felicity, John, held them captive.

440
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,099
We agreed that I would
trade myself for them.

441
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:47,563
I did and Darhk didn't live up
to his end of the bargain.

442
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,108
So you're worried
that's playing itself out again now?

443
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,987
We're going to get William back, Oliver.

444
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,197
But when we do,

445
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,700
I think you should consider

446
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,455
that maybe letting him go
isn't such a bad thing.

447
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:06,958
What do you mean?

448
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,796
Well, I heard what you told Felicity.
About keeping him close.

449
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:13,548
Owl ears.

450
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,967
Uh, I never knew my real parents.

451
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,469
I grew up in a foster home

452
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,640
and my whole life I wondered, who am I?

453
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,770
Where did I come from?
Why didn't my real parents want me?

454
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,855
A boy should know who his father is.

455
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,399
He should. And he will.

456
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,736
But knowing what William
is going through right now,

457
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,822
I realize that I wasn't ready
for the answers.

458
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:39,991
Learning about my heritage, my powers,

Hey, guys, I think we've found something.

468
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:19,280
Darhk moves his idol around,
which makes sense but...

469
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,907
-It makes him a whole lot harder to track.
-Right.

located out in a compound in Sky Woods.

Darhk says he's going to release William
three hours from now at Nelson Plaza.

There is no guarantee with Darhk.
This could be a trap.

And now we have a chance to
take out his power idol thingy.

Ollie, without his magic,

479

he won't be able to do this to anybody
ever again. It will be game over.

for all the frustrations I have
about my real parents giving me up,

how to be strong.

I turned you from a delicate, spoiled brat
into a warrior.

And now I'm going to tell you why.

I'm the Green Arrow.
And my life is very dangerous.

Which is why

that was my fault,

and I can't allow anything like that
to happen ever again.

About a number of things, I suspect.

615
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,874
Let's start with...

616
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:43,464
I can't do this.

617
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,050
When your son was in danger,

618
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,429
I had to table what I was feeling
about everything.

619
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,347
But now that I've had some space,

620
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:55,225
I realize I need space.

621
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,769
Felicity.

622
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,313
I know the position Samantha put you in.

623
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,732
I know it was an impossible decision.

624
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,069
But you were right,
you should have told me.

625
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,323
Marriage is about inclusion.

626
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,994
It's about leaning on your partner

627
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,622
when things get complicated.

628
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,961
I don't think that you know
how to do that.

629
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,717
I'm trying.

630
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,513
And now you're sending William away
and I understand why.

631
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:37,267
You know that I do, but once again,
you have left me out of the decision.

632
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,022
Felicity?

633
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,452
-Oh, my God...
-Oh, my God.
