Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that...

00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:52,261
We've been here since midday.

10
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:04,374
Easterners have a difference
sense of time, I've often found.

11
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:08,411
Once I was waiting for Salladhor
Saan here in Braavos.

Welcome to the Iron Bank.

00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:46,315
Please, sit.

17
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:11,407
What can we do for
you, Lord Stannis?

18
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,409
This is Stannis of
the House Baratheon,

19
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,678
<i>King of the Andals
and the First Men,</i>

20
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,648
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

21
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,854
<i>The Iron Throne is
currently occupied</i>

22
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,756
by Tommen of the
House Baratheon,

23
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,291
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

24
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:31,227
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

25
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:33,930
He shares no blood with me.

26
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:37,366
He is a bastard born of incest.

27
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,435
<i>As was his brother before him.</i>

28
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,238
Yes, we have heard this story.

29
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,907
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

30
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,277
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

31
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:50,713
A story about a jealous uncle

32
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,949
whose attempts to usurp the
throne from the rightful king

33
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:57,920
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

34
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,655
Gold you loaned him.

35
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,893
And you feel your blood gives
you a claim on our gold?

36
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:06,562
More than any man living.

37
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,499
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

38
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,668
with words like
"usurper" and "madman"

39
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:15,204
and "blood right."

40
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:18,374
Here, our books are
filled with numbers.

41
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:20,610
We prefer the stories they tell.

42
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:22,545
More plain.

43
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:26,015
Less open to interpretation.

44
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:31,154
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

45
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:32,555
4,000.

46
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,557
<i>And how many ships do you have?</i>

47
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,826
<i>The ones still
afloat, Ser Davos,</i>

48
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:39,328
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

49
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,732
32.

50
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:44,500
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

51
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,869
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

52
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:51,674
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

53
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,678
None.

54
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,548
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up

55
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:01,717
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

56
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,488
<i>I'm afraid we must respectfully</i>

57
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:08,591
<i>decline your request.</i>

58
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,727
<i>But we thank you for paying
us the honor of your visit.</i>

59
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:21,938
My lord.

60
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,674
I'm not a lord, Ser
Davos Seaworth.

61
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,843
You would not be either here.

62
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,778
In Braavos,

63
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:32,048
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

64
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,616
Well, strictly speaking, I
didn't do the thieving.

65
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,218
That would be the pirates.

66
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:38,654
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

67
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:42,191
This is the payment
that was demanded

68
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,526
by King Stannis for my crimes.

69
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,962
I consider it an
honest accounting.

70
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,464
He's an honest man and
he's your best chance

71
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:50,933
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

72
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:53,736
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

73
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,104
The war is over.

74
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,607
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

75
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,609
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

76
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,777
- Ser Davos...
- Humor me.

77
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:05,414
- <i>Tywin Lannister.</i>
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

78
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:06,186
67.

79
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:08,382
67. And when he dies,
who's in command?

80
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,987
A half-grown boy,

81
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,289
<i>the product of incest?</i>

82
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:16,125
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

83
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,828
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

84
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:20,963
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

85
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:24,634
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

86
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:27,303
That is a problem
for another time.

87
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:29,572
Begging your pardon, I think
it's a problem for now.

88
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:33,743
There's only one reliable
leader left in Westeros.

89
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:35,578
Stannis.

90
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:37,480
He's got the birthright.

91
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,649
He's in his prime.

92
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:41,384
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

93
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,653
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

94
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:45,021
he does it.

97
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:56,032
"Bring me my red shirt."

98
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:59,035
The first mate brings the red
shirt and the captain puts it on.

The crew is shivering

But the courageous
captain hollers,

"Captain, why do you call for
your red shirt before battle?"

The captain replies,

109
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:27,863
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

110

The next morning the

see its traditions eradicated.

307
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:19,454
And what traditions
do you speak of?

308
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:21,489
<i>The tradition of funeral rite.</i>

309
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:23,825
Proper burial in the
Temple of the Graces.

310
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,396
My father and 162
noble Meereenese

311
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:30,765
are still nailed to those posts,

312
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,969
carrion for vultures,
rotting in the sun.

313
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,047
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

314
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:48,283
so that they might
receive proper burials.

315
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:52,487
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

316
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:54,990
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

317
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:58,693
<i>Would you have begged me for
their right to a proper burial?</i>

318
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,429
Your Grace, I cannot def end
the actions of the masters.

319
00:24:01,497 --> 00:24:05,400
I can only speak to you as a
son who loved his father.

320
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,669
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

321
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:10,572
<i>Let me have him
brought to the temple</i>

322
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:12,107
and buried with dignity

323
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,509
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

324
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,416
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

325
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:28,423
Thank you, my queen.

326
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,403
How many more?

327
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:44,706
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

328
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:47,542
212?

329
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:57,519
Send the next one in.

330
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:02,157
These meetings aren't always going
to be this early, are they?

331
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:05,293
I was up late last night.

332
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:09,331
So, does this mean I am a
master of something now?

333
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:11,232
Coins, ships?

334
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,501
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

335
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:16,771
that I shall be the Master
of Ships long before you...

336
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,778
Lord Tywin, it's a great honor

337
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,247
to have been granted a
seat on this council. I...

339

for affairs of state.

340
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,987
Shall we begin?

in the Riverlands, my lord.

343
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:38,226
A coward and a traitor.

344
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,530
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

345
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:45,266
I believe the phrase "fuck
the king" was uttered.

346
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,068
Disgraceful.

348

luck with the Hound?

349
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:53,842
10 silver stags seems
a generous bounty.

350
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:56,711
Make it 100. What else?

351
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:59,314
More whispers from
the east, my lord.

352
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:00,882
The Targaryen girl?

353
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:03,718
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

354
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:07,355
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

355
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,957
Conquered with what?

356
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,925
<font color="#804040">VARYS</font>: <i>She commands an army
of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

357
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,961
Some 8,000 strong.

358
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:15,296
She has a company
of sellswords...

359
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:16,698
the Second Sons.

360
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:19,134
<i>She has two knights
advising her...</i>

361
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:22,437
Jorah Mormont and
Barristan Selmy.

362
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:24,506
And she has three dragons.

363
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,940
Baby dragons.

364
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,109
Larger every year, Your Grace.

365
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:31,613
Mormont is spying on her for us.

366
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,616
No longer. He appears to
be fully devoted to her.

367
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,652
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

368
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:40,321
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

369
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:42,157
a bit harder than anticipated.

370
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,092
He's an old man.

371
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:46,027
He wasn't fit to protect my son.

372
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,096
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

373
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,433
Dismissing him was as
insulting as it was stupid.

374
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:54,569
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

375
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:58,173
A child with two seasoned
warriors counseling her

376
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:01,443
and a powerful army at
her back, Your Grace.

377
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,511
Lord Varys is right.

378
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:06,047
I have been to Essos and seen
the Unsullied firsthand.

379
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,584
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

380
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:11,352
Less so in the bedroom.

381
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:14,155
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

382
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,724
Armies win them all the time.

383
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,993
She must be dealt with.

384
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,062
How, my lord?

385
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,430
By force?

386
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:24,499
Eventually, if it comes to that.

387
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:29,604
Can your little birds find
their way into Meereen?

388
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,639
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

389
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:34,609
Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man.

Only Varys. I'm not
actually a nobleman.

395
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,675
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

396
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,544
And yet everyone does.

397
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:14,516
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

398
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,484
Did you spend much
time in Essos?

399
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:19,187
Five years.

400
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:20,822
May I ask why?

401
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:23,691
'Tis a big and beautiful world.

402
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:26,394
Most of us live and die

403
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:28,129
in the same corner
where we were born

404
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,065
and never get to see any of it.

405
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,701
I don't want to be most of us.

406
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,737

<i>I have an ear for accents.</i>

410
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:48,216
I've lost my accent entirely.

00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,751
I have an ear for that as well.

412
00:28:51,654 --> 00:28:53,821
<i>How did you get here?</i>

413
00:28:53,856 --> 00:28:55,456
It's a long story.

414
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:58,459
One you don't like
telling people.

415
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:01,095
People I trust.

416
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,199
My paramour Ellaria, she would
find you very interesting.

417
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:06,534
You should come to the
brothel and meet her.

418
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:09,604
We brought our own wine, not
the swill they serve here.

419
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:12,807
We have some lovely boys
on retainer, but...

420
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:18,079
You did like boys before?

421
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:22,050
Really?

422
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,952
Girls? Hmm.

423
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:26,654
I hope you won't be offended when
I say I never would have guessed.

424
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:28,122
Not at all.

425
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,992
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

426
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:33,428

- <i>Nothing.</i>

00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:38,066
<i>Not me.</i>

429
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,301
When I see what desire
does to people,

430
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:42,270
what it's done to this country,

431
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:45,139
I am very glad to
have no part in it.

<i>Besides, the absence of desire</i>
