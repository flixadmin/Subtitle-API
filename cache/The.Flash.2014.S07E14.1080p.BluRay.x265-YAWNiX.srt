1
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,763
Please... Please, don't...

2
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:17,602
Don't do this.

3
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:42,998
The Indian Ocean?

4
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:45,922
Yeah, there's this
great island there.

5
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,092
Super secluded, and it's been
pretty quiet here recently,

6
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,761
so I'm zooping Iris away
for a little vacation.

7
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:53,680
Actually, it was Chester's idea,
you remember?

8
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,222
Can't forget.

9
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,768
Hey, Chester!

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,810
Iris! Wait...

11
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:03,481
Wait, if you're down here
and he's down here, then...

12
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,066
- No.
- Oh, my!

13
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,402
As much as I'd like to.

14
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:13,533
Cell phone reception's,
uh, nonexistent,

15
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,535
so we're going to be
off the grid for a while.

16
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,454
It should be nice
just to focus on each other

17
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:19,998
while we're trying to...

18
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,331
Um...

19
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,752
What I mean, Iris and I,
what we're trying to...

20
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,716
- Trying to reconnect, right?
- Reconnect. Yeah.

21
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:29,299
I mean, you know,
'cause lately, if one of you

22
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:31,151
- isn't stuck in the Mirrorverse...
- The Mirrorverse.

23
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,220
...then the other is stuck
in some psycho-masked hellscape.

24
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:35,464
- Yeah.
- Am I right?

25
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:39,559
- Okay, cool. Have fun.
- Okay.

26
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:40,768
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:45,857
So, Frost, with boss man
and boss lady away,

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,983
need us to do anything?

29
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,527
Nope. No baddies
means we can take the day.

30
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,862
I think we all need some R&R.

31
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,822
Oh, to start off this R&R,

32
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,408
why don't you guys join me
in a little bit of <i>D&D?</i>

33
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:57,535
Frost, if you're free,

34
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,997
I could use a chaotic good
ice sorcerer to help me slay

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,416
the Bog Beast of Balladok.

36
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,502
I'm gonna have to take a pass.

37
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,708
- I've got a personal errand to run.
- Need any help?

38
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:10,590
Nope.

39
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:14,385
I'm going... shopping.

40
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,389
Have fun storming the castle.

41
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,518
What say thee, fair maiden?
Care to join me in an epic quest?

42
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:26,396
Oh, sorry.

43
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:30,027
I got a hot news tip. Gotta follow up.
But I'll catch up with you later.

44
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,153
Yeah, yeah. Nice, nice, nice.

45
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:35,239
News never sleeps. News never sleeps.

46
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:46,125
<i>I was off base
on R&R, eating at a caf√©,</i>

47
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,337
<i>and I saw Major Kramer in another booth,</i>

48
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,963
<i>arguing with this guy.</i>

49
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,049
<i>- About?
- I don't know.</i>

50
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:57,720
<i>But I heard him say, "Stick to the plan
and it'll all be over tomorrow."</i>

51
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,972
<i>It didn't sound like
it was anything good.</i>

52
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:05,061
Now, that was a soldier
who served at Fort Dakota

53
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,146
at the same time
that Kramer was stationed there.

54
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,458
Did they recognize the person
that Kramer was arguing with?

55
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:12,318
A soldier named Adam Creyke.

56
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:15,238
This is the same man who led her troops

57
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,699
into an ambush six years ago
that got them killed.

58
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:22,078
Now, Kramer never logged going off base
the night of this conversation,

59
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:25,039
which means this was a secret meeting.

60
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:29,085
Hold on. Are you telling me
that Kramer knew about the ambush,

61
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,528
and maybe she even helped plan it?

62
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:31,712
I don't know.

63
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,590
They never caught the bomber
and this evidence looks bad,

64
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:39,637
but my gut says
that something still doesn't add up.

65
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:40,721
I mean, look, Cecile.

66
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:45,184
I've looked Kramer in the eye.
I've watched her work.

67
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:46,936
Uh, we've had our differences,

68
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,900
but... I still feel
she's a good cop.

69
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,778
Joe, she's not just a cop anymore.

70
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:57,447
She's the head of the C.C.P.D. now.

71
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,657
Well, I might not have a badge anymore,

72
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:04,036
but I'm gonna find out the truth
about Kristen Kramer once and for all.

73
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,292
Thanks, man.

74
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,711
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,255
I see you found someone
to play your dungeon game thing.

76
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:20,803
Oh, seriously?

77
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,681
I walked all the way here
and nobody told me,

78
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:26,392
including Marco,
who I literally just talked to.

79
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:29,937
Well, maybe if you let me
rejoin the campaign, I'd have your back,

80
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,856
like I did in the Battle of Mo'Zoq.

81
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:38,404
Using fire spells in unarmed combat
is strictly prohibited, Marco.

82
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:41,073
You're not a new...
He knows the consequences.

83
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,283
Anyway.

84
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,119
I got your text. What's up?

85
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,830
So, you know that message I got earlier?

86
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:48,830
Mmm-hmm.

87
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:52,251
I have been using <i>The Citizen</i> tip line,
but not for work.

88
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,672
I just got an anonymous tip
that's gonna help me find my cousin.

89
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,135
As in, Ultraviolet?

90
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,179
As in the Black Hole meta-assassin

91
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,348
that tries to kill you
every time she sees you?

92
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:08,351
Her name's Esperanza,
and I get how it sounds.

93
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,687
Look, she's been taking out targets.

94
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,233
First here in Metropolis,
then in Opal City.

95
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,527
I think her next assassination
is in Central City.

96
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:20,863
Chuck, if Team Flash
can get a jump on this...

97
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,491
- Flash isn't around.
- Exactly.

98
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,909
What would Barry do?

99
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,370
He'd find her and get her to stand down.

100
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,247
I have to do the same.

101
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,792
Esperanza blames me for abandoning her.

102
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:34,836
I have to make that right.

103
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:40,091
'Cause if I can get through to her,
maybe we can be a family again.

104
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,206
Listen to me. I don't wanna fight.

105
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,006
Wait.

106
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,722
Stop.

107
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:30,003
I won't let you hurt my friends.

108
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,061
Fine.

109
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:43,085
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

110
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,896
Figures
you're a part of this.

111
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:20,691
Well, I can't expect you to fail
on your missions all on your own.

112
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,402
Except for that one time in Belize.

113
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,695
That was hilarious.

114
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,384
Are you freaking nuts?

115
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,804
I have seen Ultraviolet
melt the face off of someone

116
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,430
and laugh while doing it.

117
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:54,642
What made you think
going after her alone was a good idea?

118
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,937
Chuck and I were gonna bring
in the team, but Esperanza surprised us.

119
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,690
Side note,
prayer hands emoji for the save.

120
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,623
But how did you know we were in trouble?

121
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,276
It's one of the reasons I stuck around.

122
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,571
I heard chatter
about an ex-Black Hole assassin nearby.

123
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,115
Good thing I went hunting.

124
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,702
Speaking of, where are the big guns?

125
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,621
Frost is radio silent
and Barry and Iris are off the grid.

126
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,375
So, for the rest of today,
this is Team Flash.

127
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,172
Well, that's reassuring.

128
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:27,258
I don't suppose

129
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,011
you've learned how to melt
someone's face off with your powers yet?

130
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,017
No. Okay, great.

131
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,912
Well, it's a good thing
just his wrist got hurt,

132
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,456
because we don't have nearly
enough muscle to handle this mission.

133
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,065
But I can still save Esperanza.

134
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,151
You want to save her?

135
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,570
Yeah. You know,
like Barry does with the bad guys.

136
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,532
I mean, not so much save her,
but redeem her, I guess.

137
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:56,871
Listen, I don't think
we can take on Ultraviolet by ourselves,

138
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,748
let alone change her overnight.

139
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:00,832
Uh...

140
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,377
I don't think we have a choice.

141
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,338
Look, Allegra said that Ultraviolet
is here to kill somebody.

142
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,233
That means there's a life in danger.

143
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,134
Isn't saving people Team Flash 101?

144
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,058
Chester's right. We need to stop her.

145
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,733
Fine.

146
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:29,445
But family or not, she will try
to kill you if she gets the chance.

147
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,122
That's every location

148
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:42,458
Ultraviolet's been spotted
in in the last 48 hours,

149
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,835
but so far,
no luck on her current location.

150
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,128
What about the satellites?

151
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:48,172
Well, her energy signature's
based off of light,

152
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,466
which is like, everywhere at all times,

153
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,844
so it's almost impossible to hone in
on her specific light signature.

154
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,666
This is where she's going.

155
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:58,140
It's a typical Black Hole recon pattern.

156
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:01,852
Scope out the surrounding areas
while closing in on your target.

157
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,522
This is a downtown free clinic.

158
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,234
- Why go there to try to kill someone?
- I don't know.

159
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,277
But the bigger question is,
how do we stop her?

160
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:12,238
With this.

161
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,782
It's a photonic stun grenade.

162
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,493
Procuring it required
two trips to New Delhi,

163
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:21,038
a helicopter crash
and a very deadly <i>quincea√±era.</i>

164
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,250
I'm gonna go make sure
this is fully charged.

165
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,053
I'll be back in ten,
we'll discuss the plan.

166
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:27,085
Be ready to go.

167
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,172
Yeah!

168
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,342
Time to put my badass face on.

169
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,802
Right. Yeah?

170
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,346
No?

171
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,057
Chuck, maybe
you better sit this one out.

172
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,266
Whoa!

173
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,685
What? I wanna help.

174
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,771
I know, but you're a pacifist,
and that's cool.

175
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,773
But this is gonna be too dangerous.

176
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,000
We'll be back before you know it, okay?

177
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,839
Stay away from me.

178
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,508
Not until you're dead.

179
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,181
Run.

180
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,402
Tell whoever hired you
the assassination is canceled.

181
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,155
You fools. I wasn't hired.

182
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,242
I'm hunting the doctor that created me.

183
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,829
You just saved the man
that turned me into a monster.

184
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,093
That doctor.

185
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,304
Did he really used
to work for Black Hole?

186
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,603
Talk to us or talk to C.C.P.D.
The choice is yours.

187
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,189
Although I hear their cells
are much less comfortable.

188
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,821
Do you know
how I got this little gift?

189
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,493
I remember seeing
white light everywhere.

190
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,246
Blinding me while I was held down.

191
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,206
I was helpless.

192
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,335
Then I felt a scalpel slice into me.

193
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,547
I fought back, but I was tied down.

194
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,800
All I could do was scream...

195
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,512
until they cut my voice out of me.

196
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,098
I'm so sorry.

197
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,059
- I didn't know.
- Where's Dr. Olsen?

198
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:48,893
We...

199
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,272
don't know.

200
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,274
He must pay.

201
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,484
He is still out there.

202
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,946
Turning new lab rats into weapons
for the highest bidder.

203
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,533
Abducting victims who won't be missed
when they disappear.

204
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:03,741
Like me.

205
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:06,203
I never meant for this to happen.

206
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:09,206
- I swear.
- You abandoned me, cousin.

207
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,875
Left me alone for Dr. Olsen to find.

208
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,932
We'll help you get him. I promise.

209
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:29,642
Ah...

210
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,979
Sidebar, please.

211
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,481
You want to join her now?

212
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,693
This Olsen guy needs to be stopped
before he hurts anyone else.

213
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,446
And Esperanza's the only one
who's had any luck tracking him down.

214
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,740
Okay. We cannot trust her.

215
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,784
Black Hole has twisted her mind
in ways that you can't even imagine.

216
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,188
There's no coming back from that.

217
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,663
- You can't be sure.
- Yes, I can.

218
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,458
Working with her is a suicide mission.

219
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,459
You need to know that.

220
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,259
I know what Barry would do.

221
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,307
I say we go after this doctor together.

222
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,401
You in, <i>prima?</i>

223
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:38,878
Come in.

224
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,592
Well, this is a surprise.

225
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,806
We need to talk, Captain.

226
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,181
Interim Captain.

227
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,394
And since you're no longer a cop,
what exactly do we have to discuss?

228
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:07,116
Where did you get this?

229
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,616
That's not important.

230
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,870
What matters is, I could have gone
to Chief Singh with it,

231
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,274
but I chose to come to you first,

232
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,668
because deep down, I believe you are
doing your best to be a good cop.

233
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,712
Which means I should listen
to your side of the story.

234
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,055
- Get out.
- Excuse me?

235
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,808
I take your job, now you take me down?

236
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:36,019
So you dig up some crap you can twist
for your personal vendetta?

237
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,354
- I...
- Enough.

238
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,023
You try a stunt like this again...

239
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,235
and I will arrest you myself.

240
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,822
For your own good, move on, West.

241
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,826
Find a new hobby
and get the hell out of my office.

242
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,974
Now, generate
a single blast

243
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,476
that destroys your target.

244
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,060
And focus.

245
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,905
If we're going to face
Dr. Olsen together,

246
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,364
you need to learn how to fight.

247
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,492
Try harder.

248
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,591
I'm doing the best I can.

249
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,902
It's not good enough.

250
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:50,552
You still think
you can change her?

251
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:58,101
She's got this crazy idea
that you're not a total lost cause.

252
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,687
Noble, but dumb.

253
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:02,927
Just stay out of this.

254
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,858
You think you know your cousin?

255
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,152
I know the real Ultraviolet.

256
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,154
Let me show you.

257
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,090
Yo, yo, yo,
who's ready for a snack attack?

258
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,303
Chuck!

259
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,185
He's still breathing.

260
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:41,851
You could have killed him!

261
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,856
So? He's useless.

262
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,149
As are you.

263
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,485
I'll finish this on my own.

264
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,152
You don't know how lucky you were.

265
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,590
One foot to the right and you would have
a giant hole charred in your chest.

266
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,883
Roger that.

267
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,471
But, hey, I'm good.

268
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,766
Yeah, no. It probably just
looks worse than it is.

269
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,603
Hey, no. The Runk Man's
ready for action...

270
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:25,063
No, no, no.
The Runk Man needs to stay here.

271
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,500
I'll get you some
naproxen for the pain.

272
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:28,524
Doctor's orders.

273
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,198
Chuck, this is all my fault.

274
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,659
No, no. It's not that bad.

275
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,787
Where's your cousin?
Did she really leave?

276
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,582
Yup. And good riddance.

277
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,502
Shouldn't we go after her?

278
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,259
I don't know.

279
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,474
Runk! She is still not
thinking straight.

280
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,726
You've gotta help me
talk some sense into her.

281
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:06,271
- Why me?
- She likes you. She'll listen.

282
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:10,233
I mean, yeah, we're friends and all,

283
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,320
but I really don't think
I can change her mind.

284
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,403
Not on this.

285
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,532
Okay, fine. Then I will do it myself.

286
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:20,994
She's got to realize that
sharing a back alley yin-yang tattoo

287
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,372
with someone doesn't mean
you're bonded forever.

288
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,751
Yin-yang tattoo?

289
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,756
Great Rao...

290
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,386
Arrest you?

291
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,554
Are you sure Kramer's serious?

292
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,682
You should've seen her, Cecile.

293
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,767
It was like how a guilty person reacts.

294
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,913
So she really did have something to do

295
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,855
with getting her own troops killed.
My God!

296
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:52,651
If this is true, I have to go
straight to the governor's office.

297
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,236
It's that big.

298
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,488
Babe, C.C.P.D. was like my second home.

299
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:00,200
I trained most of the officers there.
They're like my family.

300
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,744
Now I can't help but wonder
who did I leave my kids with?

301
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:04,871
That's not on you.

302
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,666
I put my badge down,
Kramer picked it up. It's all on me.

303
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:12,795
It's Kramer.

304
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,672
She wants to meet up.

305
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,550
Joe, no.
She might be baiting you into a trap.

306
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,176
- You can't go.
- I know.

307
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,347
But, babe, I can't help but feel
there's something more to this.

308
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,348
What am I supposed to do?

309
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,278
You are a good man, Joe West.

310
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,531
You forget everything
that's in that folder.

311
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,826
Your heart's always been
your best compass, right?

312
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,703
So trust it.

313
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,415
Trust your heart.
It'll show you what's right.

314
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,224
It was a good try.

315
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:11,772
But Ultraviolet is never going
to change.

316
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,817
You need to give up before you get
yourself or someone else killed.

317
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,403
I can't just abandon her.
She's my family.

318
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:19,571
Yeah, I get that.

319
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,031
No, you don't.

320
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,534
You grew up in some mansion
with two loving parents,

321
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,497
but for most of my life,
it was just Esperanza and me.

322
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,916
She's more than just my cousin.

323
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,835
She's the reason I survived
long enough to be here.

324
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:35,962
I have to save her.

325
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,050
Some people are too far gone to save.

326
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,093
Even if they're your family.

327
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:43,887
How can you say that?

328
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,531
You fought Black Hole
to save your parents.

329
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,057
That is not the same thing.

330
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,140
Why not?

331
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,519
Why is your family good enough
to save but mine isn't?

332
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,437
Because I didn't save them.

333
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:59,319
By the time I got my parents
out of Black Hole, it was way too late.

334
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,657
The people that raised me were gone.

335
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:14,209
Carver put my parents in charge
of all international accounts.

336
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,877
He gave them 10%

337
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,130
as long as they kept
all of Black Hole's overseas assets

338
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,424
hidden from the US government.

339
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:27,430
Carver bought my parents' loyalty
for billions.

340
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,352
And once they got a taste,
they needed more.

341
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,731
What happened once Carver was gone?

342
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,235
My parents were in too deep.

343
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,572
And worse,
they got used to this lifestyle.

344
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:50,161
And no matter how hard I tried,
I could not pull them out.

345
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,625
Because they didn't want out.

346
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:01,590
Which is why you have to pull
with everything you have.

347
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:07,971
When I first met Team Flash,
it was in handcuffs.

348
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,974
When they first met you,
you were robbing a bank.

349
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,851
We didn't want help, either.

350
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,478
But this team never gave up on us.

351
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,319
So thanks for the reminder.

352
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,239
You want to bail, I understand.

353
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,409
But I'm gonna go find my cousin.

354
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,588
- What the...
- Your tattoo!

355
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,634
It's a yin-yang symbol.

356
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,885
Two sides that make a whole.

357
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,595
Opposite, but the same.

358
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,640
Okay, sorry, look.

359
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,016
I know how to track Ultraviolet.

360
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,561
We couldn't track Ultraviolet's
unique light signature

361
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:59,814
because there's too much interference
from other light sources in the city.

362
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,150
But you and Ultraviolet
have the same powers.

363
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,653
So if we use you as an input signal,

364
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,863
satellites will search
for its counterpart signal.

365
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:11,201
Aka the yin to your yang... Ultraviolet.

366
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,706
Just focus your energies here.

367
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,668
Get your shine on.

368
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,853
- It worked.
- What?

369
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,063
- We found her.
- What?

370
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,692
- Oh, my arm.
- Sorry.

371
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,944
It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay.

372
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,115
Looks like she's in a run-down warehouse
that's wired for tons of shady tech.

373
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,741
It's got to be Olsen's hideout.

374
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,505
- Okay, we better hurry. Come on.
- No, no.

375
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,620
I almost got you killed once already.

376
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,747
Esperanza's my problem.
I need to do this alone.

377
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,958
Look, I know I can't do the fighting
like you guys,

378
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,268
but I can still help my friends.

379
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,460
You've done more than enough.

380
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,004
- I can't risk...
- Allegra...

381
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,215
I'm not taking no for an answer,
not again.

382
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,621
My favorite patient.

383
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,165
Ha!

384
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,461
You surprised me earlier.

385
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,383
So happy to return the favor.

386
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,389
Dr. Olsen.

387
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:58,349
Ready to die?

388
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,642
That depends.

389
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:09,778
Are you ready...
for one last experiment?

390
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,545
Okay, Allegra, I'm set.

391
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:32,550
Operation "Find your cuz
and convince her to come home" is a go.

392
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,344
Okay.

393
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:38,014
I'm reading her light signature
in a level below you.

394
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,905
Getting to her is gonna be
the tricky part.

395
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,435
I've got company.

396
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,079
Oh, I got just the thing
for those electro-pulse rifles.

397
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,025
Hold on to your volts.

398
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,158
<i>That is one EMP,
courtesy of...</i>

399
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,120
Chester P.

400
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:01,537
Okay.

401
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:03,331
I'm heading down there.

402
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,456
Uh, wait, hold on.

403
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,339
Those guys got backup.

404
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,092
Uh...

405
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,780
Another EMP would be great
right about now.

406
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,807
<i>The mobile unit doesn't have
enough juice for another pulse.</i>

407
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,863
Go find your cousin. I got this.

408
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,877
Don't worry, boys. I'll go slowly.

409
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,361
Esperanza.

410
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:17,822
You need to come with me now.

411
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,883
We don't have time for any...

412
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,668
She isn't the one
who's run out of time, my dear.

413
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:32,336
What did you do to her?

414
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:36,174
I made her into a weapon...
without a voice.

415
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,388
And these hands are the only ones
that can return what was taken.

416
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,891
So, we made a deal.

417
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,727
I'll give your cousin her voice back...

418
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:52,857
if she kills everyone who knows
the true nature of my work.

419
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:56,986
You and your team.

420
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,585
Sue, Allegra needs backup.

421
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,463
Yeah, I know the feeling.

422
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,357
Lights out, boys.

423
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,543
He's lying to you, <i>prima</i>. Listen to me.

424
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,503
I'm your family. We're blood.

425
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,880
Blood is a liquid easily spilled.

426
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:02,760
Power is eternal...
and money provides it.

427
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,596
So now that Joseph Carver is dead,

428
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,348
I work for the highest bidder,

429
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,518
and I don't plan on
going out of business anytime soon.

430
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:17,608
End her, and get your voice back.

431
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,703
Please... Please, don't...

432
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:30,829
Don't do this.

433
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,356
Fighting back is useless, child.

434
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:57,924
You'll never be stronger than her.

435
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,070
Hate fuels your light power.

436
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,239
Not for me.

437
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,220
Yes!

438
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,126
You okay?

439
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:02,796
We're good.

440
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,939
Is she gonna be okay?

441
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,941
She'll be fine.
She's just resting.

442
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:26,028
And if anyone can recover from a massive
dose of light-based energy, it's her.

443
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,574
About the whole supernova thing
I did back there...

444
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,201
- is that gonna happen again?
- Maybe.

445
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,037
It's common for meta-powers
to reach new heights

446
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,539
during times of extreme stress.

447
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,833
You just leveled up, Allegra.

448
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,379
You did well out there, you know.

449
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,214
Not sure the boss would agree.

450
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,217
I organized a rogue mission
while Barry was gone.

451
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,637
I almost got Sue and Chuck killed.

452
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:52,930
But you followed your heart.

453
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,932
And that's what Barry would have done.

454
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,852
And Dr. Olsen's in jail now, too.

455
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:00,354
And...

456
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:02,397
there's this.

457
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:16,661
Hey.

458
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:21,542
So, uh, Caitlin ran some tests.

459
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:23,461
She says you're gonna be okay.

460
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:27,256
Sorry I had to... You know.

461
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:32,136
How did you... do that?

462
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,221
I don't know.

463
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,350
Dr. Olsen said our powers
are fueled by hate, but...

464
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,424
I thought about something else.

465
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:42,062
Family.

466
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,610
After everything I've done...

467
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,862
you still call me that?

468
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:51,655
Always.

469
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:56,744
What they did to you
isn't who you are, Esperanza.

470
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,373
You're more than that. You know that.

471
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:02,917
And I do, too.

472
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,087
There's something else.

473
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:09,215
We recovered these from Dr. Olsen.

474
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,051
They're the files on what he did to you.

475
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,805
Point is,
Caitlin thinks she can use them.

476
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,308
To do what?

477
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,395
Cure you... permanently.

478
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:34,991
Thanks for meeting me so late.

479
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,620
After how I behaved,
I wasn't sure you would.

480
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,872
I'm sure you had a reason.

481
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:48,212
Like... probably the same reason
you had me meet here.

482
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:55,303
Well, figured I did enough damage
to C.C.P.D. morale for one day.

483
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:57,847
Look, West.

484
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:02,226
Earlier today, I was... unprofessional.

485
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,960
And you were right to be suspicious.

486
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:08,524
I mean, all the evidence looks that way.

487
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,321
But that's not the whole story, is it?

488
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,836
The soldier
who betrayed your unit.

489
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,239
His name is Adam Creyke.

490
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,215
He's also my brother.

491
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,718
Not by blood.

492
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,346
But some bonds run deeper.

493
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,811
As two Native kids
growing up off the rez,

494
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:48,522
we weren't exactly popular
in our community.

495
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,652
But we were still a part of it, so...

496
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,196
we kept in touch in our own way.

497
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:58,908
But that's how Adam and I bonded.

498
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,289
We didn't have a lot of support...

499
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,084
but at least we had each other.

500
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:17,259
Anyway, you were right about us arguing
the night before about the mission.

501
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,263
But I didn't know
that he had sold out our unit.

502
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,893
Adam was trying to convince me
not to go on the mission.

503
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:28,562
Said he had a bad feeling about it.

504
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:30,397
Mmm.

505
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:31,858
He was trying to protect you,

506
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,610
and you blame yourself
for not realizing.

507
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,573
I was in charge of those lives.

508
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,376
It was my job
to get them home to their families.

509
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:54,797
A dozen dinner tables
have empty chairs right now

510
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,133
because I didn't see the clues.

511
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,595
I was too blind and stupid.

512
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:12,273
Believing in somebody you love
is nothing to be ashamed of.

513
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:18,403
Take it.

514
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,702
Maybe someday you'll trust
someone enough to share it.

515
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,624
Why do you think I asked you here?

516
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:43,537
I've been looking for Adam
for six years on my own.

517
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,183
Help me catch him.

518
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:55,523
All right.

519
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:08,579
So where are you headed
to next? Some exotic locale?

520
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:11,248
Actually, I'm thinking about
sticking around.

521
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,835
Maybe even talking to my parents.

522
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,005
Yeah.

523
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:22,051
I guess you could say
I'm finally seeing the light.

524
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,639
Ciao for now.

525
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:35,898
Well, I guess we officially survived
our unsurvivable mission.

526
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,441
Barely.

527
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:39,235
Thanks for having my back, Chuck.

528
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,198
I literally couldn't have
done this without you.

529
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,489
It was nothing.

530
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,407
But we do make a pretty good team.

531
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:50,830
Hey, do you want to get
a coffee or something?

532
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:52,540
- Anywhere but Jitters.
- Yeah.

533
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:57,336
I'd love to, but I kind of set up
a <i>D&D</i> game for tonight.

534
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,963
So, another time?

535
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:00,422
Sure.

536
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,800
Or maybe I could join you.

537
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,887
For real? Like, you'd like to...

538
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:08,221
Uh-huh.

539
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:09,890
- With me?
- Yeah.

540
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:13,018
- Is that a problem?
- No, no, no.

541
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:14,478
It's amazing.

542
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:18,524
Just unexpected.
But in a great way, I mean.

543
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,860
It's... Am I making this weird?

544
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:23,571
Yeah. No. I don't know.

545
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:25,489
- It's just a game.
- Exactly.

546
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,991
Yeah, with coffee.

547
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,703
- Whole lot of coffee.
- Yeah. Lead the way.

548
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,497
Hey!

549
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,499
- Oh-ho! Looking refreshed, man.
- Thanks.

550
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,042
Yeah. How was your trip?

551
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,544
Amazing. It was great.

552
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:39,670
Iris and I...

553
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Uh.

554
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:46,635
Iris and I are thinking about getting
a time share, actually.

555
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:49,305
What happened today?

556
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:54,726
Erm...

557
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,519
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

558
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,650
Oh!

559
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:24,589
Snowflake.

560
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:27,384
It's great to see you.

561
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,261
Of course,

562
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:32,056
while I love a show of force
as much as the next guy...

563
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,391
I gave you my cell.

564
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:37,787
You do know there's a difference between
reaching out and, like, punching, right?

565
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:38,938
Shut up.

566
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:41,901
When Norvok told me you broke out
of Iron Heights, I couldn't believe it.

567
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,902
And yet, here we are.

568
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:48,322
Come on. I'm taking you back... again.

569
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:49,614
Mmm-mmm.

570
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:51,450
Looks like somebody
hasn't heard the news.

571
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,040
Ta-da! I cut a deal.

572
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,416
My record is expunged.

573
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,876
Now I'm just like you.

574
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,087
One of the good guys.

575
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:11,111
