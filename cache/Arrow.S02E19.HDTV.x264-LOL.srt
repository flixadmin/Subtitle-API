1
00:00:00,656 --> 00:00:02,607
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,365 --> 00:00:05,732
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:08,877
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:11,213
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:15,184
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:19,972
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:22,941
I must be something else.

8
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:25,644
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:27,780
There's a new player
we've been tracking.

10
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:31,066
We've been calling
him...Deathstroke.

11
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:33,736
I have
a proposal for you men.

12
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:35,821
Roy was injected
with the serum.

13
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:38,457
He's alive. But we are going
to have to keep an eye on him.

14
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:39,356
Stay away from Thea.

15
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:40,794
No.

16
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:42,444
She's not safe when
she's around you.

17
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:44,213
You love her,
and that's why

18
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:45,964
you're going to do
what I'm asking.

19
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:48,751
How could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?!

20
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:50,469
I believed in you.

21
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:52,454
As of 30 minutes ago,

22
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:54,056
your company
belongs to me.

23
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:56,392
Slade. You're working for him.

24
00:00:56,394 --> 00:01:00,095
I know Oliver Queen
is the Arrow.

25
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:11,573
I don't think
my eye holes line up properly.

26
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:13,358
Is anyone else
having this problem?

27
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,859
Don't be nervous.
I'm a lot nervous.

28
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:17,444
This is a big move,
even for us.

29
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:19,279
And we've cornered
the market on big moves.

30
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:20,931
Slade didn't
give us any choice.

31
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,033
Yeah, as far as plans go,
this is not a good one.

32
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:24,952
Felicity.
This was your plan.

33
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:26,620
I didn't think
you'd actually say yes.

34
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:28,622
We're here.

35
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,006
Ughhh!

36
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:48,625
Aahh! Ohh!

37
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:51,428
Hey! That man
used to work for me.

38
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,597
And how he works
for our enemy.

39
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,799
Security cameras
are down.

40
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,467
You all remember
the skeleton key?

41

Courtesy of William Tockman,
aka the Clock King.

42
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:03,156
It can open any lock.
Including this one.

43
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:10,981
This is where we met Barry.

44
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,657
These are plug n' play.

45
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:22,325
Fasten them to what
we talked about.

46
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:23,961
Let the C4 do the rest.

47
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:26,496
Been a while
since I've blown anything up.

48
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:27,881
Quick and clean.

49
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:38,609
I'm a bomber.
I can't believe I'm a bomber.

50
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:40,978
I wonder if I can list that
on my résume under special skills.

51
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,146
Freeze!

52
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:50,520
We have to go.

53
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,696
Thermal shows
everybody's out.

54
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:10,206
It's just a building,
Oliver.

Cowards.

00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,907
Who else would
needlessly destroy

59
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,526
cutting edge, scientific
and medical technology

60
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:31,028
whose sole purpose

61
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,729
is to make
Starling City

62
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:34,865
a healthier
and safer place?

63
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,200
As CEO of Queen
Consolidated,

64
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:39,235
I have a message
to the terrorist

65
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:41,705
who committed this
unspeakable act.

66
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:45,509
You will be caught,
and punished.

67
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:47,127
For the record,
I hated her

68
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,212
before we found
out she was a super villain.

69
00:03:49,214 --> 00:03:51,264
Ok. Slade's goal
is to create an army

70
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:53,550
of human weapons
using the Mirakuru.

71
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:56,136
To do that, he needs
an industrial centrifuge.

72
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:58,605
Which having Isabel Rochev steal
Queen Consolidated

73
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,924
from your family
gave him full access to.

74
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:02,448
But since Applied Sciences
went kaboom,

75
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:03,978
he can't use our technology--

76
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:07,097
well, formerly our
for his warped science experiments.

77
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,949
Slade has had us
on our heels for weeks.

78
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:10,784
It's about time we took
the fight to him.

79
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:13,370
All this will do
is set him back.

80
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:17,290
We have no way of knowing
where the next attack is coming from.

81
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:42,393
Look, you need
to drop this, ok?

82
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,985
I'm fine. Really.

83
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:45,635
How is any
of this fine?

84
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:48,488
Look, you need
to concentrate on you.

85
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,090
Now listen, are you going
to your meetings?

86
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:52,192
Yes. It's where
I talk about

87
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:53,994
how my father's
facing prison.

88
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,946
Laurel...

89
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:58,532
This will all
blow over, ok? Please.

90
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:00,917
No. It won't, Dad.

91
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,587
You were caught
aiding and abetting the Vigilante.

92
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:06,123
Working with him last year cost
you your detective shield.

93
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,341
Now, it can cost you
18 months in prison.

94
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:11,428
They want his name.

95
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,931
Do you know
who the Arrow is?

96
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,718
I don't.

97
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,804
I swear.

98
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:22,439
Ok, well, what about
the woman in black?

99
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:23,974
The one the Arrow
works with?

100
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:27,144
Do you know
who she is?

101
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:29,112
No.

102
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:30,814
Well, you must
have some idea.

103
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:32,515
Honey, I can't tell you
what I don't know.

104
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:34,985
Time's up.

105
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:38,805
You girls, you take
care of each other.

106
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,712
Do you really think he doesn't
know who the Arrow is?

107
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:48,531
It's not like
dad to lie.

108
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:54,755
Sometimes it's people closest
to us who lie to us best.

109
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,215
Where is Thea?

110
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:07,300
She should be here
for this, too.

111
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:08,735
I doubt she's coming.

112
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:10,320
Well, I can't lie
to either of you--

113
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:11,282
it's bad.

114
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:13,845
If Isabel Rochev is one thing,
it's thorough.

115
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,286
She's been laying the foundation
for this takeover for months.

116
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:18,829
But we still own a majority of stock
in the company, correct?

117
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,385
Yes, but Isabel has diluted

118
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,735
that stock to the point
where it's worthless.

119
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:25,418
On paper,
you're virtually broke.

120
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,421
And what's the good news?

121
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:29,856
We can protect
your assets.

122
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,274
We need to move
everything

123
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:32,843
into a new trust
that Isabel can't touch.

124
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:34,961
All I need is the beneficiaries
from the current trust

125
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:37,214
to approve the transfer.

126
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:39,716
The two of you and Thea.

127
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:42,269
Thea needs to sign off.

128
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,104
Yes. And quickly.

129
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,225
Thank you, Ned.

130
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:54,114
Well, now I have
to become mayor.

131
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:55,816
It seems I'll need
the income.

132
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:57,484
Losing the company
wasn't your fault.

133
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:58,869
It was mine.

134
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,704
I let Isabel Rochev
get the better of me.

135
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:03,440
No. You always see
the good in people,

136
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:04,407
even if they don't
deserve it.

137
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:06,109
I know that better
than most.

138
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:08,411
Isabel is
a vindictive woman.

139
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:09,946
She would have done this
with or without your trust.

140
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:11,581
How do you know?

141
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:15,085
You told me months ago
I couldn't trust her.

142
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:20,073
Your father
had a weakness

143
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:23,093
for beautiful,
strong women.

144
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,299
They were together?

145
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,484
Yes.

146
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:36,306
She was still in business school
at the time.

147
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:40,744
The pretty intern
that caught the CEO's eye.

148
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:46,149
All right.

149
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:50,003
You take this to Thea,
and you convince her,

150
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:54,007
somehow,
to help us fight back.

151
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,339
Hey. Will you help me up?

152
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:11,007
Yeah.

153
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:14,811
Just to my trunk.

154
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:17,314
Ok.

155
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,048
Ohh, look who's up.

156
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,883
Just in time
for all the fun.

157
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:40,220
What are you going
to do to him?

158
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:42,672
Make him scream.

159
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:44,991
Just like he made us.

160
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:46,309
Hmm?

161
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:49,262
They say living well
is best revenge? Ha.

162
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:51,765
I prefer torture.

163
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,216
You want first turn?

164
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:55,018
- No.
- Please.

165
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,903
I can help you.

166
00:08:56,905 --> 00:09:00,023
No, doctor.
I can help you.

167
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,375
What was it you said
you needed for research?

168
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,227
An eye?

169
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:05,578
No!

170
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,664
Let me get you a fresh one.

171
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,416
You can still
stop Slade Wilson!

172
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:12,118
Anatoly. Wait.

173
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,404
What did you say?

174
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:15,905
I can help you
stop him.

175
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:18,825
How? That miracle drug

176
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:21,428
of yours has turned him
into monster.

177
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,414
I know. I can
turn him back.

178
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,715
Ivo, what are you saying?!

179
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:27,917
The Mirakuru.

180
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,970
There's a cure.

181
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,595
Hey.

182
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:40,981
Hey,

183
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,265
is Thea here?

184
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,817
No, I haven't
seen her.

185
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,568
How's your dad?

186
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,620
He's willing
to go to jail for the Arrow.

187
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,456
I know you said
you weren't worried,

188
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,810
but Dig and I went
to Roy's apartment.

189
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:51,442
It's empty.

190
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:53,410
Seems like he cleared out
a few days ago.

191
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:54,961
Where the hell did he go?

192
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:58,281
Roy will have to wait.

193
00:09:58,283 --> 00:09:59,489
All right, we need to deal
with Slade,

194
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:01,514
figure out what his next move is.

195
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:07,424
I know Slade.

196
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:10,260
He is not going
to stop till...

197
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:22,689
Aah!

198
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:38,705
Hello, Sara.

199
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,826
Diggle, stay back!

200
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:04,314
Aaah!

201
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,821
Don't forget who taught
you how to fight, kid.

202
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,118
Excuse me, I'm looking
for my sister, Sara Lance.

203
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:41,455
Excuse me.

204
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:43,147
I'm Laurel Lance.
Is my sister ok?

205
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:45,446
Oh, she'll be fine.
Just a hairline fracture of her wrist.

206
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:46,788
We set it.

207
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,549
She's got some nasty
bruises; Looks worse than it is.

208
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:51,345
Thank you.
Nothing compared

209
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,547
to her previous
injuries.

210
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:56,050
Previous...Injuries?

211
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,619
Yes, your sister has
extensive scar tissue

212
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,154
over her entire body.

213
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:01,856
The last person I saw
with that much damage

214
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:03,925
was a veteran
injured in Iraq.

215
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:06,194
Has your sister
served in the military?

216
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:08,429
No.

217
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:12,083
No, she hasn't.

218
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:21,408
Sara.

219
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,427
Hey.
What happened to you?

220
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:25,546
Oh, I'm fine.

221
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,265
Ollie and I just had a little
motorcycle mishap.

222
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:28,599
It was nothing.

223
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,218
I already got
my discharge papers.

224
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,270
But your back...

225
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:34,705
Those scars,
where did you get them?

226
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:36,290
You ok?

227
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,643
I will be. You?

228
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:41,863
Yeah. Hi.

229
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:44,732
Hi. So tell me
what happened.

230
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:47,268
Motorcycle accident.
It was stupid.

231
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,954
We were making a left turn,
this car ran a red light.

232
00:12:49,956 --> 00:12:51,989
Did you file
a police report?

233
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:53,875
We didn't see the point.
We're both fine.

234
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:55,493
That's--
that's what counts, right?

235
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:57,245
Right.

236
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:58,963
I should really go.

237
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:00,414
I have a deposition
in an hour.

238
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,883
Ok.

239
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:04,335
Thanks for
checking up on me.

240
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:06,971
Always.

241
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:17,965
I know Oliver Queen
is the Arrow.

242
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:38,786
Hey.

243
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:42,323
We missed you
yesterday.

244
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:45,209
The meeting
with Ned Foster.

245
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:51,165
Thea, I know that you're mad
at mom and me,

246
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,351
but we may have found a way out
of this financial mess

247
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:56,137
where we aren't
going to lose everything.

248
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:59,023
Mom and I both
signed, we just...

249
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:00,841
We need
your signature,

250
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:04,145
and hopefully we
can stop Isabel from ruining us.

251
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:07,531
After you let her
ruin us, you mean?

252
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:09,900
Yeah.

253
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:14,355
It says Thea Queen here.

254
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:15,706
Who's she?

255
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,742
That's you, Speedy.

256
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:19,410
No, it's not.

257
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:21,996
Robert Queen
wasn't my father.

258
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:23,497
Malcolm Merlyn was.

259
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,216
Thea Merlyn.

260
00:14:25,218 --> 00:14:27,218
Kind of has
a nice ring to it.

261
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,054
Merlyn was your biological
father, but Dad raised you.

262
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:32,173
Only because
he didn't know I wasn't his.

263
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,391
Hey, hey!

264
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:37,011
He...He loved you.

265
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:40,064
So do I, and I am
still your brother.

266
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,850
No, you're not.
You're my half brother.

267
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:45,102
And you know who else
was my half brother?

268
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:46,320
Tommy.

269
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:49,991
Tommy,
who I tried to kiss.

270
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:52,994
I tried to kiss
my half brother--

271
00:14:52,996 --> 00:14:55,729
before my real
father killed him!

272
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:58,199
That's how
screwed up I am!

273
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:59,950
And you know
the sad part,

274
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:02,569
I was actually starting to be
in a good place.

275
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,170
I had the club,
I had Roy,

276
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:09,223
I had a brother who
wasn't lying to me.

277
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:11,476
And for the first time
in my crazy life,

278
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:15,847
everything didn't seem so completely
and totally messed up.

279
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:20,384
I thought I was
going to be ok.

280
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,603
I'm so stupid.

281
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:23,905
You're not stupid.

282
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:26,858
No, what I am...
Is the daughter

283
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,910
of two mass
murderers.

284
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:31,195
Not one, but two.

285
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,564
So let's face it,
Ollie.

286
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,950
I was never
going to be ok.

287
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,919
It's not in my genes.

288
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:39,921
Thea...

289
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:42,006
Oliver.

290
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,125
We need to discuss
that security matter now.

291
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,216
What do we have?

292
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,768
What Slade took.
Took?

293
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,353
He wasn't here
to kill us.

294
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,721
He was here because
we had something

295
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:59,089
that he wanted.
The skeleton key.

296
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,726
I did a full sweep.
It's the only thing that's missing.

297
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,861
He needs a new way
to mass produce the serum now that

298
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,273
we've dusted
Applied Sciences.

299
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:06,212
With the skeleton key,

300
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:08,010
he can get into anywhere
and take anything he wants.

301
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,536
We know what he wants.
We just need to find it first.

302
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:15,773
Where is the most cutting edge
technology housed in Starling City?

303
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:21,111
The combined inventory
of every scientist

304
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,581
who ever worked
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

305
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,333
All housed
right in here.

306
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:28,285
I hereby christen
this building "da bomb."

307
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,471
Nobody says that anymore.

308
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:31,956
I say it.

309
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,791
I define
my own cool.

310
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,128
I still can't believe Dr. Wells
is shutting this place down.

311
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,397
S.T.A.R. Labs blew a hole
in Central City

312
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,649
when we turned
the particle accelerator on.

313
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:44,151
It's not surprising that Starling City
cancelled the lease on this facility.

314
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,070
We're not exactly
the poster children

315
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,272
for "let us store our unregulated
prototypes in your neighborhood."

316
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,608
It was an accident,
Caitlin.

317
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,143
Yeah, well, try telling that
to the families of the people who died.

318
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,497
Maybe you can figure
out how to tell that to yourself.

319
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:00,668
Look, Cisco, let's get this inventory
done so we can go home.

320
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,507
I thought we were
the only ones here...

321
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:09,543
Maybe it's one of
the security guards.

322
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,100
Oh. Hey, man.

323
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,519
We should be wrapped
up any minute now.

324
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,790
Are you getting
a bad vibe off this guy?

325
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,461
The longer
you make me chase you,

326
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,579
the slower
I will kill you.

327
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:54,204
Help me.

328
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,873
This equipment
belonged to Arthur Light.

329
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,892
Wells fired him two years ago.
Why?

330
00:17:57,894 --> 00:18:00,011
Because he was
a psycho.

331
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,847
Please tell me
you can make this work.

332
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,156
I take back what I said--

333
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,692
I'll make this quick.

334
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,861
No!

335
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:22,867
Aaah!

336
00:18:56,952 --> 00:19:00,571
We're too late.

337
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:23,070
Felicity!
Cisco, Caitlin!

338
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:25,055
Are you guys ok?
He didn't hurt you, did he?

339
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:27,474
You said "he" twice.

340
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:28,992
Do you know
who attacked us?

341
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:30,727
That lunatic with the mask
and the sword?

342
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:33,530
Uh, no. I--no,
I don't know.

343
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:37,334
I--I said "he" twice,
because on the radio,

344
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:40,020
I heard that the person
who attacked you had man parts,

345
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:42,506
which would make him a...He.

346
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:45,442
I'm John Diggle, I work security
for Queen Consolidated.

347
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:47,427
Do you have any idea what
the masked man may have taken?

348
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:49,963
An industrial centrifuge,
by any chance?

349
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:52,549
No. It's a secret.

350
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:54,718
What kind of secret?
The kind I have to keep.

351
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,353
Well, does Cisco
have to keep it, too?

352
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:58,889
Yes. He does.
Ok.

353
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,891
We're just so happy
that you guys are ok.

354
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:02,976
How's Barry doing?

355
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:04,361
He's the same.

356
00:20:04,363 --> 00:20:06,262
Barry's condition
deteriorated.

357
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:07,697
They moved him to S.T.A.R. Labs.
They've been looking after him.

358
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:10,450
That's how I met Cisco and Caitlin.
Right.

359
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:13,403
Well, I'll come visit again,
as soon as I can.

360
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:14,405
That would be cool.

361
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,839
Don't worry,
Barry gets lots of visitors.

362
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:20,462
Iris is there a lot.

363
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:21,863
Iris?

364
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:24,532
She's, um,

365
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:27,052
his...

366
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:28,870
Something.

367
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:32,056
Oh.

368
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:33,809
Sure.

369
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,894
Good.

370
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:38,212
That's just swell.

371
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:41,766
Barry's in a coma
and he's already moved on.

372
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:44,552
I hacked into Harrison Wells'
personal files.

373
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:46,220
He's the director
S.T.A.R. Labs,

374
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:47,989
which basically
makes me unstoppable.

375
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:49,724
And look what I found.

376
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:52,527
It's a prototype for one of
their new bio-tech projects.

377
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:54,446
The patent
is still pending,

378
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:56,063
which is probably why they
didn't want to tell us what it was.

379
00:20:56,065 --> 00:20:57,248
So what is it?

380
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,733
It's a biotransfuser.

381
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:00,661
It can deliver blood
from one single patient

382
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:02,614
into multiple patients,
at once.

383
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:05,481
Why would Slade need
a blood transfusion?

384
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:07,116
He doesn't.

385
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:09,452
The prisoners that he freed from
Iron Heights last week

386
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:11,788
to create his own
personal army do.

387
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,041
With a few tweaks, Slade can
retro-fit it for the Mirakuru,

388
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:17,126
bypassing what we know to be
a less than desirable

389
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:19,629
ratio of success
to, you know, death.

390
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:21,764
Instead of it
metabolizing in the person,

391
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,516
it happens in the machine.

392
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,518
That's going to require
a whole lot of blood.

393
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,054
Even a man with Slade's stamina
can't handle that kind of drain.

394
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:30,506
Good.
What do you mean?

395
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:32,174
We let him use it.

396
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:34,343
He'll be weak,
vulnerable,

397
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:35,678
and that will be my
opportunity to kill him.

398
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,146
How do we find this thing?

399
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:38,564
A machine like this
pulls an exorbitant

400
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,483
amount of power
from the grid.

401
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:42,819
When it turns on,
I'll know when and where.

402
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:44,687
Right now, we just wait.

403
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:46,956
I'm tired of waiting.

404
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,326
Don't listen to him,
he's lying!

405
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:52,045
The cure is
real, I promise!

406
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:55,298
No, he's just trying
to save his neck.

407
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:01,036
Anthony, look at me.

408
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:02,638
Tell us about the cure.

409
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:12,715
I want to help you,
Sara. But first,

410
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:14,550
you have to promise
you'll help me, too.

411
00:22:14,552 --> 00:22:16,502
She can't save your life.

412
00:22:19,723 --> 00:22:24,177
No one can, not anymore.

413
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,863
All I ask is for
is a quick death.

414
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:29,398
You don't deserve
a quick death.

415
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,200
I know.

416
00:22:31,202 --> 00:22:33,753
And I'm still
asking.

417
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:37,673
It's your call.

418
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:42,378
Thank you.

419
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,963
Start talking, Ivo!

420
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:47,016
I was never able to replicate
the Mirakuru serum

421
00:22:47,018 --> 00:22:48,918
from the original
Japanese World War II

422
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,187
research I discovered.

423
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:53,072
After conducting
experiments

424
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:55,658
on the prisoners that I
acquired this past year,

425
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,094
I was able
to synthesize a solution

426
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:02,865
that counteracts,
reverses

427
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,233
the physiological effects

428
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:06,903
that exposure
to Mirakuru produces.

429
00:23:06,905 --> 00:23:09,605
From more than human...

430
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:11,574
back to human.

431
00:23:11,576 --> 00:23:14,410
Where is this cure now?

432
00:23:14,412 --> 00:23:17,079
You'll keep your word
about ending my life?

433
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:20,082
Yes. Tell us.

434
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,286
On the freighter.

435
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,807
In the safe
in my quarters.

436
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,093
Now I believe...

437
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:34,730
This concludes
my end of our deal.

438
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:00,790
Whatever you came
here to say, it takes security

439
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,542
about 60 seconds
to reach this floor,

440
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,177
so I would
start talking.

441
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:06,512
Where's Slade?

442
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:09,849
I just wanted to give you
the chance to do the right thing.

443
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:13,386
I'm under 30, and I'm the CEO of
a Fortune 500 company.

444
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:15,972
I'd say I've already
done the right thing.

445
00:24:15,974 --> 00:24:18,558
And do you even know
who Slade Wilson is?

446
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,076
Or why he's doing this?

447
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:21,510
I don't care.

448
00:24:21,512 --> 00:24:23,646
I got what I earned.
What you earned?

449
00:24:23,648 --> 00:24:25,531
You think that
sleeping with my father

450
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,833
entitles you
to my family's company?

451
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:28,839
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

452
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,161
Wow, he fooled around
with a lot of girls.

453
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:32,307
I don't see any of them
ordering hostile takeovers.

454
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:34,224
Fooled around?
Yeah.

455
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,577
Is that what
your mother told you?

456
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:42,298
Of course she would write me off
as a meaningless affair.

457
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,001
Slade Wilson put me
through hell.

458
00:24:45,003 --> 00:24:46,919
His training
nearly killed me.

459
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:49,371
Would I put myself through all that
just because I was a jilted lover?

460
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:51,807
Honestly, I don't know
what you are!

461
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:54,010
I was your father's
soul mate.

462
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:56,846
He was going
to leave your mother,

463
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:59,015
leave the company,
leave you.

464
00:24:59,017 --> 00:25:01,150
Our bags were packed.
Really?

465
00:25:01,152 --> 00:25:02,485
Your sister had to go
and break her arm

466
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:04,403
doing something
ridiculous, no doubt.

467
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:07,106
She fell off her horse.

468
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:09,692
We were at the airport
when he got the call.

469
00:25:09,694 --> 00:25:11,244
I begged him not to go.

470
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:13,412
I reminded him that
Thea wasn't even his.

471
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,386
Are you saying
that my father knew?

472
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:21,671
Of course he knew.

473
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:23,572
He was a fool,
not an idiot.

474
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:25,958
And like a fool,
he loved her anyway.

475
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,961
He promised me that we would
leave the next day.

476
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:30,546
But instead, my internship
was terminated

477
00:25:30,548 --> 00:25:32,748
and he never spoke
to me again.

478
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,268
Oh, so that's what
this is really about.

479
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,470
He chose us over you.

480
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:39,722
Please escort Mr. Queen
off the premises.

481
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:41,107
Don't touch me.

482
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:44,277
He's no longer
welcome in this building.

483
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,861
My building.

484
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:58,074
Hello?

485
00:25:58,076 --> 00:26:00,242
Thea, it's Ollie.
Listen, I just need

486
00:26:00,244 --> 00:26:01,544
five minutes
face to face.

487
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:02,778
What do you want?

488
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,914
There's something
you need to hear.

489
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:08,584
Five minutes. Come by the club
after we close.

490
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,252
Just spoke
with Felicity.

491
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:11,721
Someone reached out
to the Arrow.

492
00:26:11,723 --> 00:26:13,024
Wants a meeting.

493
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:13,932
Who?

494
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:15,658
Laurel.

495
00:26:29,305 --> 00:26:32,024
You comfortable in there,
officer Lance?

496
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:34,210
I can see if there's
an extra blanket if you're cold.

497
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:36,796
Nah, I'm good. But hey,
now that I'm on this side of the bars,

498
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:38,531
I think
it's just Quentin.

499
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,483
I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.

500
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:41,534
You'll be out of here soon.

501
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,452
Yeah, I appreciate
your optimism.

502
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:53,179
Hey!

503
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:54,830
Hey, what are you doing?

504
00:26:54,832 --> 00:26:57,717
Officer! We need help!
We need help!

505
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:58,934
Whoa, whoa, what
are you doing, man?

506
00:26:58,936 --> 00:27:00,386
Remember me?

507
00:27:00,388 --> 00:27:04,173
You should, 'cause
I remember you, Officer.

508
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:06,108
No, you can't do this.

509
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,644
Aahh! All right,
take it easy.

510
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:10,146
'Cause you and that
hooded freak show

511
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:11,814
are the reason
I'm in this place.

512
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:13,699
I thought I should be
the one to welcome you.

513
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:26,045
This isn't over!

514
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,547
This is not over!

515
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,649
I heard about
your father being arrested.

516
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:42,284
If I could help him, I would.

517
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,952
That's not what
this is about.

518
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,787
It's funny, isn't?

519
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,357
A year ago, he thought
you were a murderer.

520
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:51,543
And me, I was--
I was drawn to you.

521
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,830
I couldn't
explain why, but...

522
00:27:54,832 --> 00:27:57,966
But a part of me
felt connected to you.

523
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,536
You were always there.

524
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:03,472
For me...

525
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:07,559
For my family, and for some reason,
I never asked why.

526
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,712
Are you asking now?

527
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:12,597
I don't have to.

528
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,167
Because I already
know the answer.

529
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:23,075
Hello?
Laurel...

530
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,826
It's dad.

531
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,917
What is it?

532
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:43,660
Laurel, I am so sorry.

533
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:45,520
We had your father
under protective custody.

534
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:48,996
There's no such as thing
as protective custody in Iron Heights.

535
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:51,619
Dad!

536
00:28:51,637 --> 00:28:52,658
Hey.

537
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:54,299
It's all right, sweetheart,
it's all right.

538
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:55,784
Hey, whoa,
don't touch the ribs!

539
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:57,803
The ribs.

540
00:28:57,805 --> 00:29:00,288
I'm getting tired of visiting
my family members in a hospital.

541
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,124
What happened?

542
00:29:02,126 --> 00:29:04,793
Oh, it's just some old
collar paid me a visit.

543
00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:08,063
I guess I'm not the most
popular guy in prison.

544
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:11,483
Sara, do you mind giving Dad and I
a second alone, please?

545
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,771
Yeah, of course.

546
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:18,090
I'll be right outside.

547
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,491
Don't go far,
sweetie.

548
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,443
Dad...

549
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:23,478
What is it,
honey?

550
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,632
I have to tell you something.
What is it?

551
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:29,150
I know who the Arrow is.

552
00:29:29,152 --> 00:29:30,953
What?

553
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:34,206
Don't say
another word.

554
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:37,292
Don't say anything.

555
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,162
Ok.

556
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:45,183
Listen to me, there was a time
when I would have

557
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:48,720
sold out my badge to find out his
name. You know that.

558
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:51,323
But then I realize
I didn't care who he was.

559
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:54,593
In fact, I didn't even want to know
who he was.

560
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:56,011
Why not?

561
00:29:56,013 --> 00:29:58,346
'Cause I knew
if I knew who he really was,

562
00:29:58,348 --> 00:30:00,682
then he'd become
a person, right?

563
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:04,436
Maybe he's got
a family. Friends.

564
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:05,988
People that
care about him.

565
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,540
Someone with a life.

566
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:11,276
That he couldn't be
what I needed him to be.

567
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,246
What this city
needs him to be.

568
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:16,381
It's the Arrow
that matters.

569
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:19,534
The man under the hood
isn't important.

570
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:21,753
Look at me.

571
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:24,339
Can you imagine what
it's like to be him?

572
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:26,408
What he has to live with
day in and day out,

573
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,377
what that's
got to be like.

574
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:30,679
Hey. The least I can do

575
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:33,815
is sit here and do a little bit
of time for him.

576
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:47,840
How's your father?

577
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:50,108
He'll be better
once you drop all charges

578
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,643
and sign his release papers.

579
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:53,645
He is facing
18 months.

580
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:56,064
Yes. But he is not going
to stay here another day

581
00:30:56,066 --> 00:30:57,670
unless you want me
to resign and embark

582
00:30:57,695 --> 00:30:59,435
on an exciting new career

583
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:03,455
as a criminal defense attorney
whose sole ambition will be

584
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:05,290
to sue
the District Attorney's office

585
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:08,326
for wrongful arrest
and reckless endangerment.

586
00:31:10,546 --> 00:31:13,698
Your father will be
released on his own recognizance

587
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,866
within the hour.

588
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:19,387
And reinstated.
Tomorrow.

589
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:21,806
A word of advice--

590
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,677
be mindful
of the battles you choose,

591
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,129
because it will not
always be this easy.

592
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:37,489
Nice work, counselor.

593
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,223
Thank you.

594
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:40,725
How's your arm?

595
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:43,227
Mmm, fine.
Only hurts when I wave.

596
00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:47,449
Ouch.

597
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:49,250
I'm fine, I promise.

598
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:51,336
I know you will be.

599
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:56,708
Thanks.

600
00:32:18,864 --> 00:32:20,782
Thank you for agreeing
to talk to me.

601
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:24,052
You're talking.
I only agreed to listen.

602
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:26,404
I just want to start with--

603
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:30,041
I know you think that--

604
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:33,611
Ahem. Hold on.

605
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:35,663
I can't talk
right now, Felicity.

606
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:38,116
I know. But the grid
at Collins and Main just spiked,

607
00:32:38,118 --> 00:32:40,385
drawing a hell
of a lot of power.

608
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:42,337
Which means someone either plugged
in the world's largest hair dryer,

609
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,672
or the biotransfuser
just went online.

610
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:46,290
The power cycle
on this machine is very specific.

611
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:48,259
You have 30 minutes,
40 tops.

612
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:51,146
I know this is selfish, Oliver,
and don't hate me for saying this,

613
00:32:51,148 --> 00:32:54,766
but...Don't go.

614
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:57,268
If you don't get Thea
to sign those documents,

615
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,637
your family loses
all of its assets.

616
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:01,022
If I don't stop Slade right now,

617
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:03,241
a lot of people will
lose a lot more.

618
00:34:39,115 --> 00:34:41,500
I wouldn't touch
that if I were you.

619
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:45,187
Removing him mid-cycle
will surely end his life.

620
00:34:45,189 --> 00:34:47,806
Slade, he's just a kid!
Who's here

621
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:50,392
only because you
pushed him away.

622
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:52,744
You were the one person
he looked up to.

623
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:55,197
And for that,
you crushed his soul.

624
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,549
We found him
at a shelter in Bludhaven.

625
00:34:57,551 --> 00:35:00,741
Pathetic.
Didn't even put up a fight.

626
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:02,465
I will.

627
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,644
Tell me how to shut it down.

628
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:08,781
If you could feel the power that is
surging through me...

629
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:14,603
You would know that
I do not fear an arrow.

630
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:17,206
I am stronger than
you can even imagine.

631
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,074
And soon...

632
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,710
I will not be alone.

633
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:51,940
You can't hurt me, kid.

634
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,830
Come on, Roy.
All right, stay with me.

635
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:49,156
He's lost
a lot of blood.

636
00:36:49,158 --> 00:36:51,324
I don't know what
the biotransfuser did to him.

637
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:53,260
But his pulse is really weak;
He's barely breathing.

638
00:36:53,262 --> 00:36:54,962
And he needs
a real doctor.

639
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:57,297
We can't take him to a hospital--
they run tests.

640
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,466
We need to keep what's
in him from getting out.

641
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,717
What do we do now?

642
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,553
The only thing
we can do--we wait.

643
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:04,621
Well, while we're waiting, we still
have a Slade problem.

644
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,140
He's got 20 guys
just like him,

645
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,775
and we have no way
to stop him.

646
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:10,343
Yes, we do.

647
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:12,696
Is that what
I think it is?

648
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:14,948
Mirakuru.

649
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,284
You weren't thinking
about taking it, were you?

650
00:37:17,286 --> 00:37:19,653
No.

651
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,822
We're going to use it
to make a cure.

652
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:25,542
Oliver, we don't even know if it's
possible to reverse the affects.

653
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,861
Yes, we do.

654
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,831
Ivo did it.

655
00:37:31,033 --> 00:37:33,784
Why didn't you ever
tell us that, Oliver?

656
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:36,320
Because I'm ashamed.

657
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,905
Of what?

658
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:46,413
Five years ago, I had
the chance to use the cure on Slade.

659
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:50,250
I chose to kill him.

660
00:37:50,252 --> 00:37:54,421
Everything that's happening
right now is my fault.

661
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:58,057
I saved you
once, Sara.

662
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:00,592
It feels like
a long time ago now.

663
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:03,262
Time to return
the favor.

664
00:38:10,904 --> 00:38:13,656
You might not
believe it now,

665
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,409
but I was considered
a good man.

666
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:20,629
A good doctor.
A good husband.

667
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,300
Until the Mirakuru
drove me mad.

668
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,919
I didn't even
take any myself--

669
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:44,905
You didn't have
to do that for me.

670
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,790
Once you take a life...

671
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,543
It changes you
forever.

672
00:38:52,712 --> 00:38:54,580
And I don't
want that for you.

673
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,215
Thank you.

674
00:38:57,217 --> 00:38:59,517
Schastlivchik.

675
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,888
So, now what
do we do?

676
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:08,009
Well, I don't suppose any of you
know how to pilot a submarine?

677
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:12,397
Thea.

678
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:14,163
What are you doing?

679
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:16,164
Just grabbing some stuff.
Something tells me

680
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,833
the mansion's new owner
won't want my clothes here.

681
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:19,367
Thea, wait.

682
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:21,086
Now he's not busy.

683
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,872
I'm so sorry,
that couldn't be helped.

684
00:39:23,874 --> 00:39:26,141
May I speak to you now?

685
00:39:30,212 --> 00:39:32,013
Dad knew the truth.

686
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:34,816
What?

687
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:36,234
He knew about Merlyn.

688
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:38,837
How?

689
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:40,221
He never said
anything to me.

690
00:39:40,223 --> 00:39:42,324
He didn't have to.

691
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:44,743
Thea, whatever
dad's faults were...

692
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:47,412
He loved us.

693
00:39:47,414 --> 00:39:49,331
All of us.

694
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,834
Because we were his family.

695
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:55,620
You were his daughter,

696
00:39:55,622 --> 00:39:59,191
and some stupid blood test
wasn't going to change that.

697
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:01,943
He chose us.

698
00:40:03,913 --> 00:40:05,597
He chose you.

699
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,050
He made a decision

700
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:11,436
to be your father,

701
00:40:11,438 --> 00:40:14,255
even though
he didn't have to be.

702
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,528
So what does that tell you?

703
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,097
It tells me
that he's a liar.

704
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,534
Just like both of you.

705
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:36,745
I need you guys
to do me a favor.

706
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,631
This time,
it'll be our secret.

707
00:40:53,262 --> 00:40:56,565
Oliver.

708
00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:18,253
What's this for?

709
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:21,825
Because you're
important to me.

710
