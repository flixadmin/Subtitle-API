My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

73

I'll have a look at him.

I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.

He was a slow learner, but he learned.

- You flayed him.
- Peeled a few bits.

119
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,850
Removed a few others.

120
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,063
This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.

121
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:26,066
We've been flaying our enemies
for 1,000 years.

The flayed man is on our banners.

You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow.

Tywin Lannister has given me the North.

But he won't lift a finger to help me take it.

As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin,

our armies are trapped south of the Neck.

129
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,713
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

130
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,175
I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.

131
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,010
I already asked.

132
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,471
Lord Greyjoy refused.

133
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,680
Savages have no...

134
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,641
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

135
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,685
You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort.

136
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:02,978
I acted.

137
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,864
I had to smuggle myself into my own lands,
thanks to the Greyjoys.

138
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,409
I needed Theon whole.

139
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,288
Theon was our enemy.

140
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,372
But Reek

141
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,834
will never betray us.

142
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,505
I placed far too much trust in you.

143
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:42,434
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

144
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,854
- It's disrespectful.
- Sorry, my lord.

145
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,900
Give him the razor.

146
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,203
I'm not a Bolton, Father. What does it matter?

00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,046
Go on, Reek.

148
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,423
A nice close shave.

Reek,

150
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,656
tell Father,

151
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,617
where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

152
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,286
I don't know, my lord.

153
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,121
You murdered them

154
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,292
and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.

155
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:49,835
RAMSAY: Reek,

156
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,214
did you murder the Stark boys?

157
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,008
No, my lord.

158
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,217
Just two farm boys.

159
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,971
RAMSAY: And crisped them
so no one would know?

160
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,890
THEON: Yes, my lord.

161
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,061
The Starks have always ruled the North.

162
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,188
If Bran and Rickon are alive,

163
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,649
the country will rally to their side,

164

Robb Stark is dead.

167
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,871
Sorry.

168
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,415
I know he was like a brother to you.

169
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,209
But my father put a knife through his heart.

170
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,757
How do you feel about that?

Find those boys

on which way they went after Winterfell?

Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

176

Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

177
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,790
Their bastard brother.

178
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,625
He could be sheltering them.

179
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,960
He may know where they are.

180
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,632
Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself.

181
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,758
Could be a threat.

182

You want to prove yourself a Bolton?

183
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,722
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for Moat Cailin.

184
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,766
Bring this creature of yours.

185
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,228
Maybe he'll be of some use.

186
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,401
Take the Moat for the family, for our family,

187
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,028
and I'll reconsider your position.

188

Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the King?

189
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,871
I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome
at such exclusive affairs.

Oh, to be foreign.

(CLEARS THROAT) Shae has been noticed.

192
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:58,005
Sansa's maid saw you with her.
She already told your sister.

193
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,882
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

194
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,510
So I'm guilty of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

195
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,055
My father will ask you if there's anything
more, and you'll tell him some clever lie.

196
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,016
No, I will not.

197
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,852
How long do you imagine
your father and sister would let me live

198
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,312
if they suspected me of lying?

199
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,857
I have no pet sellsword to protect me.

200
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,942
No legendary brother to avenge me.

201

Only little birds who whisper in my ear.

202

Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

No one weeps for spiders, or whores.

I have friends across the sea
who could help her.

She won't leave.

206
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,291
I've told her this is a dangerous place
so many times, she no longer believes it.

207
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,544
Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

208
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,881
Have you ever known your father
to make an idle threat?

Your Grace, it is my honour
to present you with this wedding cup.

May you and my daughter Margaery
drink deep and live long.

212
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,647
A handsome goblet, my lord.

213
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,733
Or shall I call you Father?

214

I should be honoured, Your Grace.

She's the whore I told you about.

216

The dark-haired one.

217
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,919
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand
before the wedding.

218

Hmm.

219

Grand Maester Kaeth's history of
the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon,

Baelor the Blessed,

Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.

224

00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,244
- SELYSE: She's a stubborn little beast.
- She's a child.

323
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,496
You barely know her.

324
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:54,290
You think she's sweet because
she smiles when you visit.

325
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,709
She's sullen and stubborn and sinful.

326
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,629
Why else would the Lord of Light
have seen fit to mark her face?

327
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,214
She needs the rod.

328
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,592
She's my daughter. You will not strike her.

329
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,637
As you command.

330
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,642
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

Come in.

333
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,363
Were you sleeping, Princess?

334
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,121
Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?

335
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,581
I heard it.

336
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,166
And it frightened you?

337
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,210
Ser Axell was my uncle.

338
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,421
He was always kind to me.

339
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,423
They're in a better place now, Princess.

340
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,009
The fire cleansed them
of the sins of the world.

341
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,802
But they screamed.

342
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,305
Women scream when they give birth.

343
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,432
Afterward they are filled with joy.

344
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,267
Afterward they aren't ash and bone.

345
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,352
You have so many questions, don't you?

346
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,521
So did I when I was a child.

347
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,024
I was much like you.

348
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,526
Only I wasn't a princess.

349
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,194
And you didn't have this.

350
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,487
No.

351
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,366
But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl,
believe me.

352
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,493
What do you know of the gods?

353
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,704
I read The Seven-Pointed Star.

Septons speak of seven gods.

356
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,128
There are but two.

357
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,505
A god of light and love and joy,

358
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,593
and a god of darkness, evil, and fear.

359
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,094
Eternally at war.

360
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,890
Then there are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

361
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:38,686
There's only one hell, Princess.

362
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,855

You've been gone for hours.

Summer was eating.

Your body can't live on the food
your wolf consumes.

Spending too much time in Summer's skin
is dangerous.

You're not a dire wolf, Bran.

I know it's tempting,

but if you're trapped in Summer for too long,
you'll forget what it was to be human.

381
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,777
You'd forget us, Bran.

382

You'd forget your mother and father,
your brothers and sisters, Winterfell.

long before he drew his first breath.

484
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:13,862
Luckily for you, none of this will happen
because you'll never marry her.

485
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,868
And neither will you.

486
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,925
Your Grace. My King.

487
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,802
- My Queen.
- Lady Brienne.

488
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,138
So good of you to come.

489
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,639
I'm no lady, Your Grace.

490
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:41,724
CERSEI: Did you just bow?

491
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,102
Apologies, Your Grace.

492
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,770
I never did master the curtsy.

493
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,939
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

494
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:52,484
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.

495
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,777
A shame.

496
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:56,196
I'd knight the man that put an end to
that deviant's life.

497
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,993
I just wanted to congratulate you both
and wish you good fortune.

498
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,412
The country has been at war too long.

499
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,373
I hope your reign is long and peaceful.

500
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:08,083
- Yes.
- Thank you.

501
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,210
I hope we see more of you.

502
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:19,178
Lady Brienne.

503
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,473
You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter.

504
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:25,017
That makes you a lady
whether you want to be or not.

505
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,353
As you say, Your Grace.

506
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,771
I owe you my gratitude.

507
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,023
You returned my brother safely
to King's Landing.

508
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,528
In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace.

509
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:37,696
More than once.

510
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,115
Did he?

511
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,451
Haven't heard that story before.

512
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,705
Not such a fascinating story.

513
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,291
I'm sure you have many.

514
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:53,379
Sworn to Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark,
and now my brother.

515
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,882
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next,

516
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,551
serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.

517
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:02,221
I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.

518
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,264
But you love him.

519
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,149
Your Grace.

520
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,831
No, come to my chambers
and I will examine you personally.

521
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,166
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

522
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,544
This young lady sought my advice...

523
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,295
You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.

524
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,382
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

525
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:41,552
Brought shame on the Citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

526
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,804
More repugnant than
your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

527
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,306
Your Grace, I am a man of learning.

528
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,518
My little brother had you sent to
the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

529
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,395
What do you think I could do to you?

530
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,605
I never meant to annoy anyone.

531
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:56,442
But you are. You're annoying me right now.

532
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,735
Every breath you draw in my presence
annoys me.

533
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,613
So here's what I want you to do.
Leave my presence.

534
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,157
Leave this wedding right now.

535
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,075
Go to the kitchens and instruct them that

536
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:08,370
all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

537
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,581
Your Grace, Queen Margaery...

538
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:15,752
The Queen is telling you
the leftovers will feed the dogs,

539
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,379
or you will.

540

A gold dragon to
whoever knocks my fool's hat off.

(CROWD LAUGHING)

TYWIN: You're in rather a good mood.

543
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,876
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

544
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,795
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

545
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,255
Prince Oberyn.

546
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,715
I don't believe you have met Ellaria.

547
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,550
This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister,

548
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:06,094
and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent.

549
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,722
I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.

550
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:12,142
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,

551
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,063
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

552
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,023
Charmed.

553
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,942
Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.

554
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:27,866
We are everywhere in Dorne.
I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.

555
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,369
Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?

556
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,829
- We don't despise them in Dorne.
- No? How tolerant of you.

557
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,793
I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei,
giving up your regal responsibilities.

558
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,963
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

559
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,297
I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.

560
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,050
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

561
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,511
Please give him our regards.

562
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,847
With any luck, the gout will abate with time
and he will be able to walk again.

563
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,891
They call it the rich man's disease.

564
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:54,142
A wonder you don't have it.

565
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,894
Noblemen in my part of the country

566
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:59,231
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

567

People everywhere have their differences.

In some places,
the highborn frown upon those of low birth.

569

In other places,
the rape and murder of women and children

570
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,408
is considered distasteful.

571
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,830
What a fortunate thing for you,
former Queen Regent,

572
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:17,874
that your daughter Myrcella has been sent
to live in the latter sort of place.

There's been too much amusement
here today.

576

A royal wedding is not an amusement.

577

A royal wedding is history.

My love, come back to me.

643
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:23,972
It's time for my father's toast.

644
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,765
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

645
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:28,768
JOFFREY: How does he expect me
to toast without wine?

646
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:35,483
Uncle, you can be my cupbearer

647
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,277
seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.

648
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:39,696
Your Grace does me a great honour.

649
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,908
It's not meant as an honour.

650
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:15,815
Bring me my goblet.

651
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:41,299
What good is an empty cup?

652
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,301
Fill it.

653
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,483
Kneel.

654
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,196
Kneel before your king.

655
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,577
Kneel.

656
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:20,422
I said kneel!

657
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,635
Look, the pie.

658
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,971
(APPLAUSE)

659
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,443
My Queen.

660
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:50,994
(GASPS)

661
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:55,790
MARGAERY: Wonderful.

662
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,588
My hero.

663
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,761
- Can we leave now?
- Let's find out.

664
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:17,729
Uncle.

665
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,817
Where are you going?

666
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,652
You're my cupbearer, remember?

667
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:27,614
I thought I might change out of
these wet clothes, Your Grace.

668
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:30,241
No, you're perfect the way you are.

669
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,495
Serve me my wine.

670
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,669
Hurry up. This pie is dry.

671
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,679
Mmm, good.

672
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:54,265
Needs washing down.

673
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,725
If it please Your Grace,

674
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,520
- Lady Sansa is very tired.
- No. (COUGHS)

675
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:01,356
No, you'll wait here...

676
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,733
(COUGHING)

677
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,652
(STAMMERS)

678
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:08,822
Your Grace?

679
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,658
(CONTINUES COUGHING)

680
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:13,368
It's nothing.

681
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:17,664
(GASPING)

682
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,376
- He's choking!
- Help the poor boy.

683
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,462
(GASPING)

684
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:27,882
- Idiots, help your king.
- Move away!

685
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,050
(CHOKING)

686
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:32,387
- Joffrey!
- CERSEI: Help him!

687
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:35,223
- Someone help him!
- Joffrey!

688
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,142
(GAGGING)

689
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:38,434
- Come with me now.
- CERSEI: Joffrey!

690
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,105
If you want to live, we have to leave.

691
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,398
Don't touch him!

692
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,192
(GURGLING)

693
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,739
- Joffrey.
- (GASPING)

694
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,783
Please, Joffrey.

695
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:57,203
Joffrey, what is it?

696
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,455
Help him!

697
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,991
(SOBBING) My son.

698
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,419
He did this.

699
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:52,383
He poisoned my son,

700
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:54,093
your king.

701
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,554
Take him!

702
00:50:57,764 --> 00:50:59,474
Take him!

703
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,100
Take him!

704
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,228
(CROWD CLAMOURING)
