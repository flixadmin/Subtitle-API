1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,930
Previously, on "Arrow"...
This city needs someone

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,310
to stand up who isn't
hiding behind a mask.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,460
It needs a leader.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,490
So, I've decided
to run for mayor.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,080
Ollie, this is Alex Davis,

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,650
the new political strategist
that Walter recommended.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,110
At the house, I looked Sara in the eyes.
She wasn't there.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,850
I'm the one who killed her
in the first place.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,780
That's why she's
after me, you know.

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,620
It's blood lust;
She's consumed by it.

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,780
It's the same pain I feel
when I think about ra's.

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,390
If she kills me, she'll be ok.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,700
Curtis: There's more
to the recording...

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,900
something overlapping with it.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,600
Ray: What I need you
to know is,

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,900
I'm alive, and I'm in trouble.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,570
Ray: Open new file.

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,300
Atom project, update gamma.

19
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,220
This will be
miniaturization
test number one.

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,620
Execute.

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,620
Why can't
anything ever work
the first time?

22
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,590
Hmm?

23
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,600
All right, guys,
I know it's been
a long haul

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,030
figuring out your platform,

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,560
but the good
news is, we're
almost done.

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,610
Just two more
things here
on the docket.

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,340
Mmm, actually, only one.

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,640
I figured out where
we're going to hold
Ollie's fundraiser.

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,670
It's going to be at Gerard's.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,750
From what I remember,

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,380
that place is a little pricey,

32
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,750
leading us to our
last talking point,
the budget.

33
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,920
You have it, right?

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,350
If by "you," you mean Felicity,

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,680
then, yes. She was
supposed to be here,

36
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,260
but she's just been slammed

37
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,690
at Palmer tech
for the past few days.

38
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,390
She's really taking
this whole ceo thing seriously.

39
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,650
Well, one of us has
to have a job that
actually makes money.

40
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,990
I'll speak with her,
I'll get those
numbers for you.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,530
Alex, thank you so much
for all your hard work.

42
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,530
I'll see you later.

I was thinking,

45
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,080
maybe we should
check out Gerard's
tomorrow night.

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,300
You know, just to make sure

47
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,710
it's the right type of venue

48
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,080
for introducing our candidate.

49
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,510
Are you asking me out on a date?

50
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,240
[Chuckles]
To be honest,

51
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,190
it's been so long,
I don't even know.

52
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,520
I just am... my life is
really complicated right now,

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,320
and I don't think going
on a date with my brother's
campaign manager

54
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,060
is going to make it any easier.

55
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,290
No, you're right.
That was totally
unprofessional;

56
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,400
something I would
normally never do.

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,440
I just...
Thought there was
something there.

58
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,110
Probably just consumed
a little too much msg.

59
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,930
How about we just
erase these last
five minutes?

60
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,530
Absolutely not.

61
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,170
It was nice.

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,080

Do you have that
playing on a loop?

I've been trying
to trace to Ray's message

79
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,840
back to its point of origin,
but he must have ping-ponged it

80
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,710
off of like a thousand servers,
and the back trace algorithm

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,920
won't compile, which means
there's no way of finding him,

going to come by

That sounds like...

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,190
ray. Because it is ray,

116
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,160
because ray isn't dead.
What?

117
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,550
That's impossible.
Ray was...

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,190
killed. In an explosion
that blew up the top

But that's obviously
not what happened,

121
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,100
because he sent
this message six days ago,

don't generally do that.

like you did.

What is that?

136
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,940
A message, from the ancients,

137
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,540
leading to a very special gift.

Yeah, I know of one.

to that point
and lead an excavation.

of the laborers
and work them

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,780
Hey.

162
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,440
You ok, honey?

163
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,650
Yeah, fine. It was
just something mom said

164
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,760
about how I got lost
when I was walking
home from school once,

165
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,300
and... and how I promised
that I'd always come back.

166
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,800
But I can't remember.

167
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,370
You're probably
better off
not remembering

168
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,740
all the messed up
things our parents
did to us, anyway.

169
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,640
Hey, you two turned out
perfectly, all right,

170
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,480
and more importantly,
you're both home.

171
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,940
I couldn't ask
for anything more.

172
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,080
I tell you Ray's in trouble
and your first response is,

173
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,440
you need a shower.
And a nap.

174
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,990
You're not going
to be able to help...

175
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,190
oh, stop.
You're starting
to sound like Curtis.

176
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,120
Well, Curtis is a smart guy.

177
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,550
Did Ray's message
indicate what kind
of trouble he's in?

178
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,700
If it did, it would have been
the first thing I told you.

179
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,100
Ok. Is there anything
that I can do to help?

180
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,970
Well, have you magically
learned to code

181
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,200
in the last 72 hours?
No.

182
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,500
It was a rhetorical question.
I know.

183
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,140
I will, however,

184
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,340
accept your undying
support and backrub.

185
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,880
You can have
both as soon
as you...

186
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,180
Shower.
And take a nap.

187
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,050
Come on.

188
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,250
Come on, come on.

189
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,460
[Groans]
[Cell phone vibrates]

190
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,780
What?

191
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,220
I set an alert just in case
the back trace program

192
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,230
ever finished compiling.

193
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,960
Felicity...
Two seconds!

194
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,490
It's been taking forever.

195
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,010
What are you doing?

196
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,880
Absolutely nothing.

197
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,050
Felicity, Felicity, is that you?

198
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,270
Felicity: Oh,
my god, ray!

199
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,880
Ray, where are you?
I don't know.

200
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,850
And if that wasn't enough,
I think I'm being held

201
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,950
against my will.
What?!

202
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,410
Yeah, they want my suit,
or at least the tech.

203
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,720
The good news is, the tech is

204
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,190
useless to them
in my current condition.

205
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,490
Ray, if you have
your suit, then
why don't you just...

206
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,220
bust my way out?
Yeah, that's
not really happening.

207
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,130
What, the suit doesn't work?

208
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,030
Actually, it worked
a little too well.

209
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,520
They want my suit,
or at least the tech.

210
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,220
The good news is,
the tech is useless

211
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,320
to them in my current condition.

212
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,860
John is never
going to believe this.

213
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,050
Neither is thea.
And, well, ray is...

214
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,790
the size of a tater tot.

215
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,750
Ray modified his suit
with the same nanites

216
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,530
I injected into him
after bad Arrow shot him.

217
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,430
It's a long story involving
a lot of molecular physics.

218
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,790
The bottom line is that ray

219
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,830
jury-rigged a short-range
message burst

220
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,030
that was intercepted
by whoever's
holding him captive.

221
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,710
Ray thinks they
want the suit
for its technology,

222
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,240
but they can't use
it while its small.

223
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,910
And while he's small,
it's like looking

224
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,410
for a needle
in a city of haystacks.

225
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,210
Ray has something
he thinks could help.

226
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,570
Back at Palmer tech,
I've got schematics
for a machine

227
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,810
that should be able
to resize me.

228
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,520
Well, now that
you're both
filled in...

229
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,850
Where are you going?

230
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,480
To Palmer tech
to pull up the schematics

231
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,620
for Ray's device.
I'll come with you.

232
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,150
Why? Are you going
to build the thing?

233
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,560
No.

234
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,090
There must be
some other way
I can help.

235
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,430
There isn't.

236
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,300
This isn't over, you know.

237
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,910
You and me.

238
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,710
I'm so glad.

239
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,910
[Sighs]

240
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,440
We need to get
a couple people
in the water.

241
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,850
Dive down,
see what you can find.

242
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,780
Everyone is tired.
We've been here
for hours.

243
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,630
If you want them
to work, they have
to be able to.

244
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,490
Are you their leader?

245
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,720
I'm the guy telling you
to let them rest.

246
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,100
Ok.

247
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,600
You brought food.

248
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Take 15 minutes and eat.

249
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,940
Well, ain't you
employer of the month.

250
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,940
I'm going to need
you to keep
an eye on them,

251
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,470
and I'm going
to go enjoy
my lunch in peace.

252
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,110
Hey, Ukraine.

253
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,020
My name is vlad.

254
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,190
Well, vlad,

255
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,490
how'd you like
your life to get
a little better?

256
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,460
Doctor Palmer got
miniaturization to work.

257
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,210
He made the space
between atoms shrink.

258
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,960
I mean, this is like
solving cold fusion
and ultimate theory.

259
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,970
Do you have any idea
how amazing this is?

260
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,970
Yes. But the fact
that ray is being
held hostage

261
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,810
and could be killed
at any moment

262
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,210
because he is the size
of a cheeto has
dampened my enthusiasm

263
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,940
somewhat.
Can you build this?

264
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,350
Yes. Um, all the materials
are here at Palmer tech,

265
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,080
um, except for that.

266
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,660
That is a quantum manifold.

267
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,230
Never heard of it.
Where do we get one?

268
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,790
Only one place...
the manufacturer.

269
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,450
They hold the patent on it...
well, actually, 16 patents.

270
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,290
Where?!

271
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,870
Kord industries. I'd ask
them to do us a solid
and loan it to us, but...

272
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,870
They're our biggest competitor.

273
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,340
The good news is,
things can't get
any worse.

274
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,210
[Woman shrieks]

275
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,110
You just had to go and say that.

276
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,370
There you are!

277
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,280
Mom. Oh.

278
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,450
Ha ha ha!

279
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,480
Whee!

280
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,880
Oh, what are you doing here?

281
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,490
Well, I went
to your office,
miss ceo,

282
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,660
and your assistant
told me you'd be here.

283
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,290
So... Here I am.

284
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,420
Not here-here,
star city here.

285
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,940
Well, Oliver told me
that you've been
working nonstop

286
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,860
this past month, so I suggested

287
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,740
a visit from your mom...
uh-huh.

288
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,940
Is exactly what you needed,
and guess what?
What?

289
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,770
He agreed.
Oh.

290
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,300
Oh, hi.

291
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,140
And who are you?

292
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,400
Oh.
Hi.

293
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,040
I'm Curtis holt.

294
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,520
It is an absolute
pleasure to meet you.
Oh!

295
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,020
I can see where Felicity
got her, uh...

296
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,050
Blonde hair.

297
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,350
[All laugh]

298
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,590
Well, she dyes it, actually.

299
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,720
So, what do you want
to do first?

300
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,130
A trip to the mall,
mani-pedi.

301
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,170
You know what,
you must be exhausted
from your flight.

302
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,990
Why don't I get
a car to take you
back to my place?

303
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,840
A car? No, baby, i...
i came here to see you.

304
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,070
I know! And you
will. It's just
that, right now,

305
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,000
Curtis and I are trying
to figure out how to
build a very important

306
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,640
piece of equipment,
or someone could die.

307
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,370
Die?
Metaphorically speaking!

308
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,720
You start constructing
the machine, and I will
get you the manifold.

309
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,370
But it's proprietary!
How are you going
to do that?

310
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,210
I'm not!
Awesome.

311
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,560
The green Arrow's
going to be kicking
some ass tonight.

312
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,910
If I don't kick his first.

313
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,680
I thought it would be
a good thing.

314
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,880
Felicity:
A good thing?

315
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,520
What on earth made
you agree to this?

316
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,830
Well, you know,
your mom doesn't really

317
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,930
take no for an answer.
You've faced down

318
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,590
Mirakuru soldiers
and the league
of assassins.

319
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,070
Are you honestly telling
me that you couldn't
say no to my mom?

320
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,570
She said she missed you
and then she texted me

321
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,100
one of those emojis
with the single tear.

322
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,040
You have
been texting
with my mother?!

323
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,100
How long has that been going on?

324
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,710
You guys think we can
find a better time
to fight about this?

325
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,670
John? I thought only
Oliver's line was open.

326
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,310
Nope. Mine is open.

327
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,450
And mine.
And mine.

328
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,720
I don't remember there being

329
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,650
so much chatter
on these missions.

330
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,050
Are you ok?

331
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,790
Yeah.

332
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,320
I need a little normal.

333
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,900
And for me,
this is the kind of
thing that passes.

334
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,000
I hacked the security panel,

335
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,700
but it needs
to be accessed
from the inside.

336
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,300
Only problem is that
the building's interior

337
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,930
is protected by pressure
sensitive flooring,

338
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,040
which means chatty
Kathy, you're up.

339
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,770
Chatty Kathy?
Your new code name,

340
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,630
the only one appropriate
enough I could think of

341
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,170
to use in polite company.

342
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,680
Once the loading dock's
doors are open,

343
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,180
you'll have 90 seconds
to find the manifold

344
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,350
and amscray before
men with guns show up.

345
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,950
Chatty Kathy?

346
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,750
You know, when I get back,

347
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,880
you and I are
going to have a talk.

348
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,590
I'm at the panel.

349
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,840
Felicity: Stand by.

350
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,370
Punch in 4, 5, 8, 7.

351
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,180
90 seconds, clock's running.

352
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,780
Are you sure
it was a good idea
to bring Sara along?

353
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,680
She'll be fine.

354
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,270
[Beeps]
Something's wrong.

355
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,410
The security cameras
are coming back online.

356
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,690
Oliver:
I've got it.

357
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,920
No, don't you understand?!

358
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,250
If kord upgraded their security,

359
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,230
they probably improved
their response time.

360
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,940
[Alarm sounds]
Wait, I think this is it.

361
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,690
Sara, stop!

362
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,090
Sara!

363
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,960
Sara!

364
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,000
We have to go.

365
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,010
Oliver: We're clear.

366
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,550
Hello?

367
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,120
[Gasps]
Is anyone there?

368
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,150
Ray...

369
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,880
Any luck with the schematics?

370
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,050
I realize the quantum manifold
could present a challenge.

371
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,510
Nothing a little
late night shopping

372
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,420
at kord industries
couldn't solve.

373
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,050
[Exhales] Oh, that's great.
Thank you, Felicity.

374
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,600
Now we just have
to figure out how to...

375
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,350
ray, you still there?

376
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,170
Oh, no.

377
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,570
What happened out there?

378
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,650
Sara, she, um...

379
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,950
Had a moment
with the security guard.

380
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,050
Laurel and thea took her home.

381
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,720
Are you sure it was
darhk that you saw
in Ray's camera?

382
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,020
Just as sure as I am
that ray is not
getting out of this!

383
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,650
It's actually good
that darhk has ray.

384
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,530
This would be the same
level of delusion

385
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,760
that made you think
my mother coming to town
would make me feel better?

386
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,550
Because it's darhk,
that means that

387
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,290
we have an asset.
Lance.

388
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,670
I'll ask him to get
us a location.

389
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,040
And what if between
then and now,

390
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,130
darhk decides to squish ray
underneath his shoe?

391
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,140
If darhk wanted
to hurt ray, he would
have done it by now.

392
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,810
Dig's right.
We stay focused.

393
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,610
We get Curtis
the manifold,
keep him working,

394
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,850
and we unfortunately
just have to wait

395
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,100
and see what Lance finds out.

396
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,510
I hate waiting and seeing.

397
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,970
I have to do something.

398
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,940
Your mother's
in town, spend
some time with her.

399
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,390
We could do dinner.
I'll cook.

400
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,220
You already made
dinner plans
with my mother,

401
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,450
didn't you?

402
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,230
What? No.

403
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,600
Yes.
Oh! Oh, my god!

404
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,160
It is like a sickness with you!

405
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,120
It wasn't intentional.
We were having
a nice conversation;

406
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,660
the subject turned to cooking,

407
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,470
I mentioned that
I make a spectacular
chicken cordon bleu.

408
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,940
She said she'd never had
one. It's just dinner.

409
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,810
He's right, Felicity.

410
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,910
Besides, you look
like you haven't...

411
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,280
Eaten or slept.

412
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,180
A man's life, a friend's life

413
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,340
is in danger.

414
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,260
Doesn't seem like
the right time
for cordon bleu.

415
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,980
I promise you that
there is nothing
that we can do

416
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,490
until we get what we need
from Lance and Curtis.

417
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,950
So, dinner.

418
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,290
7:00 P.M.
I'll be there

419
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,970
as soon as I'm done with Lance.

420

I wasn't sure
you were coming back.

Well... I said
that I would.

I guess it's no surprise to you,

427
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,020
but I have lost faith
in people doing what

428
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,590
they said they're going to do.

in anything
other than
the camp or drugs?

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,910
Yeah. He also enjoys

stealing people
away from their families.

him do anything,

or even...
Magical?

436
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,380
And very religious.

He's even blessed
some of the prisoners.

their souls or some craziness.

that drugs are just a front

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,700
for what he's really doing here.

442

What could be more tempting

443
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,600
to a man like him than money?

no success in restoring you

to your cooperation.

to put in for like
20 minutes,

Inviting your mother
for a surprise visit

wasn't the best idea.

I totally accept that.

What I'm not accepting,

Distractions? What is
going on with you?

Felicity, it really isn't.

I took the voice's word
for it that no body
could be recovered

says that she's
lost herself

a lot of crazy things
over the years,

didn't choose ray.

just tell me that?

effect of the pit.

793
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,550
And I thought that
I could fight it.

794
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,680
I just...

795
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,090
I couldn't stop myself.

796
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,520
And the worst part of it was,

797
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,720
I felt better.

798
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,860
Look, Sara, controlling this,

799
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,400
it's not going to come easy, ok?

800
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,870
It's going
to take you some time.

801
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,220
And how many bodies?

802
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,090
Look, I respect the way that

803
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,430
you could deal with this, thea,

804
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,470
but I need
to handle this
in a different way.

805
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,730
Different how?

806
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,370
Laurel, I owe you everything.

807
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,940
You gave me
the greatest gift
that anyone ever could.

808
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,150
You gave me a second chance,

809
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,620
and the ability to start over.

810
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,390
I think it's time
that I really do that.

811
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,950
But Sara...

812
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,160
we just got you back.

813
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,990
Sara, you don't have to leave.

814
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I know it doesn't
seem possible right now,

815
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,060
but you can have a normal life.

816
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,770
It's been a long time since

817
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,070
my normal has ever been normal.

818
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,280
Look, I'll go visit
mom in central city,

819
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,650
and then, somewhere...

820
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,380
Maybe a few somewheres,

821
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,450
just until I figure things out.

822
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,650
If you're sure that
that's what you want to do.

823
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,360
It's your life.

824
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,430
And you have to do
what makes you happy.

825
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,730
I'm just really
going to miss you.

826
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,100
I love you, sis.

827
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,980
Always and forever.

828
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,380
I love you, too.

829
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,910
Hey.
Hi.

830
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,550
How'd it go with ray?

831
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,030
Fine. Until I told him
I sold his condo.

oh. Hmm.

835
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,900
You go first.

836
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,600
No.

837
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,700
You.

838
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,770
I think we should...

839
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,430
Clear the air.

840
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,620
Um...

841
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,450
I wanted to thank you.

842
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,880
For helping save
ray, and for being
so understanding

843
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,160
in the midst of my mini...

844
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,830
gargantuan freak out.

845
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,160
Well, I'm sorry
that I'm not
the best listener.

846
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,660
But all of this is just, it...

847
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,040
it's kind of new to me.

848
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,330
And to me.

849
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,440
I didn't exactly grow up

850
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,310
with the best
example of a normal,

It's kind of amazing
that we've made it this far.

854
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,880
We're going to be fine.

855
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,610
How can you be so sure?

856
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,190
'Cause we
found ourselves

You don't even know
the half of it.

859
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,930
I might.

860
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,230
I, um,

861
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,730
I came to town
to visit my daughter,

862
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,760
but she kicked me out
of her apartment

863
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,040
to finish a fight
with the man I hope

864
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,940
will become my future
son in law.

Ok, it's your turn.

Well, one
of my daughters
is leaving town

868
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,880
after being
back a whole
five minutes.

869
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,110
Sounds like a reason to drink.

870
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,490
Oh, I always got a reason.

871
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,760

Hey, thea. When
your brother comes in,

877
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,970
could you have him sign
these for me, please?

Yeah.
You ok?

879
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,980
Just a little stressed out.

880
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,180
Maybe, um...

881
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,290
Maybe I need to get a drink.

882

It's a little early
for a cocktail, but...

Not now. Later?

With you, at Gerard's?

00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,260
But I thought you...

Dr. Palmer's
molecular's realignment

893
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,720
was premised on a power draw
from our system,

894
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,660
which resulted...

895
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,090
just because
I understand science

896
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,430
doesn't mean
I'm not bored by it.

Bottom line it for me.

898
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,200
We were able to recover
some residue

from Dr. Palmer's
dwarf star alloy,

900

and use it to fashion into
a power source.
