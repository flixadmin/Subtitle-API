1
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:24,417
Let's play some hockey!

2
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:34,302
This is Joy, coming to you
live in Riley's mind,

3
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,097
and we are expecting
a great championship today

4
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,932
with the Foghorns.

5
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,059
Riley fans,
get up on your feet,

6
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,312
and make some noise!

7
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,647
Go, go, go!

8
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,316
Let's go, Foghorns!

9
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,193
Bring it in!

10
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,486
Foghorns on three.

11
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,404
-One, two, three...
-Foghorns!

12
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:06,501
Now, it's time to greet
your Team Riley!

13
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,002
Playing in his 13th year,

14
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,838
and fresh from
the penalty box,

15
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,840
it's Riley's Anger!

16
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,758
Let me at 'em!

17
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,639
Whoo!

18
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,934
Helmet, pads, gloves,

19
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,270
safety checklist is complete.

20
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,230
It should be nothing
but smooth sailing from...

21
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,940
Look out!

22
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,485
And that's Fear,
keeping Riley on her toes.

23
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,779
We gotta get
our mouth guard, people.

24
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,366
No, no, no! That's not ours!

25
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,993
And that, folks,

26
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,911
is the infamous Disgust.

27
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,288
Glad to have her on our team.

28
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,917
Twenty-eight.
Andersen, tripping.

29
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,294
Oh, no...

30
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,962
And bringing up the rear,

31
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,714
you know her, you love her,

32
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,632
the one, the only...

33
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,594
Oh... We got a penalty.

34
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,678
That's right,

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,889
Sadness is in the house!

36
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,140
Yay...

37
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,100
Andersen goes to the box.

38
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,602
Two minutes for tripping.

39
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,312
Okay, looks like
we have a couple of minutes

40
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,189
while Riley takes a breather.

41
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,690
Let me catch you up.

42
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,234
Riley is still exceptional.

43
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,402
Ta-da!

44
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,695
Oh. Yum.

45
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,155
And not just because
she's the top

46
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,281
-of her class...
-Riley Andersen.

47
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,824
...which, by the way, she is.

48
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,326
Riley, Riley, over here!

49
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,786
She's also really kind,

50
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,997
and she's nice to stray cats.

51
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,457
I mean, come on.

52
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, and she's officially

53
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,251
a teenager now.

54
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,462
She got very tall, very fast.

55
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,214
Did we grow overnight?

56
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,050
Oh.
That was our favorite shirt.

57
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,637
We even got braces
with extra rubber bands!

58
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,388
-How does it feel?
-Great!

59
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,765
-Ow!
-Sorry.

60
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,725
Riley's
Personality Islands

61
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,602
are still going strong.

62
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,230
Glad to see Boy Band Island
finally broke up.

63
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,149
But Goofball is still
monkeying around.

64
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,817
Wait, where's Family Island?

65
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,277
It's right there.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,447
Oh, there it is.

67
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,491
What's that blocking it?

68
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,951
Oh, that's Friendship Island.

69
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,410
Isn't it amazing?

70
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,412
But we realized her islands

71
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,915
aren't the only things
made by memories.

72
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,833
Way down, at the root level,

73
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,212
these memories
were also creating beliefs.

74
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,214
Homework should be illegal.

75
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,760
Get Up and Glow
is the best band ever!

76
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,762
And my personal favorite...

77
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm a really good friend.

78
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,225
Did you know
the change in your couch

79
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,269
could change the world?
Oh, no!

80
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,191
Oh, no,
we should do something.

81
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,235
No!
That girl is a social Titanic.

82
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,945
-Do not get on that ship.
-Uh...

83
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,196
Guys...

84
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,240
Wow.

85
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,702
That is so pretty.

86
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,708
It's okay.
I drop things all the time.

87
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,921
I'm Riley.

88
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm Grace.

89
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm Bree.

90
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,803
Turns out, when you put

91
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,096
all of those
beliefs together,

92
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,515
they make the most wonderful
thing of all.

93
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,475
Her Sense of Self.

94
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,227
I'm a good person.

95
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,689
It's what helps Riley
make good choices.

96
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,482
Thirteen years of hard work,

97
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:20,737
all wrapped up in what some
might call our masterpiece.

98
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,904
You know, one of the hardest

99
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,239
challenges we found...

100
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,324
Oh, my gosh!
We're back in the game.

101
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,909
We're tied.

102
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,244
How are we gonna score
in time?

103
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,746
Oh!
We use our slap shot!

104
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,789
No, no, no.
We charge the goalie!

105
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,916
But Grace hasn't scored yet.

106
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,170
Riley's got this.

107
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,008
Thread the needle!

108
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,719
Come on, Riley.

109
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,243
Awooga!

110
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,787
Awooga!

111
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,205
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about!

112
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,998
Look at that! That's my girl!

113
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,249
And the Foghorns

114
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,918
win the championship!

115
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,384
-She shoots and she scores!
-Champions, baby!

116
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,510
Hey, girls.

117
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,387
Congratulations on your win.

118
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,931
That's the high school coach!

119
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,516
What a game!

120
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,267
That last play? Whoo!

121
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,353
The three of you
were impressive.

122
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,687
Thanks, Coach Roberts.

123
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,064
Look, it's last minute,

124
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,109
but every year,
I do a three-day skills camp.

125
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,111
I invite all the best players
in the area.

126
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,071
I'd love
for you girls to come.

127
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,281
Are we in a dream right now?

128
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,908
Please, can somebody pinch me?

129
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,992
Ow!

130
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,202
Definitely awake.

131
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,620
If we impress Coach,

132
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,455
she'll put the three of us
on the team next year.

133
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,249
Ooh! The Fire Hawks!

134
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,085
Finally,
a team I can get behind.

135
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,336
What do you say?

136
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,421
-Yes!
-Absolutely yes.

137
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,630
-We're there!
-Thank you,

138
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,756
-thank you, thank you!
-Great.

139
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,425
We'll see you tomorrow.

140
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,968
Ah! This is amazing!

141
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,267
What a big day!

142
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,810
You are such an all-star!

143
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,146
You are gonna knock
the coach's skates off!

144
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,398
Hockey scholarship,
here we come!

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,482
Dad, stop.

146
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,234
It's just hockey camp.

147
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,403
I mean,
who knows what'll happen?

148
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,158
Twenty-eight. Andersen,

149
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,325
tripping.

150
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,203
My penalty almost lost us
the game today.

151
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,289
What if I get to camp
and I screw it up?

152
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,790
Hey, don't talk like that.

153
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,001
Yeah,
you did great today, honey.

154
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,336
Exactly. Mom gets it.

155
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,921
Yeah, I guess.

156
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,882
We're so proud of you.

157
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,675
Night, monkey.

158
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,218
All right, all right.

159
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,553
Sleep tight, honey.

160
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,020
Oh, Riley's so hard
on herself.

161
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,980
But we can make
everything easier.

162
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,067
Behold, my super high-tech

163
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,361
Riley protection system.

164
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,989
Don't look, it's fine.

165
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,782
This is for all those memories

166
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,910
that belong
in the Back of the Mind,

167
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,661
like this penalty one.

168
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,498
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

169
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,458
A one-way expressway to,

170
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,127
"We're not gonna think
about that right now." Whoo!

171
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,298
-Not bad.
-Oh, Joy.

172
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,508
-That's pretty impressive.
-You worked hard.

173
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,718
You take such good care
of Riley.

174
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,386
Thanks, I try.

175
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,514
Okay, let's do a sweep.

176
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,224
Oh, here's one
where she waved at a guy

177
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,518
who was actually waving
at a girl behind her.

178
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,728
Oh, that was so bad.
Good choice.

179
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,397
Oh, here's when she forgot
that girl's name.

180
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,524
Oh, yeah,
that was super awkward.

181
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,608
What was her name?

182
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,984
I don't know,
Janet or something?

183
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,028
Whatever. Let's just
get rid of it. Oh!

184
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,115
We keep the best
and toss the rest.

185
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,450
Nice work, everyone.

186
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,618
All right, Anger,

187
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,161
the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

188
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,337
Oh, okay.
Let's get some shut-eye.

189
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,838
Big day tomorrow.

190
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,847
Joy, are you taking that

191
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,392
where I think
you're taking that?

192
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,686
-Wanna come this time?
-Yes.

193
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,770
I mean no. I...

194
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,273
Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

195
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,524
You know, you're the only one

196
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,317
who hasn't been
to the Belief System.

197
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah, it's just that it's new,

198
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,946
and I know
how important it is.

199
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,032
And I don't wanna mess it up
or break it,

200
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,493
or burn it to the ground
or anything.

201
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,079
Sadness, you won't hurt it,
I promise.

202
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,706
Have I ever
steered you wrong before?

203
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,666
Yeah, many times.

204
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,875
Come on.

205
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,379
Where I go, you go.

206
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,448
Oh, my goodness.

207
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,344
Whoa!

208
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,732
Mom and Dad
are proud of me.

209
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,400
Ah! An oldie but a goodie.

210
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,779
I'm kind.

211
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,239
Aw. That's nice.

212
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,493
I'm strong. I'm brave.

213
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,036
I'm a really good friend.

214
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,722
I'm a winner.

215
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,141
And all those beliefs
come together

216
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,644
to make our Riley.

217
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,104
I'm a good person.

218
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,669
Huh?

219
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,756
What the heck is that?

220
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,862
Turn that off, Joy!

221
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,281
People,
it's the apocalypse!

222
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,449
No!

223
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,700
What are you doing?

224
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,453
Um...

225
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,963
Whoo!

226
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,590
Problem solved.

227
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,674
Joy.

228
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,806
Okay, let's clear it all out.

229
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,309
It's demo day.

230
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,978
Demo?

231
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,438
Wait, wait, what's happening?

232
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,106
What's going on?

233
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,317
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

234
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,319
Who are you people?

235
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,075
Hey, are you the one
in charge here?

236
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,452
Could you do me
a favor and stop

237
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,953
tearing Headquarters apart?

238
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,330
No can do. Didn't you hear?

239
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,539
Permits just came through.

240
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,166
Permits? For what?

241
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,626
For expanding the place.

242
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,127
You know, for the others.

243
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,379
What others?

244
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,590
They're not here yet?
Aye, yi, yi.

245
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,467
Hey, Margie,
you got that console?

246
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,219
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Give me a sec!

247
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,428
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

248
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,388
-All right. She's all set.
-Set with what?

249
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,932
Come on, Riley. Get up.

250
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,725
Camp time.

251
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,393
Lunch break!

252
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,188
Wait, wait!
You can't leave it like this.

253
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,731
Don't worry, we'll be back.

254
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,107
Come on.
We're gonna be late.

255
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,943
-Oh, no, no, no!
-Let's go!

256
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,864
Riley, you aren't packed yet?

257
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,284
Ugh! You're always on me!

258
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,037
Can't you just lay off for,
like, one second?

259
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,789
Uh, overreact much?

260
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,249
I barely touched it.

261
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,292
Those morons
broke the console.

262
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,169
Riley, what's wrong?

263
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,505
Oh, Mom looks sad.

264
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,715
I'm the worst!

265
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,467
Oh, no. Honey.

266
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,969
I barely touched it.

267
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,178
That's what I said.

268
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,935
Let the professional
handle this.

269
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,275
I'm too gross to go to camp
or anywhere ever again!

270
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,818
Oh, yeah,
this is totally broken.

271
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,154
Well, we all knew
this day would come.

272
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,782
Remember, we agreed not to
make a big deal about this.

273
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,284
But she really does stink.

274
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,493
Oh, it's bad.

275
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,413
Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

276
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,832
You are not gross, honey.

277
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,042
You're just changing.

278
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,627
Remember that
beautiful butterfly

279
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,337
we saw in the park last week?

280
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,797
Well, that butterfly
began as a caterpillar.

281
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,132
Easy...

282
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,049
And just like
that caterpillar...

283
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,175
Easy...

284
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,510
...you're about to
get your wings.

285
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,345
-But if you have questions...
-Oh, my gosh, Mom!

286
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,223
Just go away! Ugh!

287
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,810
Well, that's a preview
of the next 10 years.

288
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,437
-Riley!
-Oh, my gosh!

289
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,563
-We're gonna have so much fun!
-All right.

290
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,690
Who's ready for hockey camp?

291
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,983
Oh, yeah!

292
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,568
Okay, until we can
figure this out,

293
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,279
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

294
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,658
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

295
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,452
Well, we could finally
clean out the garage.

296
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,287
Or, actually,
we can get upstairs...

297
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,456
How great
is next year gonna be?

298
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,168
Coach Roberts' team has been
state champs like every year.

299
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,630
And Val Ortiz
is the captain now.

300
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,758
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

301
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,427
Uh, she made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

302
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,262
That's really hard.

303
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,473
All we have to do
is be super awesome at camp,

304
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:37,102
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

305
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,771
-Wait, what was that?
-What was what?

306
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,814
We got a look.
I don't like this.

307
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,149
What? You're paranoid.

308
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,359
I never miss a look.

309
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,364
Enhance 224... 176.

310
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,407
Track right. Zoom in.

311
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,660
Right there!

312
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,787
-So?
-She's hiding something.

313
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,080
But what?

314
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,875
What is she doing?

315
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,210
She's looking at our look!

316
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,963
No, it's much more than that.

317
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,716
She looks the same to me.

318
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,218
Overlay and compare.

319
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,972
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

320
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,682
Oh, It's so obvious!

321
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,517
But what does it mean?

322
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,602
She knows
we're hiding something.

323
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,730
What is happening right now?

324
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,815
I don't know! I don't know!

325
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,025
-I can't take this anymore!
-Ah!

326
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,944
You spilled the tea!

327
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,779
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be
our coach next year.

328
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,863
Grace!

329
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,077
We... We got assigned to
a different high school.

330
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,161
A-ha! Oh...

331
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,414
Oh, no.

332
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,623
Oh...

333
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,874
Okay. Um...

334
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,668
Yeah. No big deal.

335
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,795
-This is a huge deal!
-Our life is over!

336
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,046
Is she serious right now?

337
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,464
How long have they known this?

338
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,716
-I can't breathe.
-We can't go to high school

339
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,676
-without Bree and Grace.
-We won't know anybody.

340
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,052
We'll still get to hang out.

341
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,762
And we'll have this weekend,

342
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,514
which means
we'll get one last time

343
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,807
playing on the same team.

344
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,684
Friends are forever, right?

345
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,687
Yeah. Of course.

346
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,771
Whoo!

347
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,273
I can't wait
to get to the rink.

348
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,399
When do we get our schedules?

349
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,776
I heard our room has a view...

350
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,820
Oh, this is so sad.

351
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,488
No, wait, Sadness!

352
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,948
-No, no, no! Don't!
-I don't have a good grip!

353
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,950
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

354
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,619
Here we are.

355
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,997
This looks really cool.

356
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,623
Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach?

357
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,791
'Cause I am available.

358
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,209
-Bill.
-No? All right.

359
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,878
-We'll see you in a few days.
-Have fun!

360
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,087
-Thanks so much. Bye!
-Don't miss us too much.

361
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,922
-Okay, bye!
-Wait. Riley,

362
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,382
are you sure
you have everything?

363
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,467
-Stick?
-Yes.

364
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,593
-Gloves?
-Yes.

365
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,927
-You have your phone?
-Yes, of course.

366
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,596
-Fully charged?
-Yeah, it's like 50.

367
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,764
-What?
-Dad, it's fine.

368
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,390
Okay, call us if you need us.

369
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,475
I love you. Go get 'em.

370
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,684
Okay. Love you guys.

371
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,187
-Don't forget the deodorant!
-Mom!

372
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,188
Bye, monkey.

373
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,859
Okay, now.

374
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,241
It's okay. We need this.

375
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,957
Guys,
these are high-schoolers.

376
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,084
-Oh...
-We do not wanna be

377
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,168
red and puffy, do we?

378
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,252
No.

379
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,004
Don't worry,
we'll have plenty of time

380
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,881
to think about this
after camp.

381
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,467
Now, where did
Bree and Grace go?

382
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,968
-Oh! There they are.
-Wait.

383
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,054
Aren't those traitors
dead to us?

384
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,806
-Our best friends?
-No.

385
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,226
Whoa! Hey!

386
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,020
Are you okay?

387
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,397
Everybody act regular.
It's Valentina Ortiz.

388
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,024
-Ah!
-We gotta say something.

389
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,235
-Uh...
-Hey.

390
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,611
-Hi. I'm Val...
-I know.

391
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,779
You're the varsity captain,

392
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,447
you set the all-time
goal record as a junior,

393
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,782
your favorite color's red,
and your skates...

394
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,950
What are we saying?

395
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,284
We are so uncool.

396
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,245
Why are we
still holding her hand?

397
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,996
Just like me.

398
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,998
Oh, you're the one
Coach told us about.

399
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,917
Riley, from Michigan, right?

400
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,585
-It's Minnesota, sweetie.
-No, no, no.

401
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,213
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

402
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,549
Yeah, that's me.

403
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,844
Riley from good old Michigan.

404
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,929
Orange?
Who made the console orange?

405
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,681
-Do I look orange?
-I didn't touch it.

406
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,850
-Orange is not my color.
-Not me.

407
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,185
Hello, everybody.

408
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,646
Oh, my gosh. I am just
such a huge fan of yours.

409
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,732
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

410
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,651
Okay. How can I help?

411
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,069
-Uh...
-I can take notes,

412
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,654
get coffee, manage your
calendar, walk your dog,

413
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,322
carry your things,
watch you sleep.

414
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,409
Wow! You have a lot of energy.

415
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,952
Maybe you could just
stay in one place.

416
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,120
Anything.

417
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,830
Just call my name,
and I am here for you.

418
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,914
Okay, love that.

419
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,416
-And what was your name again?
-Oh.

420
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,959
I'm sorry.
I can get ahead of myself.

421
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,043
I'm Anxiety.

422
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,503
I'm one of
Riley's new emotions.

423
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,797
And we are just
super-jazzed to be here.

424
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,090
Where can I put my stuff?

425
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,592
Uh-uh-uh.
What do you mean "we"?

426
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,262
I wish I was as
tall as all of you.

427
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,472
Who the heck are you?

428
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,807
I'm Envy.

429
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,101
Oh! Look at your hair.

430
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,103
Oh, yeah, not happening.

431
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,479
Look at her hair!

432
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,648
We need hair like that.

433
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,151
Oh, my gosh.
I love the red in your hair.

434
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,402
Oh...

435
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,446
What are you doing?

436
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,281
Hey,
maybe when I make the team,

437
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,908
I can join Team Redhead, too!

438
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,950
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,122
Okay, who's this guy?

440
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,999
What's your name, big fella?

441
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,292
That's Embarrassment.

442
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,793
He's not really big
on eye contact,

443
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,629
or uh, like, good talking,

444
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,047
but he's a really sweet guy.

445
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,508
Well, welcome to Headquarters,
Embarrassment.

446
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,302
Oh, we're doing a... No.

447
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,179
No, going high. Oh.

448
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,264
You got a real sweaty palm
there, buddy.

449
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,309
Hey, do you wanna
come with me, actually?

450
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,685
You can meet some of
the other Fire Hawks.

451
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,937
Ooh,
this is exciting.

452
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,064
But we can't let her know
we're excited.

453
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,233
Yeah, sounds good.

454
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,609
What emotion was that?

455
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,944
That's Ennui.

456
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,779
An-what?

457
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,155
Ennui.

458
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,783
It's what you would call
the boredom.

459
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,369
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

460
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,703
Am I saying it right?

461
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,205
An-wah. No.

462
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,332
Oh, nicknames!
I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

463
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,541
No.

464
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,543
How are you driving?

465
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,337
Console app.

466
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,214
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

467
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,341
Now, now,
I know new emotions

468
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,219
can sometimes feel
unhelpful at first,

469
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,221
and you just wanna...

470
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,848
say to them,
"Why are you so annoying?"

471
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,645
But I've learned that every
emotion is good for Riley.

472
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,397
Even this turkey.

473
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,107
Okay, fine.

474
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,693
Cool. Lead the way.

475
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,820
All right. Grab your stuff
and follow me.

476
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,613
Oh, but what about
our friends?

477
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,448
Val is our future.

478
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,950
Yes, I agree completely.

479
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,201
We need new friends or else

480
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,328
we'll be totally alone
in high school.

481
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,496
-Right, Joy?
-Well...

482
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,831
-I mean, maybe, um...
-Here we go!

483
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,165
Wait up.

484
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,834
Thanks for showing me around.

485
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,168
Wait, why did you do that?

486
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,628
Sorry. What did I do?

487
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,463
We just left
our best friends behind.

488
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,340
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

489
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,800
No. Okay.

490
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,469
These next three days need
to be about Bree and Grace.

491
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,805
Joy, the next three days
could determine

492
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,724
the next four years
of our lives.

493
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,685
Now, I think that's
overstating things a bit.

494
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,104
Ooh, la, la.
Joy is so old school.

495
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,230
What?

496
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,732
Look, we all have a job to do.

497
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,983
You make Riley happy,

498
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,359
Sadness makes her sad,

499
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,320
Fear protects her from
the scary stuff she can see,

500
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,071
and my job is to protect her

501
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,948
from the scary stuff
she can't see.

502
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,992
I plan for the future.

503
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,827
Oh, I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

504
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,540
I was using that
as a cup holder.

505
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,834
Okay, so my team
has run all the data,

506
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,169
and we're looking
at the following

507
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,337
likely scenarios.

508
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,255
First, we don't take
this camp seriously,

509
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,548
and we goof off
with Bree and Grace.

510
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,051
Riley looks really uncool
in front of Val.

511
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,218
She fails to
impress the coach,

512
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,595
does not become a Fire Hawk,

513
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,430
and finally arrives
at high school.

514
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,848
She has no one.

515
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,892
She eats alone,
and only the teachers

516
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,226
-know her name.
-Ew.

517
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,728
Okay, you and I
are gonna be friends.

518
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,147
Oh, this is a sad story.

519
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,107
It's a ridiculous story.

520
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,818
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

521
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,528
None of this
will actually happen.

522
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,946
Right. Whatever you say.

523
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,365
-You're the boss.
-Oh...

524
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,160
Remember when we all finally
came up to Headquarters?

525
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,954
That was like 30 seconds ago,
Nostalgia.

526
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,123
Yeah, those were the days.

527
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,751
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

528
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,253
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations,

529
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,880
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited,

530
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,632
but I will keep you
in the loop, I promise.

531
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,758
-All right...
-Hey, hey...

532
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,093
-you ready, Riley?
-everybody focus!

533
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,261
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

534
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,763
And here we are!

535
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,602
These girls are so cool!

536
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,728
And older.

537
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,063
We are not changing
in front of them.

538
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,272
It's fine!

539
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,024
Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.

540
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,443
Hey, come on! I want you to
meet the other Fire Hawks.

541
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,486
-Hey, girl!
-What's up?

542
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,904
Hey.

543
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,531
Riley is from Michigan.

544
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,574
Okay, we're stuck with that.

545
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,535
Oh, Cool. Where in Michigan
are you from?

546
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,370
-Uh...
-Oh, no. What now?

547
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,372
Okay, looks like
we're committing to this.

548
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,665
Cities in Michigan...

549
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,874
We need to make something up.

550
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,252
I'm from all over.

551
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,129
Nice. See you out there.

552
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,338
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

553
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,298
Oh, she wants to sit with us.

554
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,551
Everything is beautiful!

555
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,678
There's not enough room
for Bree and Grace.

556
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,430
Oh! Let's go sit over there.

557
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,390
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

558
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,808
But thanks anyway.

559
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,893
Oh. Uh... Yeah. Okay.

560
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,978
No worries.

561
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,813
See? Was that so hard?

562
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,939
No. You're totally right.

563
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,315
That decision's
not gonna haunt us

564
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,192
for the rest
of our lives at all.

565
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,570
-No way!
-Bree and Grace!

566
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,029
-There you are.
-Riley.

567
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,907
Time to celebrate!

568
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,326
-Say, "awooga"!
-Awooga!

569
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,745
Okay, ladies.
Let's all settle in.

570
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,209
-Uh, Joy?
-Wait, wait, wait.

571
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,419
Ladies!

572
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,005
Settle in means settle down.

573
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,423
I need your focus.

574
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,550
Which means now I'm going
to need your cell phones.

575
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,843
All of 'em.

576
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,928
Wait, what?
Are you serious?

577
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,308
You're here
to work, not goof around.

578
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,392
Got that, Andersen?

579
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,228
Yes, Coach.

580
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,439
Please put all your phones
in the basket.

581
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,232
You get them back
at the end of camp.

582
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,738
Wow. Coach is so serious.

583
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,073
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe, um, I could help...

584
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,158
Thank you. Not now.

585
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,493
I know, right?

586
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,580
Oh.
You think this is funny?

587
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,415
Uh-huh. Well, you know
what else is funny?

588
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,625
Skating lines.

589
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,376
Now hit the ice, ladies.

590
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,420
-Great job, Michigan.
-Thanks a lot, new girl.

591
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,255
Just make her do it.

592
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,634
Bravo, Joy.
She's totally fitting in now.

593
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,636
Oh, thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

594
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,266
You're lagging behind,
Andersen!

595
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,268
-Skate harder!
-This is the worst.

596
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,563
All right, ladies,
take a breather.

597
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,398
Then we'll divide into teams.

598
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,989
Oh, that Michigan girl

599
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,033
-is off to a rough start.
-Oh, no.

600
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,493
Are they talking about us?

601
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,161
Yeah, there's no way
Coach is putting her

602
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,746
on the team if she can't
get it together.

603
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,957
Uh, okay, Dani,
like you had it all together

604
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,124
when you were a freshman?

605
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,709
I wasn't that immature.

606
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:49,256
Dani, you stuck straws
up your nose. Like last night.

607
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,678
Aw. I got you, big guy.

608
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,847
Oh.

609
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,101
I always wanted people to talk
about us, but not like this.

610
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,270
Oh, Joy, what do we do now?

611
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,312
Um...

612
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,605
We can just, um...

613
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,940
I have an idea.

614
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,441
Okay.

615
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,820
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

616
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,242
Uh, Val?

617
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,994
Oh, hey, Riley. What's up?

618
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,161
Uh, I-I...

619
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,498
I'm so sorry.

620
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,584
I didn't mean to get
the whole team skating lines.

621
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,793
I feel terrible.

622
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,128
I respect you so much.

623
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,588
I would never do anything
to mess you up.

624
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,131
Uh, that's laying it on
a bit thick, don't you think?

625
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,215
-Joy.
-You're a great hockey player,

626
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,883
and you lead the team
so amazingly,

627
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,051
and I really
look up to you and...

628
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,095
Okay, okay. Thanks.

629
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,723
Listen, Coach was pretty hard
on you today,

630
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,349
but that's not a bad thing.

631
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,809
It means you're on her radar.

632
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,935
Really?

633
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,812
Listen, I'm glad you came
to talk with me.

634
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,897
Hey, let's try to be on
the same team later, okay?

635
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,482
Oh, yeah. Cool.

636
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,734
Wow.

637
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,360
-Good job. Wow.
-I wish I could do that.

638
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,654
You guys, I mean,
it really wasn't anything.

639
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,281
I'm just trying to help.

640
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,824
I agree.

641
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,118
Great job, Anxiety.

642
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,245
I stepped back,
you stepped in,

643
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,040
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

644
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,791
But that was just
part one of my plan.

645
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,168
There's a part two?

646
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,795
A good plan
has many parts, Joy.

647
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,631
Okay, ladies,
we're gonna form your teams

648
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,757
for the rest of camp.

649
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,175
Now, split yourselves
down the middle.

650
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,345
Team one on the right,
team two on the left.

651
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,429
Let's do this!

652
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,889
One more time
on the same team, right?

653
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,931
Right.

654
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,268
Val wants us.

655
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,978
But we promised
Bree and Grace.

656
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,772
Joy, we have to
plan for the future.

657
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,443
Come on, Riley, move.
Move those feet!

658
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,778
Val's on team one,
you wanna be on team one.

659
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,862
Let's go.

660
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,614
She made a promise
to her friends.

661
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,449
She's not gonna break it.

662
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,409
Oh, you're so right, Joy.

663
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,703
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

664
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,290
No! You can't have that.
Put that back.

665
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,419
Joy, I don't mean
to overstep...

666
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,504
-No!
-...but it has to be done.

667
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,047
What are you... No!

668
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,391
No...

669
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,768
I know change is scary,
but watch.

670
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,855
I'm so excited.

671
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,609
All right.
Welcome to our team, Michigan.

672
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,784
That is not Riley.

673
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,369
I know. It's a better Riley.

674
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,746
A Riley who won't be alone
next year.

675
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,915
We build her
a new Sense of Self.

676
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,792
A brand-new her.

677
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,502
No, no, no!

678
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,753
You can't go down there
with that.

679
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,922
Over my dead flaming body!

680
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,259
I am truly sorry.

681
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,011
I was so looking forward
to working with you guys.

682
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,430
Hey, hey! What do you think
you're doing?

683
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,514
Get off me!

684
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,015
Riley's life
is more complex now.

685
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,768
It requires more sophisticated
emotions than all of you.

686
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,187
You just aren't what
she needs anymore, Joy.

687
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,898
How dare you, madam!

688
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,775
You can't just bottle us up!

689
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,485
Oh! That's a great idea.

690
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,571
I can't breathe.

691
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,655
I can't breathe!

692
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,740
It's not forever.

693
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,907
It's just
until Riley makes varsity,

694
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,993
or until she turns 18,
or maybe forever.

695
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,161
I don't know.
We'll have to see.

696
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,454
-Bye!
-Anxiety!

697
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,997
Riley needs us!

698
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,207
Okay.

699
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,084
Don't worry, Riley.
You're in good hands.

700
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,295
Now let's change
everything about you.

701
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,427
Huh?

702
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,016
Quick question. How do we
build a new Riley,

703
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,226
which I'm loving, by the way,
amazing concept,

704
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,646
if it took them 13 years
to build the old one?

705
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,732
Well, good news is we're not
starting from scratch.

706
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,151
I wanna plant one.

707
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,444
Next time.

708
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,243
If I'm

709
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,162
a Fire Hawk,
I won't be alone.

710
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,589
No, no, no!

711
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,508
Let us out now!

712
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,593
No, stop!
Stop! Let us out!

713
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,762
Uh, Joy...

714
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,898
We're gonna
be in here forever.

715
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,071
Where are you putting us?

716
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,114
The same place we keep
all of Riley's secrets.

717
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,324
We're not secrets.

718
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,909
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"We're not secrets.

719
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,619
"We're making a big mistake."

720
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,037
Never heard
that before.

721
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,127
We are suppressed emotions!

722
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,046
Let us out! Right now!

723
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,006
No, no, no.
Riley's gonna be fine.

724
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,424
Totally fine.

725
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,052
Hey, there.
You know what we call that?

726
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,262
Denial.

727
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,763
Can you say denial?

728
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,974
Hi, friends.

729
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,769
Welcome. It's so good to have
you here with us today.

730
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,896
It's Bloofy!

731
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,982
From that preschool show
Riley used to like?

732
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,275
That's right!

733
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,068
And here's a little secret.

734
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,698
Riley still likes the show.

735
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,782
♪ Stomp like an elephant ♪

736
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,200
♪ Scurry like a mouse ♪

737
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,786
♪ Make your way down
To Bloofy's house! ♪

738
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,037
Please kill me.

739
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,248
Bloofy,
we're in a real pickle.

740
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,000
Could you help us
get out of here?

741
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,961
Uh-oh.
We're gonna need your help.

742
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,796
Can you find a way out?

743
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,258
-Who are you talking to?
-My friends.

744
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,552
Do you see a key?

745
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,221
Hmm.

746
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,848
I don't either.

747
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,932
Okay, we're doomed.

748
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,392
Indeed.

749
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,562
Welcome to your eternal fate.

750
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,731
Lance Slashblade?

751
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,733
But he's
a video game character.

752
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,192
Why is he here?

753
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,612
Yeah, I always thought Riley
had a secret crush on him.

754
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,238
I never saw the appeal.

755
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,532
I long to be a hero,

756
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,076
but darkness haunts my past.

757
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,286
I get it.

758
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,579
I'm in a hundred percent.

759
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,249
-Uh... Who's that?
-Oh!

760
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,002
That's Riley's
Deep Dark Secret.

761
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,837
What... What is the secret?

762
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,048
You don't wanna know.

763
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,466
Riley's secrets,

764
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,968
a rogue emotion
has taken over Headquarters.

765
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,929
Now, if you could just
open the jar...

766
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,972
Hey, kids,
let's learn some Latin.

767
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,891
Do you know quid pro quo?

768
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,476
We get you out of that jar,

769
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,269
then you get us
out of this safe.

770
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,437
No, Bloofy.

771
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,065
Their destiny
is not ours to change.

772
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,775
We were all banished here,

773
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,569
deemed unfit, worthless.

774
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,488
Don't you dare say that.

775
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,657
You do not deserve
to be thrown away.

776
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,991
Uh, one second, Lance.

777
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,494
Don't you remember
his power move?

778
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,079
I'm coming for you, Riley!

779
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,081
Oh, yeah? Watch this!

780
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,917
Come on!

781
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,086
You listen to me,
Lance Slashblade.

782
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,837
No one is totally worthless.

783
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,132
But I am a warrior cursed
with a feeble attack.

784
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,427
Then you must make your curse
your gift.

785
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,639
Shield yourself, my friends,

786
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,100
for I shall set you all free!

787
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,981
Hey, little help?

788
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,944
Great job, Dark Secret.

789
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,072
Now it's your turn to help us.

790
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,825
My pouch has just the thing
to get us out of here.

791
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:17,537
Everybody say, "Oh, Pouchy!"

792
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,623
Oh, Pouchy!

793
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,545
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy.

794
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,338
Pouchy, we need to escape.

795
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,173
Do you have anything
that can help us?

796
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,009
I have lots of items.

797
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,219
Which one do you think
will work the best?

798
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,595
A tomato,

799
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,930
a frog,

800
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,141
or exploding dynamite?

801
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,600
Oh, for crying out loud.

802
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,022
Yay! We did it, everyone!

803
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,189
Let's all sing

804
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,774
the "We did it" song.

805
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,401
No time!

806
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,695
Thank you, friends. I must...

807
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,072
I must be leaving you.

808
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,408
What about Dark Secret?

809
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,703
Not yet.

810
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,873
Yeah, that's probably best
for everybody.

811
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,208
Hey! Who let you out?
Get back in there!

812
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,835
-Oh, boy.
-What are we gonna do?

813
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,587
Oh, disgusted one,

814
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:11,883
as you once believed in me,
I will now believe in myself.

815
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,263
Huh?

816
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,723
Wait. What?

817
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,144
Ooh!

818
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,526
Whoa! What's happening? Whoa!

819
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,031
No...

820
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,199
Dave, help! Help!

821
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,241
Hold on!

822
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,743
Dave!

823
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,080
Lance!

824
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,247
Goodbye, friends.

825
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,625
Hello, destiny!

826
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,126
Well, there's a lid
for every pot.

827
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,169
Come on!

828
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,464
What do we do?
What do we do?

829
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,424
Whoa, Anger, stop.
Where are you going?

830
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,177
Um, back to Headquarters,
to help Riley!

831
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,678
Riley's not up there.

832
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,305
She's out there.

833
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,183
We can't go back
without her Sense of Self.

834
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,520
You want us to go all the way
to the Back of the Mind?

835
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,563
Are you out of your mind?

836
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,981
But, Joy, how will we...

837
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,149
-Freeze!
-Come on!

838
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,234
Hold it right there!

839
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,988
How do we get there?
Do you even have a plan, Joy?

840
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,699
I bet Anxiety would have
a really good plan...

841
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,660
Of course I have a plan.
Who doesn't have a plan?

842
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,121
Look, she's not the only one
who can project the future.

843
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,499
First, all we have to do is,
uh...

844
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,042
Give me a second.

845
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,670
Ooh! Follow the stream
of consciousness,

846
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,338
and then we take
a nice, easy float

847
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,631
all the way
to the Back of the Mind.

848
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,966
Where all
the bad memories are.

849
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,175
Exactly. And there,

850
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,011
we'll find the Riley
we know and love.

851
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,721
We'll put her
Sense of Self back,

852
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,723
and then Riley
will be Riley again.

853
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,808
Okay,
I'm gonna give it to you.

854
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,059
That could actually work.

855
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,602
Yeah, it could!

856
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,481
And then I tell Anxiety, "Hey,
don't worry so much anymore."

857
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,775
And she'll say,
"Wow, Joy, I never thought

858
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,277
"of that before. Thank you."

859
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,736
And then we hug
and become best friends...

860
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,322
And then I punt her
into the dump.

861
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,490
What? No, Anger.

862
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,450
Okay, fine. No punting.

863
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,996
Don't worry, I know
right where the stream is.

864
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,540
Sadness and I
have been here before. Oh.

865
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,542
Joy, this is a dead end.

866
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,086
Those are the worst kinds
of ends!

867
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,631
Everything's changing so fast!

868
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,966
So, we're lost.

869
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,510
No. You're never lost
if you're having fun.

870
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,803
No one is having fun, Joy.

871
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,597
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

872
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,056
She's having a great time.

873
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,143
I thought you knew
where you were going.

874
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,311
I do. I did.

875
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,979
-I just need a moment.
-She doesn't know.

876
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,314
We're stuck here!

877
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,192
Oh, Riley's awake.

878
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,527
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

879
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,321
Come on,
we'll find another way.

880
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,200
Don't worry, Riley.
We're coming.

881
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,542
Why are we up so early?

882
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,961
Because, mon ami,
we need to speed things up,

883
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,379
and that means
we hit the ice early,

884
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,174
and practice like
we've never practiced before.

885
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,884
Aren't we already good
at hockey?

886
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,135
We're good.

887
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,471
-But the Fire Hawks are great.
-That's right!

888
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,351
Every time we miss,

889
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,685
we skate a lap
around the rink.

890
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,687
Hockey is not a game,
it is a sport.

891
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,825
-Yes!
-Wow.

892
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,160
That was amazing.

893
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,246
We need to be that good
every time.

894
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,789
Let's run it again.

895
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,582
Hey, I see I'm not the only
one who likes to start early.

896
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,792
You guys, it's Val!

897
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,126
We had the same idea.

898
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,586
We're basically
the same person.

899
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,004
We're gonna be best friends.

900
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,547
How long have you been here?

901
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,508
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

902
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,969
I just wanted to get in
some extra ice time.

903
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,136
I'm the same way.

904
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,888
Oh, my gosh. She gets us.

905
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,140
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

906
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,268
You get what it takes
to be the best.

907
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,813
Look at us.

908
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,690
This is going great!

909
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,276
Yeah! But we need Val
to really like us.

910
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,444
Oh, we should ask Val
lots of questions.

911
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,321
People love
talking about themselves.

912
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,491
So, what was
your freshman year
on the Fire Hawks like?

913
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,244
I mean,
it was a lot of work,

914
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,870
like, a lot...

915
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,123
but it's also
how I met my best friends.

916
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,292
Val is sharing things with us!

917
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,460
Hey, a few of us are just
gonna hang out tonight,

918
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,587
order some food.
You should come.

919
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,923
Oh! An exclusive invitation.

920
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,341
We're going!

921
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,634
-Really?
-Definitely.

922
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,802
It'll be fun.

923
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,679
All right, ladies,
let's warm up.

924
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,307
Hey, Riley.

925
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,391
Hi.

926
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,601
We are not sharing Val
with them.

927
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,603
Early mornings
make me so hungry.

928
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,980
I know, right?

929
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,274
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

930
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,400
Yes!

931
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,360
See? I told you I'd find it.

932
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,903
The Stream of Consciousness.

933
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,698
-But, Joy...
-Wow! Our girl is hungry.

934
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,991
Hop on something delicious!

935
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,409
-Joy...
-Ooh, deep dish.

936
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,244
And it's still warm.

937
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,746
Extra cheese, baby!

938
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,830
Sadness, come on.

939
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,373
But I've been trying
to tell you.

940
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,751
We can't take the tube back,
Joy.

941
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,420
Someone has to be
at the console to recall us.

942
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,505
She's right. We'd be stranded.

943
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,007
Yeah. Anxiety would have
thought about that.

944
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,550
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

945
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,302
Okay. Uh...

946
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,221
So, someone's gonna have to
crawl up that tube,

947
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,639
and go back to Headquarters,

948
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,433
and at the right moment,
bring us back.

949
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,185
Oh, I'll do it.
I'll pound that...

950
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,561
I don't think so, punty.

951
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,146
-Okay, here's the thing.
-You were never an option.

952
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,397
Thank you.

953
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,566
You want me to crawl through
a tube in this?

954
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,901
Yeah, not happening.

955
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,656
Oh, no, not me.

956
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,533
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

957
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,827
You know the console
better than anybody.

958
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,913
You've read the manuals
cover to cover.

959
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,414
I mean, you say that,

960
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,918
but I know a lot less about
Manual 28, Chapter Seven,

961
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,669
"How to Recall
Non-Memory Objects"

962
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,463
than most folks realize.

963
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,131
You've proven my point
for me, Sadness.

964
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,341
That sounds like a yes.

965
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,425
Where is everybody?

966
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,676
You on break again?

967
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,804
Ooh! Walkie-talkies. Here.
Check-check-check.

968
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,097
Can you hear me?
I gotta press a button.

969
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,599
Go for Joy. Copy that. Over.
Oh, I love 'em!

970
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,934
We'll signal you
when we get there,

971
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,019
-and then you bring us back.
-Oh...

972
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,063
Sadness, it's the fastest
way back to Headquarters.

973
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,231
Joy, I can't do it.

974
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,650
I'm not strong like you are.

975
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,193
I know you, Sadness.

976
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,903
You are strong.

977
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,739
I can't give you
specific examples right now,

978
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,157
but you got this.

979
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,620
Just don't look down
and keep moving.

980
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,288
Yeah, I can do it.

981
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,001
She'll be okay. Right?

982
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,837
Uh, fifty-fifty.

983
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,755
Mmm! You want one?

984
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,091
But we hate those things.

985
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,968
They taste like cardboard.

986
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,262
We can't say no to Val.

987
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,222
Okay, no, you're so right.

988
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,682
We eat whatever Val eats.

989
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,183
-That's the spirit!
-Whoo!

990
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,644
Envy, I think you're really
in the zone.

991
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,104
Take the wheel,
I'll be right back.

992
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,814
She picked me! She picked me.
Did you see that, Ennui?

993
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,898
She picked me.

994
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,859
You care too much
about things.

995
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,361
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

996
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,114
It's got
a very interesting texture.

997
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,658
It tastes like... Mmm...

998
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,535
What does it remind me of?
Um...

999
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:59,206
Cardboard? Asparagus?
Broccoli?

1000
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,958
What are they doing to her
up there?

1001
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,543
I don't know,
but we have to go.

1002
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,836
No! No way am I step...

1003
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,505
We have to. Riley needs us.

1004
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,715
Okay, fine!

1005
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,758
Ugh. Ew! Ew!

1006
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,387
Gross.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1007
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,902
If I'm good at hockey,

1008
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,196
I'll have friends.

1009
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,413
Whoo!

1010
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,623
-Yeah!
-Okay, Miss Riley.

1011
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,874
-Way to go, Michigan.
-Nice one, Michigan.

1012
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,126
All right, ladies.
Great day today.

1013
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,794
Take it easy tonight.

1014
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,422
Yes! This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

1015
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,008
Party time with Val
and our future besties!

1016
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,802
Why are we stopping?
What's going on?

1017
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,513
There it is.

1018
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,348
The red notebook.

1019
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,725
Don't say it like that.
You'll freak her out.

1020
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,101
Why would it freak me out?

1021
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,311
Mmm, only because everything

1022
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,812
Coach thinks about you
is in there.

1023
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,814
The good and the bad.

1024
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,025
Whether she wants you
on the team...

1025
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,735
-Or not.
-You guys, too much.

1026
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,655
-What? It's the truth.
-She's not wrong.

1027
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,448
What do you think
she's written about us?

1028
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,367
I don't know.
Do you think it's bad?

1029
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,536
Well, I didn't until now!

1030
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,870
What if she's made
a list of

1031
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,247
all her favorite players,
and we're not on it?

1032
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,790
Or a list of
all the worst players,

1033
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,874
and we're at the top?

1034
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,668
Or worse,
we're not on either list,

1035
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,087
and we fade into obscurity!

1036
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,589
Uh, sorry to interrupt you,
but they're walking away.

1037
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,757
We're losing them,

1038
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,841
we're losing them.

1039
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,595
Okay.
First big hang with the group.

1040
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,722
We just gotta act casual.

1041
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,100
Uh, why do our arms swing
like that when we walk?

1042
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,851
Try to keep them still.

1043
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,603
-That looks crazy.
-Okay.

1044
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,815
Well, walk like Dani.
Her arms have rhythm.

1045
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,483
No, you're making it worse!

1046
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,734
Well,
that wasn't my intention.

1047
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,486
I'm sorry
for trying something!

1048
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,572
Uh, what do you think
pockets are for?

1049
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,864
Oh, that's good.

1050
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,157
Ennui,
I am very proud of you.

1051
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,868
What are they
laughing about?

1052
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,495
Does anybody know
what cool people laugh about?

1053
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,163
I don't know. We were too
focused on the arms thing.

1054
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,832
Just pretend we get the joke.

1055
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,842
Joy, Anger is
taking up the floret.

1056
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,427
Fear, what is the matter
with you?

1057
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,636
I don't like this vessel.

1058
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,804
Well, that's all we have.

1059
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,306
How much longer
till we get there?

1060
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,765
We'll get there
when we get there.

1061
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,018
I bet Anxiety would know
how long, down to the minute.

1062
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,936
Well, she just knows
everything, doesn't she?

1063
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,104
Look,
I don't like her words,

1064
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,439
and I do not like her actions.

1065
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,857
I just think I can change her.

1066
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,359
You know what?
Who likes banana bread?

1067
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,611
Show of hands.

1068
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,575
So, Michigan,
who's your favorite band?

1069
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,201
Uh...

1070
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,536
Everyone's staring at us.

1071
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,289
There's only one right answer
to this question.

1072
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,875
Oh! Get Up and Glow!
They're so awesome.

1073
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,335
Get Up and Glow!

1074
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,837
I was all over them
in middle school.

1075
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,921
-Are you serious?
-Yeah,

1076
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,757
I was a Glow Girly. Relax.

1077
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,092
No! We need a band
they think is cool,

1078
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,469
not one we actually like.

1079
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,763
Quick, recall everything
we know about music.

1080
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,433
Uh-oh!

1081
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,490
We have to know
one cool song, right?

1082
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,494
-♪ TripleDent gum ♪
♪ Will make you smile ♪

1083
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,912
Embarrassment,
get that out of there!

1084
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,080
Come on, there's gotta be
something in here.

1085
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,498
I'm looking,
I'm looking.

1086
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,248
Something better,
something cool. Come on.

1087
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,918
No, not that. No.

1088
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,127
This is the best we have!

1089
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,838
It's mostly jingles
and Dad's yacht rock.

1090
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,882
But, I mean,
you don't still like

1091
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,842
Get Up and Glow, do you?

1092
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,678
Okay, don't panic.
What do we do?

1093
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:41,887
If we don't like their music,

1094
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,013
we have nothing

1095
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,139
to offer these girls.

1096
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,432
We'll be outed as the imposter

1097
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,850
-that we obviously are.
-Pardon. Excusez moi.

1098
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,520
I've been waiting my whole
life for this very moment.

1099
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,191
Oh, yeah.
I love Get Up and Glow.

1100
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,568
Love Get Up and Glow.

1101
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,451
Abandon broccoli!

1102
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,003
-Joy!
-Give us your hand! Come on.

1103
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,257
What is that?

1104
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,800
That's a Sar-chasm.

1105
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,385
It can open for miles!

1106
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,928
Run for your lives!

1107
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,222
Sar-chasm? Really?

1108
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,557
Get Up and Glow

1109
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:27,891
is my favorite band.

1110
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,810
But she loves Get Up and Glow.

1111
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,478
They choreograph
their own dances.

1112
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,604
Okay, Joy,

1113
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,772
if we can't follow the stream,

1114
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,898
we don't know
where we're going.

1115
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,233
And if we don't know
where we're going,

1116
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,818
we can't follow the stream!

1117
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,947
It is an endless loop
of tragedy and consequence!

1118
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,699
Or we could just
ask those guys.

1119
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,242
Oh, yeah. Or that.

1120
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,287
Boy, are we so lucky
we ran into you guys!

1121
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,498
Boy, are we so lucky

1122
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,002
-we ran into you guys!
-Huh?

1123
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:58,172
Please,
we really need your help!

1124
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,008
We really need your help.

1125
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,551
What's their problem?

1126
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,553
Guys, you just gotta
turn on the charm.

1127
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,221
Hey!

1128
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,473
I bet you're the best

1129
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,142
crane crew in the world!

1130
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,144
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1131
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,315
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1132
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:20,194
Oh, yeah.
Get Up and Glow is so awesome.

1133
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,070
Riley, what are you
talking about?

1134
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,323
-You love Get Up and Glow.
-Oh. Uh...

1135
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,699
Hey, guys.

1136
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,451
Why are our best friends

1137
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,161
always trying to
hang out with us?

1138
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,872
Come on, Riley,
we just went to their concert.

1139
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:32,956
Well, yeah.

1140
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,666
-I mean, sure, but like...
-But what?

1141
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,959
We had a great time.

1142
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,628
Grace, you are not helping.

1143
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,879
Oh, yeah,

1144
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,798
we had a great time.

1145
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,508
Great time.

1146
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,261
Why can't they just
leave her alone?

1147
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,888
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

1148
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,349
We go the long way,
which is the best way.

1149
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,726
Stretch those hammies, Anger.
Let's go.

1150
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,562
Best night of my life.

1151
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,564
Well,
this has been really fun.

1152
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,857
Extremely.

1153
00:46:58,899 --> 00:46:59,983
But we're gonna go now.

1154
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,819
Okay, bye.

1155
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,945
Oh, this is

1156
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,154
the best band ever!

1157
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,114
-Okay, Riley!
-Michigan knows what's up!

1158
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,493
See? As long as
we like what they like,

1159
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,953
we have all the friends
we need.

1160
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,204
Night, guys.

1161
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,248
Well, I think
I'm calling it a night.

1162
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,416
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, it's late.

1163
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,543
Plus, I think
you'll want to get some sleep

1164
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,627
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

1165
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,170
What scrimmage?

1166
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,464
Uh. It's just something Coach
always does on the last day.

1167
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,258
It's how Val made the team
as a freshman.

1168
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,425
Don't tell her that.

1169
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,052
Val scored two goals.

1170
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,637
No freshman
has ever done that.

1171
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,055
Dani, stop.

1172
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,140
Technically, it's not your
tryout for the next year,

1173
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,393
but it basically is.

1174
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,478
You'll do great.
Just be yourself.

1175
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,729
Did you hear that?

1176
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,857
We could become a Fire Hawk,
like, tomorrow.

1177
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,026
But how do we be ourself if
our new self isn't ready yet?

1178
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,611
Excellent point.

1179
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,572
Let's get
these memories downstairs.

1180
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,116
Oh...

1181
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,252
Is that broccoli?

1182
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,629
We're getting
deeper and deeper in, Joy.

1183
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,797
Great observation.

1184
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,048
The long way did turn out

1185
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,133
to be a little longer
than I thought.

1186
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,843
Anyway,
who wants to sing a song?

1187
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,012
Oh, I know a song.
It's called, "I give up."

1188
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,889
Or let's play the quiet game!

1189
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,891
One, two, three, hush.

1190
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,183
I'll tell you
what we do,

1191
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,727
we go back up there
and we kick those...

1192
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,228
Anger,
now is not the time.

1193
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,563
Joy, this is useless.

1194
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,189
Real Riley is out there
somewhere,

1195
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,441
and we're never
going to find her.

1196
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,609
You know what?
Yeah, these can go.

1197
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,610
-Forget 'em!
-No, no, no, I can find her.

1198
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,236
I just need to get
a better view.

1199
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,337
Okay, well, this isn't
working, and that's fine.

1200
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,880
-Everything's fine.
-This is hopeless.

1201
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,049
I say we cut our losses
and walk back.

1202
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,842
This whole trip
is just a series

1203
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,427
of deader and deader ends.

1204
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,596
Ever since that
puberty alarm went off

1205
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,307
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

1206
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,476
I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

1207
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,728
It's light out at 1:00
in the morning!

1208
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,231
I have never been inside
so many jars in my life.

1209
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,233
And the Riley we knew is gone!

1210
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:09,404
And if Joy can't see that,
well, then, she's delusional!

1211
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,992
Delusional?

1212
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,411
Of course I'm delusional!

1213
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,081
Do you know how hard it is to
stay positive all the time,

1214
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,751
when all you folks do is
complain, complain, complain?

1215
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,628
Jiminy mother-loving
toaster strudel!

1216
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,589
Do you think
I have all the answers?

1217
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,174
Of course I don't!

1218
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,805
We can't even find
the back of our own mind.

1219
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,852
Anxiety is right!

1220
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,481
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

1221
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,735
And that hurts.

1222
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,862
It really hurts.

1223
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,911
Joy, you've made
a lot of mistakes.

1224
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,663
A lot.

1225
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,416
And you'll make a whole lot
more in the future.

1226
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,002
But if you let that stop you,

1227
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,713
we might as well lie down
and give up now.

1228
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,423
Well, actually,
that does sound kinda nice.

1229
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,465
Ow!

1230
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,259
Come on.

1231
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,851
-Excuse us.
-Hey! You can't use that.

1232
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,978
-Riley emergency.
-Thank you!

1233
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,604
Hop on!

1234
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,829
Let's just forget
that ever happened.

1235
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,164
You don't have to
ask me twice.

1236
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,586
Look.

1237
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,258
We're right behind you.

1238
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,935
-Whoa!
-This is great.

1239
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,562
The Fire Hawks
have accepted us.

1240
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,064
But if Coach doesn't put us
on the team,

1241
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,231
none of that matters.

1242
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,900
Tomorrow is everything.

1243
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,027
Which is why
we're gonna need more help.

1244
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,361
Ennui,
are you paying attention?

1245
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,238
-No.
-Ugh. Embarrassment?

1246
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,323
Well,
this has been really fun.

1247
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,574
Embarrassment?

1248
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,117
-Extremely.
-Never mind.

1249
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,119
-But we're gonna go.
-Okay, bye.

1250
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:30,796
Ah!

1251
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,006
Now, let's see.

1252
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,258
What am I looking for?

1253
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,718
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something,

1254
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,844
and then
you get there to do it,

1255
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,054
and you forget
what you were gonna do?

1256
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,764
We'll need all the help
we can get.

1257
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,099
That is exactly
what I was thinking.

1258
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,315
Oh...

1259
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,695
Most important game
of our lives.

1260
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,750
All right, guys,
it's gonna be a long night.

1261
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,921
So let's get the team ready.

1262
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,716
Come on. We just need to
cut through...

1263
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,094
Imagination Land!

1264
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,720
Oh, you guys
are gonna love it.

1265
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,890
There's French Fry forest
and Cloud Town and...

1266
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,059
Whoa!

1267
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,978
This place has changed.

1268
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,606
Mount Crushmore?

1269
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,150
Those are her top four?

1270
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,569
The only one that matters
is Lance.

1271
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,320
Well, at least
they got his good side.

1272
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,906
Every side is his good side.

1273
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,658
-The Rumor Mill?
-Ooh.

1274
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,201
Where all of our good gossip
comes from.

1275
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,369
Extra, extra!

1276
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,538
Pipin' hot rumors
right off the mill!

1277
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,832
"The teacher's lounge
has a hot tub"?

1278
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,543
"Lucy from math class
is legit psychic"?

1279
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,044
"Abbie R's been
texting Mike T,

1280
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,463
"but Mike T's been obsessing
over Sarah M"?

1281
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,174
Where's the journalistic
integrity?

1282
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,009
Oh!
Fort Pillowton's still here!

1283
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,510
And it even got bigger.

1284
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,262
Hmm.

1285
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,222
And orange?

1286
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,228
All right, 22,
Riley breaks her leg
in practice,

1287
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,271
disappointing everyone.

1288
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,480
Nice job.

1289
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,065
Now, 18.
Val and Dani whispering

1290
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,442
after Riley misses a goal.

1291
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,320
Great! We need to help
Riley prepare.

1292
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,571
Now's the time to send up

1293
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,781
every possible thing
that could go wrong.

1294
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,992
We are looking to the future.

1295
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,119
Every possible mistake
she could make.

1296
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,624
Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you.

1297
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,170
Riley misses an open goal,

1298
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,171
Coach writes about it
in her notebook.

1299
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,255
Yes!

1300
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,798
More like that.

1301
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,008
Oh, no!

1302
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,010
They're using Riley's
imagination against her.

1303
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,553
Val and her friends
like us now,

1304
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,638
but if we
don't make the team,

1305
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,097
will they like us tomorrow?

1306
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,061
Okay,
let's go to number three.

1307
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,312
Bree and Grace's team win,

1308
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,147
and we look stupid.

1309
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,108
Number 22. Val passes to us,
and we miss it.

1310
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,195
We can't let her
do this to Riley.

1311
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,656
We have to shut this down.

1312
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,491
Love it, 37.

1313
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,911
Riley hits the puck
into her own net.

1314
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,372
-Why are you drawing a hippo?
-I'm not.

1315
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,665
I...
I'm drawing Riley!

1316
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,124
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

1317
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,584
Oh, I love her pony tail. Yes!

1318
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,545
Riley scores
and everyone hugs her?

1319
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,172
81, that is not helping.

1320
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,132
Riley paints her nails
to match her jersey.

1321
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,760
Everybody copies her.
And she is so cool.

1322
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,929
Riley wears knee pads.

1323
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,224
We buy flowers
for the losing team!

1324
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,935
What? I can't always be
the rage guy.

1325
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,478
No, no. I liked it.

1326
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,938
Nail polish? Knee pads?

1327
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,231
I'm starting to think you guys

1328
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,108
don't understand
the assignment.

1329
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,359
What...

1330
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,490
What? Who sent that
projection to Riley?

1331
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,075
-Why would I know that?
-Don't look at me.

1332
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,162
What is going on?

1333
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,164
Who is sending
all this positive...

1334
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,293
Joy.

1335
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,253
I know you're in there.

1336
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,838
-Is that really her?
-Is she really here?

1337
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,339
Joy from Headquarters?

1338
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,882
The mind police
are on their way.

1339
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,677
Well, I think we gave it
our best shot.

1340
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,679
Don't listen to Anxiety.

1341
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:11,141
She's using these horrible
projections to change Riley.

1342
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,101
Joy, I'm doing this for you!

1343
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,353
This is all
so Riley can be happier.

1344
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:19,607
If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

1345
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,651
Who's with me?

1346
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,778
Uh-uh.

1347
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,697
Really? Nothing?

1348
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,282
Sorry, Joy.

1349
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,201
Yeah! I see you, 87.

1350
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,369
A cat.

1351
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,455
A little off-topic,
but I'll take it.

1352
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,165
Who else? Come on!

1353
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,499
What if Riley
is better than Val

1354
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,001
and then Val hates her?

1355
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:41,504
Or what if Riley is better
than Val and Val respects her?

1356
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,214
Yeah! There we go!

1357
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,094
What if Riley is so bad
she has to give up
hockey forever?

1358
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,930
What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries,

1359
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,349
and the Olympics call,

1360
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,435
and she rallies
a weary nation to victory?

1361
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,562
Uh, Joy,
reality is also a thing.

1362
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,565
No!

1363
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,651
Anxiety has got you all
chained to desks,

1364
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,070
drawing nightmares!

1365
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,739
But you don't have to
take it anymore!

1366
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,949
Pencils down! Projections off!

1367
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,076
Yeah!

1368
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,452
Enough is enough!

1369
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,706
My projections!

1370
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,124
Pillow fight!

1371
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,796
For Riley!

1372
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,714
We need to be prepared.

1373
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,469
Oh! No!

1374
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,307
Okay, it's time to go!

1375
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,558
Yeah, I think so.

1376
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,685
-Bring it on, coppers!
-Oh, no, no, no.

1377
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,857
Hey, get back here!

1378
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,318
Quick! To the Parade
of Future Careers!

1379
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,614
Grab a balloon!

1380
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,949
-Oh, a pastry chef!
-Underpaid!

1381
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,534
-Art teacher!
-Underappreciated.

1382
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,036
-Oh, ethnomusicologist!
-I don't understand

1383
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,122
what that is. Oh!
Supreme Court justice!

1384
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,206
-That's the one!
-I trust her judgment.

1385
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,208
Get back here!

1386
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,835
-Move!
-They're getting away!

1387
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,424
Yes! Now Riley can
get some sleep.

1388
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,093
I miss the jar!

1389
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,636
Joy doesn't get it.

1390
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,972
Without our projections,
we won't be prepared.

1391
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,765
Tomorrow's game is everything.

1392
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,350
Coach will either
make us a Fire Hawk

1393
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,562
or doom us
to a friendless future.

1394
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,731
I wish we knew what
Coach thought about us.

1395
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:27,360
-Her notebook!
-Yes! That's a great idea!

1396
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,279
Everything Coach thinks
about you is in there.

1397
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,449
All we got to do is sneak
into her office

1398
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,783
and read it.

1399
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,955
Come on, Riley.
Move those feet.

1400
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,040
She doesn't want to?

1401
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,876
Uh, are we pushing her
too hard?

1402
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,878
We got to see
what's in the notebook!

1403
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,796
It's the only way for us
to know how we can do better.

1404
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,515
Oh, Riley, no.

1405
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,017
Oh. Hmm.

1406
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,228
Joy? Come in, Joy.

1407
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,313
Sadness?

1408
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,481
Sadness, what's wrong?

1409
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,607
Why is Riley awake again?

1410
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,066
Over.

1411
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,944
Anxiety is making Riley
break into the coach's office.

1412
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,863
-What?
-She knows better than that.

1413
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,449
She will once we get her
Sense of Self back.

1414
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,701
Sadness,
you have to stop her.

1415
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,578
Just don't get caught.

1416
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,455
Over!

1417
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,134
Psst.

1418
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,512
Psst!

1419
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,590
No, Riley, no.

1420
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,888
Oh!

1421
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,026
Why did she stop?

1422
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,112
Sadness?

1423
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,697
Ennui! Where's your phone?

1424
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,865
Ooh, la, la, my phone?
Where is my phone?

1425
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,993
Seriously?
This is not happening!

1426
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,327
No, no, no!

1427
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,746
Okay, she's got to be here
somewhere. Find her.

1428
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,582
Gotcha!

1429
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,474
Sadness.

1430
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:06,394
Uh... No.

1431
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,564
I know Riley
sneaking around feels wrong.

1432
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,816
This isn't who Riley is.

1433
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,402
It's not about who Riley is.

1434
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,779
It's about
who she needs to be.

1435
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,212
"Not ready yet"?

1436
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,965
Wait. Coach already decided?

1437
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,342
We're not making the team?

1438
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,594
No. We have one day left.

1439
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,095
What do we do? What can we do?

1440
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,555
-Okay, okay, okay.
-What would Val do?

1441
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,767
Uh, well, we're just gonna
have to change Coach's mind.

1442
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,477
Which means
we're gonna need ideas.

1443
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:48,603
Lots of them.

1444
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,274
Ow!

1445
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,613
Oh, no. It's a Brainstorm!

1446
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,573
Too close!

1447
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,242
Hog the puck?

1448
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,286
Trash talk the other team?

1449
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,707
-Ooh!
-Yes!

1450
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,754
We can't let these bad ideas
get to Riley.

1451
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,255
Joy!

1452
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,301
-Smash as many as you can!
-Joy!

1453
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,179
Joy!

1454
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,521
I'll start sorting these into
ideas I wish I'd thought of.

1455
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:33,690
Oh, no, no, no.
None of these are good enough.

1456
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,817
We need more. Get more!

1457
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,445
Get on the balloon!

1458
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,572
Whoa!

1459
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,910
This is worse
than the broccoli!

1460
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,499
Quick! Grab an idea.

1461
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,878
-Whoa!
-These ideas are too small.

1462
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,380
These ideas are too small!

1463
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,006
We need something bigger.

1464
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,637
That's our way out!

1465
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,144
Ready?

1466
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,611
Joy! We need this idea!

1467
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:21,863
If Riley takes
one of these ideas,

1468
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,364
it could be a disaster!

1469
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,491
Joy, the only way out is up.

1470
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,049
That's a big idea!

1471
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,635
Whoa! I like it.

1472
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,554
Oh, no.

1473
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,560
Hold me!

1474
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,187
Seriously. Hold me!

1475
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,900
Fear,
you have a parachute?

1476
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,151
Uh, yes.

1477
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,944
The real question is,
why don't any of you?

1478
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,490
-Land! Yes!
-Yes!

1479
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,033
-Stuck the landing!
-We did it!

1480
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,159
We made it!

1481
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,411
Come on,
to the Back of the Mind!

1482
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,455
You're finished, Anxiety!

1483
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,251
Coach is right.
Riley isn't ready.

1484
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,838
But we're so close
to a new Riley who is.

1485
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,673
This is what we're missing.

1486
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:27,220
We show them we're a Fire Hawk
who will do whatever it takes.

1487
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,077
Finally, we're one of them!

1488
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,537
What do you think, Sadness?

1489
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:54,038
-Well, I...
-Awesome!

1490
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,414
Red is really our color.

1491
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,624
Yeah, no,

1492
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,875
I mean, it's so much fun.

1493
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,717
Okay, it's giving jealousy.
I'm sorry.

1494
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:07,927
They wouldn't know cool

1495
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,512
if it hit them in the face.

1496
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,097
Hey, Michigan.

1497
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:13,558
Oh! Rocking the red, huh?

1498
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,685
-Yes!
-We are in.

1499
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,311
I hope it's okay.

1500
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,896
I know I'm not officially
a Fire Hawk yet,

1501
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,398
but I figured since we're
on the same team

1502
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,607
we should match, right?

1503
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,817
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1504
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,443
Did you, um, sleep last night?

1505
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:26,737
No, how could I?
Big game today!

1506
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,322
You mean the camp scrimmage?

1507
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,825
See? I told you
not to freak her out.

1508
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,119
You're all good, okay?
I see you're in your zone.

1509
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,079
Get ready to score some goals.

1510
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,622
Yeah! I will!

1511
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,249
Val scored two goals
in the scrimmage

1512
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,417
to become a Fire Hawk.

1513
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,168
And you know
what's better than two?

1514
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,253
-Three!
-Three!

1515
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,421
I was just about to say that.

1516
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:45,131
We were about to say that
at the same time.

1517
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:48,259
But how are we gonna score
three goals?

1518
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,386
The new Riley
will handle anything.

1519
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,097
And I think this
is the finishing touch.

1520
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,435
I'll be right back.

1521
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,941
Come on!

1522
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,484
We're so close.

1523
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,778
The Sense of Self is just
on top of that mount...

1524
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,451
That is a lot.

1525
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,995
This is more than I remember
sending back here.

1526
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,413
Oh, when she walked into

1527
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,165
that glass door at that party.
Oof!

1528
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:21,751
Yeah, and breaking
Grandma's favorite plate.

1529
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,878
Thank goodness
these aren't part of her.

1530
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,671
-Phew!
-Oh, yeah.

1531
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,353
There it is.

1532
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,612
I'm a good person.

1533
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,655
Oh, no.

1534
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,458
Yes. Come on, come on.

1535
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,669
Here we go!

1536
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:07,755
I'm not good enough.

1537
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,341
What?

1538
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,135
I'm not good enough.

1539
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,013
I'm not good enough.

1540
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,475
Are you sure...

1541
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:20,851
Don't worry.

1542
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:21,644
It's just that she knows that
there's always room

1543
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:22,770
for self-improvement.

1544
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,771
She'll be fine.

1545
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,067
Sadness,
we have the Sense of Self.

1546
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,235
Bring us back!

1547
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:30,403
Sadness, do you copy?

1548
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,863
Psst. Psst!

1549
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,117
I'm not good enough.

1550
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,248
Oh...

1551
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,711
Okay, I can work with this.

1552
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:47,962
I just need to recalibrate

1553
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,213
the console and make sure
it's ready.

1554
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,756
Just no more surprises.

1555
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:53,426
Okay, this one goes here.
Check.

1556
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:54,719
That one goes there.
Check.

1557
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,262
Not exactly there.
Here.

1558
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,805
Come on.
Turn it up a little bit.

1559
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,473
It's got to be
absolutely perfect.

1560
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,559
That one is definitely wrong.
What is happening?

1561
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,935
Sadness, now!

1562
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,988
Oh...

1563
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,448
Joy...

1564
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,199
-Oh, no!
-Uh...

1565
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:38,679
I'm a good person.

1566
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,723
I'm not good enough.

1567
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,228
That was our only way back.

1568
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,105
-What do we do?
-We were so close.

1569
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,282
Joy. Joy!

1570
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:00,326
Where are you going?

1571
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,927
Twenty-eight!

1572
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,303
Andersen, tripping!

1573
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,516
Twenty-eight!

1574
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:24,558
Andersen, tripping!

1575
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:31,857
Twenty-eight!

1576
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:32,900
Andersen, tripping!

1577
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,738
I expected better, Riley.

1578
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,742
That's not...

1579
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:48,749
What...

1580
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,716
Come on, please.

1581
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,678
What am I missing?

1582
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,520
I'm a good person.

1583
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,653
Joy...

1584
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,698
so what do we do now?

1585
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,791
I don't know.

1586
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,837
I don't know
how to stop Anxiety.

1587
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,091
Maybe we can't.

1588
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,888
Maybe this is what happens
when you grow up.

1589
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:47,349
You feel less joy.

1590
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:55,608
But I do know this.

1591
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:00,988
Riley will never be herself

1592
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,032
if we don't get this
back to Headquarters.

1593
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,700
Fast.

1594
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:07,244
How?

1595
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,625
Have a good game, Riley.

1596
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,126
You too.

1597
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:17,922
I'm not good enough.

1598
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:23,594
Whoa!

1599
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,431
Yes! Go, go, go!

1600
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,059
Riley, I'm open.
Pass it, pass it!

1601
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,393
I'm not good enough.

1602
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,484
Yeah, Michigan!

1603
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:40,361
Leave some
for the rest of us, huh?

1604
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,030
Yes! One down, two to go.

1605
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,782
Okay, so how do we
get our Sense of Self

1606
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:46,533
from here to there?

1607
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:52,331
I have an idea,
but I really don't like it.

1608
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,250
Anger, Riley needs us.

1609
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:59,129
Oh, Pouchy!

1610
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:04,510
Well, what are you
waiting for? Say the words!

1611
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,637
Oh, Pouchy!

1612
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,271
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1613
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,438
We know.

1614
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,023
Pouchy, we need to
get back to Headquarters.

1615
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,733
Do you have anything
that can help us?

1616
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,568
I have lots of items.

1617
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,862
Which one do you think
will work the best?

1618
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,281
A roll of tape,

1619
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:27,533
-a rubber ducky...
-No time!

1620
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,159
Huh?

1621
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,244
Hmm.

1622
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,329
Seriously, Pouchy? Dynamite?

1623
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,373
Don't you have, like,
a jetpack or a plane

1624
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,749
or something
that's going to help us?

1625
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,626
What do you think,
I have everything in here?

1626
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,336
I offered you
the rubber ducky,

1627
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,421
I offered you the tape.

1628
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,588
I know what to do.

1629
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,632
But we're gonna need
a lot more dynamite.

1630
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,844
You know what? Good luck...

1631
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:52,057
Come on, Riley.
Get the puck!

1632
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:53,267
Take it, take it!

1633
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,812
I'm not good enough.

1634
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,606
Michigan, what are you doing?

1635
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,900
We're on the same team!

1636
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,409
Yes!

1637
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,786
Well, Dani might be
a little mad at us,

1638
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,788
but they'll all forgive us
when we make the team.

1639
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,249
Come on, Riley. One more goal.

1640
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:23,589
Uh... Hold on, Joy.
We're gonna

1641
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,466
-blow up this cliff?
-Yep!

1642
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,551
And then
we'll ride an avalanche

1643
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,053
of bad memories
back to Headquarters?

1644
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,137
Yeah!

1645
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,764
And how do we
keep the bad memories

1646
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:33,265
from forming bad beliefs?

1647
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,434
I don't know.

1648
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,562
Um, yeah! What could go wrong?
I'm in!

1649
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,772
Ready?

1650
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:40,939
-For Riley.
-Let's do it.

1651
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,858
Here we come, Riley.

1652
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:57,748
Jump on!

1653
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,233
Come on!

1654
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,026
Aw, man!

1655
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:29,279
I'm not good enough.

1656
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,115
You have to score!

1657
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,544
Andersen,
penalty box, two minutes.

1658
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,170
No!

1659
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,839
Grace, are you okay?

1660
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,010
We hurt Grace.

1661
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:54,763
It all happened so fast.
I didn't even see her.

1662
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,855
I'm not good enough.

1663
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:04,523
Oh, no. What did I do?

1664
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:07,776
No, no.

1665
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,070
I can fix it, I can fix it.

1666
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,403
I expected better, Riley.

1667
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,530
Wait... No!

1668
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,033
Come on.

1669
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,744
I'm not good enough.

1670
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:00,704
Come on, Riley.

1671
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:01,914
Get it together.

1672
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:03,749
Come on, Riley,
get it together.

1673
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,209
I'm not good enough.

1674
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,462
You have to score, Riley!

1675
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,588
Or this will all

1676
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,964
have been for nothing!

1677
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,841
Anxiety, you're putting
too much pressure on her.

1678
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:33,028
Okay,
let's take a breather!

1679
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,333
-Sadness!
-Joy! Help!

1680
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,711
Come on! We can do this!

1681
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,172
It's not working!

1682
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,298
It's Anxiety.

1683
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,193
Anxiety, stop!

1684
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:21,159
You don't get to choose
who Riley is.

1685
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,375
Anxiety...

1686
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,299
you need to let her go.

1687
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:01,742
I'm a good person.

1688
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,462
Joy.

1689
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:15,547
I'm sorry.

1690
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:19,676
I was just
trying to protect her.

1691
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:23,555
But you're right.

1692
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:27,184
We don't get to choose
who Riley is.

1693
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:35,567
We keep the best
and toss the rest.

1694
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:49,164
Twenty-eight!

1695
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,290
Andersen, tripping!

1696
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:15,565
I'm a good person.

1697
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,533
Joy! What are you doing?

1698
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,254
I'm selfish.

1699
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:39,631
I'm kind.

1700
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,884
I'm not good enough.

1701
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:45,887
I'm a good person.

1702
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,098
I need to fit in...

1703
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,434
...but I want to be myself.

1704
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,644
I'm brave, but I get scared.

1705
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,563
Success is everything.
I make mistakes.

1706
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:55,814
I'm nice.
I'm mean.

1707
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:56,898
I'm a good friend.

1708
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:57,983
I'm a terrible friend.
I am strong.

1709
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:00,610
I'm weak.
I need help sometimes.

1710
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:01,254
Riley, you okay?

1711
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,056
Yeah.

1712
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:13,517
I mean... no.

1713
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:20,732
I was such a jerk to you guys.

1714
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:23,568
When you guys told me you were
going to a different school,

1715
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:24,945
I freaked out.

1716
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,822
And...

1717
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,075
I'm so sorry.

1718
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,704
If you don't want to
be friends anymore...

1719
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:37,040
I get it.

1720
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,292
But...

1721
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,419
I really hope that
you can forgive me.

1722
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:43,922
Someday.

1723
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:12,909
-Let's go, ladies!
-Come on.

1724
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,536
We've got a game to finish.

1725
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:44,774
Joy...

1726
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,860
Riley wants you.

1727
01:22:22,228 --> 01:22:23,188
Riley!

1728
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,483
Yes!

1729
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:10,276
Whoo!

1730
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:31,881
Hey, Minnesota,

1731
01:23:31,923 --> 01:23:33,091
how long are you gonna
stare at your phone?

1732
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,551
It's almost 2:00.

1733
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:36,344
Coach is gonna post
the list any minute.

1734
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,847
-Okay. 2:00 p.m. That's in...
-Six minutes.

1735
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:40,306
And what happens if we don't
become a Fire Hawk?

1736
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,393
Well, thanks for asking, Joy.
I'll tell you.

1737
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,103
First, Mom and Dad
are very disappointed.

1738
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,312
We don't go pro,

1739
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,605
and we find work
as an ethnomusicologist...

1740
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:48,732
even though we don't
really know what that is.

1741
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:50,900
We have no friends,
and we die alone.

1742
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:52,318
Okay, okay.

1743
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,320
None of that
is happening right now.

1744
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,822
-Is it?
-No.

1745
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,575
Great! So why don't we take
a seat in our special chair.

1746
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:01,119
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1747
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,579
See? Isn't that better?

1748
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:05,081
Oh, yeah,
that's the stuff.

1749
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,333
We can't control whether Riley
makes the team.

1750
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:08,960
But what can we control?

1751
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,420
Well, um... Oh!

1752
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,630
Riley has a Spanish test
tomorrow. We need to study.

1753
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,715
Oh! You're right.

1754
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:14,924
-We totally...
-Olvidamos!

1755
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:16,593
-What's that mean?
-"Forgot."

1756
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:17,802
Someone paid attention
in class.

1757
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,304
I never would've
thought of that.

1758
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:19,929
-You're clearly an expert.
-Muchas gracias.

1759
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:20,930
Oh, thanks, guys.

1760
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:22,140
Plus, we followed our new

1761
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,434
varsity caliber
training program.

1762
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:25,894
Oh, I wish I thought of that.

1763
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:27,520
Newsflash, you did!

1764
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,355
Wait, you're right, I did.

1765
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,775
I'm jealous of myself.
Thanks for the reminder.

1766
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:33,109
You're welcome!

1767
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,528
-Who said that?
-It's my new buddy, Pouchy.

1768
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,489
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1769
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,240
Confetti if we make the team!

1770
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,076
Good idea. Ah!

1771
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:43,536
That's great, but either way,
we love our girl.

1772
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:44,954
Confetti if we don't!

1773
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:49,501
Oh, is it Coach's email?

1774
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:51,961
No. It's Bree and Grace.

1775
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:54,506
Aw. I miss those girls.

1776
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:57,092
Oh. Remember when
Bree and Grace,

1777
01:24:57,133 --> 01:24:58,593
-and us used to...
-You're still early.

1778
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,136
-No, no, no. Too early.
-Go downstairs.

1779
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:02,806
I'll just be downstairs
if you need me.

1780
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,432
It's 3 minutes to 2:00.

1781
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:06,976
-She's got this.
-'Cause she's got us.

1782
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:12,524
Ooh, yeah! Right? 'Cause
she's... Maybe?

1783
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:14,192
All right, Embarrassment.

1784
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:16,069
Everybody,
look at Embarrassment!

1785
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,323
Hey, look, if you don't
make it this year,

1786
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,574
there's always next year.

1787
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,159
I know.

1788
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,620
-I love our girl.
-How could you not?

1789
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,288
She's super smart.

1790
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,832
And great at hockey.

1791
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:30,250
She's really creative.

1792
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,752
She can be bored,
but never boring.

1793
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,547
But she can be a little
sarcastic from time to time.

1794
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:38,591
She can have
really bad ideas.

1795
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:41,594
Occasionally, she can
do the wrong thing.

1796
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:44,931
And sometimes, she can be
too hard on herself.

1797
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,434
But every bit of Riley
makes her who she is.

1798
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,687
And we love all of our girl.

1799
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:55,942
Every messy,
beautiful piece of her.

1800
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:28,141
So, Riley, how was camp?

1801
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,935
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

1802
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:32,312
Uh...

1803
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,646
But what about sneaking

1804
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:34,689
-into Coach's office?
-What about hitting Grace?

1805
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,690
-Remember the lying?
-Are we gonna

1806
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:36,816
tell her about the Fire Hawks?

1807
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,318
-She doesn't need to know.
-Objection.

1808
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:39,569
Pardon. Excusez moi.

1809
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:41,738
It was good.

1810
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:47,118
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

1811
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,411
And what about
the red in her hair?

1812
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,579
Did she join a gang?

1813
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:51,080
Welcome back, Anxiety.

1814
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:57,170
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

1815
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,672
Yeah. Sounds right.
Back to the game.

1816
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:01,633
With a nice pass
over to Reeves,

1817
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:03,343
comes across center ice.

1818
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:05,845
Down to the line.
Oh, what a move!

1819
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,307
Okay, Deep Dark Secret.

1820
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:49,475
It's time.

1821
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:54,438
It's okay. Come on.

1822
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:59,193
Okay. Let it go, buddy.

1823
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:00,486
What's the secret?

1824
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:05,825
We burn hole in rug.

1825
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:07,910
Really? That's it? Whew!

1826
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:10,329
I thought you were gonna say
the time we peed in the pool.

1827
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,498
Oh, no, wait.

1828
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:15,793
And he's gone.
