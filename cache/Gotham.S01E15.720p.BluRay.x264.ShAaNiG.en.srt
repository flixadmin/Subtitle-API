1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,366
Previously on Gotham:

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,484
Fish Mooney's alive,
and you've been playing me for a chump.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,728
No, no, no.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,247
You better stop this machine right now.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,001
<i>Because if I die,
Don Falcone is gonna send a team up here...</i>

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,369
to skin you alive
and slaughter your family.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,922
That man who was thrown from the roof,
the killer removed his adrenal glands.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,929
Essentially, it's the fear gland.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,448
He's still out there.

10
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,284
Hello?

11
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,929
Who are you?

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,683
- I'm dreaming, right?
- Oh, I hope so lady.

13
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,928
I sure hope so.

14
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,327
Hell.

15
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,727
What's up with them?

16
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,922
What are they waiting for?

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,881
First man that comes at a new girl nearly
always gets jumped by the second man.

18
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,923
Is that right?

19
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,769
Here's a promise, boys.

20
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,491
The first of you to come at me
will die like... that.

21
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,049
The second will die slow.

22
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,209
So boys...

23
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,721
who's first?

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,730
- Thank you, that was wonderful.
- Yeah, taxi!

25
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,761
And no case files.
We didn't mention work once.

26
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,726
- Ha-ha-ha. There's hope for us yet.
- Yeah.

27
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,801
So, what is this, our third date?

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,128
I believe that's correct.

29
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,489
Three dates, and I still haven't been
to your apartment.

30
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,445
What particular room of my apartment
are you interested in?

31
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,849
- I don't know. How's the kitchen?
- Small.

32
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,405
- Living room?
- Dark.

33
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,920
- How about the bedroom?
- The bedroom, I think you'd like.

34
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,122
Yeah. Taxi!

35
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,961
But not tonight.

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,282
- No?
- I have to get a good night's sleep.

37
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,687
I start a new job in the morning.

38
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,166
- A new job? Congratulations. Since when?
- I heard this morning.

39
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,045
I didn't wanna spoil dinner
with a discussion about it.

40
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,689
Why would it spoil dinner?

41
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,248
I'm coming to work at the G.C.P.D.
I'm you're new medical examiner.

42
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,448
You're kidding.

43
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,602
Wow, that's great.

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,086
Is it?

45
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,722
Of course. I mean, I was the one
that suggested you work there.

46
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,651
- Yes, but now it's real.
- So good.

47
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,366
We'll see, won't we?

48
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,684
Good night.

49
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,686
Hey. Gennaro Marx, single, 63.
High-school English teacher.

50
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,565
Same exact surgical incisions
as our last victim.

51
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,808
What are the odds
he's got no adrenal glands?

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,809
So, what's he doing with them?

53
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,889
Why?

54
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,209
What's the matter with you?

55
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,164
Why won't you help me, Gerald?

56
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,125
Help me.

57
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,007
Do you have everything you need,
Master Bruce?

58
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,485
Yes.

59
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,847
I can still come with
you, if you want me to.

60
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,565
No.

61
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,930
- Wouldn't be right.
- No, of course.

62
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,886
<i>- I'll</i> be fine, Alfred. You don't have to worry.
- Who said I was worried?

63
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,802
I'll be back before dark.

64
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,128
I've been on this hike before, you know?

65
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,368
Not without your father.

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,047
Come here.

67
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,802
He would've approved, you know...

68
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,846
carrying on the tradition like this.

69
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,602
My father and I stayed overnight.
We woke up early to watch the sunrise.

70
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,970
It's not the same.

71
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,808
Well, maybe next year then.

72
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,324
Well, off you go then.

73
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,442
And then, the worst of it.

74
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,326
Maroni had me locked inside a sedan
and tried to crush me alive.

75
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,763
So, well, you can imagine my concern.

76
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,722
Maroni's not a man to let things go, and I
fear he will come after me in retaliation.

77
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,962
- Were you planning to clean up the place?
- What?

78
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,804
Oh. Uh...

79
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,482
- I can. If you like.
- It needs it.

80
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,085
Is that blood?

81
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,449
Perhaps.

82
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,484
But, Don Falcone...

83
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,049
While you're at it, maybe you could
do something about the design.

84
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,850
The design?

85
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,725
It reeks of Fish Mooney.

86
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,925
What do you think about the lamps?

87
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,044
Don Falcone, maybe you didn't hear me.

88
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,163
I need your protection.

89
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,170
- Maroni will surely try and kill me.
- Yes.

90
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,446
The lamps should go.

91
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,849
Don Falcone, please.

92
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,931
Maroni wants my scalp,
and you'd have me redecorate.

93
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,366
This nightclub makes a lot of money.

94
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,207
Without money, we lose influence.
Without influence, we lose control.

95
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,248
And without control, Maroni killing you
is no longer a hypothetical...

96
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,970
it's a foregone conclusion.

97
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,128
That's why I wanna reopen it.

98
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,930
Under your care.

99
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,681
I can have the club?

100
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,291
- It's mine?
- You've earned it.

101
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,087
Your days of sneaking around
spying on Maroni are over.

102
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,011
You're with me now. Publicly.

103
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,649
Things are gonna be much different.
So spruce up the place. Get it open.

104
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,124
As for Maroni, leave him to me.

105
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,926
What do you got?

106
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,088
Yearbook where the victim taught English.

107
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,887
I'll tell you one thing. Girls didn't look
like this when I was back in high school.

108
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,890
- Easy.
- I'm just saying.

109
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,210
- Hi, Jim.
- Lee. You remember Harvey, right?

110
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,169
- Hi, Lee.
- Hi.

111
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,041
Lee's our new ME.

112
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,605
You're joking.

113
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,644
- No.
- Oh, good. You've met.

114
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,683
Detective Gordon and I know each other.

115
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,282
- Oh, right. From Arkham?
- Right. Arkham.

116
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,084
Welcome aboard.

117
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,520
Thank you.

118
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,609
You can fill her in on your cases later.

119
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,083
Dr. Thompkins, will you follow me?
Lots to get you up to speed on.

120
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,285
- It was good to see you again, detective.
- It was really good to see you, doctor.

121
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,648
- You have no luck at all, do you, brother?
- What do you mean?

122
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,731
You find a fine lady like that, and she
comes to work with you in the same building?

123
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,842
- It's a damn shame.
- Why?

124
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,886
Office romance always ends in tears. Tears.

125
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,880
- It's not gonna be like that.
- Trust me. I know.

126
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,971
There.

127
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,401
Holy mother Mary.

128
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,841
- You got him?
- Staring right back at me.

129
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,725
That's him.
That's him, that's the guy from the pool.

130
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,491
His name is Gerald Crane.
He's a biology teacher.

131
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,167
School doesn't let out for hours. Let's go.

132
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,611
- I'm Kelly.
- Fish.

133
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,442
- Fish?
- That's what I said. Fish.

134
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,648
So where are we? What is this place?

135
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,683
Some people think it's a prison.

136
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,848
Some think it's hell.

137
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,130
I just think it's cold, mostly.

138
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,609
Breakfast.

139
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,444
Ah-ah-ah!

140
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,084
You gotta let the boss eat first.

141
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,169
People call him Mace.

142
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,647
He's the one in charge, huh?

143
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,961
- Okay. Okay
MAN: Get off me. Get off me.

144
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,526
<i>Gerald called in one day
and said he wasn't coming in.</i>

145
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,451
- That's the last I heard of him.
- Let me guess. Three weeks ago?

146
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,610
- Yeah.
- That's when neighbors said he moved out.

147
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,802
Unis searched the place. Nothing.

148
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,004
- So, what can you tell us about Crane?
- He was a good teacher.

149
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,644
Focused. And a good father. He was
very protective of his son, Jonathan.

150
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,083
But he could be quiet too. Somber.

151
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,409
I think it had to do with his wife.
She died six or seven years ago.

152
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,649
- She died. How?
- Uh, car accident.

153
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,961
- Did Crane ever talk about fear or phobias?
- Why?

154
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,725
Is someone targeting phobics?

155
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,650
Yeah.

156
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,410
- Killing them?
- Does this mean something to you?

157
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,371
These victims,
were they missing their adrenal glands?

158
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,806
How'd you know that?

159
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,726
This was an academic paper
Gerald wrote a few months ago.

160
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,251
He asked me to proof it.

161
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,209
See, Gerald had a theory that fear
was an evolutionary flaw in humans.

162
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,530
That war, rape, theft, murder,
it was all caused by fear.

163
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,767
He was obsessed with it.

164
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,209
So Crane killed these people
and took their glands to test a theory?

165
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,961
No. Gerald wasn't trying to prove
he was right about fear.

166
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,922
He was trying to cure himself of it.

167
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,169
Crane's idea of curing fear
was to inoculate himself against it.

168
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,566
- Like a disease?
- Exactly.

169
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,651
In order to do so, he needed a condensed
source of the hormones that cause fear.

170
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,446
- Phobics.
- Crane's preying on them?

171
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,204
Spiking their fear by scaring them and then
killing them in order to harvest hormones.

172
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,566
Damn.

173
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,366
- How much of this stuff does he need?
- What do you mean?

174
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,326
- How many more people is he gonna kill?
- Oh. Of course. Good question.

175
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,603
Depends on how scared he is, I guess.
What's he scared of?

176
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,088
In Scottie's phobia support group,
he said he was afraid of failure.

177
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,083
Who isn't? It's gotta be something else.

178
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,570
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

179
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,009
That we got a new medical examiner.
Much better than the old one.

180
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,884
And she smells nice.

181
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,004
See, Jim? Competition already.

182
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,530
Look at this. Crane developed protocols
for two inoculations.

183
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,087
Himself and somebody else. Subject B.

184
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,124
Ooh. I wonder who that is.

185
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,884
Dad?

186
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,728
Dad, you okay?

187
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,241
I'm glorious.

188
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,804
It's working, Jonathan.

189
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,807
I said it would.

190
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,729
And it's almost your turn.

191
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,248
You will be free of fear forever.

192
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,771
You'll be cured.

193
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,687
Are you ready, Jonathan?
Are you ready, son?

194
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,007
- Thank you for having me.
- My pleasure.

195
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,601
- We're friends, eh?
- Of course.

196
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,882
Then let me talk to you as a friend.

197
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,964
You wanna have lunch, take a walk?
I'm happy to.

198
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,249
But a sandwich and a stroll
ain't gonna keep me from killing Penguin.

199
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,522
That little rat is dead.

200
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,489
So be it.

201
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,851
Mr. Cobblepot, will this do?

202
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,242
We will not be serving that.

203
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,611
No, no, no.

204
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,241
I said lose the drapes, not tie them back.

205
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,842
We're opening in 10 hours.

206
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,771
- Sorry.
- Hey, boss.

207
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,082
Ah. They're ready.

208
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,529
Still warm from the printer.

209
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,731
Nothing can go wrong tonight, Gabe.

210
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,447
This is more than an opening.
It's my moment.

211
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,649
They're perfect.
Take these to everybody on the list.

212
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,328
But not this one.

213
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,410
This one I wanna deliver in person.

214
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,289
I just want a word. I mean no harm.

215
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,330
That's close enough.

216
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,244
No harm, huh?

217
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,484
- So, you're the boss in here?
- I am.

218
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,921
Why you?

219
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,521
I see a lot of tough guys around here.

220
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,205
This is the only blade in the place.

221
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,528
And I'm holding it.

222
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,246
Fair enough.

223
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,644
- I wanna make a deal with you.
- A deal.

224
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,530
Yeah.

225
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,322
I think I might have skills
that could be useful to you.

226
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,363
Really.

227
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,080
What skills, exactly?

228
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,763
All kinds.

229
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,328
You protect me from these animals,
and I'll show you.

230
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,922
You think you're worth protecting?

231
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,284
You have no idea.

232
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,445
Huh.

233
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,283
- Can I help you?
- I don't think so. Can you?

234
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,365
What do you want?

235
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,843
What I want the poor have,
the rich need and if you eat it you'll die.

236
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,971
Is this...? Are you asking me a riddle?

237
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,049
- Do you like riddles?
- No.

238
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,726
So, do you give UP?

239
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,526
Friend, lo0kit...

240
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,849
Nothing. The answer is nothing.
The poor have it, the rich need it...

241
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,130
- Who are you?
- Edward Nygma.

242
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,240
I know who you are.

243
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,768
Then you know
that you're standing too close.

244
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,448
You know male emperor penguins
keep their eggs warm...

245
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,762
by balancing them on their feet?

246
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,803
Isn't that neat?

247
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,281
Nice to meet you, sir.

248
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,369
Keep moving.

249
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,490
Will do.

250
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,966
Cell-phone records?

251
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,571
And credit-card statements.

252
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,489
- Give me a hand.
- Yeah, sure.

253
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,446
- Uh, give me a minute.
- Take your time.

254
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,964
- It's good to see you, old friend.
- What are you doing here?

255
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,449
I wanted to invite you
to a party I'm hosting.

256
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,886
No, thanks.

257
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,481
I hear you. Too busy, I suppose.

258
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,251
Are you on a tricky case?
Anything I can help you with?

259
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,606
It worked so well the last time.

260
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,882
I don't want your help.

261
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,881
It was a mistake to ask.

262
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,447
I don't want you coming here.

263
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,811
You shouldn't treat me this way, Jim.

264
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,130
One day soon, you'll need my help.
You'll come to me.

265
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,288
And walking with a friend in the dark
is better than walking alone in the light.

266
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,003
Good luck with your police work.

267
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,883
And please, reconsider my invitation.

268
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,600
It won't be the same without you.

269
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,763
Do you trust me?

270
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,765
Of course.

271
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,162
I love you, son.
I wouldn't do anything to harm you.

272
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,727
Just go. Go ahead.

273
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,807
You're being a very good boy.

274
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,327
Yes, don't struggle. Look at me.
Look in my eyes.

275
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,411
Ow!

276
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,243
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

277
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,562
- How's your first day going?
- Busy.

278
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,726
- Good, good. I've gotta get back, so...
- Yeah, hey.

279
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,649
Lee.

280
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,287
We can't do that here.

281
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,201
- Why? You kissed me in the bullpen.
- You weren't working here then.

282
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,687
- That makes a difference?
- It's not professional.

283
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,245
Well, I should hope not.

284
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,601
Lee.

285
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,085
Oops.

286
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,090
- Hey, Bullock.
- Sorry to interrupt.

287
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,520
What's up?

288
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,969
Nothing that can't wait on your love life.
Just business.

289
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,849
How does a cigar sound?
I've got some beautiful Castros...

290
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,405
I've been waiting to try.

291
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,321
Carmine, talk straight with me.
Why you doing this?

292
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,807
Granted Penguin is a money-maker.

293
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,049
How come you laying all this grease on me
to keep him alive?

294
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,691
What's your angle?

295
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,166
He's clever.

296
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,682
And I like to have a clever man beside me
who knows his place in life.

297
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,565
- You know how that goes.
- Yeah, all day.

298
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,085
He's clever enough to know that a little
man like him is never going to be the boss.

299
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,691
True enough.

300
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,366
So I'm supposed to give you
a prime asset like that...

301
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,404
and you're gonna bring out
some nice old cigars?

302
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,042
Heh. Of course, I'll show my gratitude
to you in a more formal way.

303
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,766
This is not a money thing.

304
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,009
- This is personal.
- I understand.

305
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,362
Do you know
Chief Judge Stanley Turnbull?

306
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,369
Of course.

307
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,131
He's the meanest son-of-a-mother bitch
in the courthouse.

308
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,762
Yes. A hard and righteous man.

309
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,486
- Powerful too.
- Put down some good friends of mine.

310
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,806
You bring me his ugly head
and, say, 200 grand, and you got a deal.

311
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,604
Oh, I'll give you a better
deal than his head.

312
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,964
On my mother's life.

313
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,969
Judge Turnbull.

314
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,568
He was out with the young man.
I had him drugged and brought here.

315
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,845
Now he's all yours.

316
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,290
Mine?

317
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,522
I mean, we'll share him, of course.
But, uh, in spirit, he's yours.

318
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,210
Now smile for the camera.

319
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,610
It's beautiful.

320
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,087
We must be missing something.

321
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,044
What about your pal, Penguin?

322
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,006
What about him?

323
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,281
He helped us with Flass.

324
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,002
- Maybe he'll help us with Crane.
- No. I'm not going back to him.

325
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,328
- It's worth a try.
- No, it's not.

326
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,411
Then we wait for another body to drop,
because we're not gonna find him here.

327
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,011
Yeah, you're right.

328
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,242
We're never gonna be able to track Crane.

329
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,326
We gotta get ahead of him
by finding out what's driving him.

330
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,729
We know what's driving him.
He's obsessed with fear.

331
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,564
Yeah, but why?

332
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,207
What's he afraid of? What happened to him
that made him this way?

333
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,926
His wife was killed in a car crash.

334
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,046
Yeah. Let's check that out.

335
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,562
- Got it. Karen Crane.
- Yeah.

336
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,843
Says here she died in a house fire,
not a car accident.

337
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,883
You think the coworker was lying?

338
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,162
Three other people said the same thing.

339
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,209
Crane must've lied about it
for some reason.

340
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,686
What happened in the fire?

341
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,326
Says she was sleeping
when the fire broke out.

342
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,809
Her husband, Gerald and son,
Jonathan, 8, were downstairs.

343
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,520
Crane was in the house when his wife died?

344
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,045
And didn't save her.

345
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,527
- No wonder he lied.
- He's ashamed.

346
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,803
His fear is the reason his wife died.
That's why he's doing this.

347
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,082
Address for the old Crane house. Let's go.

348
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,763
Jonathan?

349
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,648
Jonathan?

350
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,891
Stop, Johnny. Stop! Stop there!

351
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,321
We've started the protocol.

352
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,364
It must be completed.
It will be harmful for you otherwise.

353
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,002
- I can't do it again.
- Think of it, Johnny. No more fear.

354
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,727
- I'm not even afraid like you.
- We're all afraid.

355
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,490
Every man and woman on the planet.

356
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,570
We're all standing at the edge
of the abyss, paralyzed by fear.

357
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,683
Come on, son. Trust me.
I just want to help you. And mankind.

358
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,930
Mankind, Johnny.
Now, you must be brave, hmm?

359
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,004
Come on, son. Are you with me?

360
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,164
Then let's go back to the house. It'll all
be over before you know it. I promise.

361
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,090
Come on.

362
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,728
What's up, doc?

363
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,848
The name's Mace.

364
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,806
That's cute,
but I like to give my friends nicknames.

365
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,367
And yours is "doc"...

366
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,531
because you have a wise look
in your eyes for such a big man.

367
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,961
A real little firecracker, huh?

368
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,441
Hmm.

369
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,486
A firecracker goes off once,
and then just lies there.

370
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,968
What you're looking at
is the Fourth of July.

371
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,280
Come sit by me.

372
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,006
- Does that mean we have a deal?
- Sure, baby.

373
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,328
I have a couple of riders
I would like to talk...

374
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,124
Hush now, baby.

375
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,005
You talk too much, and you'll make me mad.

376
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,964
Hmm, let's see.

377
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,563
That's rider number one.
Don't call me baby.

378
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,727
Ah!

379
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,406
My name is Fish Mooney.

380
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,691
I'm in charge now.

381
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,926
No, no, no.

382
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,281
Dad, we have to go now.

383
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,763
Dad, they're going to arrest you
once they come in. We have to go.

384
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,122
There's time. We can complete the protocol.

385
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,767
Coming in.

386
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,321
- What are you doing?
- We have to finish the protocol.

387
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,727
- It's the only way.
- Dad, that's too much.

388
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,088
It's the only way.

389
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,210
Dad.

390
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,480
- There's not enough time.
- It'll be fine.

391
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,803
- I love you, son.
- Stop!

392
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,090
Hands where we can see them!

393
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,284
Hands in the air or we'll shoot!

394
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,407
- You think I'm afraid of you?
- Not another step.

395
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,965
Afraid of your guns?

396
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,283
I have no fear.

397
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,487
You take him. I get the kid.

398
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,168
Call an ambulance.

399
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,931
Call an ambulance.

400
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,606
It's all right, son. It's all right.

401
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,162
Hello there, Master Bruce.
Well, you certainly took your time.

402
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,404
What, you stop off for a pie and a pint
on the way out, did you?

403
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,364
How long have you been there?

404
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,131
I don't know, about an hour.

405
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,005
Just when you were started climbing up
that really nasty hill.

406
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,087
- Well, thanks for your help.
- Yeah, I never got you down there, did I?

407
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,564
Are you all right?

408
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,971
Come here.

409
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,442
I'm cold, I'm tired and
my ankle's sprained.

410
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,045
Oh.

411
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,284
I just wanna go home.

412
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,170
You wanna go home...

413
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,683
or do you wanna wait
and watch the sunrise?

414
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,450
Like you did with your dad?

415
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,690
Well, Alfred, you can only stay
if you think you can handle it.

416
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,329
If I can handle it?

417
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,889
Mate, this place is positively cushy...

418
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,004
compared to some of the places
I've slept at.

419
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,204
Cup of tea, you cheeky monkey?

420
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,761
<i>No more heroes anymore</i>

421
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,485
<i>No more heroes anymore</i>

422
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,043
<i>No more heroes anymore</i>

423
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,527
<i>No more heroes anymore</i>

424
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,041
<i>No more heroes anymore</i>

425
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,726
<i>No more heroes anymore</i>

426
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,446
<i>No more heroes anymore</i>

427
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,325
<i>No more heroes anymore</i>

428
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,207
Penguin.

429
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,123
Where you going?

430
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,804
Don Maroni. It's such a
pleasure to see you.

431
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,881
Look at you. From the trunk of my car
to running your own club.

432
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,445
The place looks good, Penguin.

433
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,641
Hell of a turnout.

434
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,327
Yeah.

435
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,326
How about a table? Drinks?
My compliments, of course.

436
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,969
Expensive stuff. Let me see.

437
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,810
I had a little chat with Falcone.

438
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,245
I came here to let you know
that all is kosher between us.

439
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,002
As long as you don't go giving Falcone
any more of my secrets.

440
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,890
No.

441
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,366
Nothing like that.

442
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,040
Of course not. Grab a glass.

443
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,326
You better hope that old man Falcone
lives a long life.

444
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,361
Because the second he's out of the picture,
so are you.

445
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,969
Master B.

446
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,448
Sunrise.

447
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,201
Oh, hey. How are you?
I heard your suspect was killed.

448
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,483
He came after Harvey and me with a gun.
We didn't have a choice.

449
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,763
I'm so sorry. What about his son?

450
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,684
Paramedics were able to stabilize him.

451
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,082
I'm heading to the hospital
to check in on him.

452
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,769
- Well, let me know how he is.
- I will.

453
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,050
So all settled in here, huh?

454
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,328
Uh, almost.

455
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,650
- Think you're gonna like it here?
- I do, so far.

456
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,645
Good.

457
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,727
Um, I have tickets to the circus.
Do you wanna come with me?

458
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,491
- A circus?
- Yeah, they're good.

459
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,524
No, uh, sad elephants. Heh.

460
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,609
Circus, sure. Why not. Look, Lee...

461
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,526
Um...

462
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,167
No kissing here on the job, okay?
I'm serious.

463
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,204
"Okay" Okay?

464
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,051
If your hardass reputation
is worth that much to you.

465
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,686
- This is a place of work.
- Cops have feelings too.

466
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,647
- It's not unprofessional to show feelings.
- Yeah, it is. Those kinds of feelings. Yeah.

467
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,164
Fine. Be that way.

468
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,081
<i>Hey-</i>

469
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,047
I'm just joking. I'll be discreet.

470
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,487
All right, everyone, gather around.

471
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,080
Up until now, there's
been no order in here.

472
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,088
No structure.

473
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,161
Things are gonna change.

474
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,566
She's back.

475
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,609
MY eyes.

476
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,929
They took my eyes.

477
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,444
The boy received a massive dose
of condensed hormones.

478
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,961
Cortisol, adrenalin and another compound
we're still trying to identify.

479
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,322
The combination nearly killed him.

480
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,883
But he's gonna live?

481
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,607
Yes.

482
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,407
But we ran a CAT scan in order to
determine if he suffered any brain damage.

483
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,444
The results, we've never seen
anything like them before.

484
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,641
The hormones themselves
have long since worn off.

485
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,128
But the effects, they seem to be lingering.

486
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,167
What are you saying?
That he's still in fear?

487
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,964
Well, not just fear.

488
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,290
Jonathan's brain activity shows
he's in a constant state of intense terror.

489
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,725
- How long until this goes away?
- Well, that's just the thing, detective.

490
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,924
We can't be certain it ever will.

491
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,329
Imagine the thing
you fear most in the world.

492
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,526
Imagine that's all you see.

493
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,722
Every waking hour.

494
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,411
No.No.No.
