1
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,568
Doctor's log.

2
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:53,153
It's day 243 in this...

3
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:56,031
portobello purgatory.

4
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:59,243
My only companion is a rock I named Stone.

5
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,167
The question is,
for whom am I narrating this?

6
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:11,755
It seems I've become a featured player
in the theater of the absurd.

7
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:15,133
Marooned in deep space
by that wretched blue rodent.

8
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:19,596
But it's all good, thanks to a breathable
atmosphere and my supreme intellect,

9
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,933
sharpened against the only competitor
savvy enough to bring it.

10
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,518
Chanterelle to d4.

11
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,772
I've been striving to make fungi
Info a functional drink of choice...

12
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,315
Mushroom coffee.

13
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,444
...with limited...

14
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,988
limited...

15
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,200
limited...

16
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,244
SUCCESS.

17
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,500
But today, day 243,

18
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:51,837
has brought a new optimism
to my most pressing endeavor--

19
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:56,421
Planet us exodus to returnicus
and kick blue butticus.

20
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,392
If my calculations are correct,

21
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,020
and there's no reason to say "if"
because they always are...

22
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,317
this quill is going to power
my masterpiece.

23
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,987
Let's light this candle...

24
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,366
and see who comes a-knockin'.

25
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,308
Greetings!

26
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,108
Klaatu barada nikto.

27
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,787
Agent Stone? Now!

28
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,007
Thank you, Stone.

29
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,551
It's time to say goodbye
to this piece-of-shiitake planet!

30
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:33,623
Where did you get that?

31
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,130
From a little blue menace
on the planet called Earth.

32
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:44,926
I'd be happy to show you the way.

33
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,879
They're still on us.

34
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:23,089
This'll slow 'em down.

35
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,785
Watch out. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Coming through.

36
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,455
Good evening, gentlemen. Mind if I drive?

37
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,334
Better buckle up.

38
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,844
How we doing back there?

39
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,137
And now this way.

40
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,983
I'm sorry. I don't speak duct tape.

41
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,069
-What the heck are you?
-Fear not, citizen.

42
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:30,157
I am the hero you need
and the hero you deserve.

43
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,700
The blue dawn that banishes the darkest--

44
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,952
Holy crap!

45
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,709
Don't worry. Nobody's gonna get hurt.

46
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,466
-What are those?
-Bombs. Bombs.

47
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:49,050
They're bombs! Those are bombs!

48
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,302
Relax. They're not even lit.

49
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,223
So I'll say again, nobody's gonna get--

50
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,810
I was wrong! We're all gonna die!

51
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,772
Why aren't you slowing down?

52
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,606
That would require brakes.

53
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,362
It's hot. Hot, hot, hot!

54
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,155
Why don't you just let
the police handle this?

55
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,200
Because that's not what heroes do.

56
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,164
Thank you very much.
Please hold your applause.

57
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,921
Do you hear that? There's one bomb left.

58
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:28,673
Uh-oh.

59
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:31,384
-Did you check under the seat?
-Of course I checked under the seat!

60
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,971
You are terrible at this!

61
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,974
You know what? Your negative attitude
is not helping anyone.

62
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,018
It's in your spiky things!

63
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,689
I can never find anything in here.

64
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:47,650
Drained it from downtown!

65
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,321
See? I told you nobody would get hurt.

66
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,700
Holy sherbet!

67
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:58,953
Oh, hello.

68
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,749
Don't panic. This is only a drill.

69
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,877
-Come here!
-No need to thank me, citizens.

70
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:50,338
All in a night's work for...

71
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,883
Blue Justice!

72
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,385
You're a terrible hero!

73
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:09,524
-Morning, Wade!
-Morning, Sonic!

74
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,993
Good morning, Green Hills!

75
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,055
Come on.

76
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,683
Uh-oh.

77
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,121
Sonic.

78
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:05,872
I miss you, Longclaw.

79
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,541
I'm trying to make you proud.

80
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,638
And now for a little shut-eye.

81
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,519
Ozzy, morning breath!

82
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,521
Sonic. Are you still in bed?

83
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,981
You're supposed to meet Tom, remember?

84
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:37,403
All right, all right, I'm up! I'm up.

85
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,114
What a day.

86
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,327
Thanks for coming out, bud.

87
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,498
I feel like you and me,
we haven't had much time together lately.

88
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,211
How's it going over there?
You getting any bites?

89
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,679
I can't swim! Help!

90
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,431
If I die, don't look in my closet!

91
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,726
Hey, hey, you're good.
You're all right. Come on.

92
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,938
-It's freezing.
-All right, okay. Take it easy.

93
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:14,732
You're good. Okay.

94
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,447
But now that you've had a nap and a bath...

95
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:25,576
I went up to your room last night
to bring you some new comics and...

96
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:31,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.

97
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,917
[ Wouldn't come any closer,

98
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:36,004
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

99
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,214
Oh, no. Oh, no.

100
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,216
I'm so embarrassed. Get out of here quick!

101
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,759
Oh, no, here comes another one!

102
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,679
Go. Now. Save yourself.

103
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,139
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.

104
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,474
[ Wouldn't come any closer,

105
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:50,601
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

106
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,812
Oh, no. Oh, no.

107
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,355
I'm so embarrassed. Get out of here--

108
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,608
I knew I should've used real farts.

109
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,363
-How many times are we gonna do this?
-What?

110
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,990
Cast your line and not catch anything?
Seems like a billion.

111
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,909
I think you know what I'm talking about.

112
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,995
The lying. The sneaking out.

113
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,371
The pretending to be Batman.

114
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:13,332
-Blue Justice, trademark pending.
-Whatever. You're being reckless.

115
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,626
Not this conversation again.

116
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,504
Hey. It's no fun for me, either.

117
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:20,298
But if you keep being irresponsible,
we're gonna keep having this conversation.

118
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,425
How is it irresponsible to use my powers?

119
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,553
Sonic, you destroyed an entire city block!

120
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:28,556
That block was already messed up.
Who cares?

121
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,185
Look, I stopped a robbery. I was a hero.

122
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,188
No, you put people in danger
and that's not what a hero does.

123
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,235
You're supposed to be my friend.

124
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,153
Stop trying to be my dad.

125
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,076
I can take care of myself.

126
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,661
Sonic, taking care of yourself
is not what being a hero's all about.

127
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,917
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

128
00:13:57,252 --> 00:14:00,338
And right now, whether you want to hear
this or not, you are still just a kid.

129
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:04,759
You got some more growing up to do
before you're ready to be the big hero.

130
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,178
But trust me when I tell you,

131
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,722
there will come a time
when your powers will be needed.

132
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,560
But you don't choose that moment.

133
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,313
That moment chooses you.

134
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,316
Look at you.

135
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,692
Look at that. I just got goose bumps.

136
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,986
Wait a second.
Did you steal that from Oprah?

137
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,448
No, sir.
That is a Wachowski family special.

138
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,036
Came from my dad,
in this very boat, on this very lake.

139
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,956
He would always try and steer me
in the right direction.

140
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,834
And that's what Maddie and I
have always tried to do with you.

141
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,130
So, until your moment arrives,

142
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,759
I want you to work on
being a little more responsible.

143
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,303
Comprende?

144
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,347
Comprende.

145
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,432
High five on it.

146
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,645
Yeah! Donut Lord and the Blue Blur
are back at it again!

147
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:57,895
Hang on.

148
00:14:58,438 --> 00:14:59,564
Speedboat!

149
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,820
Sonic!

150
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,783
How excited are you,
going to Hawaii with me?

151
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,034
Oh, yeah!

152
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:14,913
Wow.

153
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:18,833
Welcome to Sonic Air,
the fastest way to travel.

154
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,293
Now boarding groups one and two.

155
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,382
Sonic, this is so fun!

156
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,717
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're group three.
Please wait your turn.

157
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,304
-Anyone from groups one and two? Nobody?
-Just let him get it out of his system.

158
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,556
Okay, then everybody else right this way.

159
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:35,308
Thank you.

160
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,356
And you, sir?

161
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,525
Terrible shirt detected.

162
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:45,610
There we go.

163
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,155
Okay, you're free to go. Enjoy your trip.
Bye-bye now.

164
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,991
Okay.

165
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,909
Bring it in.

166
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,162
Tom, I'm about to be
hedgehog of the house for the first time.

167
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,581
I think I'm a little mature
to hug you goodbye.

168
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:00,583
Okay, what about a power bump?

169
00:16:01,084 --> 00:16:02,960
-Power bump?
-Yes, power bump.

170
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,712
That's more like it.

171
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,005
-Wachowski!
-Wachowski!

172
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,592
Okay, use this one to get back home.

173
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:13,137
All right, we're off. Be good.

174
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:15,097
Yes. You have our number.

175
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,934
Sorry! Can't hear you! You're traveling
through a cross-dimensional portal!

176
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,436
-Miss you already!
-Okay?

177
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,103
Have fun at Rachel's wedding!

178
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,024
Okay, it's 48 hours until they come back.

179
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:29,070
We've got TV channels, streaming channels,
a house full of food and no supervision.

180
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,573
Let's do this.

181
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:02,288
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

182
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,498
I found him!

183
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,709
I just hope I'm not too late.

184
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:25,186
He's close.

185
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,605
I just need a way to reach him
without being spotted.

186
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,444
Standard human transport. Perfect.

187
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,999
Oh, boy.

188
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,630
Aloha!

189
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,799
-How's it going, bud?
-Oh, you know.

190
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,969
Just a quiet night at home,
settling in with a good book.

191
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,930
-And you? What's up with you?
-I was just calling to say we're here.

192
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,433
But now every word out of your mouth
ls making me suspicious.

193
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:04,558
What?

194
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,772
You got to relax, buddy.
You're at the Four Seasons Oahu.

195
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:11,274
Have a mai tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

196
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,193
Get sunburned somewhere embarrassing.

197
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:15,695
This weekend is about you.

198
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,364
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.

199
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,866
So whatever it is you're doing,

200
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,451
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?

201
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:27,035
Exactly! I mean, I am deeply offended
by such accusations!

202
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:28,958
So, how's Rachel's fiancé?

203
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,128
ls he as good-looking in person
as he is in pictures?

204
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,589
Somehow better-looking.

205
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,551
Wow! You're about to be
the third best-looking dude in the family.

206
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,470
But, hey, still on the podium.

207
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,098
All right,
I better go and introduce myself.

208
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,142
Stay out of trouble.

209
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:50,688
Trouble? Don't worry.
Everything here is completely normal.

210
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,231
Uh-huh. Night, bud.

211
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,109
Hey! I was just coming over to say hi.

212
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,945
You've got a lot of nerve coming up
in here after what you did to my fiancée.

213
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,074
-Wait. What?
-Totaling her car?

214
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:04,326
Leaving her tied to a chair?
I should rip you limb from limb.

215
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,249
Oh, my God, look at your face!

216
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,251
Tommy, breathe, baby. Breathe.
I was kidding.

217
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,253
-Hey, man, I was totally kidding.
-Okay.

218
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,841
-You were kidding.
-Yeah.

219
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:20,760
I'm sorry. Rachel put me up to it.
It was totally her idea.

220
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:22,636
That rascal.

221
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,850
Listen, I don't know if you're aware.
Rachel does not care for you at all.

222
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,935
I'm aware. Yeah.

223
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,688
Seriously, bro, you got work to do.

224
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,230
-Hey!
-Hey.

225
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:35,607
Good to see you! Thanks for coming, Tom.

226
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,735
-Really glad you came.
-Really?

227
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,739
Great to see you, too. Congratulations.

228
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,283
I mean, you guys seem
really happy together.

229
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,951
You know, you're all right,
Thomas Wachowski.

230
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,247
-Can we bury the hatchet?
-I'd love that.

231
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:51,832
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

232
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,376
-All right, bring it in!
-All right! Great.

233
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,755
And if you screw up my wedding,
I will end you.

234
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,720
All right, Ozzy,
it's movie night at Casa de Sonic,

235
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:06,055
and it's your turn to pick.

236
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,683
But I am not watching Snow Dogs again.

237
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,436
That movie is the worst!

238
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,648
Blackout!

239
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,193
Ozzy.

240
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,446
Sorry, buddy. Everything's okay.

241
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:31,622
Excuse me. We did not order a poltergeist.

242
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,470
If this is the pizza guy,
this is really unprofessional.

243
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,613
Eggman?

244
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:11,036
Hello, hedgehog.

245
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,622
Did you miss me?

246
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:19,336
I don't know how you got back,
but you made a big mistake coming here.

247
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,256
Au conftraire, mon frere.

248
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,301
The mistake was thinking you'd won.

249
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,845
But that was just a prelude,
an hors d'oeuvre,

250
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,097
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

251
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:31,473
I get it.

252
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,602
I don't think you do.

253
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,604
But you're about to.

254
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,232
And so will that idiot sheriff
and his wife.

255
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,361
And your little dog too!

256
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,714
Pitiful.

257
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:06,425
What? Who are you?

258
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,597
Where are my manners?

259
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,684
Sonic, meet Knuckles.

260
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,977
My new BFFAE.

261
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:20,439
Bestest friend forever and ever!

262
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:23,651
Look, Robotnik, I don't care
who you brought to help you.

263
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,570
You're never going to get my power.

264
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:28,238
Do I look like I need your power?

265
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:43,003
So nice when diabolical evil
lives up to the hype.

266
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,341
Where is it?

267
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,469
You want it? Here it comes.

268
00:23:50,553 --> 00:23:55,053
I was expecting more of you.
You're unskilled.

269
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,310
Untrained.

270
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:01,188
And unworthy!

271
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,194
You forgot one. Unstoppable.

272
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:35,973
It is my destiny
to do what my ancestors could not--

273
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:40,227
To restore the ultimate power
to the home of my people.

274
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,773
Ultimate power?
I don't know what you're talking about.

275
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:46,066
You've got the wrong guy.

276
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,318
Ultimate power?

277
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,614
Now you're speaking my language.

278
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,867
Don't play dumb with me,
apprentice of Longclaw.

279
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,410
You knew Longclaw?

280
00:24:56,494 --> 00:25:00,623
Longclaw and her people were
the sworn enemy of my tribe, the Echidna.

281
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:05,207
We fought and died at their hands,
and now you will die at mine.

282
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,557
Come on. Get in! I'm on your side.

283
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:20,559
I'm sorry. Who are you?

284
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,521
You know what? It doesn't matter.

285
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:28,108
Get us out of here! Go, go, go!

286
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:33,322
He's gone rabid!

287
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,993
Gross! Is he licking it?

288
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:39,494
See ya!

289
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,872
Make sure to get your shots, Eggman!

290
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:59,432
Wow. Okay. Let me just say
it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.

291
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,058
Is it okay if I call you Sonic?

292
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,894
Everyone calls me Tails.
You're probably wondering why.

293
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:06,355
Let me guess. Because of the extra tail?

294
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,357
That's right!
I should've known you'd get that.

295
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,153
Cool. Also, what is going on?
Robotnik's back?

296
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:14,696
And who is
Clifford the Big Red Rage Monster?

297
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:17,324
That's Knuckles, the last of the Echidnas

298
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,827
and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.

299
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,996
He's obsessed with finding
the Master Emerald.

300
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,415
Are you serious? The Master Emerald?

301
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,125
That's just a bedtime story.

302
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,627
Well, he believes it's real.

303
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,003
And he must think
you're the key to finding it.

304
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,050
Red light! Give me the wheel!

305
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,968
-Hey, what are you--
-Move your foot.

306
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,018
I think we lost him.

307
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,529
We did not lose him.
We definitely did not lose him!

308
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,953
I've got an idea. Do you trust me?

309
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:05,247
Of course not! I literally just met you!

310
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:07,416
-Just let me-- Come on!
-What are you doing?

311
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,645
We're flying.

312
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:30,439
Did your butt just turn into a helicopter?

313
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,442
A butt-copter!

314
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:37,362
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could come up with something like that.

315
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:54,629
Foxy move.

316
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,925
You want something done right...

317
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:02,221
you have to hire someone
you can push around.

318
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,265
All caps.

319
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,910
Doctor,

320
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:26,954
where are you?

321
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,795
Freak.

322
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,347
I'm sorry, folks.

323
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,808
I have to close early. Everybody out!

324
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,978
Everybody out.
Thank you for visiting the Mean Bean.

325
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,105
All right, good night. Good night.

326
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,333
He's back.

327
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,046
He's back!

328
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:14,019
That's more like it.

329
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,857
I've been re-hatched!

330
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,910
So, my massively metacarpaled friend,

331
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,374
you mentioned...

332
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:39,253
ultimate power.

333
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,338
Back at the house?

334
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,047
The Master Emerald?

335
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,507
It does not concern you.

336
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,594
I got you off that planet
and you brought me to the hedgehog.

337
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,762
We have no more use for each other.

338
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,181
Well, I hate to be a contrarian, but...

339
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:53,225
I think we might.

340
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,187
You think these machines
are a match for me?

341
00:30:57,271 --> 00:31:00,732
I will shatter them
like the bones from a fallen--

342
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,735
They are stairs.

343
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:12,619
You see, Earth is my turf, G.

344
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,872
If you don't know how to floss,
you'll be lost without me.

345
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:18,500
I understand nothing
of what you just said.

346
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:22,963
I help you retrieve the Emerald,
and you use it to...

347
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:28,756
destroy the hedgehog!

348
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,680
You're suggesting an alliance.

349
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:35,893
Around here we simply
grip each other's hands tightly.

350
00:31:41,273 --> 00:31:44,901
You truculent space bumpkin!

351
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:47,153
You've crushed my favorite hand!

352
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,740
Really? My hand is uninjured.

353
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,202
But I'm now convinced of your commitment.

354
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,203
"Oh, goody,"

355
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:58,790
he exclaimed,
while he reset two of his knuckles.

356
00:31:58,874 --> 00:32:01,209
I'm...

357
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:05,793
delighted to be on the same team.

358
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,432
Road trip!

359
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:18,059
I'll let you stick your nose
out the window.

360
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,022
Sonic, where are we?

361
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,483
Welcome to the Wade Cave.

362
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,611
Which is something
I hope to someday say to a woman.

363
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,363
A woman who's not my mom.

364
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,407
Wade, focus.

365
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,202
We need to figure out why Knuckles thinks
I'm the key to finding the Master Emerald.

366
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,204
And why did he mention Longclaw?

367
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:40,040
There must be a connection.

368
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:42,042
Wait a minute. There is.

369
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:46,505
Look. There's an emerald symbol
on the map Longclaw gave me.

370
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,465
I never knew what it meant before.

371
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,843
Something's happening.

372
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,357
Longclaw?

373
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,984
Hello, Sonic.

374
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:10,445
If you're watching this,
then something has happened to me.

375
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,365
And I pray
you've made it to Earth unharmed.

376
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:18,161
This world has been chosen
for a very important reason.

377
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:21,873
It's the secret location
of the Master Emerald.

378
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:27,629
The Emerald has the power
to turn thoughts into reality.

379
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,632
Like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
from Ghostbusters.

380
00:33:31,383 --> 00:33:35,470
In the wrong hands it could threaten
all life in the universe.

381
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:38,473
Protecting the Emerald was my sacred duty.

382
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:42,227
And now I must pass
that responsibility to you.

383
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,023
This is my moment.

384
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:49,567
Follow the map, find the Emerald,
and keep it safe.

385
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,737
My dear Sonic,

386
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,781
you have a heart
like no creature I've ever known.

387
00:33:55,407 --> 00:33:57,075
I love you so much.

388
00:33:58,744 --> 00:33:59,953
Goodbye.

389
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,123
No, no, wait.

390
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,132
I won't let you down, Longclaw.

391
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,221
So is that your dad?

392
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:18,763
What?

393
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:19,722
No?

394
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:23,435
According to this map,
the first clue is in Siberia.

395
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,812
It's a compass
that will lead to the Emerald.

396
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:28,815
And with Knuckles already here,
it's a race.

397
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:29,900
Knuckles?

398
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,444
I knew a kid in middle school
named Knuckles.

399
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,363
Could fit his whole fist in his mouth.

400
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:38,575
If this is the same Knuckles,
we are screwed.

401
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,078
This Knuckles, that Knuckles.
It doesn't matter.

402
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:42,829
We're gonna get there first.

403
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,584
What do you mean, "we"?

404
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,960
You're coming with me.

405
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:50,378
No, no, no.

406
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:53,673
I just came here to warn you.
I'm not a field guy.

407
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:57,552
Don't worry. I got your back.
I won't let anything happen to you.

408
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,766
It's a power bump.
On Earth, it means an unbreakable promise.

409
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,561
Okay, I'm in.

410
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,662
Doctor. It's really you.

411
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,123
You look different.

412
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,418
Papa's got a brand new 'stache.

413
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:36,174
I knew it. I knew it!
I knew you'd come back, sir.

414
00:35:36,258 --> 00:35:38,677
I never stopped steaming
your Austrian goat's milk.

415
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,934
Could use some mushroom.

416
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:48,978
You brought something.

417
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,524
Some kind of space porcupine.

418
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,028
Porcupine? I am an Echidna!

419
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:58,696
Trained since birth
in all forms of lethal combat,

420
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,991
destined to restore honor to my tribe,

421
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,870
and willing to destroy
anything that gets in my way.

422
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,872
Welcome to the team.

423
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,005
That means he trusts you, Stone.

424
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,342
Now let's renovate this dump!

425
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:21,344
Latte with steamed Austrian goat milk!

426
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,908
Good one. Solid.

427
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,458
-Sorry, fellas.
-That's game!

428
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,210
That's how we do!

429
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,172
-But are they good at math?
-Teamwork makes the dream work!

430
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,132
Sorry about that, Big Tom.

431
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:01,801
-Are you good?
-All good. Fine.

432
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:04,929
Thanks for inviting me out to hang
with you and your groomsmen.

433
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:06,514
Good quality bonding.

434
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,308
You know, bro,

435
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,894
those guys right there,
they're way more than my groomsmen.

436
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,104
That's my squad.

437
00:37:12,187 --> 00:37:14,230
Never would've made it through life
without 'em.

438
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:15,356
Get over here!

439
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,151
Yeah, I'm coming!

440
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,446
-I'll catch you later.
-Hey. Yeah!

441
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,822
Let me know if you're ready
for some power yoga.

442
00:37:22,906 --> 00:37:25,950
-You bet.
-Come on, Tommy boy. Let's go.

443
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:27,076
Don't make me.

444
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,246
What am I doing?

445
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:30,621
Hey, Uncle Tommy!

446
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,207
Hey, girls!

447
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,127
-How you do-- Are those the wedding rings?
-Uh-huh.

448
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,712
May 1?

449
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:40,256
This little ring bearer
has been taking her job very seriously.

450
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,675
-She's been practicing all morning.
-I can see that.

451
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,137
How very responsible of you.

452
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,888
Except aren't there supposed
to be two wedding rings?

453
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:48,640
Uh-oh.

454
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,312
-Uncle Tommy?
-Hang on. What's going on here?

455
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,940
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

456
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,066
Bye.

457
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,526
-Hey, baby

458
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:04,656
That's right! Groom in the building!

459
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,199
Look at those guys.

460
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,202
I wish Sonic had that.

461
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,954
-Muscles?
-Control yourself.

462
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,667
No. Buddies. Wingmen. A squad.

463
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:19,254
Sonic doesn't have anything like that.
He's flying solo.

464
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,090
Baby, you got to relax.

465
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,384
You're at the Four Seasons.

466
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,387
Have a mai tai.
Spend some time with your wife.

467
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,557
That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.

468
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,686
See? He's a smart kid. He'll find his way.

469
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,356
I absolutely cannot find my way.

470
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,776
We are completely, totally,
unequivocally lost.

471
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,696
Sonic, in this weather,

472
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,783
there's no way we're gonna get
any readings on this thing!

473
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:49,617
-Should we go back?
-No, no, no.

474
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:52,954
There's a light up ahead.
Maybe we can take shelter in there.

475
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,628
Perfect.

476
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:02,880
Are you sure about this?
We don't know who's inside.

477
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,218
Don't worry.
On Earth, people are very welcoming,

478
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:09,679
and love taking complete strangers
into their homes.

479
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:40,794
Run.

480
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,006
Table for two, please!

481
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,344
What would you like to order?

482
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,138
Two beef stews, please.

483
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,771
-Where'd you get all these cool gadgets?
-I invented 'em.

484
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,773
That's kinda my thing.

485
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,317
In fact,
my inventions are how I discovered you.

486
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,487
Remember that night at the baseball field?

487
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,283
Your energy blast reached all the way
to my home planet.

488
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:15,866
I saw you save your whole village
from that crazy mustache guy.

489
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,290
Wait, so you've been watching me
this whole time?

490
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:20,958
Even in the shower?

491
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,961
That's a trick question.

492
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,255
Sonic the Hedgehog prefers bubble baths.

493
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,673
Man, you're good!

494
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,217
When I learned Knuckles was on your trail,

495
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:32,137
I knew I couldn't just sit back
and watch anymore.

496
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,679
I had to come warn you.

497
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,600
What? Hang on one sec.

498
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:38,267
Donut Lord is checking in.

499
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,899
"Just chilling. Watching TV."

500
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:46,150
Dot, dot, dot.

501
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,987
Dot, dot, dot.

502
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,448
Dot, dot, dot.

503
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:53,324
Dot, dot, dot.

504
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,494
Dot, dot, dot.

505
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:57,996
Doctor,

506
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:01,332
why are we working with this imbecile?

507
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:07,168
Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.

508
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:10,717
Something to help you get revenge
on the hedgehog.

509
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,427
Think bigger, Stone.

510
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:16,305
The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.

511
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,767
My genius wouldn't just be recognized
on Earth.

512
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,853
It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,

513
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:25,190
allowing me to harness
all the negative forces of the universe

514
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,235
and commune with Darkness itself.

515
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,695
Wow. That sounds big.

516
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,532
It's been on my vision board for years.
It's the Law of Attraction.

517
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:35,950
Didn't you see The Secret?

518
00:41:37,285 --> 00:41:39,328
Kaplooey!

519
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,455
Kaplooey.

520
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,750
"Another boring night at home."

521
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,836
The hedgehog has returned home!

522
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:49,380
Falsa. Which is Latin for "wrong-o."

523
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,302
According to my worldwide network
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,

524
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,179
all the way

525
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,142
from the majestic hinterlands
of Eastern Siberia.

526
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:05,146
He's a long-distance liar!

527
00:42:09,776 --> 00:42:11,861
Yeah, there's more where that came from.

528
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:16,449
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.

529
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,869
Now let's begin our quest.

530
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,915
Wait.

531
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,459
What about your minion? The goat milker.

532
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:29,420
There's no room on the ship for Stone.

533
00:42:29,504 --> 00:42:32,298
I say we ditch him,
ghost him, blow him off.

534
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:33,341
Dishonor!

535
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,345
"Dis" is how I roll.

536
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:48,439
I'm sorry, but I asked for the beef stew.

537
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,235
Your breath smells like goat poop.

538
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,738
What did you say?

539
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,910
What's going on?

540
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,079
Maybe they think it's my birthday?

541
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:07,834
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.
Okay, everybody, take it easy.

542
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,961
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation

543
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,464
for whatever my friend said or did.

544
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,257
Stand back.

545
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:15,883
I just farted.

546
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,182
Meow?

547
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,601
Throw these monsters in the fire!

548
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:31,566
Oh, no, no. Come on, guys.
Take it easy. Let's talk this through.

549
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,317
Let's talk this through!

550
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,238
Come on, come on.
Scanning Siberian customs.

551
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:41,075
-There's got to be something in here.
-Tails, whatever you're doing, do it fast.

552
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,201
I think I got it!

553
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:44,495
Pivonka! Pivonkal

554
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:46,706
Pivonka!

555
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:15,360
Da.

556
00:44:15,902 --> 00:44:17,028
Pivonka!

557
00:44:18,738 --> 00:44:20,948
Tails, what's a "pivonkad'?

558
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:23,826
It's a Siberian custom
to resolve disputes.

559
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,579
If we win, they let us go. If we lose...

560
00:44:32,085 --> 00:44:35,421
Okay, we have to grab the map
and get out of here. Where's the map?

561
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:38,174
Oh, no. I left it on the table! Look!

562
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,142
What?

563
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,001
Oh, my God, it's a dance fight.

564
00:45:14,419 --> 00:45:16,629
Sonic, what do we do?

565
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,006
We dance and get that map.

566
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,967
Here we go.

567
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,640
Okay, now let's do-- No, we're gonna go--

568
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,981
Okay.

569
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,994
Okay, this is not going well.
Channing Tatum makes it look so easy.

570
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,621
Wait, Sonic. Look!

571
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,336
The map! Come on, let's grab it!

572
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:01,424
You want?

573
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,843
Come get.

574
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,219
Freaks!

575
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,305
Freaks!

576
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,766
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

577
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:12,017
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

578
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,229
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

579
00:46:14,312 --> 00:46:15,771
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

580
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:18,524
What's wrong, Tails? Come on. I need you!

581
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:21,527
I can't do this, Sonic.
I'm not brave like you.

582
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:24,280
My gadget got us in this mess,
and I lost your map,

583
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,407
and we're gonna get tossed into a fire!

584
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:33,080
New deejay coming in.

585
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,295
Come on, pal. I got an idea.

586
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,088
They called us freaks,

587
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,840
so let's get freaky.

588
00:46:42,924 --> 00:46:45,176
Just follow my moves. You'll be fine.

589
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,040
All right! Backup dancers!

590
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,046
Here we go!

591
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,820
There's a lot of me up here!

592
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:53,202
I love pivonka!

593
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,876
And big dismount!

594
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:02,670
Yeah!

595
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,925
I'll take that.

596
00:48:13,556 --> 00:48:14,682
We did it!

597
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,935
That was amazing! Way to go, Tails.

598
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:31,236
Wow. Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could win a dance battle that epic.

599
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:32,742
Well, stick with me, pal.

600
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:36,830
Earth can be a scary place, but I know
everything about this old pale blue dot.

601
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,623
Do you really mean that?

602
00:48:38,706 --> 00:48:42,292
I mean, not everything. But I watch
a lot of Discovery Channel and--

603
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,254
I meant about me being your pal.

604
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:48,299
Of course, buddy.

605
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:52,886
Comin' in hot.

606
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:56,182
Growing up, I didn't have any friends.

607
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,185
Everyone in my village
thought my two tails were weird.

608
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,020
Hey, I know that feeling.

609
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:05,149
But then I saw you,
the fastest creature in the galaxy.

610
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:09,111
You were weird too. But you were a legend.

611
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:12,906
That made me think,
maybe being weird isn't so bad.

612
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:16,410
You inspired me to leave my village,

613
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:19,455
to find you and help you in your mission.

614
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:21,832
I'm really glad you're here, Tails.

615
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,918
I'm glad I'm here 00, Sonic.

616
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:32,718
Well, might as well get some sleep.

617
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:35,262
This feels like a good place
to spend the night.

618
00:49:35,346 --> 00:49:37,097
You'll be able to get clear readings
on your gizmo thing

619
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,684
once the storm is over, so |--

620
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,780
Night, Tails.

621
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,839
Tails. Tails. We have a situation.

622
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:19,515
Today's forecast calls for
clear, sunny skies

623
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,518
and a 100% chance of adventure.

624
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:25,563
I pinpointed the coordinates.
It's right up ahead.

625
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:29,358
Wow.

626
00:50:39,702 --> 00:50:40,994
Hey, Tails. Wait up.

627
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:50,797
Okay, we got a giant owl door.
Seems encouraging.

628
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,228
Check this out.

629
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:08,022
-Can you translate that?
-Yeah.

630
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,610
Ages ago, a fearsome group of warriors,

631
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,320
known as the Echidnas,

632
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,697
forged the Seven Chaos Emeralds

633
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:20,534
info the most unstoppable weapon
ever created.

634
00:51:23,454 --> 00:51:25,456
The Master Emerald.

635
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,917
With it, a single warrior

636
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,503
could defeat entire armies.

637
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:35,424
Believing no one should have such power,

638
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:39,053
an order of heroes recovered the Emerald

639
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,889
and swore to protect it from evil.

640
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:44,767
Sounds like the Owls and the Echidnas

641
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,311
have been fighting each other
for centuries.

642
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,397
Like Vin Diesel and The Rock.

643
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,191
Wait for me.

644
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,952
Okay, giant owl door, giant owl.
Makes sense.

645
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:17,258
Wait a second.
I've seen these symbols before.

646
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,638
Here we go.

647
00:52:31,272 --> 00:52:32,773
Well, that did something.

648
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,335
-The compass!
-This will lead us to the Emerald!

649
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,677
Hey, you got a little something on your--

650
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,388
Oh, no. Tails, get back.

651
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,061
Run!

652
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:18,277
That guy again?

653
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,156
Heads up, my little stalagmites.
Someone call an Uber?

654
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,618
Hey, thanks for doing all the hard stuff.

655
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,082
But we'll take it from here.

656
00:53:31,165 --> 00:53:33,667
Okay, we really gotta talk
about your new look.

657
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,503
It's like Professor X
meets the Monopoly man.

658
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:40,007
And what kind of genius
shows up to Siberia in a convertible?

659
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:43,094
The kind of genius
that can turn up the heat...

660
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,764
with a flick of a switch.

661
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,945
Good one! I'm sure that wasn't important.

662
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,658
Tails, that's our exit. Come on.

663
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,756
Let's split up.

664
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,342
-You go high, I go low.
-Right.

665
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,886
Quick little stretch and here we go.

666
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,941
So you want to play?

667
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,406
That's new.

668
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:57,919
Sonic!

669
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,808
Snowball fight!

670
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:22,026
It's too easy. Come on, challenge me!

671
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,251
We are talking style and pizzazz.

672
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,219
Yeah! I make this look good.

673
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,849
Oh, great. The Winter Soldier.

674
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,651
For a guy named Knuckles,
you are really bad at punching.

675
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,029
Surrender the compass!
You are no match for me.

676
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,615
I've been training for this
my entire life.

677
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,202
And I had no training at all,
yet here I am ahead of you.

678
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,371
That's gotta be embarrassing.

679
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:22,753
My rings!

680
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:29,510
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious anger issues?

681
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,138
You mock me with your weak jokes,

682
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:34,431
but you know nothing about me, hedgehog.

683
00:56:34,515 --> 00:56:38,519
Well, I know you Echidnas have a habit of
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.

684
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:42,023
Ruining your life? Another bad joke.

685
00:56:42,106 --> 00:56:44,942
I lost everything because of you.

686
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:48,320
My tribe was on the verge
of its greatest victory.

687
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,281
The last of the Owl warriors
had been located.

688
00:56:51,365 --> 00:56:55,118
Soon Longclaw's Emerald secrets
would be ours.

689
00:56:55,202 --> 00:56:58,413
But my father stopped me
from joining the fight.

690
00:56:58,497 --> 00:57:02,042
He said my moment
to honor our tribe would come,

691
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:04,253
but it was not this moment.

692
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,964
Those were the last words he spoke to me.

693
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:09,383
I never saw him again.

694
00:57:10,968 --> 00:57:13,470
We both lost everything that day.

695
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,433
-Goodbye, Sonic.
-No!

696
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:19,392
Longclaw!

697
00:57:23,689 --> 00:57:25,565
Sonic! Are you okay?

698
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,817
Deceiver!

699
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,528
No, it wasn't a trick.

700
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:32,906
Tails, take the compass
and get out of here!

701
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,703
Yeah!

702
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,414
Later, haters!

703
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,877
Tails!

704
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,635
Tails, come on. Wake up.

705
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:56,388
He chose helping the fox
over pursuing the compass.

706
00:57:56,472 --> 00:58:00,642
Of course he did.
New friend, same pathetic weakness.

707
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,614
Oh, no. No, no, no.
We're in real trouble here.

708
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,701
Come on, Tails. I need you to fly us
out of here. Time to wake up.

709
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,503
See ya, kids. Enjoy the fresh powder.

710
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,113
Did you...

711
00:58:59,618 --> 00:59:02,537
These rings signify the--

712
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,253
Sorry.

713
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,422
Thought it was on silent.

714
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,263
These rings--

715
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,724
So help me, Thomas!

716
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:29,022
Okay, sorry.

717
00:59:29,106 --> 00:59:30,649
Excuse me, this is an emergency.

718
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:33,944
Sorry.

719
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,201
What? This better be important. I just--

720
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,079
Are you skiing?

721
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,414
Snowboarding, actually.
But I need your help now.

722
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,833
Life or death situation this very second.

723
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,836
I need you to use the ring I gave you
to save me. Like right now.

724
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,172
Okay, slow down.
I don't even know where you are.

725
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:55,465
You just gotta picture
where you want the ring to go.

726
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:56,675
So picture this.

727
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,014
Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Hang on.

728
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,482
What?

729
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,276
Did you throw it?

730
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:17,738
-Oh, God.
-What? Tell me what "Oh, God."

731
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,365
I mixed up the rings
when I was teasing Jojo.

732
01:00:19,448 --> 01:00:20,866
What? Where is it then?

733
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,455
You don't want to know.

734
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,873
But I do, Tom.

735
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,291
I very much want to know,

736
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,835
before I become
a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.

737
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,004
Hang tight, buddy. I got this.

738
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,881
With this ring, Rachel...

739
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,716
Hey! Hi.

740
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,594
Everything okay, bud?

741
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,221
-Not really.
-What are you doing?

742
01:00:42,304 --> 01:00:45,807
This is gonna sound crazy, but I need
to see that ring for just one second.

743
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:48,310
-Have you lost your mind?
-I'm gonna give it right back, I promise.

744
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:51,146
-Please, Randall, it's really important.
-No, bro. Go sit down.

745
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,191
-Give me the ring, please?
-Randall, don't look at him, look at me.

746
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,859
-One second.
-Put the ring on my finger.

747
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:59,279
-No, Randall, listen to me.
-Randall! Look at me. Ring on my finger.

748
01:00:59,363 --> 01:01:01,823
-Give me the ring! Just one second.
-Put a ring on it!

749
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,951
Please, love? Okay?

750
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:05,035
-With this ring--
-Yes, baby.

751
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,578
I'm so sorry about this.

752
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:19,174
-Snow, my God.
-Oh, boy.

753
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,469
Incoming!

754
01:01:32,938 --> 01:01:34,356
Anybody hurt?

755
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,483
-Sonic!
-Hawaii.

756
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,818
Are you okay?

757
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,778
What's happening? Are you hurt?

758
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,822
-No, no, I'm fine.
-Okay, good.

759
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:45,451
-Because you're in so much trouble!
-Okay, you calm down.

760
01:01:45,534 --> 01:01:46,868
You talk.

761
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:48,370
Okay, quick version.

762
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,248
Robotnik is back on Earth
and he's after a magic emerald.

763
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:55,335
We need to get it back
or the world is doomed.

764
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,171
Tails!

765
01:01:57,254 --> 01:02:00,715
-Wait! All this happened since yesterday?
-Wait. Who's Tails?

766
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:02,050
Tails, can you hear me?

767
01:02:02,134 --> 01:02:04,094
Oh, Lord, there are two of them now.

768
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,346
Okay, let me think. Tails, come on, buddy.

769
01:02:11,101 --> 01:02:12,477
Hey!

770
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:14,729
Randall, why do all of your friends
have weapons?

771
01:02:16,815 --> 01:02:20,068
You really should have taken me up
on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

772
01:02:20,861 --> 01:02:21,903
Olive Garden guy?

773
01:02:21,987 --> 01:02:24,531
It's okay, everyone. We're federal agents.

774
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,784
You, too, Agent. Go ahead.

775
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:38,378
You mean to tell me
that this entire wedding was a setup?

776
01:02:38,462 --> 01:02:40,172
-Rachel, wait a minute.
-What?

777
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,340
That's correct, ma'am.

778
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:44,801
Every single aspect of Operation Catfish
was a complete fabrication.

779
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,388
Operation Catfish?

780
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,764
So is everyone here an agent?

781
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,392
Are you an agent?

782
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,394
Son of a...

783
01:02:54,895 --> 01:02:58,231
Was the florist an agent?
How about the photographer?

784
01:02:58,857 --> 01:03:00,358
The woman who waxed my...

785
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,444
at the spa?

786
01:03:04,446 --> 01:03:06,448
-Is Jojo an agent?
-Rachel.

787
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,118
-What?
-Rachel, listen to me.

788
01:03:09,201 --> 01:03:12,287
I'm done listening! I am done listening!

789
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,833
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

790
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,500
I really am. I am so sorry.

791
01:03:19,461 --> 01:03:21,129
No. Hey, no!

792
01:03:22,506 --> 01:03:24,674
Let him go! Hey!

793
01:03:27,636 --> 01:03:28,803
Sonic, hang on.

794
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,974
-Take it easy. It's not worth it.
-Tom!

795
01:03:32,891 --> 01:03:35,476
Sonic is not a threat. He's on our side.

796
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,479
He's an uncontrolled extraterrestrial.

797
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,648
And your days of aiding
and abetting him are over.

798
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,442
Secure them in the hotel
until the chopper arrives.

799
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:44,444
You're making a mistake.

800
01:03:44,528 --> 01:03:46,071
Hold on, Major A-hole!

801
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,323
This is still my day,

802
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:52,119
and someone is gonna explain to me
what the hell is going on here!

803
01:03:52,202 --> 01:03:55,538
After the events in San Francisco,
a global task force was created,

804
01:03:55,622 --> 01:03:58,833
devoted to protecting our planet
from alien threats.

805
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:01,586
That day,
Guardian Units of Nations was born.

806
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,255
-G-U-N. Seriously?
-GUN, yeah.

807
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,925
Look, what about protecting our planet
from Dr. Robotnik?

808
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,636
Robotnik is dead.

809
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,805
You're wrong. He's back.

810
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,308
And you just hauled away the only ones
who could stop him.

811
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,063
Sounds like Robotnik
might be back in play.

812
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:21,648
If he is, I want him found immediately.

813
01:04:22,983 --> 01:04:25,151
And cancel my five o'clock
at the Olive Garden.

814
01:04:25,652 --> 01:04:27,278
-Aunt Maddie?
-Yeah.

815
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,031
Sonic and his friend dropped this.

816
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:37,289
I have an idea.

817
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,541
And I want to have a word with my fiancé.

818
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,251
And that word is "murder."

819
01:04:46,715 --> 01:04:48,758
Hey, come on.
You can't just leave us in here.

820
01:04:48,842 --> 01:04:51,970
My friend is hurt!
He needs a doctor, a vet, anyone!

821
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,183
Tails, you got to wake up, buddy.
Please wake up.

822
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:05,651
All clear.

823
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:10,863
All right. Game plan.

824
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:13,909
I get inside the hotel and find
where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.

825
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:15,618
Then I find Randall, right?

826
01:05:15,702 --> 01:05:17,120
And then I squeeze the breath

827
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:21,291
from his lying, deceitful,
perfectly manscaped body!

828
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,379
I'm going through a lot right now.

829
01:05:25,462 --> 01:05:28,548
-So let me process this my own way, okay?
-Sure, sure.

830
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,842
-No judgment.
-Should've brought a journal.

831
01:05:30,926 --> 01:05:32,302
Okay--

832
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:35,931
Okay. Is this meant to be a weapon?
This is adorable.

833
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:38,141
Take that, Randall!

834
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:40,268
Run, Randall!

835
01:05:40,352 --> 01:05:41,770
All right.

836
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,772
-We're about to find out.
-All right!

837
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,649
Let's go kick some booty.

838
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,622
Rachel! No. Rachel!

839
01:06:01,915 --> 01:06:02,999
In a minute.

840
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:09,673
Stop right there!

841
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:11,591
Get the bag.

842
01:06:19,808 --> 01:06:21,351
He's gonna come back down, right?

843
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,894
I don't know.

844
01:06:22,978 --> 01:06:23,979
Good luck!

845
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,483
Look. Tom and Sonic have to be inside.

846
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,986
I got a fiancé to vaporize.

847
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:32,570
-Watch your back, sis.
-Okay.

848
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,450
Randall!

849
01:06:44,082 --> 01:06:46,125
We got her. Move in.

850
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:51,589
Okay.

851
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,149
I did not mean to do that!

852
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,872
Something bothering you, Agent?

853
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:26,625
I just feel a little guilty
about what I did to Rachel, sir.

854
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:30,003
Don't worry about it.
We'll send her a gift card.

855
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,214
Now, I propose a toast.

856
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:38,219
To a perfectly executed operation.

857
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,559
Sir, we're under attack.

858
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:08,458
Randall, wifey's home!

859
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,756
Oh, my God. Rachel.

860
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,284
What a woman.

861
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,662
You no-good,

862
01:08:46,913 --> 01:08:49,916
lowdown, dirty, lying--

863
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,209
Rachel, just listen to me.

864
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:55,547
What kind of twisted sicko
tricks someone into a fake wedding?

865
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,176
Party's over, Bridezilla.
Stop right there.

866
01:09:01,511 --> 01:09:03,638
You son of a--

867
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,265
-Have it your way.
-No!

868
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:07,600
No!

869
01:09:12,522 --> 01:09:14,857
Very disappointing, Agent Handel.

870
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:21,198
-Is that supposed to be a weapon?
-I don't know, but we gonna find out.

871
01:09:21,281 --> 01:09:23,700
Haven't you caused enough trouble
for one day?

872
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:26,077
I haven't even begun causing trouble.

873
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,873
Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned.

874
01:09:36,713 --> 01:09:39,006
Looks like it's real, huh?

875
01:09:43,261 --> 01:09:44,595
No. Right.

876
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,100
Be honest. How bad is it?

877
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,312
Not bad at all.
You got Tased. You'll be fine.

878
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,320
-I'm so cold.
-You landed on our ice sculpture.

879
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,488
Get up.

880
01:10:09,204 --> 01:10:12,081
Just tell me the truth, for once.

881
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:17,420
Is there anything about you
or about us that was real?

882
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:21,549
Rachel, look at me.

883
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:26,512
Before I met you, I didn't think
that I was even capable of real happiness.

884
01:10:28,181 --> 01:10:30,433
But that all changed
when you walked into my life.

885
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,312
And I ended up breaking the first rule
of undercover work.

886
01:10:35,021 --> 01:10:36,397
Which is?

887
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:38,525
Never fall in love.

888
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:54,374
-Maddie!
-We're busting out of here.

889
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,667
How'd you get past the guards?

890
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,586
Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.

891
01:10:57,669 --> 01:10:58,711
Come on.

892
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:01,840
-Let's go.
-You're amazing.

893
01:11:12,642 --> 01:11:15,311
The Owls were fools to think
they could hide this.

894
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:54,934
What's happening?

895
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:58,229
Wait for it.

896
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:12,035
Yes. Eureka!

897
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,955
I've found it!

898
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:35,558
Sonic.

899
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,270
-What is that?
-A big problem.

900
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:42,231
The compass led Robotnik to the Emerald.

901
01:12:42,315 --> 01:12:44,317
That's got to be hundreds of miles away.

902
01:12:45,777 --> 01:12:49,197
All right. Huddle up.
Let's figure out a plan.

903
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,324
-Together.
-There's no time for that.

904
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:53,368
I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.

905
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:56,328
Sonic, this is way too big for you
to do by yourself.

906
01:12:56,913 --> 01:12:58,414
You see that little fox over there?

907
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:02,002
He came all the way across the universe
to meet his hero.

908
01:13:02,085 --> 01:13:05,004
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.

909
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,841
You know what? You were right.

910
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:11,969
My moment came and I blew it. I'm no hero.

911
01:13:12,053 --> 01:13:13,220
-Wait.

912
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,640
I'm not letting anyone else get hurt
because of me.

913
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,600
I'm gonna fix this while I still can.

914
01:13:19,102 --> 01:13:20,728
Sonic!

915
01:13:20,812 --> 01:13:22,230
Sonic, wait!

916
01:13:25,066 --> 01:13:26,942
Hold on. Wait.

917
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:29,529
-Don't move.
-Take it easy, little guy. You're hurt.

918
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:33,283
But we have to help him.
You don't know what he's up against.

919
01:13:40,498 --> 01:13:41,874
You believe us now?

920
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,091
Hey, Bob!

921
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,926
Hey, Maria, how you doing?

922
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:56,514
Working on my moves.

923
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,225
Just keepin' it green.
No need to burn the fuel.

924
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:00,310
Speaking of fuel--

925
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,109
Closed?

926
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:10,903
That doesn't seem right.

927
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:24,750
Close.

928
01:14:29,297 --> 01:14:30,589
Yes.

929
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:33,218
Makeover, makeover. Look at you.

930
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:34,635
Freeze! Police!

931
01:14:36,012 --> 01:14:38,097
Oh, my God, you got robot hands.

932
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:41,559
-No, they're gloves.
-Get 'em up. Now spread your fingers!

933
01:14:42,894 --> 01:14:45,521
Now wiggle 'em! Wiggle your digits!

934
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:49,651
Yes! Like you just finished
a big musical number.

935
01:14:51,486 --> 01:14:53,029
Good.

936
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:54,531
Why is there a light on your head?

937
01:14:58,451 --> 01:15:00,494
'Cause I'm the sheriff
for the weekend, pal.

938
01:15:09,629 --> 01:15:10,588
Water.

939
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,548
Why did it have to be water?

940
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:18,304
Okay, you can do this.

941
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:23,517
I gotta go fast.

942
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:09,457
I don't want to die like this!
It's derivative!

943
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,668
Make room for Daddy!

944
01:17:20,635 --> 01:17:21,802
Two and two.

945
01:17:21,886 --> 01:17:25,139
Great! We're still bipedals, more or less.

946
01:17:28,434 --> 01:17:29,977
Fire in the hole!

947
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:35,399
I've solved it. There is a booby trap
every seven seco--

948
01:17:42,073 --> 01:17:43,449
That was a little early.

949
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:48,537
So glad it didn't cut off my mustache.

950
01:17:48,621 --> 01:17:51,040
Hey, Little Red Wrecking Ball.

951
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,210
I know you're dying
to get your Emerald on,

952
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:58,006
but can we be a little bit more mindful
of our surroundings?

953
01:17:58,506 --> 01:17:59,548
May 1?

954
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,766
In 30 feet turn left.

955
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,726
Work smarter, not harder.

956
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:33,541
My pelvis.

957
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:42,050
Okay, Secret Temple,
let's see what you've got.

958
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,851
No, no, no! No!

959
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:57,565
No.

960
01:18:58,733 --> 01:18:59,734
Yes!

961
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:07,616
You have arrived at your destination.

962
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,703
Wow. That really opened up the space.

963
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:13,748
I can't even picture it
with an impenetrable wall now.

964
01:19:13,831 --> 01:19:15,749
And the rubble is always a nice touch.

965
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:28,680
At last. The Master Emerald.

966
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:30,014
Ultimate power.

967
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,934
Soon order will be restored.

968
01:19:33,017 --> 01:19:36,353
All because of what we have done together.

969
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:38,730
Such a lovely sentiment, Knuckles.

970
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:41,817
I think I feel a single tear forming.

971
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:46,030
Sadly...

972
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:51,698
you're as useful to me now
as a backstage pass to Limp Bizkit.

973
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:07,593
Nailed it.

974
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:12,223
This guy is always trying to spoil
a bad thing!

975
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:16,060
You guys are here, too?
Took the long way, huh?

976
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,312
Is everything a joke to you?

977
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:21,357
Why must you constantly interfere
with my destiny?

978
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:25,111
Because my destiny is to protect
my friends and family.

979
01:20:25,194 --> 01:20:27,362
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

980
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:32,656
And if you want that emerald,
you're gonna have to go through me.

981
01:20:55,641 --> 01:20:58,685
The Echidna's taking no prisoners today!

982
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:02,523
Sonic has heart,
but will he lose the quill to live?

983
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:08,029
I don't want to fight you,
but you're not giving me much choice.

984
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:17,496
Too easy. Let's do this.

985
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:49,070
Why don't you stand still
and die with honor?

986
01:21:49,153 --> 01:21:50,404
Let me think about it.

987
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:54,158
Okay, I thought about it and I pass.

988
01:22:03,626 --> 01:22:05,085
Hi there, beautiful.

989
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:08,381
You're the real deal, aren't you?

990
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:12,510
Where have you been all my life?

991
01:22:16,347 --> 01:22:18,766
Say goodbye, hedgehog.

992
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,189
Knuckles, stop.
Robotnik's stealing the Emerald!

993
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,733
What kind of fool do you take me for?

994
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:29,068
Just look.

995
01:22:31,612 --> 01:22:32,946
Mine.

996
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:36,909
Wait! That wasn't the deal.

997
01:22:40,371 --> 01:22:42,998
You poor, naive creature.

998
01:22:43,082 --> 01:22:44,500
It's not your fault.

999
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:48,212
A more advanced intellect would have seen
this move coming a mile away.

1000
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,131
Or 1.6 kilometers.

1001
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:53,383
But I trusted you! You were my friend!

1002
01:23:00,516 --> 01:23:02,935
I'm sorry. That just hit me funny.

1003
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:08,353
Let this be my final lesson to you,
you dim-witted celestial skin tag.

1004
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:11,235
Friends...

1005
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:15,323
are open, honest
and vulnerable with each other.

1006
01:23:15,406 --> 01:23:17,950
Which means X squared
times the hypotenuse of Y squared,

1007
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,870
divided by the absolute value
of friendship, equals...

1008
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,412
dookie!

1009
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,748
Oh, no.

1010
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:36,381
Chaos is power!

1011
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,947
Let's get out of here!

1012
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,669
Knuckles!

1013
01:24:15,132 --> 01:24:18,009
Water again? Come on!

1014
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:20,740
-You saved me.
-Don't talk to me. I'm not in the mood.

1015
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:26,162
How dare you attack me
in my hour of sorrow!

1016
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:28,497
Why did you save me?

1017
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:32,376
Because you saved me first,

1018
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,130
which clearly gave you
a tactical advantage I do not understand.

1019
01:25:36,213 --> 01:25:39,841
It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.

1020
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:45,385
Why? I've been trying to destroy you
since the moment we met.

1021
01:25:45,681 --> 01:25:49,601
Because being a hero
isn't about taking care of yourself.

1022
01:25:49,685 --> 01:25:53,105
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

1023
01:25:55,399 --> 01:25:58,652
Wise words. An ancient Earth proverb?

1024
01:25:58,736 --> 01:26:01,155
No, sir,
that's a Wachowski family special.

1025
01:26:01,238 --> 01:26:03,240
I got it from a guy in a rowboat.

1026
01:26:03,991 --> 01:26:05,492
Someone who means a lot to me.

1027
01:26:07,411 --> 01:26:08,995
Wait a second. What's that sound?

1028
01:26:11,165 --> 01:26:14,668
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
needs rescuing this much.

1029
01:26:15,836 --> 01:26:17,712
That sly little fox!

1030
01:26:20,257 --> 01:26:22,592
Come on, Knucklehead. We're not beat yet.

1031
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:25,929
On the mountain,
you told me you'd lost everything.

1032
01:26:26,555 --> 01:26:28,056
The way I did.

1033
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,892
But you seem so hopeful and free.

1034
01:26:31,894 --> 01:26:35,480
How did you move forward
despite failing again?

1035
01:26:36,232 --> 01:26:39,360
And again. And again.
And again. And again.

1036
01:26:39,443 --> 01:26:43,071
Okay, I didn't fail that much.
But I didn't do this all alone.

1037
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:45,740
I found a new family. New friends.

1038
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,243
And you can too.

1039
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,956
You don't have to be alone anymore.

1040
01:26:57,044 --> 01:26:59,212
Are you kidding me with that handshake?

1041
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:03,259
I'm done playing games, pal.

1042
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:06,678
You're gonna tell me what I want to know.

1043
01:27:09,098 --> 01:27:12,476
And I am asking you for the last time...

1044
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:17,272
what would you like on your bagel?

1045
01:27:17,356 --> 01:27:19,274
I'm not telling you anything.

1046
01:27:19,358 --> 01:27:22,277
And that is a display bagel.

1047
01:27:22,361 --> 01:27:25,572
I don't get it with you!
I mean, I've tried everything.

1048
01:27:25,656 --> 01:27:29,284
I was good cop. I was bad cop.
I was cop who offers you a bagel.

1049
01:27:29,368 --> 01:27:30,369
And nothing. It's like--

1050
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:32,705
That is a display bagel. Wow.

1051
01:27:41,964 --> 01:27:43,715
Doctor, you're here.

1052
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:50,218
Yes, I'm here, and yet I'm...

1053
01:27:51,932 --> 01:27:53,600
not all there.

1054
01:27:53,684 --> 01:27:55,185
Sir, are you feeling okay?

1055
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:59,398
I'm more than okay.

1056
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:03,152
I'm upgraded.

1057
01:28:03,235 --> 01:28:06,279
Sinister 3.0.

1058
01:28:06,363 --> 01:28:10,367
My game is next level.

1059
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:16,623
Hi.

1060
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:23,960
I can smell the electricity in your brain.

1061
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,761
You smell like a snack plate.

1062
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:34,308
Yeah, that's fair. I had a couple today.

1063
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:36,309
Sit down.

1064
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:42,399
In the chair.

1065
01:28:45,611 --> 01:28:46,778
I didn't know.

1066
01:28:47,863 --> 01:28:50,949
"Cause he was in the chair,
so I didn't-- Okay.

1067
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:52,951
Sir? We have a problem.

1068
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:01,418
-All teams in position!
-Set up a perimeter!

1069
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:03,462
Move! Move! Move!

1070
01:29:18,602 --> 01:29:22,230
In correct us, my trusty barnacle.

1071
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:26,026
After all these years,

1072
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:28,404
what I finally got...

1073
01:29:29,572 --> 01:29:31,615
is a solution.

1074
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:44,127
-Commander.
-Status report.

1075
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:47,589
Robotnik is in there with Stone
and a hostage. Possibly local PD.

1076
01:29:47,673 --> 01:29:51,051
I'm not saying he's dumb,
but if he is local PD,

1077
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:52,761
this town's in a lot of trouble.

1078
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:54,804
Wade.

1079
01:30:09,194 --> 01:30:10,195
Okay.

1080
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:13,699
Rockin' that new spring collection, I see.

1081
01:30:13,782 --> 01:30:18,282
Well, if it isn't the Pastry King.

1082
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:19,538
The Donut Lord.

1083
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:21,832
A real genius would remember
the name of the guy

1084
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,834
who helped kick your butt off this planet.

1085
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,878
And I'll do it again if you mess
with Green Hills.

1086
01:30:26,962 --> 01:30:30,757
Congratulations on your oh-so-temporary
sense of superiority.

1087
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:33,176
You're finished, Robotnik!
We've taken everything.

1088
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,971
Your lab, your drones, your funding!

1089
01:30:36,055 --> 01:30:39,224
Let's see how big of a man you are
without your silly little robots.

1090
01:30:40,976 --> 01:30:42,894
Would you like to see...

1091
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:46,482
how big a man I can be?

1092
01:30:57,368 --> 01:31:00,537
Welcome to the new norm.

1093
01:31:10,839 --> 01:31:12,215
My God!

1094
01:31:15,719 --> 01:31:19,431
Doctor! Take me with you!

1095
01:31:43,872 --> 01:31:45,707
He's taking everything apart.

1096
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:48,127
He's building something.

1097
01:31:56,135 --> 01:31:58,512
That can only be one thing.

1098
01:31:58,595 --> 01:32:00,972
The fearsome power of the Emerald.

1099
01:32:01,056 --> 01:32:05,060
If that thing really turns thoughts
into power, we are in big trouble.

1100
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:07,187
Robotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.

1101
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:10,232
Hey, Sonic,
are you sure it was a good idea

1102
01:32:10,315 --> 01:32:11,816
bringing you-know-who aboard?

1103
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:15,653
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

1104
01:32:15,738 --> 01:32:17,448
I am not mixed up!

1105
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:22,031
I have steely focus. And I'm complex.
And that's a lot for some people.

1106
01:32:23,245 --> 01:32:25,872
Hope you're not still mad
I hit you with that car.

1107
01:32:26,623 --> 01:32:28,374
I was completely uninjured.

1108
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:31,628
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.

1109
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:05,662
Sir, you're magnificent!

1110
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:07,789
Thank you, sycophant.

1111
01:33:07,873 --> 01:33:10,292
Your admiration is inevitable.

1112
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:21,803
I knew it!

1113
01:33:21,887 --> 01:33:24,389
Just like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1114
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:27,517
World Domination play list.

1115
01:33:40,864 --> 01:33:42,031
Fall back.

1116
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:46,286
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

1117
01:33:48,288 --> 01:33:50,373
How are we supposed to beat this thing?

1118
01:33:50,457 --> 01:33:51,499
We need a plan.

1119
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:53,626
Knuckles, use your strength to--

1120
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:56,546
Jump off the plane. Wow.

1121
01:33:56,630 --> 01:34:00,550
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
Step 1: Light taunting.

1122
01:34:00,634 --> 01:34:02,385
Step 2: I have no idea.

1123
01:34:05,514 --> 01:34:06,681
Sonic!

1124
01:34:09,852 --> 01:34:11,812
Nice action figure, Eggman.

1125
01:34:11,895 --> 01:34:14,814
Does it do anything
or just stand there looking ugly?

1126
01:34:18,485 --> 01:34:21,154
Like a blister, he keeps coming back!

1127
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:25,117
He's on the okay-to-kill list.
Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.

1128
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,994
I need a moment, sir.
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

1129
01:34:28,078 --> 01:34:30,163
Did you even glance at a manual?

1130
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:32,415
-No!
-I'll do it.

1131
01:34:32,499 --> 01:34:33,917
Pardon my lightning.

1132
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,877
You might want to ground yourself.

1133
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:39,047
Uh-oh.

1134
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:41,675
I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili--

1135
01:34:44,219 --> 01:34:45,678
Hang on!

1136
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:01,236
-Yeah!
-Close one.

1137
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,113
Sonic!

1138
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,451
Robotnik!

1139
01:35:10,078 --> 01:35:11,537
Deceiver!

1140
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:13,415
Die, mosquito.

1141
01:35:25,844 --> 01:35:26,845
I felt that.

1142
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:47,490
What just happened?

1143
01:35:47,574 --> 01:35:50,827
It's the Stache Masher.
Right here in the manual.

1144
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:55,456
Return to sender.

1145
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:04,382
Stone?

1146
01:36:05,884 --> 01:36:10,054
Great. Next thing you know, there'll be
a report about a hostile work environment.

1147
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:16,310
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!

1148
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:20,232
We can't beat Robotnik as long as he's got
that Emerald. He's too powerful.

1149
01:36:20,315 --> 01:36:23,401
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat Robotnik on our own.

1150
01:36:23,485 --> 01:36:24,736
But there's three of us.

1151
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:27,989
Your strength, your smarts and my speed.

1152
01:36:28,073 --> 01:36:29,741
Together. That's how we win.

1153
01:36:29,825 --> 01:36:34,287
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.

1154
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:35,747
As a team.

1155
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:37,332
This is it.

1156
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:41,378
This is our moment.

1157
01:36:43,422 --> 01:36:44,923
Time to fight.

1158
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:55,851
Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.

1159
01:36:56,852 --> 01:36:58,687
Tails, any ideas?

1160
01:36:58,770 --> 01:37:00,438
We have to find his weak spot.

1161
01:37:00,522 --> 01:37:02,148
I suggest the groin.

1162
01:37:02,232 --> 01:37:04,317
What? No. No!

1163
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:06,986
Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.

1164
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:09,113
Stop saying "groin."

1165
01:37:09,197 --> 01:37:10,990
Hedgehog!

1166
01:37:11,074 --> 01:37:12,408
Look out!

1167
01:37:15,203 --> 01:37:17,705
I know what his weak spot is. It's me.

1168
01:37:17,789 --> 01:37:19,540
I'm the groin!

1169
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,130
Think about it.
I live rent-free in this dude's head.

1170
01:37:25,213 --> 01:37:27,048
So if I go out there and rile him up...

1171
01:37:27,132 --> 01:37:29,551
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open

1172
01:37:29,634 --> 01:37:31,886
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!

1173
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:34,722
Hedgehog,
you are a brave and noble warrior.

1174
01:37:34,806 --> 01:37:37,475
Go to your certain death with honor.

1175
01:37:37,559 --> 01:37:40,103
We're gonna have to work
on your pep talks, pal.

1176
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:41,980
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

1177
01:37:45,692 --> 01:37:47,318
All right, mustache.

1178
01:37:47,402 --> 01:37:50,238
You want me? Come and get me.

1179
01:37:50,322 --> 01:37:53,074
You don't tell me
about coming and getting.

1180
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:55,535
I am on the cutting edge
of coming and getting!

1181
01:37:55,619 --> 01:37:57,537
Coming, getting.

1182
01:37:57,621 --> 01:38:01,791
Coming, getting.
Coming, getting. Coming, getting.

1183
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:06,463
You're really heavy.

1184
01:38:06,546 --> 01:38:10,383
That's because I am
one million percent muscle. Faster, fox!

1185
01:38:12,594 --> 01:38:15,763
-Go! Move, guys! Move back!
-Let's go, that's it! Go, go, go!

1186
01:38:15,847 --> 01:38:16,889
-Keep going!
-Go! Go!

1187
01:38:16,973 --> 01:38:18,849
-No, no! Stop!
-Stop the truck!

1188
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:20,226
Tom, what happened here?

1189
01:38:21,269 --> 01:38:23,187
-You thinking what I'm thinking?
-Let's get our kid.

1190
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:24,647
We need your truck!

1191
01:38:30,862 --> 01:38:33,072
Coming, getting.

1192
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:36,076
Yoo-hoo!

1193
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,077
So what's the plan here?

1194
01:38:38,662 --> 01:38:43,041
You gonna build a big robot house?
Get yourself a big robot wife?

1195
01:38:43,125 --> 01:38:47,462
I'm going to enslave humanity
and force them to service my machines.

1196
01:38:47,546 --> 01:38:50,382
First, Green Hills. Then the universe.

1197
01:38:50,465 --> 01:38:51,716
Then the multiverse.

1198
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,511
Then who knows? Maybe that'll be enough.

1199
01:38:55,178 --> 01:38:56,470
Full disclosure?

1200
01:38:57,347 --> 01:38:59,932
You won't be there.

1201
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:06,606
Eye lasers? Really?

1202
01:39:19,077 --> 01:39:21,037
Snot rocket!

1203
01:39:22,622 --> 01:39:23,664
No, no, no!

1204
01:39:32,174 --> 01:39:33,675
Giving up already?

1205
01:39:33,758 --> 01:39:37,470
Not so tough when you're fighting someone
700 times your size, are ya?

1206
01:39:39,598 --> 01:39:42,058
You can't beat me!

1207
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:45,353
I'm all-powerful! All-knowing!

1208
01:39:48,064 --> 01:39:50,274
All-seeing.

1209
01:39:51,401 --> 01:39:53,736
Looks like your fancy robot has a glitch.

1210
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:57,073
Is it me? What about me? I'm over here.
Up top! Down below! Behind you!

1211
01:39:58,074 --> 01:39:59,992
I'm over here. Sorry! Over here.

1212
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:01,828
Too slow! Try again.

1213
01:40:01,912 --> 01:40:03,955
-You can't outsmart me.
-Missed me again.

1214
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:05,832
I'm the out smarter-er!

1215
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:13,131
I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.

1216
01:40:13,215 --> 01:40:14,507
Robotnik!

1217
01:40:15,133 --> 01:40:17,885
I am also a hologram.

1218
01:40:17,969 --> 01:40:19,887
Disloyal.

1219
01:40:19,971 --> 01:40:22,807
"Dis" is how I roll.

1220
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:52,754
Where's my Emerald?

1221
01:40:53,505 --> 01:40:55,381
No, no, no, no!

1222
01:40:55,465 --> 01:40:57,800
Computer, auxiliary power.

1223
01:41:07,143 --> 01:41:09,395
The Emerald. It's right there.

1224
01:41:09,938 --> 01:41:11,856
Move, you hunk of junk!

1225
01:41:16,403 --> 01:41:19,781
I have to... reach it.

1226
01:41:43,013 --> 01:41:44,014
Come on.

1227
01:41:46,182 --> 01:41:48,350
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

1228
01:41:57,277 --> 01:41:58,319
No!

1229
01:41:58,403 --> 01:41:59,695
We got you, Sonic.

1230
01:42:00,905 --> 01:42:02,323
Hold on!

1231
01:42:15,545 --> 01:42:17,797
-You guys okay?
-Yeah.

1232
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:20,341
Okay.

1233
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:27,932
I got the Emerald.
We could still defeat him.

1234
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:31,185
Come on, come on.
How does this thing work? What do I do?

1235
01:42:32,395 --> 01:42:33,562
What?

1236
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:36,941
No. No, no, no!

1237
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:44,990
Look at the happy little family.

1238
01:42:50,872 --> 01:42:53,374
You have to get away from me.
I'm the one he wants.

1239
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,459
Hey.

1240
01:42:54,959 --> 01:42:56,585
We're not going anywhere.

1241
01:42:57,170 --> 01:42:58,337
We're family.

1242
01:43:01,925 --> 01:43:03,593
And families stick together...

1243
01:43:06,471 --> 01:43:07,680
no matter what.

1244
01:43:10,809 --> 01:43:11,935
I love you guys.

1245
01:43:12,852 --> 01:43:14,395
We love you too, Sonic.

1246
01:43:22,904 --> 01:43:24,363
No!

1247
01:43:26,408 --> 01:43:28,576
I got him!

1248
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:32,246
I finally got him!

1249
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:39,462
What was that?

1250
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:27,551
It's over, Eggman.

1251
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,639
I like the new look. It works for you.

1252
01:44:32,223 --> 01:44:35,226
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?

1253
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:39,063
I did some things, you did some things.
There are good people on both sides.

1254
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:43,860
Surely two intelligent beings

1255
01:44:45,612 --> 01:44:47,614
can work these things out!

1256
01:44:59,626 --> 01:45:02,086
-Come on, buddy. Come on.
-Get him, Sonic!

1257
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:03,504
Yeah. Come on.

1258
01:45:20,063 --> 01:45:21,522
It's like that?

1259
01:45:23,024 --> 01:45:25,317
Okay, we're not friends.

1260
01:45:29,739 --> 01:45:32,032
Later, hater!

1261
01:45:43,419 --> 01:45:44,878
-Sonic!
-Buddy!

1262
01:45:45,463 --> 01:45:47,506
Wait! You cannot touch him!

1263
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:50,259
The hedgehog holds
the power of the Emerald.

1264
01:45:50,969 --> 01:45:54,555
I am sorry.
He is no longer the Sonic you once knew.

1265
01:45:55,139 --> 01:45:56,140
What?

1266
01:46:16,077 --> 01:46:17,703
You got to try this.

1267
01:46:23,459 --> 01:46:26,795
Okay.
He is exactly the Sonic you once knew.

1268
01:46:28,673 --> 01:46:30,049
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.

1269
01:46:38,516 --> 01:46:39,600
Sonic!

1270
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:43,479
Bring it in, bud.

1271
01:46:44,939 --> 01:46:46,899
It's good to be back in blue.

1272
01:46:46,983 --> 01:46:50,319
The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been more my color.

1273
01:46:50,403 --> 01:46:51,487
Looks good on you.

1274
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:56,071
Sonic, you were the most powerful hero
in the universe, and you let it go.

1275
01:46:57,076 --> 01:46:58,160
Why?

1276
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:03,041
Because I still have
some growing up to do.

1277
01:47:05,293 --> 01:47:09,046
-And I kind of like being a kid.
-And you're not just any kid.

1278
01:47:09,631 --> 01:47:11,507
You're our kid.

1279
01:47:11,591 --> 01:47:13,009
That's right.

1280
01:47:13,092 --> 01:47:15,803
-Bring it in!
-Yay. Hugs.

1281
01:47:15,887 --> 01:47:18,723
It's a good thing we didn't do this
before. You would've blown up.

1282
01:47:26,356 --> 01:47:27,940
You fixed it.

1283
01:47:28,024 --> 01:47:31,360
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.

1284
01:47:31,444 --> 01:47:32,736
Now I have it.

1285
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,613
Now we have it.

1286
01:47:34,697 --> 01:47:37,282
What do we do with it? What next?

1287
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:39,494
There were once two orders of heroes

1288
01:47:39,577 --> 01:47:43,706
who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the Emerald for evil.

1289
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:47,668
But they have all passed on
to the great battleground in the sky.

1290
01:47:47,752 --> 01:47:51,213
So we start a new order. The three of us.

1291
01:47:51,297 --> 01:47:53,007
This is no light task.

1292
01:47:53,091 --> 01:47:57,591
We must make a vow to use our powers
to keep the universe safe,

1293
01:47:58,554 --> 01:48:00,389
to watch out for each other.

1294
01:48:00,473 --> 01:48:02,183
Our new tribe.

1295
01:48:02,266 --> 01:48:03,392
I know!

1296
01:48:03,476 --> 01:48:05,895
-A power bump!
-Good idea.

1297
01:48:06,938 --> 01:48:10,149
It's an Earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.

1298
01:48:10,733 --> 01:48:12,025
Very well.

1299
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:15,238
A power bump it is.

1300
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:18,074
Power bump!

1301
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:26,124
It's truly a beautiful day for baseball
here in Green Hills.

1302
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:27,917
An exciting lineup today

1303
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:31,295
with the debut appearance
of two new players!

1304
01:48:31,379 --> 01:48:35,549
On the mound,
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,

1305
01:48:35,633 --> 01:48:38,177
Miles "Tails" Prower,

1306
01:48:38,261 --> 01:48:42,761
facing off against the powerhouse,
Knuckles the Echidna.

1307
01:48:44,434 --> 01:48:46,310
I don't understand.

1308
01:48:46,394 --> 01:48:48,562
Why am I angry at the enemy ball?

1309
01:48:48,646 --> 01:48:49,813
You're not angry.

1310
01:48:49,897 --> 01:48:53,150
You just want to hit it as hard as you can
and then run around the bases.

1311
01:48:53,234 --> 01:48:57,734
But if my quest ends where I am standing,
why run at all?

1312
01:48:58,531 --> 01:49:01,075
I can't with this guy. Why do I even try?

1313
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:03,828
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.

1314
01:49:03,911 --> 01:49:05,412
Just having some fun.

1315
01:49:05,496 --> 01:49:06,914
Fun.

1316
01:49:08,124 --> 01:49:10,501
All right! Give him the heat, Tails!

1317
01:49:10,585 --> 01:49:12,503
Hope you're ready for my fastball.

1318
01:49:12,587 --> 01:49:15,047
Your fastball will be dishonored.

1319
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:17,383
And so will you, fox.

1320
01:49:17,467 --> 01:49:19,844
-Easy, guys!
-Don't think about it too much.

1321
01:49:19,927 --> 01:49:23,347
Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball and give it a ride.

1322
01:49:23,431 --> 01:49:24,849
A ride? To where?

1323
01:49:29,103 --> 01:49:30,395
Power bump!

1324
01:49:35,693 --> 01:49:37,152
Victory is mine!

1325
01:49:37,236 --> 01:49:39,780
Hey, no fair! That shouldn't count.

1326
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:42,116
First base is also mine!

1327
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:46,700
-I think that was our only ball.
-I have conquered the second of the bases!

1328
01:49:46,871 --> 01:49:48,414
Who wants ice cream?

1329
01:49:48,498 --> 01:49:49,707
Knocked the cover off that.

1330
01:49:49,791 --> 01:49:51,709
-Ice cream!
-Ice cream, yeah!

1331
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,421
I am having the fun! What is ice cream?

1332
01:49:56,506 --> 01:49:59,842
It's a dessert.
If you like fun, you're gonna love it.

1333
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:03,095
Yum. Dessert. Does it have grapes in it?

1334
01:50:03,179 --> 01:50:04,763
No, not usually.

1335
01:50:04,847 --> 01:50:06,515
I'm proud of our little guy.

1336
01:50:07,391 --> 01:50:10,435
I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.

1337
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:13,564
-He cracks me up.
-Heck of a swing too.

1338
01:50:13,648 --> 01:50:16,400
Come on, fox.
Our dessert adventure awaits.

1339
01:50:16,484 --> 01:50:17,818
-Good job, guys.
-Yeah.

1340
01:50:17,902 --> 01:50:21,196
You too, baby. Let's go get
some ice cream. Come on, come on.

1341
01:50:22,365 --> 01:50:24,533
I'm happy for you, pal.

1342
01:50:24,617 --> 01:50:27,786
Got your wing men.
Perfect friends to grow up with.

1343
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:31,164
-Come on, Knuckles.
-My victory chariot!

1344
01:50:33,209 --> 01:50:36,170
I've got a lot more than that... Dad.

1345
01:50:41,634 --> 01:50:42,968
Race you to the truck.

1346
01:50:44,637 --> 01:50:46,055
One, two, three, go!

1347
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,766
No, don't go easy on me. I want your best.

1348
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,811
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.

1349
01:50:51,894 --> 01:50:55,564
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.

1350
01:50:55,648 --> 01:51:00,148
What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.

1351
01:51:00,653 --> 01:51:03,280
-What?
-I mean, you barely beat me.

1352
01:51:03,948 --> 01:51:06,450
You've never been beaten so hard.

1353
01:51:10,872 --> 01:51:12,039
Can't forget this.

1354
01:53:11,409 --> 01:53:13,285
Agent, I want an update.

1355
01:53:13,369 --> 01:53:16,288
Still searching, sir.
We haven't found any sign of Robotnik.

1356
01:53:16,372 --> 01:53:18,707
No one could've survived that crash.

1357
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:21,376
He's toast. Good riddance.

1358
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:24,713
What a mess that lunatic made.

1359
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:28,175
Sir, there's something else.

1360
01:53:28,718 --> 01:53:32,221
When we were wiping Robotnik
off our database, we found something.

1361
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:36,058
A file buried deep in our system
and dating back over 50 years.

1362
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:39,061
-What was it?
-Coordinates, sir.

1363
01:53:39,145 --> 01:53:41,021
Coordinates? To what?

1364
01:53:41,772 --> 01:53:43,732
A secret research facility.

1365
01:53:44,358 --> 01:53:45,942
It was a black site, sir.

1366
01:53:46,694 --> 01:53:49,154
Someone worked very hard
to keep this hidden.

1367
01:53:50,531 --> 01:53:51,740
My God.

1368
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:54,034
Project Shadow.
