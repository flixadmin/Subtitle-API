1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,634
(People murmuring)

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,672
The tiger talisman

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,907
is inside
one of these pies.

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,577
Pfft. Piece of cake--
er, pie.

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:14,046
We just join the contest
and eat till we find it.

6
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,614
And the beauty is,

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:19,518
Mr. green jeans
is our only competition.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,586
(Footsteps approach)

9
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:21,820
Uh...

10
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,722
<i>Was.</i>

11
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,424
(Evil laugh)

12
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,063
Maybe tohru
didn't leave room for desert?

13
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,331
(Tweeet)

14
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,399
(Slurping)

15
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,750
(Crunch)

16
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,720
Somethin' crunchy
in my pie.

17
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,461
Thank you!

18
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,696
Ahhh!

19
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,031
Gimmie that ta--

20
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,367
he was gonna
say "pie," right?

21
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,635
Wha--?!

22
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,103
Grrr.

23
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,171
Huh?

24
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,073
47 pies!

25
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,241
A new record!

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,962
After 9 centuries,

27
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,931
all 12 talismans
have been recovered,

28
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,934
yet I possess only 2,

29
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,138
while Jackie chan has 10!

30
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,541
You have failed me,
valmont!

31
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,009
Now, shendu,

32
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,813
just because chan's
locked them away
in section 13

33
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,215
doesn't mean
we won't find them.

34
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,951
The new year approaches!

35
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:37,289
It is essential that I have
all 12 talismans before then

36
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:42,961
if you ever wish to lay eyes
upon the treasure
of <i> o'in shi'huang.</i>

37
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,230
Tohru!

38
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,237
Bring me Jackie chan.

39
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,975
He will surrender
the location of section 13,

40
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,778
with proper prodding.

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,846
(Buzz buzz)

42
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,585
Chinese new year rocks!

43
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,520
Especially the sweets.

44
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,621
Jackie: Jade.

45
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,224
2 more days
till new years.

46
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,193
Aww.

47
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,795
Hot cha!

48
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,131
Jackie, the tiger talisman

49
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,534
possess the power of balance.

50
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,669
Cool!

51
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,137
So, whoever has it
can't lose their--

52
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,905
whoa!

53
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:32,244
The kind of balance
your parents in Hong Kong
sent you here to learn.

54
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:37,149
Within each and every one
of us lies conflicting forces:

55
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,251
Yin and Yang,

56
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,253
light and dark,

57
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,388
good and evil.

58
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,158
Like <i> Jackie</i>
àhas a dark side.

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,227
I do.
Her name is Jade.

60
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,695
Ba-dum-pum-tch!

61
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:52,297
Balance?! That's not
even a real power.

62
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,235
Good. I will enjoy taking
this powerless talisman
to section 13,

63
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,837
so we can put this quest
to rest.

64
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:03,976
While Jade
will enjoy making tea
for her dear old uncle.

65
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,577
Rrr.

66
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,845
Huh?

67
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,580
Cracked?

68
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,182
How did...?

69
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,250
(Crunch)

70
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,820
Ahh.

71
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,389
Whaa?!

72
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,464
Whoa!

73
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,699
Whew. Mirror.

74
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,469
Oh! Where's
the other half?

75
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,716
(Crunch)

76
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,986
(Crying) Uncle!

77
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,154
What is it?

78
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,023
I stepped on a bug!

79
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,725
(Crying)

80
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,927
Tea is ready,
dear uncle.

81
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:56,995
(Gasps)

82
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,533
Mmm. Good.

83
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:05,304
Jackie!!
That's <i> my</i> candy!

84
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,440
Not any more.
Got milk?

85
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,642
What happened
to Jackie?

86
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,244
He is such
a crybaby!

87
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,313
He's such
a jerk!

88
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:17,349
He is in the library
weeping all over my research!

89
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,652
No, he's in the kitchen,
raiding the fridge.

90
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,125
Jackie?
Jackie?

91
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,364
Whaa!
Whaa!

92
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,732
(Braaaack)

93
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,833
Whaa!
Whaa!

94
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,402
Hmm...

95
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,872
When the talisman broke,

96
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,409
Jackie's yin was separated
from his Yang.

97
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,610
Whoa.

98
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,679
Jackie-lite
and Jackie-dark.

99
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,481
I am the dark side.

100
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,250
I murdered a bug!

101
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,720
You're the side
who ate my candy?

102
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,291
You're evil!
Eviiiil!!!

103
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,859
Not evil.

104
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,961
Just lacking
sound judgement

105
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,630
without his good side
to guide him.

106
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:09,534
So, each of you
has half of the talisman?

107
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,239
Good.

108
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,475
You must
join them together

109
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:19,311
to reunite
into one Jackie.

110
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,079
Me and wimpy?!

111
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,781
Oh, please, no!

112
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:26,017
He burps out loud
without saying "excuse me"!

113
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,854
You must restore balance!

114
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,455
But--ow!
But--ow!!

115
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,723
Ow!

116
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,659
Oo, you will
pay for that!

117
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,994
Ow!
Oh!

118
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,576
Uh...Jackies?

119
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,515
(Growls)
(Whimpers)

120
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,584
The dark hand.

121
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,025
Hide the talisman!

122
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,528
What are we
gonna do?

123
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,697
Laugh like circus clowns
while they scream for mercy.

124
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,899
Run!!

125
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,700
Guess we'll never know
if 2 jackies

126
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,768
are better than--whoa!

127
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,638
This is no place
for children!

128
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,476
Chan, you're coming with--

129
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,311
oh!

130
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,581
Hey. You didn't even
let him finish.

131
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,485
(Crack)

132
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,753
(Crack)

133
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,656
Ahh!
Whoa!

134
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,593
Fighting is not nice.

135
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,761
Get him!

136
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,338
Jackie-lite
is still packin'
Jackie moves,

137
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,642
but I bet he's gonna
need some "Jade dark"
to balance him out.

138
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,678
Men: Ow! Ugh! Ow!

139
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,984
Seem like chan's
in a particularly
bad mood today?

140
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,419
You mean the psycho?

141
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,187
He copped my jacket!

142
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,056
Oh, who cares?
Look what I copped.

143
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,997
Hey!

144
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,332
Grrr.

145
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,267
Run!
Totally run!

146
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,039
Uncle: Hiyeee! Hyah! Hyah!

147
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,776
Grrrr.

148
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,411
Ahhh!

149
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,147
Ahhhhhhhhh!

150
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,953
Huh. He'll never
catch us.

151
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,755
Weren't <i> we</i> supposed
to catch <i> him?</i>

152
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,090
Shut up.

153
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,263
(Imitates guitar playing)

154
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:15,854
It's him!

155
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,858
Ahh!

156
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,099
Here. Take it.

157
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:31,736
What, and spoil my fun?

158
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,104
This better be good.

159
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,609
Ahhhhhhh!

160
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,895
Ahh!

161
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,431
(Gasps)

162
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,637
Chinese new year rocks!

163
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,977
Half a talisman?

164
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,713
It's a start, I suppose.

165
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:19,884
Now tell me the location
of section 13 or--

166
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,186
(vidphone rings)

167
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,554
What is it?

168
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,589
We got chan.

169
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,392
Valmont: I know.
He's right here.

170
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,627
He is?

171
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,495
No, he's not.
He's right here.

172
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,730
Oh, hello.

173
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,064
How are you?

174
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,938
The tiger talisman
is the glue

175
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,107
that binds
the conflicting powers

176
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,142
of all the other talismans

177
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,112
into one unified whole.

178
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,547
If it was divided by chan,

179
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,784
it is likely
that chan himself is divided

180
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,987
into light and dark.

181
00:10:55,989 --> 00:11:00,458
So, which chan
do we have?

182
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,095
And when the fish
hit the road,

183
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,765
you guys all went,
"bwaaa!"

184
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,832
(Laughing)

185
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:13,104
Ya know, chan,
you're all right.

186
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,907
Yeah. Too bad
we gotta eliminate you.

187
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,375
Eliminate me?

188
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,843
(Door opens)

189
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,979
Shh, shh.
It's big "v."

190
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,515
Valmont: Perhaps
there is another option.

191
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,551
Bring me the talismans
from section 13,

192
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,422
and I will make you rich.

193
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,892
Works for me.

194
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,264
Get in there.

195
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,199
Are those seats
real leather?

196
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,903
Oh, those poor cows!

197
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:45,970
(Jackie sobbing)

198
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,038
(Gunfire)

199
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,873
Section 13!
They're shootin'!

200
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,941
Get down!

201
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,680
(Fireworks popping)

202
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,953
Jade, this is terrible!

203
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,989
I know, I know. I shouldn't
be playing with fireworks.

204
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,791
Yes, that's very true.

205
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,959
But even worse,

206
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,129
those bad men
captured my other half!

207
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,002
We need
section 13's help,

208
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,771
but if captain black
sees you,

209
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,006
he's never gonna believe
there's another you

210
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,241
who needs rescuing.

211
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,777
So you have to wait
here, <i> capiche?</i>

212
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,245
Uh-huh.
Good.

213
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,247
Now, hand me your half
of the talisman

214
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,516
so I can put it
in the vault for
safekeeping.

215
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,926
Captain black!

216
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,461
The dark hand
captured Jackie!

217
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,562
What?! We've got to--

218
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,434
you almost had me, scamp.

219
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,502
(Humming)

220
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,143
But I'm serious!
He's in trouble!

221
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,711
Now, now, Jade.

222
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,079
I just saw Jackie.

223
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,348
Look, there he goes again.

224
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,415
Heh heh.

225
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,751
You totally blew it!

226
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,653
I told you
to wait outside!

227
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,721
Cool jacket.

228
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,723
Get your mitts off it.

229
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,659
Grrr.

230
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:15,760
Why are you being such a...

231
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,395
Jerk?

232
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,666
Brother!

233
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,268
You're ok!

234
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,870
Oh, are you
going fishing?

235
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:26,938
Went.

236
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,174
Talisman fishing.

237
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,309
Oh! You're a bad boy.

238
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,545
And you're ugly!

239
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,713
Now, where's the other half
of the tiger?

240
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,816
Oh, that tickles!

241
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,386
Ugh!

242
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,854
Aah!

243
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,758
Ugh.

244
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,959
Ok, meanie!
What are you--

245
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,327
was I mean to you?

246
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,829
Oh, I'm sorry!

247
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,730
What are <i> you</i>
àdoing down here?

248
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,766
I told you
to wait outside.

249
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:58,903
The bad me
- stole the talismans.

250
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,171
Most of them, anyway.

251
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,507
You gotta stop him!

252
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,409
I tried scolding him,
but--

253
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,110
I mean "stop" him!

254
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,245
You know...

255
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:10,181
Hyah! Aiyyee! Hyah!
Hyah! Aiyyee! Hyah!

256
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,150
Oh! Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

257
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,785
Fighting
is not nice.

258
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:14,853
Rrr.

259
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,756
Wait!

260
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,491
You can't do this!

261
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,093
If the dark hand
gets all the talismans,

262
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,163
then something
really, really bad
is gonna happen!

263
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,231
So?

264
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,566
But you're not evil,
remember?

265
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,902
Uncle said everyone
has yin <i> and</i> Yang.

266
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,937
You can't be <i> all</i> Yang.

267
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,707
Yang-dang-doodle.
Doobie-doobie-doo.

268
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,775
Jackie.

269
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,210
(Jade growls)

270
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,411
Hyah!

271
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,684
I liked these.

272
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,387
Oopsie?

273
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,723
Hyaaah!

274
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,063
Hyaaah!

275
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:00,965
Ah, ah, ah.

276
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,002
It's not nice to drop-kick
little girls.

277
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:06,471
See? If he has
a fighting side,

278
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:09,607
then you've gotta have
a, er, nice guy side.

279
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,542
Once I give these
to valmont,

280
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,012
I'll have
a rich guy side.

281
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,383
Give me that,
you little gnat!

282
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:21,819
Ah, ah, ah! Name-calling
is not nice, either.

283
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,973
Jackie-lite may need
a little magic back-up.

284
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,243
(Straining)
Come on! Come on!

285
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,017
Ooh, let's get you
an icepack for that.

286
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,085
(Vidphone rings)

287
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,655
Any sign of chan?

288
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,790
No.

289
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,326
Then get off
your tremendous behind!

290
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:04,896
I want those talismans!

291
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,832
Yes, master.

292
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,434
(Straining)

293
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,069
(Pants)

294
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,839
Ow! Ooh!
Ow! Ooh!

295
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,907
Smarts.

296
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,608
I <i> like</i> the burn.

297
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,055
Ahh!

298
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,790
Hyah!

299
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,001
Oh, I got you all dirty.

300
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,137
(Strains)

301
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:52,744
Yes!

302
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,349
These are not
the talismans!

303
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,753
Let me go!

304
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,521
Help!

305
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,590
Jackie!

306
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,192
Jade!

307
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,695
Too bad.
I kinda liked her.

308
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,763
She's scrappy.

309
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,731
Oh! She's family!

310
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,767
We have to save her!

311
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:16,868
We do?

312
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,204
You'll get to fight
more bad guys.

313
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,308
8...9...

314
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,177
10 and 11.

315
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:31,549
Yes. I can feel
my power returning.

316
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,351
The statue talked?

317
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,186
You guys are working
for a statue?

318
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,587
Quiet!!

319
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,960
11 1/2.

320
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,595
What?

321
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,698
Valmont and shendu:
Where is the other half?!

322
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,766
(Whistles casually)

323
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,773
It's always tohru's fault.

324
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,843
Everyone blames tohru.
Huh?!

325
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,248
So, which one's
on our side again?

326
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,257
Jackie-dark:
Black's not my color.

327
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:16,928
(Elevator music plays)

328
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,836
(Crack)

329
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:25,937
(Crack)

330
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,672
Come on down.

331
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,307
Can't we get along?

332
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,310
(Straining)

333
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,313
No! Stop, please!
Stop! (Laughs)

334
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,217
I said "please."

335
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,087
The chans
are in the building.

336
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,390
They do not possess
the missing half.

337
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,359
Well, it must be--

338
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,066
somewhere.

339
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,179
Hey, you have pretty decent
chops for such a big baby.

340
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:11,582
Oh, I owe it all
to teamwork.

341
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,783
Don't touch me.

342
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,118
Jade: Jackie!

343
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,896
Stop him!
He has all 12!

344
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,732
Stop!
Stop!

345
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,802
Hy--!
Hy!!

346
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,644
Game over, chan.

347
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,713
<i>Way</i> over.

348
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:01,732
I live!!!

349
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,271
Rrrrrrrrr.

350
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,581
Jade: Hey, Jackie?

351
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,715
Yes?

352
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,250
What's your favorite
junk food?

353
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,851
My favorite junk food?

354
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,387
My favorite
junk food...

355
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,125
Ice cream

356
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,627
yum yummy.

357
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:30,962
I love ice cream.

358
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,029
Chocolate,

359
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,598
vanilla,
strawberry.

360
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,434
That's all. Mostly
I like ice cream,

361
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,569
but after I ate
ice cream today--

362
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,637
chocolate--

363
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,072
more punching,
more kicking.

364
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,409
Ow!

365
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,345
Let's go to eat
some ice cream.
