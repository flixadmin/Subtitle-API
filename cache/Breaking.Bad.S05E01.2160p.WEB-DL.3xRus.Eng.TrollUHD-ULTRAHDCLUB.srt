1
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,881
Here you go.

2
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,954
What happened there?

3
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,918
- It's my birthday.
- Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

4
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,070
Birthday meals are free at Denny's.
All you gotta show is a valid ID.

5
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,591
I'm good. Thanks.

6
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:53,052
Really? Free meal. Free is good.

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,015
Even if I was, like, rich,
free is always good.

8
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,268
Thank you.

9
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,644
Okay.

10
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,029
New Hampshire.
You're a long way from home.

11
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,488
How long a drive is that?

12
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,493
About 30 hours,
if all you stop for is gas.

13
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,579
You headed to California?

14
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,248
No. Here.

15
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,084
Okay.

16
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,003
So, what's here?

17
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,343
Business.

18
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,222
You know, I was in Boston once. Boston
and a little town called Swampscott

19
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,766
which is right outside of Boston.

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,311
That's kind of near New Hampshire, right?

21
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,940
Yeah. More or less.

22
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,943
Yeah, I was maybe 6,
so I don't really remember it.

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,238
I want to say I liked it.
They got this really big aquarium.

24
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,575
Yeah. Great science museum there.

25
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,579
Excuse me.

26
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,707
- Hi.
- Hi.

27
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,709
My name's Lucy. I'll be your server.

28
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,565
I got your word this won't wind up
crossing the border?

29
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,194
It's never leaving town.

30
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:37,157
Is there a manual? Instruction manual?

31
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,159
I pulled something off the Internet.

32
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,078
It's in there.

33
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,789
Well

34
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,999
good luck, I guess.

35
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,956
Happy birthday, Mr. Lambert.

36
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:45,076
{\an8}Jesus, Walt, the news here...
Gus Fring is dead.

37
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,789
{\an8}He was blown up along with some person
from some Mexican cartel,

38
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,918
{\an8}and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.

39
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,420
{\an8}Do you know about this?

40
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,465
{\an8}Walt?

41
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,803
{\an8}Walt, I need you to...

42
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,181
{\an8}<i>It's over. We're safe.</i>

43
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,033
Was this you?

44
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,956
<i>What happened?</i>

45
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,459
I won.

46
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,576
{\an8}Oh, God.

47
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,358
{\an8}Dad.

48
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,193
{\an8}- Dad.
- Hey.

49
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,654
{\an8}Hey.

50
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,115
{\an8}Serious... You don't have the TV on?
Seriously?

51
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,576
{\an8}No, sorry, I...

52
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,163
{\an8}You didn't tell him about Mr. Fring?

53
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,124
- He knows.
- Welcome home.

54
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,712
{\an8}Jesus, Dad,
it's all they're talking about.

55
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,382
{\an8}They haven't said it on TV yet,

56
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,718
{\an8}but Uncle Hank says he was
this major, major drug dealer.

57
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,222
{\an8}I mean, like, holy shit.

58
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,767
Your uncle is safe, right?
How do they know that?

59
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,353
{\an8}Uncle Hank was after this guy all along.

60
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,814
{\an8}He didn't tell us, but he was.

61
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,566
{\an8}He even took me
to his restaurant one time

62
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,528
{\an8}just, like, totally toying with the guy

63
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,531
{\an8}just like, "I got my eye on you."
Like that.

64
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:14,494
{\an8}They figure Mr. Fring was the one
who put the hit out on Uncle Hank.

65
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,123
Just somebody got to him first.

66
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,708
{\an8}Yeah, wow.

67
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,210
{\an8}Aunt Marie's still pretty freaked.

68
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:27,549
{\an8}She didn't want us to leave,
but Mom figured it was time.

69
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:34,514
{\an8}There's still some agents over there,
but they figure it's over.

70
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,142
{\an8}Like, when this hits the news

71
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,811
{\an8}Uncle Hank is gonna be a hero.

72
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,897
- Yeah.
- I mean, even more so than before.

73
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,108
Seriously.

74
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,068
See... See if it's on TV.

75
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,446
Yeah, yeah, I want to.

76
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,406
Just give me a couple minutes, huh?

77
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,159
<i>- -around the 24-yard-line.
- They break huddle...</i>

78
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,086
Hi.

79
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,547
Hi.

80
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,054
Hi, sweet pea.

81
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,848
Oh, Daddy missed you so much.

82
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,560
Yes, he did.

83
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,645
I know.

84
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,814
I missed you too.

85
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:34,115
Well, don't you think
I rate a "hello," at least?

86
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,203
Hello.

87
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,086
Hello to you too.

88
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,675
So are you gonna talk to me here?

89
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,303
Are you gonna...

90
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,764
You gonna show some kind of...

91
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:03,061
I don't know, some kind of mild relief
that I'm alive?

92
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,065
I am relieved, Walt.

93
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,610
And scared.

94
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,571
Scared?

95
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,990
Scared of what?

96
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,121
You.

97
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,088
Hey.

98
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,343
Hi.

99
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,745
Oh, shit.

100
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,453
Jesus, just say it already.

101
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,122
Tell me "I told you so."
Get it out of your system

102
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,542
before you need, like,
dialysis or something.

103
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,921
It's exactly like Boetticher's drawings.

104
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,675
Where were the two bodies?

105
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,220
Over by the freight elevator.
Over there.

106
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,184
- No idea who they were?
- No, not much left.

107
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,854
Apparently the teeth do this popcorn
thing when they get too hot,

108
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,648
so they tell me.

109
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,859
Whoever torched it did it up right.

110
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,783
Fring, you magnificent bastard.

111
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,172
What do you figure that was?

112
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,135
I don't know, some kind of lab equipment?

113
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,935
Maybe a camera?

114
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,120
Come on. Come on, you, be nice.
Be nice.

115
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,789
Come on. Hey. Hey!

116
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,791
You be nice. Just be nice.

117
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,793
Let Wendell in there.

118
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,130
If Wendell doesn't eat, nobody eats.

119
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,757
Yeah.

120
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,313
It's Gustavo.

121
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,524
He's dead.

122
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,144
Son of a bitch.

123
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,689
Son of a bitch.

124
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,734
- Hold up! Hold up!
- Get out of my way, kid.

125
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,656
- Wait a minute, all right? Let him talk.
- I am done listening to this asshole talk.

126
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,366
Now get out of my way.

127
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,826
He's got something you need to hear,
all right?

128
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,204
What'd you do, Jesse?
Do you even know?

129
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,248
Do you even know what you've done?

130
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,917
- Yeah, he saved his own life...
- One more word.

131
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,002
Mike. Mike.

132
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:24,048
If you kill him, you're gonna
have to kill me. Come on.

133
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,094
Oh, Jesse.

134
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,555
Jesus.

135
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,891
What is it with you guys?

136
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,602
Honest to God.

137
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,105
May I?

138
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:45,153
Look, whatever differences
you and I have, they'll keep.

139
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,738
Right now we've got bigger fish to fry.

140
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,826
- Bigger fish.
- The video cameras.

141
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,579
Gus kept cameras on us at the lab

142
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,498
at the laundry,
God only knows where else.

143
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,460
And of course, when I say "us,"
I'm including you.

144
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,295
Mike.

145
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,964
Mike, if he taped all that shit

146
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,675
us cooking, you picking up...

147
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,242
If Gus had a record of that
and the police get to it before we do...

148
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,472
You son of a bitch.

149
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,684
Mike, it's all on tape somewhere,
or a hard drive.

150
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,644
Where?

151
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,104
Where did he keep it?

152
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,360
He had a laptop in his office.

153
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,363
Kept it in the back of the restaurant.

154
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,783
It all fed straight to there.

155
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,501
What?

156
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,711
Keys, scumbag.

157
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,381
It's the universal symbol for keys.

158
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,622
Meter fraud.
And yes, yes, it's a big deal.

159
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:25,878
Guy rigs his meter so he's paying
2 cents less for first-class postage.

160
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm here to tell you that the USPS
takes that very seriously.

161
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,595
It's money out of your pocket,
it's money out of my pocket.

162
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,973
I was hoping... Now, look, sarge.

163
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,018
Do you think we could work together on
this thing? You folks have it over there?

164
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,480
Could you tell me that, at least?

165
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,067
Yeah.

166
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,694
Yeah.

167
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,364
Well, thanks for your help.

168
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:59,369
Inspector Clark... Inspector Dave Clark,
like the Dave Clark Five?

169
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,830
Before your time.

170
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,542
Well, you feel free to call me
day or night at this number.

171
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,921
Yes, sir. No, you as well.

172
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,506
Thank you.

173
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,468
Oh, yeah.

174
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,137
We're boned.

175
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,518
Well...

176
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:28,440
You know how they say
"It's been a pleasure"?

177
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,192
It hasn't.

178
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,737
Are you gonna tell us about the laptop?

179
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,574
- Where you going?
- I'm getting the hell out of Dodge, kid.

180
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,702
And so should you.
It's just a matter of time.

181
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,206
Mike, where is the laptop?

182
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,252
What the hell difference does it make?
They got it. End of story.

183
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,719
A.P.D., Northwest Area Command
on Second.

184
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,972
They tagged it, they filed it

185
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:04,017
it's in the system,
and they locked it in their evidence room.

186
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,353
All right.

187
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:11,817
All right. So describe the building.

188
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,402
Describe the...

189
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,529
How about I describe Fort Knox?

190
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,364
And what are you gonna do?

191
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,131
Are you gonna put on your black leotard
and go dangling on a clothesline?

192
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,204
It's a building full of cops.
What else do you need to know?

193
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,207
And why in the hell am I talking to you?

194
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,294
Mike, we gotta do something.

195
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,921
I am doing something.

196
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,838
He's good with this stuff, okay?
Just give him a chance.

197
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,593
Now, you look.

198
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,096
That laptop might as well be on the moon.

199
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,309
They build these evidence rooms
like bank vaults because guess what

200
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,353
lunatics like you wanna break into them.

201
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,151
But unlike a bank vault, this is a place
that is guarded 24 hours a day

202
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,111
by the police.

203
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,822
There's no way you're getting it
out of there.

204
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,242
Who said that we have to
get it out of there?

205
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,415
We just need to destroy what's on it.

206
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,209
Oh, so now you wanna
blow up a police station?

207
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,170
I don't believe I said that, no.

208
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,922
Nursing home full of old folks
just whet your appetite.

209
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,756
Now you wanna kill a bunch of cops.

210
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,968
I never said anything
about killing anybody.

211
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,804
I am, however, considering
the possibility of a device.

212
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,432
- A device.
- Yes, a small device.

213
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,310
Say this device gets filed into evidence.

214
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,146
- Now it is inside that room.
- What about a magnet?

215
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,774
You wanna commit a whole other crime
just to get this bomb into evidence.

216
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,694
- Who said "bomb"? I said "a device."
- What about a magnet?

217
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,613
An incendiary device.
One quick fire is all it would take.

218
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,075
You don't think they have fire
suppression? I'm not talking sprinklers.

219
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,287
I'm talking about halon.
Because halon doesn't destroy evidence.

220
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,957
- A magnet, though, maybe like...
- A bomb then. We plant a bomb outside.

221
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,341
Oh, actually I knew a crew
out of Fort Worth

222
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,045
that tried to blow up an evidence room
from outside.

223
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,548
About all they did was take out
a couple of hedges.

224
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,260
You are probably talking about 2 feet
of reinforced concrete.

225
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,845
Or what about a magnet?

226
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,390
What magnet? What about it?

227
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,308
You know, just:

228
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,326
So, what do you think?

229
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,620
Expensive.

230
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,872
Leaving aside engineering

231
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,583
rigging some kind of
alternate power source

232
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,921
my primary sticking point is
I actually need the thing.

233
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,841
As you gentlemen can see,
it's paying the bills.

234
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,261
But I mean it's feasible, doable?

235
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,640
Hey, we're living in a time
of string theories and God particles.

236
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,643
Feasible, doable?
Yeah, sure, why not?

237
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,895
Expensive.

238
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,107
What would you put it in?

239
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,656
What about that? Does it run?

240
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,950
We can get it running.

241
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,161
What's the box made of?

242
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,413
Plywood and aluminum, just what you need.

243
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,877
All right, so you wanna talk money?

244
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,297
Step into my office.

245
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,011
Hey, listen.

246
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,390
I don't actually have
any money right now.

247
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,186
My wife... There's an IRS issue.

248
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:39,232
Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you could
spot me my share. I'll pay you back.

249
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,234
Yeah. Whatever.

250
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,111
Right.

251
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,865
You coming?

252
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,576
If you have any brains,
you'll take that money you saved,

253
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:55,248
and you'll skip town.
Today. Right now.

254
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,583
You don't think this can work?

255
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,170
Is that a serious question?

256
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,130
Mike, this is a three-man job.

257
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:06,218
The only way I know it won't work for sure
is if we don't have you.

258
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,586
Come in.

259
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,799
Get in. Close the door.

260
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,386
What did we say about you coming here?

261
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,264
Yeah, speaking of things
that tend to rile you up

262
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,183
the police, they may call.

263
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,354
Let me back up a little. Can I sit down?
I'm gonna sit down.

264
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,982
Okay, why are the police gonna call?

265
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,068
May call you.
Distant, outside possibility.

266
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,363
But on the off chance,
I want you thinking one thought:

267
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,739
<i>Hogan's Heroes.</i>

268
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,658
Sergeant Schultz.
You remember Sergeant Schultz?

269
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,452
"I know nothing. I see nothing."

270
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,955
You remember how he...
I want you like that.

271
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,708
- Okay, Saul, why are the police...
- There was an incident with Beneke...

272
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,335
Oh, God.

273
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,920
- And it's...
- Oh, Jesus.

274
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,715
- What incident?
- An act of God.

275
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,633
There's no right. There's no wrong.

276
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,219
I mean, it just... That's the best phrase.

277
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:36,474
It fits, but we got a problem.

278
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,355
Ted's dead.

279
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,316
Sorry?

280
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,610
Ted is dead?

281
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,154
No. No, no.

282
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,656
He just woke up.

283
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,999
Right-o, that should do her.

284
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,959
All right, watches off.

285
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:06,130
Necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets...

286
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,257
Gold. These are nonferrous.

287
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,508
Better hope.

288
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,179
What about that stuff you young guys
wear on the end of your pricks?

289
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:17,183
Speak now or forever sing soprano.
What's up with that, by the way?

290
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,312
Why would anybody wanna put a metal
ring through the end of their prick?

291
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,774
What are you looking at me for?

292
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:27,818
All right, guns, knives

293
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,696
tools, keys, plates in your head

294
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,407
artificial hips.

295
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,577
Check your pockets for me
one more time, please.

296
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,121
Oh, credit cards.

297
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,959
You want that plastic working
come Miller time.

298
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,879
You know, I can foresee a lot of
possible outcomes to this thing,

299
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,424
and not a single one of them
involves Miller time.

300
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,176
P.M.A.

301
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,804
Positive mental attitude.

302
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,973
Okay, I think we're good to go.

303
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,351
All right, where do you
want me with this?

304
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,353
Start 40 feet out.
That's more than the length of the room.

305
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,273
- Who's doing the honors?
- Me.

306
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,066
Flip that switch, turns it on.

307
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,276
Twist this here.
That's your power control.

308
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,153
- All right.
- Everybody ready?

309
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,822
- Yeah.
- Okay.

310
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,907
Fire in the hole!

311
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,413
All right, you ready?

312
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:38,055
Fingers crossed it don't yank
the drive shaft through the floor.

313
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,488
Anything?

314
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,910
Nope. It's still working.

315
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:03,581
All right, start walking forward slowly.

316
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,635
Wait, wait, wait.

317
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,179
Yeah. That did it.

318
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,309
Yes.

319
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,484
Yeah, bitch!

320
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,986
Magnets!

321
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:38,407
How many batteries is this?

322
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:43,746
That there's 21, wired in series,
so 21 times 12.

323
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,331
Two hundred fifty-two volts.

324
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,625
Can you add 21 more, wired in parallel?

325
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,002
Up the amperage?

326
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,719
Everything goes flying
in that evidence room

327
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:03,766
it's gonna make one hell of a noise,
and there goes your element of surprise.

328
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,684
Won't matter.

329
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,854
Sixty seconds, we'll be gone.

330
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,252
Excuse me.

331
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,589
Hi. Who are you looking for?

332
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,050
Ted Beneke. I'm a friend of his.

333
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,219
But if it's not a good time, I could...

334
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:43,597
No, no, no, this is fine.
I'm just finishing up. Come on in.

335
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,654
Hey, Ted.

336
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,699
I tell you, he's been a real champ.

337
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,119
His color's better
and his blood pressure's up.

338
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:08,136
We are gonna have you
eating solid food in a day or two

339
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,790
I bet you money.

340
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,960
That's wonderful.

341
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,046
All right, I'm just down the hall.

342
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:28,476
Ted.

343
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,937
Can you hear me?

344
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,693
Yes.

345
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,948
Ted, I just...

346
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,994
I don't even know...

347
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,038
Skyler.

348
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,375
I haven't said anything

349
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,837
to anyone.

350
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,927
I told them it was an accident.

351
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,471
I tripped,

352
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,309
and fell. That is all they know.

353
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,063
Just...

354
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,944
I've... I've got children.

355
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,072
Family.

356
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,659
I swear to you.

357
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,995
Please.

358
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,916
I just...

359
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,005
I...

360
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:44,802
...will never breathe

361
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:49,974
one word of this.

362
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,442
Good.

363
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,776
It should be about a quarter
of the way down on the left.

364
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,071
We'll do a loop and come around
the other side. Turn here.

365
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,251
Right up there.

366
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,504
That's the wall.

367
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,799
What the hell is this?
There's some big-ass hump in the way.

368
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,426
So? Just drive over it.

369
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,194
- All right.
- Come on, you can do it.

370
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,057
Take it easy. Take it easy.

371
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,850
You got it.

372
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,193
Cut it.

373
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,531
It's, like, 8 feet away. Is this cool?
Is this close enough?

374
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:11,740
It'll work.

375
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,449
- Mr. White, let's go.
- Hold on.

376
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,494
- Let's just go!
- Hang on.

377
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,996
Mr. White, let's get out of here.

378
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:44,291
Just one minute.

379
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,302
- Turn it off! Turn it off.
- I will.

380
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,519
Jacocks! Jacocks, you okay?

381
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,854
Outside! Outside!

382
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,751
Yeah, bitch!

383
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,878
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

384
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,382
And what exactly are you celebrating?
You left the truck behind.

385
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,759
- So what?
- "So what"?

386
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,594
So what if they find prints?

387
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,806
And what if they trace it back
to the wrecking yard?

388
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,599
They won't.

389
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,726
There's no prints, I made sure of that.

390
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:48,564
There's no paperwork on the truck,
the magnet or the batteries.

391
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,400
Untraceable salvage, all of it.

392
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,026
I made sure of that too.

393
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,028
Well, you got all the answers.

394
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:58,907
So you tell me, Answer Man,
did all that even work just now?

395
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,869
Yes. It worked.

396
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,371
And I'm supposed to take that on faith?

397
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,457
Yeah? And why?

398
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,042
How do we know?

399
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,171
Because I say so.

400
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,870
07-66-26432.

401
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,455
Gutierrez, Alvin B.

402
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,457
Roofing hammer.

403
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,376
Undamaged. Bag still sealed.

404
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,427
11-58-73321.

405
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,137
Fring, Gustavo.

406
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:04,264
Samsung laptop computer.

407
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:07,351
Damaged. Glass screen
is broken and in pieces.

408
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,186
Bag still sealed.

409
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:21,073
11-58-73317.

410
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,451
Fring, Gustavo.
Framed photograph of two men.

411
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:25,661
Damaged.

412
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,663
The glass is broken,

413
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,998
and photo has slipped out of its frame.

414
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,627
Bag appears to be slightly punctured
by broken glass.

415
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,339
Check it out.

416
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,926
That's not on the manifest.

417
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,597
All right, so first off,
I'm not a marriage counselor.

418
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,474
Nor do I take sides in this thing.

419
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,559
And, not taking sides, mind you,

420
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,061
but you did put her in charge
of your money

421
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,773
which I advised against, if you'll recall

422
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,900
all of which is not to be construed
as an "I told you so."

423
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:02,656
I'm just walking you through
my mental process, so to speak.

424
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,078
So she comes to me with a problem.

425
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:11,645
That she's been cooking Beneke's books,
he's in Dutch with the IRS,

426
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,085
and once they audit,
it's Rio de Caca for the both of them.

427
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:19,256
To which I say, "Hey, let's involve Walt
in this discussion."

428
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,134
To which she says,
"No, let's cut Beneke a check

429
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,553
so's he can pay off the IRS."

430
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,266
Again, not taking sides,
but she really was trying to protect you.

431
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,271
A little feedback here might be nice.

432
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,484
"Let's involve Walt in this discussion."

433
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,654
Yeah, that's what I told her.
She said no.

434
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,031
And you didn't argue the point.

435
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,075
You didn't think to contact me.

436
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:53,290
You were a tad preoccupied at the time,
if you'll recall.

437
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:57,878
Okay. So you took it upon yourself

438
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:02,758
to give away $622,000 of my money

439
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:06,636
to a man who had been
sleeping with my wife.

440
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,515
She's my client, same as you.

441
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,560
Does this arrangement
get a little tricky at times?

442
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:14,811
Absolutely.

443
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,981
But I try my best, you know,
ethically, in my duty...

444
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,941
Ethically?

445
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:23,236
I'm sorry. I must be hearing things.

446
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:28,241
Did you actually just use
the word "ethically" in a sentence?

447
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,577
You're not Clarence Darrow, Saul.

448
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,497
You're a two-bit bus-bench lawyer.

449
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:34,998
And you work for me.

450
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,460
Yeah, well, Clarence Darrow
never had a client like you ask him,

451
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,378
for something

452
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,130
like this.

453
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,592
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass
on the line for you.

454
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,177
Huell too.

455
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,847
He's got fingers like hot dogs.
He could've easily busted this in two,

456
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:53,850
and killed everyone in the office.
But do I complain?

457
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,561
No. Beg, borrow or steal,
I'm your huckleberry.

458
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,105
I go the extra mile.

459
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:04,110
Only you never told me
that kid would wind up in the hospital.

460
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,196
You know...

461
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,698
Take that thing
and get the hell out of here.

462
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,201
You and me, we're done.

463
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,843
What are you...?

464
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,427
Come on. Hey.

465
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,263
Hey.

466
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:40,981
We're done when I say we're done.

467
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:17,517
Yes, you are. Yes.

468
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,774
Hey.

469
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:33,408
I heard what happened to Ted.

470
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,995
He's not gonna talk.

471
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,997
Yeah.

472
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,274
I forgive you.
