"Minions 2015" ^ (Run time : 01:30:53)

2
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,507
minions

3
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:48,549
Minions.

4
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:53,118
Minions have been on this planet
far longer than we have.

5
00:01:53,143 --> 00:01:54,847
They go by many names.

6
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:58,660
Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike.

7
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:02,019
Oh, that one is Norbert.

8
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:04,229
He's an idiot.

9
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:08,184
They're all different.
But they all share the same goal.

10
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,512
To serve the most despicable
master they could find.

11
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:13,397
BOSS!

12
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:16,223
- Boss.
- Boss.

13
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:22,985
Making their master happy was
the tribe's very reason for existence.

14
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,450
But that's not to say that
they didn’t have other passions.

15
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:29,926
- Oh. Hey, look. It's a banana.
- Move over.

16
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:33,543
Hey, I know. It's a banana.
Ha-hah-ha.

17
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:35,538
Yum yum.
Huh?

18
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:38,167
Finding a Boss was easy.

19
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:43,131
But keeping a Boss...
therein lies the rub.

20
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:45,021
Ow.

21
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:47,474
Ow.
Owww.

22
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:50,143
Whoa.

23
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,369
Whoa!

24
00:02:55,613 --> 00:02:57,454
Oh.

25
00:02:58,651 --> 00:02:59,671
- Oop.
- Aw.

26
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:00,917
- Oh.
- Oh.

27
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:10,667
I am... oaf.
Aw.

28
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:26,096
Nope,
it wasn't easy for these guys.

29
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,501
But they never gave up.

30
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:33,648
With the emergence of the stone age
came the rise of a new species.

31
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:36,330
Man was very different
from the dinosaur.

32
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:41,841
He was shorter, hairier
and way, way smarter.

33
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:52,534
The minions took an instant liking to Man
and helped him the best they could.

34
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,138
Oh, no no...
Here. A present.

35
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:00,796
- This?
- Yes yes yes.

36
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:03,309
For hitting.
Ut-ut.

37
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:08,943
Aw!

38
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:15,932
Poor man.
So trusting, so fragile, so-so delicious.

39
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:19,084
Their quest for a boss put
the minions front and center

40
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,713
for some of the civilization
most historic moments.

41
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:30,897
Ancient Egypt held great promise.

42
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,185


43
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,839
Okay!

44
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,946


45
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,806
But it didn't last long.

46
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:41,634
Hmm.
Oh.

47
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,136
Here.
Yup.

48
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:44,423
Ow!

49
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:48,893
The dark ages
were actually fun times.

50
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:55,194
Their new master had a tendency
to party all night and sleep all day.

51
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,925
Ahem.
Yoo-hoo.

52
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:04,086
- What is it?
- Surprise!

53
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,068
<font color="#ff9b9b">[Happy Birthday]
357</font>

54
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:11,366
Oh.

55
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:14,482
But eventually
the party was over.

56
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:16,875
Achoo.

57
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,875
They bounced from
one evil master to another.

58
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,522
But they never seemed
to find their perfect fit.

59
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,851
One particular employer took
their failure very very badly.

60
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:40,218
Huh?

61
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:45,611
The Minions had no other
choice but to keep moving.

62
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:50,014
Oh.
Look at this.

63
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,267
And then,
when all hopes seem lost.

64
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,963
They found sanctuary.

65
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:59,599
The Minions were safe.

66
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:30,532
Years passed as the Minions
forged their own civilization.

67
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,446
They truly made a life
for themselves.

68
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,519
But something just wasn't right.

69
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:46,149
They felt empty inside.
Without a master, they had no purpose.

70
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:48,039
They became aimless

71
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:50,191
and depressed.

72
00:06:54,451 --> 00:07:00,006
If this continue any longer,
the Minions would perish.

73
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:06,361
But all was not lost,
for one Minion had a plan.

74
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:09,807
His name was Kevin.

75
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,916
He was excited to share
his idea with the tribe.

76
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:19,781
He'd been preparing for
days, weeks, months.

77
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:22,484
But now he was ready.

78
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:35,833
Buddies.

79
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:48,368
Kevin would leave the cave,
go back to the outside world

80
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:50,959
and he would not return
until he had found his tribe

81
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:54,184
the biggest baddest villain deserved.

82
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,138
But he needed help.

83
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:58,665
Me! Me!
I will come.

84
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,187
Bob was eager to go.
- Kevin?

85
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:04,415
But Kevin felt he was just not strong enough
for the dangerous journey ahead.

86
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,596
Uh no.
One other Minion?

87
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:09,026
Me.
Choose me.

88
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,120
Me! Choose me!
Aw.

89
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:12,230
Me!

90
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:14,196
I will come.

91
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:15,876
Luckily someone stepped up.

92
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:18,362
- Huh?
- Stuart! Come here.

93
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:20,591
Huh. Me? Me?
Oh, thank you.

94
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:23,523
Truth be told. Stuart had no idea
what he was chosen for.

95
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:26,035
Huh!
Wh-Why?

96
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,050
But was thrilled that made
people cheered for him.

97
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:33,072
Thank you!

98
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,865
Uh.
Stuart, Stuart.

99
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,181
One more?

100
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:39,724
ME!
I am strong.

101
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:41,408
See here.

102
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:44,098
See!

103
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,812
- Oh.
- Oh.

104
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:49,322
Uh. okay.
One more.

105
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:51,132
Kevin.
Choose me.

106
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:54,049
Please.
Choose me, Kevin.

107
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:55,203
Come here.

108
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:56,461
Huh.
Yeah! Ha ha.

109
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:58,856
Eventually, Bob's energy and enthusiasm

110
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:03,442
but mostly lack of other volunteers
changed Kevin's mind.

111
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:06,181
- Kumbaya!
- Kumbaya!

112
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,853
Kumbaya.

113
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:09,403
Big boss!
Big boss!

114
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:11,271
The tribe said their farewells.

115
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:15,035
Kevin had given them something
they haven't had  in a long time.

116
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,944
- Hope.
- Kevin!

117
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:18,487
- Bob!
- (Big boss! Big boss!)

118
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:20,925
Hey, Tony.
Good luck to you.

119
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,567
Tom.
Take care.

120
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:25,479
And Chris.
See you later.

121
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:28,979
- Hey Bob, you coming?
- Yes, yes.

122
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:32,301
Big boss!
Big boss!

123
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,816
Bye bye.

124
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:42,132
Kevin felt pride.

125
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:45,639
He was going to be the
one to save his tribe.

126
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:48,696
Stuart felt,
hungry mostly.

127
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,946
He was going to be the one
to eat this banana.

128
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:55,601
- And Bob
- Oh.

129
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:59,903
Bob was frightened
of the journey ahead.

130
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:03,546
Hey, it's okay.

131
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,806
Okay. Okay.
Look for the big boss.

132
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,289
Ah. There you go, Bob.
Come on.

133
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:17,864
And they were off.

134
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:22,008
Off,
to find their new boss.

135
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:25,251
Come on, Bob.

136
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:43,786
Huh?
Kevin?

137
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:04,436
Oh.

138
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:07,434
- Hungry?
- Food?

139
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,530
There is no food.

140
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,650
Huh.
Banana.

141
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,739
Uh.
Stuart, What it it?

142
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,629
Banana.

143
00:11:16,663 --> 00:11:18,863
- Banana!
- Aww.

144
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:21,904
- Stuart.
- Food.

145
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:23,524
Stop!

146
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:27,416
Bob!
Stop!

147
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:39,170
Huh.
Oh. Land!

148
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:40,447
Bob.

- Oh, look at that one.
- Whoa!

151
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,951
Whoa.
Look at that one.

152
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:27,086
- Peace!
- Make love, not war!

153
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:28,668
Peace to the world.

OUT NOW

Hey.

Stuart. Hey, oh.
Bee-do.

163
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:04,128
Where is Bob?

164
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:07,241
- Kevin...
- Huh. Bob!

165
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:12,483
Oh.

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,721
Huh.
Ah, Bob.

169
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:26,581
Wow.

170
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:34,886
Whoa.

Huh, Bob.
There's Bob. Come on.

Excuse me.
Coming through.

00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:44,071
Ah... Okay.
You go right.

174
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,206

The store is now closing.

177
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:51,761

- Excuse me. Excuse me.

178
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:54,539

Hey, ha ha.

00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:09,216
You are here.
You are here, my buddies.

184
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:10,950
Hey.
It's me, Bob.

185
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,405
Hey.
My buddies.

Oh.

- Nothing.

191
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,495
Oh.
There, here's Tim.

192
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,442
Oh, ha ha.
My Tim. Thank you.

193
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,196
Hm?

194
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:37,991
Oh no.
They are closed.

195
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,271
Hey. Look at this.
Boing, boing,

196
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:43,493
Come on in.

197
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:54,165

198
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,937
Ah.
How's this shows?

199
00:14:55,962 --> 00:15:00,364

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,538
Well Jennifer.
Have you decided

204
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:15,282
which of these 3 gentlemen,
you'll go on a date with?

205
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:19,119
- Is it Bob?
- Yeah! Go Bob.

206
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:21,419

- It's me, Kevin.

207
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:26,027
- Or will it be Stuart?
- Oh. Yo, Stuart.

208
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:30,550
Gosh. This is so hard.
They all sounded so cute.

209
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:33,251
I think I'm going
to go with...

Nobody panic, alright.

Now, now.
Calm down, Stuart.

Hey, greetings.
Orlando?

237
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:14,664
Ooh. Hello, Papagena.
You beautiful papaya.

Hey, Stuart.
Do you best.

00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:52,172
Oh yeah, far out.

00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,467
Welcome to Wayne, brother.

No. No no no.
Kevin.

249
00:18:00,594 --> 00:18:03,161
I'll do it. I'll do it.
You watch.

250
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:14,640
Ha-ha-ha...

Just you wait.

There.
You do it.

260
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:58,125
Stuart, that's him.

00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:32,262
Oh, Walter look. These adorable little
freaks are heading to Orlando too.

263
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,800
Yeah, I see that.
Hey, Walter Junior.

264
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:36,725
- What's happening?
- Tina.
- Hi.

265
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,849
Pinkie. What do you say
we give these fellows a ride?

266
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,910
- Yeah! New friends.
- Yeah! New friends.

267
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,398
All aboard the Nelson Express.

268
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:47,227
You, one eye,
You're sitting next to me.

269
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,617
Okay.
I'm going.

270
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:50,874
Stuart.
Just get on.

271
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:59,982
Glad we came along before
some weirdos picked you up.

272
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:03,293
Who wants apple slices?

273
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,390
Ahh.
Apple.

274
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:06,676
Oh, you too.

275
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:10,853
Growing of a... boy like...
creatures need their strength.

276
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,871
Okay.
You want it?

277
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:15,539
Yeah!

278
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:18,252
Thanks, man.

279
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:21,041
Alrighty.
Who needs to stretch their legs?

280
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,674
- Yeah!
- Yes. Me me me!

281
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:25,017
You guys wait right here.
We'll be right back.

282
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:28,151
Okay, Nelsons.
Let's do this.

283
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:33,502
Uh.
Protection?

284
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:38,711
Go go go!

285
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:44,299
Okey dokey,
on the road again.

286
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,025
Dad, we got company.
It's because I tripped the alarm.

287
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,473
- I stink.
- Hey.

288
00:20:57,498 --> 00:21:01,444
We all make mistakes, sugar plum.
You're still learning.

289
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:03,745
Whoa!
What!

290
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,809
- Your father's right, Tina.
-  Reload.

291
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:08,339
- He wasn't this good at being evil overnight.
- Reload.

292
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:10,406
Your time is coming.

293
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,150
Ah!
It's jammed.

294
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:19,901
Huh?

295
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:26,534
- Give me.
- No.

296
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,571
- Give me. Give me!
- No no. No.

297
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:51,762
- Okay, who did that?
- It's Stuart.

298
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:54,481
- Huh? Me... me...
- That was great.

299
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:56,183
Ha ha ha.
Thank you.

300
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,777
Give me.
Give me. Give me.

301
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:01,198
Say, fellows. Can we get
personal for just a second?

302
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:05,210
Why are you
going to Orlando?

303
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:10,126
Come on, you can tell us,
You're going to Villain-Con, aren't you?

304
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:11,414
Yes, Villain-Con.

305
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:13,046
Villain-Con.

306
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:15,597
Wow, so many
bad guys in the car.

307
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:17,667
- What fun.
- I knew it.

308
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:19,723
I knew you were villains.
Didn't I, honey?

309
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:22,496
What a small world.
Hope we're not in rival gangs.

310
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:24,393
Heh heh heh.

311
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:26,081
Pinkie, joke.

312
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:27,891
Babies, huh?

313
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:59,350
Hey, everybody.
The boss.

314
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:03,192
It's big boss.
Let's go welcome him.

315
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,449
- Yah.
- Hoo hoo.

316
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:08,623
- Boss.
- Boss.

317
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,776
Boss.
The boss.

318
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:12,513
Sheesh. sheesh.
Sheesh, sheesh...

319
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,708
The boss will speak.

320
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:29,610
When we get to Orlando,

321
00:23:29,635 --> 00:23:32,552
I'm going to get all my favorite
villains to sign my magazine.

322
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,803
Dumo, the Sumo.

323
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:36,376
Oh oh.
He's a boss.

324
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:38,987
Oh, Kevin! You don't
want to work for him.

00:23:39,012 --> 00:23:41,676
He ate his last henchman.

326
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:44,955
Frankie Fishlips.
He lives in the ocean.

327
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,401
- Ah. And he's the boss?
- Uh.

328
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,561
- Can you breathe under water?
- Bah... So so.

329
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:54,153
Oh oh oh.
Look at her, Scarlet Overkill!

330
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:57,192
The coolest supervillain,
like ever.

331
00:23:57,216 --> 00:24:00,793
She started out as your average
little girl. Bracers, pig tails.

332
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:05,444
But, by the time she was 13,
She built a criminal empire.

333
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:09,239
If I was a Minion, that's who
I would want to work for.

334
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:11,677
Ah... Scarlet Overkill.
Whoa.

The world's first female supervillain.

382
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:13,274
Appearing right now in Hall 8.
- Bob, Stuart, buddies.

Buddies, let's go.
It's Scarlet Overkill.

- Scarlet?
- Come on. Come on.

385
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,973

Ha.

389
00:27:31,627 --> 00:27:35,255
Doesn't it feel so good
to be bad?

390
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,056
- Scarlet-Scarlet-Scarlet...
- Yes!
- Hoo-hoo-hoo.

Whoa. Ha ha.
What beauty.

395
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:09,189
Wow.
Thank you.

396
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:13,083
Thank you so much.

Okay.
Shh shh shh.

398
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:20,684
When I started out,
people said a woman could

399
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:25,342
never rob a bank
as well as a man. Well.

400
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:28,906
Time's changed.

401
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:30,606
I love you, Scarlet!

402
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:35,733
Look at all those faces out there,
we are all so different.

403
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:38,049
But we have
one thing in common.

404
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:41,780
We were born with flippers!

405
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,200
No?
Just me?

406
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:46,849
Okay.

407
00:28:46,974 --> 00:28:52,728
We have big dreams, and we will
do anything to make them come true.

408
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:55,348
Have any of you ever dreamt

409
00:28:55,373 --> 00:29:00,523

supervillain of all time?

410
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,917
Heh-heh-heh.
Well.

411
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:07,125
What if I were
to tell you,

412
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,015
that I am looking
for a new henchman!

413
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,071
Hey, big boss.
This is our chance.

414
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:14,178
- Yes.
- Ha.

415
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:17,392
I truly believe
somewhere out there

416
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:21,529
is a villain with the potential
to serve greatness.

417
00:29:21,554 --> 00:29:25,289
- And it could be any of you.
- Whoa.

418
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:27,661
Although let's not kid ourselves.

419
00:29:27,688 --> 00:29:33,073
Truly the only man for this job
are Kevin and his Minions.

420
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:35,863
10 times the evil and
half the package.

421
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:37,730
I'm just in awe.

422
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:42,971
Let's hear it for Kevin.
He saved his tribe!

423
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:46,717

Kevin!

- Kevin Kevin Kev...
- Hey, Kevin. Hey.

425
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:51,834
- Ow.
- Hey. Pay attention.

426
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:55,388
So.
How should we do this?

427
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:58,013
Hmm.
Oh.

428
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:00,464
You see this
tiny little trinket?

429
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:03,025
Well, just take it from my hand
and you got the job.

430
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,014
No big deal,
it's almost too simple.

431
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,653
Eh heh heh.

432
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:11,321
Oh, come on, don't be afraid.
Just take the stone and get that job.

433
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:13,112
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.

434
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:15,053
Let's go get our boss.
Come on.

435
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:18,339
- That job is mine.
- Oof.

436
00:30:24,496 --> 00:30:26,580
Now, go easy on me.

437
00:30:27,146 --> 00:30:28,635
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

438
00:30:28,682 --> 00:30:30,008

439
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:32,632

- Stop. Tim.

Aw!

454
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:21,099
Didn't my speech inspired anyone

455
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:24,442
to rise up and prove
themselves worthy?

456
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:28,326
All these villains, and yet
I still have the- bear.

457
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:30,452
Stuffed bear.
Why am I holding a bear?

458
00:31:30,477 --> 00:31:33,412
- Oh.
- Who has the ruby?

459
00:31:39,984 --> 00:31:43,060
Wow.
Who-Who are you?

460

My... knights
in shiny denim.

- Yo.
- And Bob.

470

Huh?
The boss, in England.

477

Nah. We have the boss.
Listen.

Ah. Uh...
Hello, Kevin.

479

Did-Did you say England?

480
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:47,289
Uh-huh.

Oh. He hung up.
Hello.

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,802
Wow.

485
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,670
Here we go.
Come here.

486
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:29,091
By the way.
I really like your bear.

487
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:32,837
- Herb, my baby.
- You know I am.

488
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,736
How did it go?
Were you evil?

489
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:37,638
- So evil.
- Oh!

490
00:34:37,663 --> 00:34:41,015
A little bird dropped
this off today.

491
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,951
<font color="#ff80c0">I Missed You!
♥ H.</font>

492
00:34:43,976 --> 00:34:46,385
It's me,
I'm the "H".

493
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,679
Also, there's no birds.
Also me.

494
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:51,116
Herb, seriously.

495
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:53,283
I want to dig up that
William Shakespeare,

496
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:55,833
so he can see
what true writing is.

497
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:57,343
I love it.

498
00:34:57,368 --> 00:35:00,164
That works because I love you.

499
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:03,002
Well, I love you too.

500
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:05,372
Oh.
The love, oh.

501
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:10,509
Oh, boys.
Could you come here please?

502
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:17,572
Meet my husband, Herb.
Inventor, super genius, fox.

503
00:35:17,728 --> 00:35:19,871
Herb, these are the new recruits.

504
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,293
Kevin, Stuart and
that cute little one is Bob.

505
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:27,206
Right on. You guys
are crazy little and

506
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:31,556
way yellow,
and I digged that.

507
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:36,714
Sweet, man.

508
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:42,652
- Wow.
- Cool house.

509
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,595
I know, right?

510
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:48,303
Just a few thing I stole
to help fill the void.

511
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:51,827
Whoa.
Las Vegas' Ukulele.

512
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:55,385
Checking out my can?

513
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,789
We stole that because finally

514
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,461
someone expressed my love
of soup in painting form.

515
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:01,078
- Wow.
- Woo.

516
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:05,673
Okay, listen up.
It is time to get down to business.

517
00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:07,931
Do you know who this is?

518
00:36:07,956 --> 00:36:09,812
Uh.
The cockroach?

519
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:14,119
This is Queen Elizabeth,
ruler of England.

520
00:36:14,144 --> 00:36:18,439
Oh. I love England.
The music, the fashion.

521
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:21,842
I'm seriously thinking about
overthrowing it someday.

522
00:36:21,867 --> 00:36:23,392
- I'm so excited.
- Yes.

523
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:27,000
Anyway. This pale drink of water
oversees it all.

524
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:29,968
I'm her biggest fan,
love her work.

525
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:33,590
And I really really really
want her crown.

526
00:36:36,747 --> 00:36:40,251
Steal me the crown and
all your dreams come true.

527
00:36:40,276 --> 00:36:41,752
Respect!

528
00:36:41,777 --> 00:36:42,825
Power!

529
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,660
Banana!

530
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:46,868
Banana!

531
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:58,731
Huh!
Henry!

532
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,240
The way to England,
is... is...

533
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,655
Ah!
Give me.

534
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,181
Uh. England is...
this way.

535
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,509
March on!
Eh!

536
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:22,403
Wait for me!
Wait for me! Ah!

537
00:37:28,263 --> 00:37:30,176
Go back!

538
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:36,511
- Hm. What is this place?
- Hey. Over there.

539
00:37:36,536 --> 00:37:38,328
- Whoa.
- Wow.

540
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:40,554
Whoa oh.
Uu la la.

541
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:42,124
No.
Oh, no.

542
00:37:42,149 --> 00:37:43,692
Don't get too close, boys.

543
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:46,301
When it's completed, it will
be my ultimate weapon. But.

544
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:51,041
Right now, it's leaking radiation.
Like you would not believe.

545
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,784
So you're here
for gear.

546
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,091
Whoa.

547
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:02,354
- Bob, Robert, Bobby my boy.
- Yes?

548
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:06,398
You get my far out
stretch suit.

549
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,329
Wow.

550
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:11,515
Kevin, Kevo, Seventh Kevin.

551
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,418
You are the proud owner
of my Lava Lamp gun.

552
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,570
This baby shoots actual lava.

553
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:21,151
- Woo, for me?
- Pretty cool, right?

554
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:26,424
And finally, Stu, Stu-art,
Stuperman, Pitstu.

555
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:29,903
I got you the coolest invention,
probably ever.

556
00:38:30,927 --> 00:38:33,289
Hypno hat!

557
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:41,907
You can use it
to hypnotize anyone.

558
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,267
Anyone!

559
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:46,092
Oh, you look so great.

560
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:50,074
I feel like a proud mama
with 3 dashing evil sons.

561
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,668
Uh.
Scarlet. Scarlet.

562
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:53,178
There is something
wrong with this.

563
00:38:53,203 --> 00:38:56,255
No, no, don't say anything,
I won't understand.

564
00:38:56,287 --> 00:39:00,959
It's getting late, you had a big day.
You must be exhausted.

565
00:39:00,984 --> 00:39:04,507
Boing.
Boing.

566
00:39:04,532 --> 00:39:06,787
Wow, these cats are pumped!

567
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:11,811
Well, maybe I'll settle them down
with a bedtime story.

568
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:17,466
How does that sound, Bob?

569
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:19,890
Bob? Bob?
Bob!

570
00:39:19,915 --> 00:39:21,350
Oh.
Bedtime story?

571
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,040
That, is a groovy idea,

572
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:24,727
I'll go get some
cookies and warm milk.

573
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:28,568
This is going to be so fun!

574
00:39:28,864 --> 00:39:30,143
And the bedtime story.

575
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:34,965
Oh, yes, I've got a really really
good bedtime borey.

576
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:40,031
Once upon a time,
there were 3 little pigs.

577
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:46,595
One fateful day, the pigs
encountered a big bad wolf,

578
00:39:47,603 --> 00:39:50,286
who had a wonderful
surprise for them,

579
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:55,270
The wolf offered the 3 piggies and
all their friends a job working for her.

580
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:58,520
Everyone would be so happy.

581
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:02,618
All the 3 little piggies had to do
was just steal one little crown.

582
00:40:02,642 --> 00:40:04,630
That the beautiful wolf
had wanted ever since

583
00:40:04,656 --> 00:40:08,265
she was a penniless
little street cub.

584
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,063
Unloved and abandoned.

585
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:15,650
But that crown would mean
she was a princess.

586
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:17,874
And everybody loves the princess.

587
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,300
So, the wolf sent the
piggies to get that crown.

588
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:25,186
But the little piggies weren't
up to the challenge.

589
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:27,465
They failed their mission.

590
00:40:27,497 --> 00:40:30,583
So the wolf huffed and puffed

591
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:34,335
and she blew them off
 the face of the earth!

592
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:41,361
The end.

593
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,747
Good luck getting the crown
tomorrow, little piggies.

594
00:40:49,556 --> 00:40:52,405
I know you won't disappoint me.

595
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:02,283
Tower of London

596
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:03,409
Tower of London - LONDON

597
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:08,999
Okay.

598
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:11,956
<font color="#cd9c9c">[HOME OF THE QUEEN'S CROWN]</font>
- Let's go get the crown, for Scarlet.

599
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:14,115
<font color="#cd9c9c">[HOME OF THE QUEEN'S CROWN]</font>

600
00:41:18,197 --> 00:41:20,794
Hello.
3 please.

601
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:23,778
You are not allowed
to enter without an adult.

602
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:26,028
Scram, hooligans.

603
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,239
Woo, a lad.

604
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:36,840
- What lad?
- Holah!

605
00:41:36,865 --> 00:41:39,181
Poof.
Stuart, that way.

606
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:45,669
How many tickets, please?

607
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:48,362
3, please.

608
00:41:48,524 --> 00:41:51,526
One, please.
One.

609
00:41:56,689 --> 00:42:00,236
- Enjoy yourself, love.
- Thank you.

610
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:10,612
- That way.
- Okay.

611
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:15,060
<font color="#cd9c9c">[KEEP OUT]</font>

612
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,553
Go!

613
00:42:17,616 --> 00:42:19,428
Okay, we're in.

614
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,360
Okay, come on.

615
00:42:25,385 --> 00:42:29,143
Hey!
What are you doing here?

616
00:42:29,168 --> 00:42:30,399
Eating?

617
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:32,765
This is a restricted area!

618
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,618
- Hands in the air!
- No...

619
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:37,182
Let me do it.

620
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,124
Stop that!

621
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:48,340
Get back!

622
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,590
Hey-hey-hey...

623
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:27,121
Bob, Stuart, come on.

624
00:43:44,328 --> 00:43:46,482
Stand back.
Leave this to me.

625
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,429
There it is, the crown.
Come on.

626
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:06,410
So.

627
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:10,141
You came for the
queen's crown, did you?

628
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:13,303
Well, you're going to
have to get through me!

629
00:44:13,328 --> 00:44:16,527
The keeper
of the crown.

630
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:25,399
You think it's funny to
mock the elderly, do you?

631
00:44:25,424 --> 00:44:27,135
Uh.
Yes.

632
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,163
I've been up here
for decades.

633
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:34,758
Just waiting for someone to try
and steal the queen's treasure.

634
00:44:35,183 --> 00:44:37,453
Okay.
Me will do it.

635
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:42,050
What are you saying?
And I don't care!

636
00:44:42,075 --> 00:44:44,289
Hee hee.
Ha ha ha.

637
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:50,164
Oh no, you don't.

638
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:52,351
Get out of the way.

639
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:55,028
Ow! Oof!
Ow!

640
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:56,642
For... god sake.

641
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:59,243
Quick, the crown.
After it.

642
00:45:02,348 --> 00:45:04,233
Bob.
Open it.

643
00:45:05,274 --> 00:45:06,736
Alright.

644
00:45:26,192 --> 00:45:28,359
The crown.

645
00:45:33,136 --> 00:45:34,508
The crown.
Quick.

646
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:36,396
Hello.

647
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:46,539
Hey, look at me!

648
00:45:56,393 --> 00:45:58,300
Hello.

649
00:45:58,325 --> 00:45:59,881
- Stop the bloke!
- Stop him, men!

650
00:45:59,906 --> 00:46:02,329
- Aim for the legs.
- Freeze.

651
00:46:06,711 --> 00:46:08,037
Ow.
Manic.

652
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:10,195
Kevin!

653
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,548
The Queen's been kidnapped, Sgt.

654
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:19,253
Blimey!

655
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:44,658
What's going on?

656
00:46:44,683 --> 00:46:46,480
Hello.
Oh, the crown.

657
00:46:46,505 --> 00:46:48,597
Give me the crown.
Now!

658
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:50,844
Ha ha!
I got it!

659
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:57,007
Gentlemen do not steal
 ladies' crowns!

660
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:12,931
The coach.
Waa...

661
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:15,987
Oh, no no no...

662
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:21,373
Oh-Oh dear!

663
00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:31,421
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!

664
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:34,863
Yeah.
Ha ha ha.

665
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:38,261
You scoundrel.
After them!

666
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:41,702
Stop the blighter!

667
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:43,983
- Stop the blighter!
<font color="#ffff80">[SWORD IN THE STONE]</font>

668
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:46,776
You're surrounded.

669
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:05,132
Oh, blimey!

670
00:48:05,157 --> 00:48:09,164
One of England's most famous
myths has become a reality.

671
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:11,543
As a new king
has been crowned.

672
00:48:11,568 --> 00:48:14,727
Bob, who appears to be
a bald jaundice child,

673
00:48:14,752 --> 00:48:17,168
has pulled the famed sword
right from it's stone

674
00:48:17,193 --> 00:48:21,014
which legend dictates,
makes him the new king.

675
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:23,878
Tiny yellow traitor!

676
00:48:37,118 --> 00:48:39,883
Ah-ha-ha.
England!

677
00:48:39,908 --> 00:48:43,392
England!
England!

678
00:48:43,635 --> 00:48:47,300
England.
Eng... land.

679
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,142
- England.
- England.

680
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:51,105
- England.
- England.

Hey!
Help!

683
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:16,377
A studio.
Hello! Hello!

00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:40,390
Hello, King Bob.

687
00:49:40,415 --> 00:49:42,954
Welcome to Buckingham Palace.

688
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:44,799
Uh.
No.

689
00:49:44,825 --> 00:49:46,925
Oh. What's the matter,
Your Majesty?

690
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,033
Whatever is bothering you,
we can make it right.

691
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:52,002
- Just name it.
- Oh.

692
00:49:52,696 --> 00:49:55,343
Ha ha ha.
Buddies.

693
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:58,590
Buddies.
Ha, buddies.

00:49:58,615 --> 00:50:01,772
Ha, buddy.
Ah-ha-ha...

695
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:21,011
King Bob!

696
00:50:21,036 --> 00:50:23,218
- Yeh!
- Hurray!

697
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:25,247
- King Bob!
- Yeh.

698
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:04,317
King Bob!

699
00:51:04,342 --> 00:51:06,256
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

700
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:16,432
Whoa, wait.

701
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:29,184
- Yee-ha!
- King Bob.

702
00:51:29,993 --> 00:51:32,153
Grill chicken!

703
00:51:46,343 --> 00:51:48,237
Yes, King Bob?

704
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:52,153
King Bob?

705
00:51:52,486 --> 00:51:54,114
King Bob?

706
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:57,182
Ah, Claire.
Hm, Tiffany.

707
00:51:57,207 --> 00:51:59,058
My beauties.

708
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,052
Ball!
Yah!

709
00:52:08,077 --> 00:52:09,393
How dare you?

710
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,885
AW!

711
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:18,258
Scarlet.

712
00:52:18,283 --> 00:52:21,980
Don't you Scarlet me.
You backstabbing little traitors!

713
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,606
Using Herb's inventions
to steal my crown!

714
00:52:27,134 --> 00:52:29,515
I feel used,
not going to lie.

715
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,226
You stole my dream.

716
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:35,342
I was going to conquer
England some day.

717
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:37,351
There was going
to be a coronation.

718
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:39,982
And I was going
to be made queen.

719
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:41,934
Every moment was planned.

720
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:45,293
I would wear a dress
so sparkly and glowed.

721
00:52:45,318 --> 00:52:48,423
And everyone whoever doubted me

722
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:52,644
Would be watching
and they would be crying.

723
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:56,159
I was going to be the picture
of elegance and class!

724
00:52:56,184 --> 00:52:59,027
And you pinheads
screwed it up!

725
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:01,553
No no no.
The crown, for you.

726
00:53:01,904 --> 00:53:03,649
No, no no.
King Bob.

727
00:53:03,674 --> 00:53:06,439
You cannot just
abdicate the throne.

728
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:08,294
Who invited the square?

729
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,943
And you definitely cannot just
give the job to this woman.

730
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:13,672
There are laws.

731
00:53:13,697 --> 00:53:16,324
Laws?
What laws?

732
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,544
I give in to
Scarlet Overkill.

733
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:24,888
King Bob has official
changed the law.

734
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:28,656
Clearing the way for Scarlet Overkill
to be crowned Queen of England,

735
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:32,005
She will be coronated at London's
historic Westminster Abbey.

736
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,426
If I'm wasn't so polite,

737
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:36,036
I say this spells certain
doom for the country,

738
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:37,513
if not, the world.

739
00:53:37,538 --> 00:53:41,290
But, I'm so very polite,
that I shall keep my mouth shut.

740
00:53:41,315 --> 00:53:44,126
But, seriously,
we are all in big trouble.

741
00:53:44,151 --> 00:53:46,342
- Scarlet
- Ms. Overkill.

742
00:53:46,495 --> 00:53:49,039
I don't have time
to answer any questions.

743
00:53:49,064 --> 00:53:50,771
I'm just want to thank
the minions for

744
00:53:50,796 --> 00:53:54,061
going above and beyond
the call of duty.

745
00:53:54,086 --> 00:53:59,855
You are 3 tiny golden
pill shaped miracle workers.

746
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,296
And you have stolen not just England,
but my heart.

747
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:06,585
- Scarlet, over here.
- Over here.

748
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,253
Show her,
the buddies.

749
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,888
Pardon Me?

750
00:54:12,256 --> 00:54:15,042
Wow, so many.
[ERiC], [NORBERT]

751
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:16,730
Good for you,

752
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,354
Well.
You'll all get what you deserved.

753
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:50,071
Oh.

754
00:54:51,699 --> 00:54:53,882
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

755
00:54:57,197 --> 00:54:58,696
Buttocks.

756
00:55:04,181 --> 00:55:06,350
I don't want you to
take this the wrong way.

757
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:07,705
But I hate you.

758
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,946
I thought I could
get over what you did.

759
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:13,045
But I feel so betrayed.

760
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:17,268
I think, yes, I think
we're gonna have to break up.

761
00:55:17,293 --> 00:55:19,608
And it's not you.

762
00:55:19,863 --> 00:55:21,070
Oh wait, hold on.

763
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,617
It is you.
It's a 100% you.

764
00:55:23,642 --> 00:55:25,147
Huh.
No no.

765
00:55:25,172 --> 00:55:29,505
So get comfortable, Minions.
Get real real comfortable.

766
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,780
Because this is where
you're going to spend

767
00:55:31,811 --> 00:55:37,201
the rest of your
worthless little lives.

768
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:41,715
Alright, let's do this.

769
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,510
Look.
Look, it's Herb.

770
00:55:43,535 --> 00:55:47,937
Who's this handsome Herb fellow?
No, My name is Blerb.

771
00:55:47,962 --> 00:55:49,722
I'm a-a dungeon master.

772
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:52,987
Prepared for torture
which I do.

773
00:55:53,993 --> 00:55:55,646
Alright, are we comfy?

774
00:55:55,671 --> 00:55:59,502
Doesn't matter.
This is TORTURE!

775
00:56:02,616 --> 00:56:04,169
- Oh.
- Uh, anything?

776
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,248
No no.
My sunshine.

777
00:56:05,273 --> 00:56:08,642
Wow, harder than I thought.
Next machine.

778
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:14,349
Oh, welcome to hang town.
Population: You.

779
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,319
Cut it out.
This is really unprofessional.

780
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:24,792
No laughing in the dungeon.

781
00:56:24,817 --> 00:56:27,358
I want to see tears and
I want to hear screams.

782
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,066
Or I'm going to get...

783
00:56:29,091 --> 00:56:30,328
- Wait.
- Hey.

784
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:33,429
Eww, I've got a groovy idea.

785
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:37,925
Look at this.
Ah-ha-ha.

786
00:56:43,207 --> 00:56:46,491
Hello, the future King Herb Overkill.

787
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:48,859
Please come upstairs to
prepare for the coronation.

788
00:56:48,884 --> 00:56:52,072
Well, I hope you learn
your lesson for today.

789
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:58,502
And by the way, it was me,
Herb, the whole time.

790
00:56:59,385 --> 00:57:02,616
I don't even know
anyone named Blerb.

791
00:57:06,104 --> 00:57:11,331
I am hours away from becoming
the Queen of England.

792
00:57:11,356 --> 00:57:13,246
I know,
it's a gas.

793
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:15,373
- I will finally get my crown.
- Yeah.

794
00:57:15,403 --> 00:57:16,878
It's all I ever wanted.

795
00:57:16,903 --> 00:57:20,026
I'm going to be so happy.

796
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:23,234
But, let me ask you
something, Fabrice.

797
00:57:23,259 --> 00:57:27,594
Does that, look like
this to you?

798
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,546
Mrs. Overkill.

799
00:57:30,571 --> 00:57:34,301
The hair in that picture
is just 2 wavy lines.

800
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:37,232
Oh. So what now,
you're an art critic?

801
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:40,134
I drew that when
I was 5 years old.

802
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:42,439
Get out of my sight.

803
00:57:45,389 --> 00:57:47,406
Bye, Fabrice!

804
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:50,206
I liked him,
he was fun.

805
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:51,773
So, what do you think
of the dress?

806
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:53,995
Oh, it's so beautiful,

807
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:58,452
so fashion forward,
so Valentino.

808
00:57:58,477 --> 00:58:01,111
Oh. The sweetheart neckline
because you're my sweetheart.

809
00:58:01,136 --> 00:58:05,335
The high colored and cinch waist reflect
a simpler more valentine.

810
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,127
The material is a blend of taffeta

811
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:08,939
and high density body armor.

812
00:58:08,964 --> 00:58:11,168
Fully armed and loaded.

813
00:58:11,693 --> 00:58:14,371
And they glow.
That's nuclear.

814
00:58:14,396 --> 00:58:17,061
Nice.
Just one more thing to do.

815
00:58:17,086 --> 00:58:19,339
Got to look good
for the public.

816
00:58:20,002 --> 00:58:22,762
- Do you mind?
- My pleasure.

817
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:27,066
A little tighter, sweetie.
Come on, I can take it.

818
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:29,015
A little tighter.

819
00:58:29,248 --> 00:58:30,481
Tighter.

820
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,543
Must have tiny waist.

821
00:58:34,693 --> 00:58:37,143
Seems to work.
Seems to work.

822
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:38,528
Losing feeling in my legs.

823
00:58:38,553 --> 00:58:40,695
Perfect.
Tight, tight tight tight.

824
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:45,016
Huh?

825
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:48,060
Ah.
Bob, Stuart.

826
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:49,718
- Huh?
- Help me.

827
00:58:49,743 --> 00:58:51,458
Lift up.
Lift up.

828
00:58:51,492 --> 00:58:53,844
Lift up.
Lift up.

I'm so-so excited.
This is perfect.

Everyone looks so nice.

Oh, you're just adorable.

Oh.
Yes!

853
01:00:30,934 --> 01:00:33,150
And that music.
Eh.

01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:36,049
Who is that organist?
She's good.

855
01:00:36,074 --> 01:00:37,980
Right?
She looks like an Edna.

856
01:00:38,005 --> 01:00:41,590
- Edna! You're very good.
- Who's that?

857
01:00:44,551 --> 01:00:47,622
Thanks for doing this, Padre.
Big fan.

858
01:00:47,651 --> 01:00:49,320
Come here, let me squeeze you.

859

Woo.
You're so squishy.

860
01:00:54,739 --> 01:00:57,126
There, Scarlet.

861
01:00:57,151 --> 01:00:58,811
Go go go.

862
01:01:04,651 --> 01:01:06,450
Whoa.
Arh!

01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:09,356
Heh heh.
Move aside.

Up-Up there?
My Puchi?

No.

longer a coronation.

Get them!

Whoa Nelly!

- Guys.
- Kevin.

Hey.

Mind the gap!

919
01:06:30,348 --> 01:06:32,460
Now, what about this one.

920
01:06:32,485 --> 01:06:35,610
Why did the Queen
go to the dentist?

921
01:06:35,635 --> 01:06:38,818
To get her teeth crowned.
Ha-ha-ha.

922
01:06:38,843 --> 01:06:40,339
Ha.
The queen.

923
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:43,144

of the little fellows

927
01:06:49,659 --> 01:06:51,960
who stole the monarchy from me.

928
01:06:51,985 --> 01:06:55,306
And hows that
working out for you?

929
01:06:56,717 --> 01:06:57,913
Oh, yes yes.

930
01:06:57,938 --> 01:06:59,815
I saw what was going
on, on the telly.

931
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,887
Uh.
Telly?

932
01:07:00,912 --> 01:07:03,855
What was meant to be the
coronation of Scarlet Overkill

933
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,247
has gone terribly wrong.

934
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:11,927
Kevin. Kevin.
I know you're out there.

935

You think you'd gotten away?

936
01:07:13,648 --> 01:07:16,386
Well, what do we have here?

Stuart?

939
01:07:19,014 --> 01:07:21,434
Which one shall I kill first?

I will do it, Kevin,
if you're not back here by dawn.

There he is.

Follow me!

948
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:21,860
Harder.
It's just my head.

01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:35,497
Ha-ha-ha...

969
01:10:40,783 --> 01:10:44,153
Ha ha ha.
Come on, no worries.

970
01:10:51,515 --> 01:10:54,525
Wait, what?
How did he?

971
01:10:54,563 --> 01:10:56,220
Hold my bear.

972
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,171
Ha ha ha.
Safe.

973
01:11:20,236 --> 01:11:21,793
- Ha ha.
- Yippee.

974
01:11:21,818 --> 01:11:23,009
- Kevin.
- Woo-hoo-hoo.

975
01:11:23,034 --> 01:11:25,173
- Be careful! Be careful!
- Be careful.

976
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:26,709
So, that's your plan?

977
01:11:26,734 --> 01:11:31,141
Make yourself a bigger target?
Ha-ha-ha.

978
01:11:32,509 --> 01:11:34,492
- One more scone.
- Yes yes.

979
01:11:36,014 --> 01:11:37,941
Huh?
Kevin?

980
01:11:37,966 --> 01:11:40,796
Hey. It's Kevin.
Come on.

981
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:46,121
YAH!

982
01:11:57,404 --> 01:11:59,158
Ha ha ha ha.

983
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:06,248
And so help me.

984
01:12:06,273 --> 01:12:08,276
I never want to see
another one of your

985
01:12:08,301 --> 01:12:10,364
goofy buttered faces ever again!

986
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:11,437
Scarlet!
Scarlet!

987
01:12:11,462 --> 01:12:12,654
What?

988
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:14,096
Scarlet!
Scarlet!

989
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:17,011
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

990
01:12:18,829 --> 01:12:21,042
Oh no, you don't.

991
01:12:21,067 --> 01:12:23,092
Yah!

992
01:12:23,575 --> 01:12:26,516
Whoa!
Wah!

993
01:12:28,808 --> 01:12:31,636
And just for the record,
my little double eggs.

994
01:12:31,661 --> 01:12:35,935
You can thank Kevin for
what I'm about to do to you!

995
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:36,982
Aww!

996
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:37,786
Ow!

997
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:39,193
Oww!

998
01:12:43,517 --> 01:12:46,403
- Yeh!
- Buddies!

999
01:12:46,902 --> 01:12:48,317
Tony!
Hey hey.

1000
01:12:48,342 --> 01:12:50,566
Tom!
And Chris!

1001
01:12:50,591 --> 01:12:52,526
- Bodyguard!
- You're the man!

1002
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:54,834
Ha ha ha.
Buddies!

1003
01:12:54,859 --> 01:12:56,756
Hey, Kevin!

1004
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:09,445
Eww.

1005
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:12,362
Ah.
Kevin! Kevin!

1006
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,027
Enough!

1007
01:13:14,052 --> 01:13:18,996
This... ends... now...!

1008
01:13:44,334 --> 01:13:45,978
KEVIN !!!

1009
01:13:46,003 --> 01:13:49,877
Ha-ha-ha, you imbecile.
Have fun exploding.

1010
01:13:49,902 --> 01:13:51,826
Take me
home...

1011
01:13:51,851 --> 01:13:54,973
- What's the rush?
- Got to get out of here!

1012
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:59,153
Let... us... go!

1013
01:14:01,918 --> 01:14:05,938
Whoaaa!

1014
01:14:05,963 --> 01:14:08,876
No, no no no...

1015
01:14:15,406 --> 01:14:20,318
Ke-Ke-Ke
KEVIN!

1016
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,692
He's gone.

1017
01:14:32,884 --> 01:14:34,333
Here.
Your Puchi.

1018
01:14:34,358 --> 01:14:37,536
Huh. Puchi!
You came back.

1019
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:42,362
Kevin's gone.

1020
01:15:01,282 --> 01:15:02,788
Look!

1021
01:15:04,848 --> 01:15:07,018
- Kevin!
- Kevin!

1022
01:15:26,892 --> 01:15:28,455
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1023
01:15:30,869 --> 01:15:33,585
Yoo hoo hoo.
Ouch.

1024
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:47,758
- Stuart.
- Hm.

1025
01:15:47,783 --> 01:15:49,865
- Bob.
- Yes?

1026
01:15:51,618 --> 01:15:52,947
Okay.

1027
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,825
Ladies and gentlemen.

1028
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:14,449
We are here today
to celebrate the Minions.

1029
01:16:19,048 --> 01:16:23,201
The country owes you a
great debt of gratitude.

1030
01:16:23,394 --> 01:16:29,085
Bob, you were a wise and
noble king for all of 8 hours.

1031
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:32,565
So for you,
I offer this tiny crown

1032
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,933
for your Teddy Bear, Tim.

1033
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:38,283
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you.

1034
01:16:38,308 --> 01:16:40,078
Oh.
Very good, Bob.

1035
01:16:40,103 --> 01:16:44,031
Oh!
Oh, spectacular!

1036
01:16:44,056 --> 01:16:47,467
I'm so proud of you boys.

1037
01:16:47,492 --> 01:16:50,084
- Oh, Stuart.
- Ah. What's up.

1038
01:16:50,109 --> 01:16:56,559
For you, I have this beautiful,
super duper incredible

1039
01:16:56,584 --> 01:16:58,490
snow globe.

1040
01:16:58,515 --> 01:17:00,456
Snow globe?

1041
01:17:00,481 --> 01:17:01,981
And, look.
Look.

1042
01:17:02,006 --> 01:17:04,398
Hours of excitement.

1043
01:17:04,423 --> 01:17:09,316
Oh... Yippee.
Thank you.

1044
01:17:11,094 --> 01:17:15,124
Oh, Stuart.
We're just messing with you.

1045
01:17:15,149 --> 01:17:18,219
Don't be mad at me.
It was Kevin’s idea.

1046
01:17:18,244 --> 01:17:20,243
- Ha.
- Kevin!

1047
01:17:20,448 --> 01:17:23,449
We have a much
better surprise for you.

1048
01:17:23,474 --> 01:17:25,880
Here.
A Super Mega Ukulele.

1049
01:17:25,905 --> 01:17:29,030
Wo-Wow.
Cool.

1050
01:18:03,384 --> 01:18:05,033
Thank you.

1051
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,282
Right.
Uh.

1052
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:10,066
And finally, Kevin.

1053
01:18:10,529 --> 01:18:12,212
Yes, my queen.

1054
01:18:12,237 --> 01:18:15,846
You are hero of the
highest order.

1055
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:20,822
For your bravery and valor,
I am knighting you.

1056
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:24,770
From here on out,
you are Sir Kevin.

1057
01:18:25,106 --> 01:18:26,935
Well done.

1058
01:18:36,576 --> 01:18:38,834
What a beautiful moment.

1059
01:18:38,859 --> 01:18:40,946
- Kumbaya!
- Kumbaya!

1060
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:46,329
The nation and the world was
celebrating Kevin, Stuart, and Bob.

1061
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,541
The last few thousand
years were rough,

1062
01:18:48,566 --> 01:18:53,783
no question, but things were
finally going their way.

1063
01:18:53,808 --> 01:18:57,591
Kevin had never been more proud.

1064
01:18:57,616 --> 01:18:59,426
But something was missing.

1065
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:03,083
Ha ha, yes.
Good show Good show.

1066
01:19:03,851 --> 01:19:06,960
My crown is gone.
It's gone!

1067
01:19:06,985 --> 01:19:08,221
Blimey!

1068
01:19:08,246 --> 01:19:10,886
- She lost the crown.
- Oh my god.

1069
01:19:13,216 --> 01:19:14,754
Ha-ha-ha...

1070
01:19:14,779 --> 01:19:15,923
Scarlet?

1071
01:19:21,372 --> 01:19:22,980
They took everything from me.

1072
01:19:23,005 --> 01:19:25,452
My castle.
My reputation.

1073
01:19:25,477 --> 01:19:28,150
Things looked bleak, baby,
I'm not going to lie.

1074
01:19:28,175 --> 01:19:32,674
But now, at least,
I have my crown!

1075
01:19:46,287 --> 01:19:49,086
Fellow, give me that back.

1076
01:19:49,111 --> 01:19:52,272
No, I don't think so.

1077
01:19:52,297 --> 01:19:55,658
You have no idea
who you are messing with.

1078
01:19:55,683 --> 01:19:59,225
I'm the greatest
supervillain of all time.

1079
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:02,250
Oh, were you?

1080
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:11,873
Bud-Bud-Buddies.
Come here. Come here.

1081
01:20:11,898 --> 01:20:14,091
Lo-Lo-Look!

1082
01:20:29,739 --> 01:20:33,578
It's the boss.
The boss! Come on!

1083
01:20:33,603 --> 01:20:39,818
Are you really going to allow that
little penguin to make off with my crown?

1084
01:20:40,618 --> 01:20:45,068
Oh, Herb.
I'm done.

1085
01:20:45,093 --> 01:20:47,165
Hey. Hey.
Scarlet.

1086
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,615
Here.

1087
01:20:48,947 --> 01:20:51,830
For Me?
Oh.

1088
01:20:51,855 --> 01:20:55,601
Yes, for you.
Bye bye.

1089
01:20:55,626 --> 01:20:57,860
Big boss!

1090
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:03,798
And that is how the Minions
found their new boss.

1091
01:21:03,823 --> 01:21:05,833
He was cunning.
He was evil.

1092
01:21:05,858 --> 01:21:07,408
He was perfect.

1093
01:21:07,433 --> 01:21:09,392
He was

1094
01:21:09,417 --> 01:21:12,213
despicable.
