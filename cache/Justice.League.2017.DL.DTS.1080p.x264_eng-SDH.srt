runs the whole kit.

1461
01:47:54,511 --> 01:47:56,429
I mean, he did the Bilbao job
two years ago.

1462
01:47:56,596 --> 01:47:58,306
Yeah, he has it all in storage
in Croydon.

1463
01:47:58,473 --> 01:48:00,225
- The Belgian?
- Right, yeah, the Belgian.

1464
01:48:00,392 --> 01:48:03,520
LOIS: <i>This time,
the light shone on the heroes</i>

1465
01:48:03,687 --> 01:48:07,315
<i>coming out of the shadows
to tell us we won't be alone again.</i>

1466
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:14,114
<i>Our darkness was deep
and seemed to swallow all hope.</i>

1467
01:48:14,823 --> 01:48:17,659
But <i>these</i> heroes
were here the whole time

1468
01:48:18,493 --> 01:48:23,581
<i>to remind us that hope is real,
that you can see it.</i>

1469
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:30,505
<i>All you have to do is look,</i>

1470
01:48:33,091 --> 01:48:34,342
<i>up in the sky.</i>

1471
01:48:35,677 --> 01:48:36,886
(SONIC BOOM)

1472
01:49:32,901 --> 01:49:35,153
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1473
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:37,280
Not at all, Barry.

1474
01:49:38,031 --> 01:49:39,032
Curious myself.

1475
01:49:39,199 --> 01:49:41,076
Yeah, and it's not
like a competition, you know?

1476
01:49:41,201 --> 01:49:43,369
Well, it is a competition.

1477
01:49:43,536 --> 01:49:46,372
But, you know, it's not like
a macho, uh, measuring thing.

1478
01:49:46,539 --> 01:49:47,957
But if I win, you're off the team.

1479
01:49:51,211 --> 01:49:52,921
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1480
01:49:54,255 --> 01:49:55,298
- No...
- Oof.

1481
01:49:57,050 --> 01:49:58,551
If I Win...

1482
01:49:58,927 --> 01:50:01,679
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch.

1483
01:50:01,888 --> 01:50:04,224
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1484
01:50:04,849 --> 01:50:06,351
I feel stung by that.

1485
01:50:08,144 --> 01:50:09,521
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1486
01:50:09,687 --> 01:50:10,688
Deal.

1487
01:50:11,606 --> 01:50:12,607
Which coast?

1488
01:50:13,441 --> 01:50:15,276
Uh, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1489
01:50:16,736 --> 01:50:17,862
Which is that way.

1490
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:20,990
Because the sun, and it's...

1491
01:58:02,201 --> 01:58:03,703
(DOOR BUZZES)

1492
01:58:03,786 --> 01:58:05,705
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

1493
01:58:07,123 --> 01:58:08,291
GUARD 1: All right,
let's keep it moving.

1494
01:58:08,457 --> 01:58:10,501
<i>GUARD 2: (ON RADIO)
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1495
01:58:11,794 --> 01:58:12,795
<i>Luthor!</i>

1496
01:58:22,138 --> 01:58:25,433
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1497
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:32,982
(LAUGHING)

1498
01:58:58,257 --> 01:59:00,468
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1499
01:59:00,635 --> 01:59:02,386
Care for a glass of Goût de Diamants?

1500
01:59:02,928 --> 01:59:06,807
I was just celebrating God's return out
of the ground and back up into the sky.

1501
01:59:07,516 --> 01:59:10,728
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1502
01:59:10,853 --> 01:59:12,146
DEATHSTROKE: You better not
be wasting my time.

1503
01:59:12,355 --> 01:59:16,150
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1504
01:59:16,275 --> 01:59:18,944
<i>We have to level the playing field,
Mr. Wilson.</i>

1505
01:59:19,904 --> 01:59:21,280
To put it plainly,

1506
01:59:23,157 --> 01:59:26,369
shouldn't we have a league of our own?

1507
01:59:55,481 --> 01:59:56,482
