552
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,547
Mouse.

553
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,593
I never thought I'd see you again.


644
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,295
When you...

645
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,380
When you disappeared that night...

646
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,091
I'm sorry.

647
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,386
We were supposed to watch out
for each other and then you were gone.

648
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:55,021
Shining Light sent me here.

649
00:46:55,104 --> 00:47:01,319
Put the needle in my spine
and filled me full of the blue poison.

650
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,908
I should have found you.

651
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:12,288
No. I'm the big sister.
I should have come back for you, but...

652
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,503
...they made me into...

653
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:24,675
...a monster.

654
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:31,057
If that's true, we're both monsters now.

655
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,770
Did it hurt?

656
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,022
I wanted to die.

657
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,527
Me too.

658
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,822
They had one dose left

659
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,200
and they knew it worked on you

660
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,787
so they figured it would work on me.

661
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,630
I'm sorry.

662
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,341
It's not your fault.

663
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,278
It's not your fault.

710
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,072
These people you were with...

711
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,242
They keep me safe.
They'll keep you safe too.

712
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:06,749
Or we can go home. Back to the village.

713
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,836
There is no village anymore.

714
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,213
What?

715
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,174
They came for us.

716
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,343
Who?

717
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,594
The Americans.

718
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,555
This hero came shrieking
out of the sky like a demon.

719
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:25,768
Destroyed the camp.
And all the villages around it too.

720
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,146
There were bodies everywhere.

721
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,815
Everyone's gone.

722
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,818
Then we'll go somewhere else.
Back to Japan.

723
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,738
Maybe grandma and grandpa
are still alive.

724
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,698
You don't care?

725
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,242
That the Superhero split
an old woman in half?

726
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,829
That the entire school caved in
with the kids inside?

727
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,832
That babies burned alive in their cribs
when the propane tanks exploded?

728
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,752
I never wanted this.
But they were right all along.

729
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,463
Shining Light is full of shit!

730
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,007
Shining Light fights injustice.

731
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,717
They stand up for
people without a voice.

732
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,137
They murdered our parents!

733
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,306
This country is an enemy
to the whole world now.

734
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,185
We need to fight back. Fight with me!

735
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:13,607
You're the boy who nursed
every mouse who lost its mother.

736
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,820
That was a long time ago.

737
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,657
You're still my brother.

738
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:27,246
Then... you know I have to do this.
