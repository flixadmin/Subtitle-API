00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:13,791
"HELL IS EMPTY AND ALL THE DEVILS
ARE HERE!" WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

2
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,291
Thanks for coming over so quickly, Egon.

3
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,583
The workers found
these two corpses this morning.

4
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,583
They're still children.

5
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,541
Strange. It's as if someone
dressed them in costumes.

6
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:41,541
Oh, God...

7
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:01,375
AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT
NUCLEAR POWER FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD!

8
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:34,583
AS YOU SOW, SO YOU SHALL REAP

9
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,416
On time, like a clockwork.

10
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,208
Where were we?

11
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,833
The Einstein-Rosen bridge.

12
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,000
A passage...

13
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,625
between a black hole, the entry,

14
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,416
and a white hole, the exit, which...

15
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,583
connects time and space.

16
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,416
To pass through it
is to travel through time.

17
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:17,708
Tick-tock.

18
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Our thinking is shaped by dualism.

19
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,875
Entrance, exit. Black, white. Good, evil.

20
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,250
Everything appears as opposite pairs.

21
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,208
But that's wrong.

22
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,208
Have you ever heard of the triquetra?

23
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,916
The trinity knot.

24
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,375
Nothing is complete
without a third dimension.

25
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,583
There isn't only up and down.

26
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,708
There's a center, too.

27
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,958
I think Einstein and Rosen
overlooked something.

28
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,833
"Sic mundus

29
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,208
creatus est."

30
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:02,250
A wormhole connects not just two,
but three different dimensions.

31
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,750
Future, present...

32
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,583
and past.

33
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,416
Helge...

34
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,750
Good Lord.

35
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,125
Just look at you.

36
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,000
I...

37
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,875
I was at the construction site.

38
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,166
-There was something...
-Take off your clothes.

39
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,583
I told you to take off your clothes.

40
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,333
Go on.

41
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,208
Wait here.

42
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,125
Hello, my boy.
What have you been getting into again?

43
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,083
-I was at the construction site.
-That's nice.

44
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,708
They found something there.

45
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,625
-What did they find?
-He's been creeping around again.

46
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,208
Tell me, what did they find?

47
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,666
There were police everywhere
at the construction site.

48
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,625
-Police?
-Two dead bodies.

49
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,916
-In the middle of the construction site.
-What are you talking about?

50
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,458
They looked like kids.

51
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,666
-What? Are you sure?
-Yes.

52
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,666
You're not lying?

53
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,500
You're late.

54
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,250
The coins for Claudia are on the table.

55
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,041
I've never seen this kind of burn before.

56
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,375
Possibly from a phosphorous grenade.

57
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,291
It's also interesting that both their ears
are completely destroyed.

58
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,125
And that's not the only strange thing.

59
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,541
They both had one around their neck.

60
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,958
The coin is from 1986.

61
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,666
Is this a joke?

62
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,541
It gets even better. Take a look.

63
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,416
The little tag on the collar.

64
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,958
"Made in China"?

65
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,375
All their clothes are from China.

66
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,291
Chinese?

67
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,500
They're definitely not from around here.
The boy here...

68
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,458
He looks Mediterranean, or maybe Arabian.

69
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,583
I don't know about the redhead.

70
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,458
This tattoo is strange.

71
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,583
I've seen all sorts of odd things,
but this...

72
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,166
definitely takes the cake.

73
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,833
One, two...

74
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,458
three.

75
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:05,375
One, two, three, four, five...

76
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,166
You write
about Nietzsche's eternal recurrence...

77
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,750
A universe that expands
and then collapses again.

78
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,833
A universe that repeats itself endlessly.

79
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,750
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME
H.G. TANNHAUS

80
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,541
It's been a long time
since I've seen that.

81
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,208
There were only 500 copies in total.

82
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,958
You write about the lunar-solar cycle,

83
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,375
in which everything repeats itself
every 33 years.

84
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,541
From a cosmic point of view, yes.

85
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:35,250
Every 33 years, the cycle of the moon
is synchronized with that of the sun.

86
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,833
But the 33...

87
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,958
is more than that.

88
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,541
We encounter it everywhere.

89
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,333
Jesus performed 33 miracles.

90
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,000
There are 33 litanies of the angels.

91
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,875
Dante's 33 cantos in purgatory,

92
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,666
and 33 in paradise.

93
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,791
And it is the age
at which the Antichrist begins his rule.

94
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,250
Why would someone do that?

95
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,166
What?

96
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,500
Kill.

97
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,541
Why?

98
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,541
What's inside them?
Where does it come from?

99
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,708
-Why someone becomes a murderer?
-Yes.

100
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,041
Are you born one or do you become one?

101
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,708
It would certainly make our work easier
if we knew ahead of time.

102
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,791
Lock them up while they're still little.

103
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,666
Before they get on the wrong track.

104
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,791
Why does someone become a murderer?

105
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,458
Hey, weirdo!

106
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,041
-Why the big hurry?
-Buying silk stockings for mommy?

107
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,791
See if there's anything in his pockets.

108
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,416
-Leave me alone!
-Scream. No one will hear you.

109
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,250
Don't piss your pants. Your old man's
got dough coming out of his ears.

110
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,125
-There's someone there.
-Let's get out of here!

111
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,541
Hey, wait a minute.

112
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,333
Did someone just come by here?

113
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,791
An old man in pajamas?

114
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,958
Are you okay?

115
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,875
You have to defend yourself.
Or they'll never stop.

116
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,208
But they're stronger than me.

117
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,666
Then just bite them next time.

118
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:32,000
Imagine you're standing
in an infinitely large, dark room,

119
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,291
shining a light to the left.

120
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,916
The beam should continue

121
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,416
in the same direction forever.

122
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,875
There's no reason to assume

123
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,958
that it could come back at you
from the right.

124
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,666
But a wormhole

125
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,208
changes the topology

126
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,458
of space-time.

127
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,958
Bends it...

128
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,625
Nothing is where it belongs anymore.

129
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,041
Hello. Could you help me?

130
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,375
Excuse me. We're not from around here.

131
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,291
-I'm looking for Killinger Strasse 61.
-That's where I live.

132
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,083
It's down the road and then to the right.

133
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,708
-Are you Mr. Egon Tiedemann?
-No.

134
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,291
How rude of me.

135
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,833
My name is Agnes Nielsen.

136
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,208
And this is my son Tronte.

137
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,583
We're new in Winden.

138
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,291
Tronte?
Come and say hello to the nice man.

139
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,708
Hello.

140
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,291
You're Tronte Nielsen?

141
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,041
And you're Agnes Nielsen?

142
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,458
Yes.

143
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:48,625
Imagine traveling back in time
and meeting your father.

144
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,416
Before he had you.

145
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,541
Excuse the question.

146
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,083
But what year is it?

147
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,291
1953.

148
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,708
Would you have already
changed things with this encounter?

149
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,208
And is it even possible to change things?

150
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,250
Are you all right?

151
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:17,083
Or is time an eternal beast
that can't be defeated?

152
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,125
What do you think?

153
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,541
Can we change the course of events?

154
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,000
Any scientist would tell you no.

155
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,875
Causal determinism forbids it.

156
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,333
But it is human nature to believe
that we play a role in our own lives.

157
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,083
That our actions can change things.

158
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:48,625
All my life, I've dreamed of traveling
through time, to see what was

159
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,416
and what will be.

160
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,708
You don't dream that anymore?

161
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,916
Dreams change.

162
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,083
Other things become important.

163
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:04,083
My place is not
in the yesterday or tomorrow.

164
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,875
Rather, it's right here.

165
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,041
And now.

166
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,500
Can I help you?

167
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,083
Are you looking for a watch?

168
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,333
Are you H.G. Tannhaus?

169
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,208
This H.G. Tannhaus?

170
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,250
No, not the same guy then, right?

171
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,916
What year is it?

172
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,333
What year?

173
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,791
1953.

174
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,833
1953.

175
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,291
Stalin is dead. England has a Queen.

176
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,750
And Nanga Parbat has been conquered.

177
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,458
1953 as it lives and breathes, yes.

178
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,416
It's not possible. Impossible.

179
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,791
The number 33.

180
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,500
You write that it could be
the time difference...

181
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,541
between the planes
of a three dimensional wormhole.

182
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,291
That's just a theory.

183
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,166
But perhaps it could be
the crux of the matter.

184
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,291
Here, girl.

185
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,000
Here.

186
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,125
You're late.
I've told you before to be on time.

187
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,208
Claudia, I forgot the money at home.

188
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,541
I'll bring it over later.

189
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,291
Come in.

190
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,125
FROM 1 TO 100

191
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,583
Wrong.

192
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,041
Wrong.

193
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,083
Wrong.

194
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:50,875
There are two rooms
and a small kitchen upstairs.

195
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,500
Unfortunately,
the plumber hasn't been here yet.

196
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,125
The water upstairs isn't working properly.

197
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,541
This is my daughter Claudia.

198
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,250
Claudia, please say hello.

199
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,166
Hello.

200
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,625
Agnes Nielsen.

201
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,583
Tronte?

202
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,583
-I'm Tronte.
-Claudia.

203
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,666
This is our dog Gretchen.
I hope you're okay with dogs.

204
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,708
My husband isn't here much.

205
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,333
He's with the police.

206
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:22,125
Sometimes it seems like he thinks
he alone is responsible for this town.

207
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,708
And your husband is... ?

208
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,791
-He's dead.
-Oh. I didn't mean to...

209
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,291
I talk without thinking. It...

210
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,458
I'm truly sorry.

211
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,250
Do you want to see the rooms upstairs?

212
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,250
Claudia, why don't you show
the boy the neighborhood later?

213
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,041
Here you go.

214
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,208
Should I call a doctor?

215
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,791
-Hello.
-Hello, Ines. Hello, Jana.

216
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,625
I'm here to pick up Dad's watch.
Is it ready?

217
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,166
Right...

218
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,416
Kahnwald, Kahnwald...

219
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:25,958
Kahnwald.

220
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,291
Here you go, Ines.
Purrs like a kitten again.

221
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,791
Did you hear
what the police found this morning?

222
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:37,000
No. But I'm sure you're about to tell me.

223
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,166
Jana heard it in the teachers' room.

224
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,416
The suspense is killing me.

225
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,541
Mom?

226
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,416
They found two dead bodies
on Doppler's construction site.

227
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,250
Two little boys.
They were abducted by aliens.

228
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,958
-For experiments.
-What did you just say?

229
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,916
About the aliens?

230
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,416
No, about the boys.

231
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,500
The police found
two dead boys this morning.

232
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,125
The discovery of uranium fission

233
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,166
has heralded in a new era
in the history of humankind.

234
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,333
An era of reason,

235
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:35,791
objectivity,

236
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,083
and the dominance of man over nature.

237
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,125
ENERGY OF THE FUTURE

238
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,958
We can harness this phenomenon

239
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,791
by economically utilizing
neutron-induced fission

240
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:53,083
in nuclear reactors.

241
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,375
A minuscule atom...

242
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,000
can change the world.

243
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:03,708
And it is here that we will build
the first German nuclear power plant,

244
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:06,625
ensuring the local community's

245
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,708
long-term stability and prosperity.

246
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,916
STOP! POLICE
KEEP OUT! CRIME SCENE

247
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,208
I need a list of all the workers
that have been on the premises.

248
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,583
What's the point?

249
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:24,458
You should be asking who might have a
problem with the power plant being built.

250
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,791
The power plant?

251
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,000
I just spoke to the city council
about the building permit.

252
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,500
And just like that,

253
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,041
two dead children's corpses appear
on the construction site one day earlier?

254
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,708
And who put them there, in your opinion?

255
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,250
The coal plant operators.

256
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,208
You don't believe me.

257
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,416
If this power plant gets built,
it will be nothing short of a revolution.

258
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,875
Not only will it change Winden.

259
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,833
Nuclear energy

260
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:03,916
will bring growth and wealth
to the entire nation.

261
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,583
But it means change.

262
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,666
The old must give way to the new.

263
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,625
Not everyone likes that.

264
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,083
I'll send you a list with the names
of the coal plant operators.

265
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,416
You'll see.

266
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,625
The whole thing is a conspiracy.

267
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:57,000
These are our caves.
We're not allowed to go in very far.

268
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,750
But sometimes we do it anyway.
As a dare, you know?

269
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:01,958
A dare?

270
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:05,875
Sure.

271
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,916
Shouldn't you be heading home by now?

272
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:11,791
And you still owe me a mark.

273
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,583
Come on. Let's keep going.

274
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,166
We're rid of him.

275
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,500
Come on. Come.

276
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:50,583
Gretchen! Come, Gretchen, come!

277
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:58,666
-Is one of the two my son?
-I can't help you.

278
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,375
I just want to know
if one of them is mine.

279
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:02,208
-Calm down!
-Let go. Right now!

280
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,666
What's going on here?

281
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,833
The two boys you found this morning,
what did they look like?

282
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:11,041
What did they look like?
Did one have brown hair? 11 years old?

283
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,291
-Why do you want to know?
-My son...

284
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:17,583
My son disappeared. All I want to know
is if one of the dead kids is mine.

285
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:22,083
His name is Mikkel.
He's 11 years old. Brown hair. Blue eyes.

286
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,541
About this tall. I have a picture.

287
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,416
-Shit, my jacket!
-He's drunk.

288
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:29,750
No.

289
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:34,708
One's pretty dark, brown eyes. Foreign.
The other a bit taller, bright red hair.

290
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,500
You're sure there wasn't a third?

291
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,791
Have you reported your son missing?

292
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,250
Do you know someone
by the name of Helge Doppler?

293
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,000
-Bernd Doppler's son?
-No. Old, about 70.

294
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,041
The only old one is Bernd Doppler.

295
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,375
Bernd Doppler
from the nuclear power plant?

296
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:56,875
-Bernd is Helge's dad.
-Correct.

297
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,208
Stop. Wait!

298
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,250
But you...

299
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,333
Why are you so fascinated with time?

300
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:14,500
I want to understand if I can change it.

301
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,625
If everything has a purpose, and if so...

302
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,375
who decides about this purpose?

303
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,625
Coincidence?

304
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,250
God?

305
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,208
Or is it us?

306
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,250
Are we actually free in our actions?

307
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:34,083
Or is it all created anew,
in an eternally recurring cycle?

308
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,500
And we can only obey the laws of nature

309
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:39,625
and are nothing but slaves
of space and time.

310
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,583
-Egon.
-What?

311
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:57,375
-They're here.
-Who?

312
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,625
The woman who called about the rooms.

313
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,458
She's odd, but I think she's nice.

314
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,833
I think she'll take the rooms.

315
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,375
Did something bad happen?

316
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:24,541
No. It's just...

317
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,125
Everything's fine.

318
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,208
Mrs. Nielsen?

319
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,083
Mrs. Nielsen,
this is Egon Tiedemann, my husband.

320
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,166
Hello.

321
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,833
Hello.

322
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,458
Your wife has told me a lot about you.

323
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,125
-You have a very nice home.
-Thank you.

324
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,083
Did you arrive today?

325
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,875
May I ask
why you came to Winden, of all places?

326
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,333
Stop questioning her.

327
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,958
My husband is a policeman.
He can't help being curious.

328
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,583
My grandmother is from Winden.

329
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,958
She always gushed about this town.

330
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,833
May I ask
what your grandmother's name was?

331
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:19,708
Dad! Dad! Dad!

332
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,416
Gretchen is gone! In the woods.

333
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:26,208
-She was there and then she was gone.
-Calm down and tell me what happened.

334
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:29,375
I was showing Tronte the woods.
The path down into town.

335
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,041
Gretchen was with us the whole time,
then she disappeared.

336
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,000
And where's Helge?

337
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,500
-Maybe Gretchen is with Helge.
-Yes.

338
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:40,458
-That must be it.
-Can you go and find out?

339
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,708
-I was going to see the Dopplers anyway.
-Egon...

340
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:50,916
I invited Agnes and Tronte to dinner.
Don't be late again, okay?

341
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:59,916
Time loops have a significant impact
on the principle of causality.

342
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:05,166
On the relationship of cause and effect.

343
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:11,208
As long as a wormhole exists,
there is a closed time loop.

344
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,833
Inside it,
everything is mutually dependent.

345
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,000
The past
doesn't just influence the future.

346
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,625
The future also influences the past.

347
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:28,458
It's like the question
of the chicken and the egg.

348
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,833
We can no longer say
which of the two came first.

349
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,958
Everything is interconnected.

350
00:33:58,416 --> 00:33:59,250
Hey.

351
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,291
You're Helge Doppler, aren't you?

352
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,416
Yes. Why?

353
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,750
Look at this.

354
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,875
Have you ever seen that before?

355
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:30,125
No.

356
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,666
Did you find the man you're looking for?

357
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,333
Yes.

358
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,208
You look sad.

359
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:51,208
What's in your box?

360
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,000
Did you kill them?

361
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:11,000
Hey. I asked if you killed them.

362
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,625
They just fall from the sky.
They just plop down.

363
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:18,666
I just collect them.

364
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,833
They're so beautiful when they're dead.

365
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,625
But you will kill something.

366
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:39,416
The two boys at the construction site.

367
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:44,875
My brother.

368
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:51,500
My son.

369
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,541
Not now, but in the future.

370
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,208
But I can change it, you know.

371
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,458
I can change the past.

372
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,291
And the future.

373
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:07,916
Help!

374
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,208
If you don't exist,
all of this won't happen.

375
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:14,541
No!

376
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,333
-Mrs. Doppler will be right down.
-Thank you.

377
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,291
Hello, Mrs. Doppler.

378
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,833
My husband isn't home.

379
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:10,125
I...

380
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,250
I'm looking for Gretchen.

381
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,916
Our dog.

382
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,958
-Perhaps Helge took her home?
-Certainly not.

383
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:21,333
Helge knows
we don't allow animals in the house.

384
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,791
Then I have no idea where she is.

385
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,083
There is no dog here.

386
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,375
Anything else?

387
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,875
No. Thank you.

388
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,791
Sorry about the disturbance.

389
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,875
In case the dog turns up...

390
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,416
Good day.

391
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,333
Helge?

392
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,875
Helge!

393
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:40,583
All our lives are connected.

394
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:45,000
One fate bound to another.

395
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:49,041
Every one of our deeds is merely

396
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,250
a response to a previous deed.

397
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,625
Cause and effect.

398
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,875
Nothing but an endless dance.

399
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,750
MISSING
MIKKEL NIELSEN

400
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:13,833
Everything is connected
to everything else.

401
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:29,041
But that's just a theory.

402
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:38,416
I can't shake the feeling that you're
actually here about something else.

403
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:42,458
What if I told you
that everything in your book was true?

404
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,666
That time travel is possible.

405
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,625
Your theory on the formation of wormholes

406
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,083
through gravitational impulses
is not just theory.

407
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,208
There is such a hole. Here in Winden.

408
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,250
I come from the future.

409
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,583
I traveled through the wormhole to 1986.

410
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:31,083
Where... where did you get that?

411
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:32,208
It's broken.

412
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,083
You have to fix it.

413
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:36,083
I can't do that.

414
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:39,875
Aren't those your initials? You built it.

415
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:44,083
This device enables one to travel
through time and space?

416
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,750
It can create a wormhole?

417
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,583
It opens a portal through which
one can travel

418
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:52,250
33 years into the past
and 33 years into the future.

419
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,375
And the wormhole you traveled through?

420
00:43:57,916 --> 00:43:59,500
Did that device create it?

421
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,250
No.

422
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:05,291
A few months ago,
an incident at the nuclear power plant

423
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,166
released a blast of energy.

424
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:12,291
But the device is able
to repeat that same process.

425
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,375
And you want to create another wormhole?

426
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,916
No, I want to destroy the one that exists.

427
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:24,708
I want you to leave now.

428
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:29,291
This town is like a festering wound.

429
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,250
And we're all a part of it.
But I can change it.

430
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:34,375
-Your device can change it.
-Leave.

431
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:36,541
Leave now.

432
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,416
I've seen the future.

433
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:55,458
I know what will happen.

434
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:01,375
I have to set things right again.
And you have to help me.

435
00:49:56,666 --> 00:50:00,666
