1
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:37,933
All right, everybody. Listen up.

2
00:01:38,142 --> 00:01:42,688
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
who were not with us this morning...

3
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:45,065
...we raided his headquarters.

4
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:47,109
Also his last-known address.

5
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:51,405
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

6
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:55,201
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The man himself smelled us coming.

7
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:00,039
So study the face. Study the file.

8
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,625
Get a big old raging hard-on...

9
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,128
...at the idea
of catching this piece of shit.

10
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:09,048
My apologies
to the H.R. department.

11
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:13,093
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

12
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:14,845
All right.

13
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:16,972
On the hit parade, 1998.

14
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:19,141
Reputed to have whacked
one "Dog" Paulson...

15
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,228
...back when our bandidos
were wresting the crank trade away...

16
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:23,979
...from the SoCal biker gangs.

17
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:27,608
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

18
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:31,445
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals...

19
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:34,281
...I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance...

20
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,742
...of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

21
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:39,912
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

22
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,122
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that...

23
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:43,833
...but we couldn't make it stick.

24
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,627
Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

25
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:50,756
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

26
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:54,176
Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
what's going on down there.

27
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,178
We sure don't want it going on
up here...

28
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:58,180
...which brings us to the good news.

29
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:02,893
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

30
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:06,981
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name: No-Doze.

31
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,693
Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law...

32
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,528
...a.k.a. Gonzo.

33
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:17,199
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body--

34
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,785
Either hiding it there
or pulling it out. Not sure.

35
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:23,455
--when he got his arm crushed
clean off.

36
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:26,709
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my website. Hilarious.

37
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:28,878
Anyway. The upshot is...

38
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:34,425
...we got us a nice, big, juicy,
bloody fingerprint...

39
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:38,053
...which belongs to Señor Tuco.

40
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:41,849
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

41
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:45,519
That is, provided we find this guy.

42
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:49,023
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

43
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:51,734
-Yes.
-Yes.

44
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,360
What the hell was that? Jesus.

45
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:56,071
Wanna try that again?

46
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,491
-Do you wanna find this guy?
-Yes!

47
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,244
-Are we going to find this guy?
-Yes!

48
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:03,746
-Louder, damn it!
-Yes!

49
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:05,873
-Give me a "hell, yeah!"
-Hell, yeah!

50
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,791
-Hell, yeah!
-Hell, yeah!

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,504
<i>Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.</i>

52
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,593
They ain't gonna find him.

53
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,012
<i>Guy is in México by now.</i>

54
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:23,224
Appearances, Gomey.
It's all about appearances.

55
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:27,770
Listen, I gotta take
some personal time.

56
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,688
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

57
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:34,443
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

58
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:37,780
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

59
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:40,950
Damn. You don't think he...?

60
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:44,537
Holler if you need me.

61
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:47,623
All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

62
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:03,866
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so....

63
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:08,204
But that's what he looks like now.

64
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,748
Without the hair.

65
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,668
Hey, it's me.

66
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:18,380
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
sparing us your day off.

67
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:21,008
No worries. Happy to help.

68
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:23,469
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

69
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:26,055
-What about height and weight?
-Five eleven...

70
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:28,390
...most recently, about 170.

71
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:33,020
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.

72
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:36,065
I guess he weighs a little less.

73
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:39,527
That's fine.
That's close enough. Good.

74
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:42,071
What about
other distinguishing features?

75
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,573
Tattoos or moles or scars?

76
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:49,828
-Anything that might help us.
-Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

77
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:51,831
That's fine.

78
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,874
-Is that the list of medications?
-Yes.

79
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,585
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

80
00:06:56,794 --> 00:07:00,506
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

81
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,217
Has he been depressed?

82
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:13,185
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

83
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:15,104
Yeah.

84
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:19,608
Last night, he was agitated.

85
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:20,943
Agitated?

86
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:25,614
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was agitated, upset.

87
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:29,535
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

88
00:07:33,164 --> 00:07:38,294
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said:

89
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:41,046
"I don't know where to begin."

90
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:45,134
Then he just walked out of the room--
Out of the bathroom.

91
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:46,969
I was in the tub, taking a bath.

92
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,222
--and when I came out
about 10 minutes later, he was gone.

93
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:53,017
Nothing else missing?

94
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,230
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

95
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:02,109
But-- What about the phone call?

96
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:05,654
I'm looking into it.

97
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:09,783
-What phone call?
-Walt's cell phone rang.

98
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:14,330
He pulled it out, looked at it,
and didn't answer it.

99
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:18,167
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

100
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,169
I mean...

101
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:22,213
...couldn't that be...

102
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,298
...important, right?

103
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:29,929
Anything else you can think of?

104
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,681
Anything else.

105
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,017
No. I called
the credit card providers...

106
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:40,356
...and there's no report
of any recent activity.

107
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:44,902
I-- Let's see. I checked
with every hospital within 50 miles.

108
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,196
Every police station. Every morgue.

109
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:50,074
So, no, I really don't--
I don't have anything else.

110
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:53,786
I was actually hoping
that you had something else...

111
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:56,497
...being that you're the expert.

112
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:02,336
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:03,879
No worries.

114
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:07,842
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

115
00:09:09,802 --> 00:09:12,555
-Mrs. White.
-Thank you.

116
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:15,182
-Walter.
-Thank you.

117
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,237
So that cell-phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

118
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,364
-And?
-Never happened.

119
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:32,032
No record of it.

120
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,535
-Second cell phone.
-Yeah. I'm thinking.

121
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:16,053
I understand.

122
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:19,849
Out.

123
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:22,017
Get away from me!

124
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:27,189
Settle down, bitch.

125
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:31,694
You gonna shoot me, huh?
Shoot me in here!

126
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:34,196
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

127
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:36,448
That way, you have to clean it up!

128
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:41,829
It's your ride, retard.

129
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:43,956
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now, get out.

130
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:56,177
Get up.

131
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:58,721
Get up.

132
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:09,440
Oh, my God.

133
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:11,734
Don't do this, Tuco.

134
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:38,487
No more posters?

135
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:41,782
Walter Jr.'s making more.

136
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:47,496
Thank you, Marie.

137
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,086
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

138
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:57,840
I mean, he just doesn't strike me
as the type.

139
00:13:58,048 --> 00:13:59,675
He'll turn up.

140
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:12,021
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

141
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:15,774
-...I just find it bewildering that...
-Marie.

142
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:18,861
-...you didn't believe that--
-Marie.

143
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:22,531
Not now.

144
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,459
Empty your pockets.

145
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:28,657
Thought your name was
Heisenberg...

146
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:31,660
..."Walter Hartwell White."

147
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:35,080
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

148
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:39,835
You know, a business name.

149
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:48,469
Yeah.

150
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:56,393
I like doing business
with a family man.

151
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:59,188
There's always a lot of collateral.

152
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,934
Answer me one thing.

153
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,605
Can I trust you?

154
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:46,068
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

155
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:57,830
Sit down.

156
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,465
DEA...

157
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,928
...hit my place of business
this morning.

158
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,347
About a hundred cops
looking for me.

159
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:20,060
-You two haven't been talking, right?
-No.

160
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,687
No.

161
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:26,775
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

162
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:30,029
Everybody except Gonzo.

163
00:18:30,237 --> 00:18:32,281
That's weird, right?

164
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:35,951
I mean, don't you think
that that's weird?

165
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,871
It's weird. Yes.

166
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,456
Unusual.

167
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:43,042
Unusual.

168
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:48,964
Last two days,
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

169
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:53,469
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

170
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,181
Explain to me.

171
00:18:57,681 --> 00:19:02,478
How is it my fault that that little
bitch did not know his place?

172
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,320
I saw this coming.

173
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:15,115
I can see the future, you know?

174
00:19:15,324 --> 00:19:19,995
It's this gift that I have
deep inside my head.

175
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:24,625
I knew last night they were gonna
come try and bust me.

176
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:26,335
Gonzo.

177
00:19:28,712 --> 00:19:33,926
He went and snitched to the cops!
That lousy son of a bitch!

178
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:40,850
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

179
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:44,645
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him,
I'm gonna skin him...

180
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:48,357
...and I'm gonna stuff his hide
for a heavy bag...

181
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:52,695
...and every time I hit him,
it's gonna be like a lesson to myself!

182
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:56,949
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

183
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:09,170
So you plan to ice Gonzo,
like, future tense?

184
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:11,297
What?

185
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:14,633
You're saying, Tuco....

186
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:17,636
You're saying that Gonzo...

187
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:22,141
...is currently operating
as a police informant...

188
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:23,559
...as far as you know?

189
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,231
I'm very sorry to hear that.

190
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:32,276
That's disappointing.

191
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:33,903
Yeah.

192
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:37,072
-I'd waste him too, yo.
-Shut up.

193
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:38,657
Okay.

194
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:41,744
They're out there looking for me
right now.

195
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:44,747
They got ghetto birds
and black ops.

196
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:49,084
I need to get high.
I need to get good and high.

197
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:57,051
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

198
00:20:57,843 --> 00:21:01,305
No, it's-- It's killer.

199
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,057
Yeah, seriously.

200
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:10,606
So I was thinking last night.

201
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:12,441
I came up with this great idea.

202
00:21:16,737 --> 00:21:21,367
-Mexico?
-We'll disappear way out in the jungle.

203
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,327
We'll set you up in a superlab.

204
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:26,038
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

205
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,123
And no Federales
are gonna mess with us...

206
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:30,543
...because I got my people there.

207
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:32,545
Connections.

208
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:36,966
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg, huh?

209
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:39,260
Tuco, I....

210
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,096
I have a wife and family.

211
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,474
So what? You'll get another one.

212
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:49,728
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but I can't just...

213
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:52,314
...uproot my life like that.

214
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:54,483
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.

215
00:21:57,528 --> 00:21:59,238
Who's talking to you?

216
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:05,619
You need me, man...

217
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:08,998
...because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

218
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,335
Yeah.

219
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:15,129
I'll tell you something, yo.

220
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:18,174
You never tried nothing like it.

221
00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:20,509
Stink or no stink...

222
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:25,181
...one bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

223
00:22:27,183 --> 00:22:30,853
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

224
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,397
Careful when you hit it.

225
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:36,442
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

226
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:42,031
It's got a secret ingredient.

227
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:45,826
What secret ingredient?

228
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:48,829
Chilli powder.

229
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:57,463
I hate chilli powder.

230
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,512
This blue magic, this is money.

231
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:08,807
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

232
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:16,232
We're gonna rewrite history
with this.

233
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:24,406
All right. Time to clean the menudo
out from between your ears.

234
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:28,536
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.

235
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,746
I need him very, very badly.

236
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:34,250
He's my partner.

237
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:39,547
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.

238
00:23:41,757 --> 00:23:44,927
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now...

239
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:47,930
...to smuggle us back,
and they're gonna be here by sunset...

240
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:51,600
...and you're gonna be on that truck,
or you're gonna be dead!

241
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:55,145
And you....

242
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,358
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

243
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:18,961
-Where are you going?
-Louis is taking me to the train station.

244
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,921
We'll put these up.

245
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,134
-No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
-He wants to help, let him help.

246
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:28,762
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

247
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:33,058
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

248
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:36,729
For chrissake,
you got a bun in the oven.

249
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,231
I got my cell if you need me.

250
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,525
-Okay?
-Okay.

251
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:46,614
-Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
-All right. Bye.

252
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:54,038
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet...

253
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:56,081
...bodes well.

254
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:01,545
Well, I mean, if he-- You know.

255
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:05,633
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

256
00:25:06,383 --> 00:25:08,427
There's got to be something.

257
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:10,513
Some detail
that we haven't picked up on.

258
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:15,100
-What about the second cell phone?
-Jesus.

259
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:18,938
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

260
00:25:20,397 --> 00:25:22,441
Okay. What are you talking about?

261
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,866
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

262
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:33,369
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

263
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:36,330
No incoming,
no dropped calls, nothing.

264
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,582
But his phone rang. I heard it.

265
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:45,005
All right. Well, then if that's the case,
he must have a second phone.

266
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:49,802
Why? What sense would there be
in that?

267
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,055
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

268
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,811
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

269
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,063
What does it mean?

270
00:26:01,272 --> 00:26:03,399
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

271
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:07,736
It means Walt has a secret.

272
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:11,782
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

273
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:16,912
-Okay. Everyone. Okay.
-Skyler, come on.

274
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:21,041
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

275
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:26,881
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

276
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:29,508
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

277
00:26:30,176 --> 00:26:32,052
Walt? Please.

278
00:26:36,432 --> 00:26:42,062
-What about the marijuana?
-He's not on pot anymore.

279
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:44,273
Says who? Him?

280
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:46,609
Chemotherapy
and marijuana go together...

281
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:50,738
...like apple pie and Chevrolet.

282
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:55,618
Maybe he's addicted to the pot...

283
00:26:55,826 --> 00:26:57,870
...and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

284
00:26:58,078 --> 00:27:01,165
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
like that.

285
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:04,335
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

286
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:09,298
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

287
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:11,091
He may know something.

288
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:20,309
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

289
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:24,313
Then grasp.

290
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:35,825
Excuse me, ma'am.

291
00:27:36,784 --> 00:27:39,912
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

292
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,498
No. I'm afraid not.

293
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:45,626
-Why?
-I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

294
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:50,256
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

295
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:53,676
He taught your son chemistry
in high school.

296
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:57,221
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

297
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:00,057
-That was a long time ago.
-Yes, ma'am.

298
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:03,936
It's my understanding that he
and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

299
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:07,064
-Really?
-Yeah.

300
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,653
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

301
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:15,197
He really tried to motivate him.

302
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:17,783
He was one of the few teachers
who cared.

303
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:19,785
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

304
00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:22,538
I'm so sorry
to hear about his illness.

305
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:24,373
Please pass along our best wishes.

306
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:27,918
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

307
00:28:28,127 --> 00:28:29,336
He's missing, actually.

308
00:28:30,296 --> 00:28:31,797
Just kind of walked off, or....

309
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:35,301
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around...

310
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:38,137
...trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

311
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:40,055
That's terrible.

312
00:28:40,264 --> 00:28:42,558
Anything we can do to help.

313
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:45,728
Well, if you could put me in touch
with your son....

314
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:48,981
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

315
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,235
Jesse's not answering either number,
and no one seems to be at his house.

316
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:57,573
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

317
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:01,744
I don't necessarily. I just--

318
00:29:01,952 --> 00:29:04,163
-Are you with the police?
-No, ma'am. Not at all.

319
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:11,545
I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

320
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:13,297
Oh, my God.

321
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:14,590
Is my son in trouble?

322
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,259
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

323
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:19,970
Do I need to get a lawyer?

324
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,765
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this...

325
00:29:22,973 --> 00:29:25,392
...coming here and asking questions
about my son and--

326
00:29:25,601 --> 00:29:28,020
Mrs. Pinkman,
I'm not here on official capacity.

327
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:31,899
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

328
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:33,859
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.

329
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:39,114
His wife is worried sick,
and she's got a baby on the way.

330
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm sorry. I would like to help you...

331
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:45,871
...but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

332
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,458
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

333
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:54,380
Well, thanks for your time.

334
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:00,636
If you could tell me one more thing.

335
00:30:00,845 --> 00:30:05,224
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

336
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,855
If he had spent half as much time
and money on his education...

337
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:15,276
...as he has
on that ridiculous bouncing car....

338
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:18,654
Low rider, huh?

339
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,448
Gomey, hey.

340
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:24,493
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out...

341
00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:26,787
...a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo...

342
00:30:26,996 --> 00:30:31,417
...registered to a one
Jesse Pinkman.

343
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:34,753
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

344
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:38,507
It's one of those jack-off low riders,
so I'm betting there is.

345
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:42,052
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

346
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:10,998
Chilli powder.

347
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:15,044
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

348
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:16,587
Whatever, man.

349
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:18,547
At least I tried something.

350
00:31:18,756 --> 00:31:20,674
Hey, it almost worked too.

351
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:23,969
How's about
you leaving my gun, huh?

352
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:27,014
First you boost it,
then you leave it in your house.

353
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:28,891
My gun.

354
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:35,731
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

355
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,109
Well, at least he wants you alive.

356
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:14,937
Hey, I don't get it.

357
00:32:15,145 --> 00:32:18,148
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

358
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:20,067
I don't know.

359
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:22,611
I don't know.

360
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:25,906
Does it really matter?

361
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:30,077
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant...

362
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:32,371
...who does he
automatically blame?

363
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,415
Us.

364
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:38,794
We need a plan.

365
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:44,300
-Think, think.
-Let's just bum-rush him, man.

366
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:46,760
You crack him over
the head with something...

367
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:49,013
...and I'll go for his gun.

368
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:56,604
Crack him over the head
with something?

369
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:02,484
Hey, you got the C-bomb, man,
all right?

370
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:04,361
You're as good
as checked out already.

371
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,657
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

372
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:10,284
Just....

373
00:33:12,703 --> 00:33:15,414
Oh, so my life
is not the priority here...

374
00:33:15,623 --> 00:33:18,167
...because I'm gonna be
dead soon anyway.

375
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,169
That's your point?

376
00:33:20,836 --> 00:33:22,379
Yeah.

377
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:53,077
We gotta get him to take this.

378
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:55,663
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chilli P.

379
00:33:55,871 --> 00:33:57,706
That much has been established.

380
00:33:57,915 --> 00:34:00,876
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump....

381
00:34:06,257 --> 00:34:09,844
Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.

382
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:30,656
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

383
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:34,118
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

384
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:15,451
<i>Take it easy, Tio.</i>

385
00:35:15,993 --> 00:35:19,955
I will feed you.
I eat first. That's the deal.

386
00:35:27,963 --> 00:35:29,632
What?

387
00:35:37,389 --> 00:35:39,308
I get it, I get it, I get it.

388
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:43,729
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

389
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:46,148
I tell you, Heisenberg.

390
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:49,318
Old people.

391
00:35:50,486 --> 00:35:52,154
You feed them, huh?

392
00:35:52,363 --> 00:35:54,990
You put them in a really nice crib
in the country...

393
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,577
...and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

394
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:02,039
You better eat every bite of that.

395
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:28,023
What did you do that for?

396
00:36:28,232 --> 00:36:30,150
God!

397
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:16,739
Hey, look. Look.

398
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:18,574
There's nothing left.

399
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:48,646
What? What do you want?

400
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,320
No.

401
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:59,782
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

402
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,242
Don't go there.

403
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:16,549
<i>Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?</i>

404
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:21,470
What, you don't like them?

405
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:24,807
One ding.

406
00:38:25,015 --> 00:38:28,394
<i>That means yes. Tio don't like you.</i>

407
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,484
<i>Why don't you like them, Tio?</i>

408
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:40,823
You don't trust them?

409
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,835
<i>-Why don't you trust them, Tio?
-Tuco, come on. He's....</i>

410
00:38:53,335 --> 00:38:57,006
There clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

411
00:39:10,394 --> 00:39:12,188
<i>Did they do something to you, Tio?</i>

412
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:17,651
Something that you don't like?

413
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:28,704
<i>What did they do to you?
What did you do to my tio?</i>

414
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:30,206
Nothing. Nothing.

415
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:35,211
<i>-Bullshit! My tio does not lie!
-I don't know. I swear. I don't know.</i>

416
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:40,216
No, I-- Maybe it was-- I did change
the channel on his TV, but....

417
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:42,676
Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking...

418
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:46,388
...he was watching
one of those telenovels...

419
00:39:46,597 --> 00:39:49,225
...with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

420
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:51,101
I told you
not to change the channel.

421
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,313
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's it.

422
00:40:01,821 --> 00:40:03,948
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>

423
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:06,575
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>

424
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:09,703
Did they change your mamitas?

425
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:21,006
<i>What are you telling me, Tio?</i>

426
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:25,094
Are they punking me?

427
00:40:40,442 --> 00:40:42,903
Hey. No.

428
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:46,532
No, man. No.

429
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,200
-Come here!
-No.

430
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:51,954
No, no, Tuco.

431
00:40:58,794 --> 00:41:01,797
Tuco, no. Tuco.

432
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:07,970
Shut up!

433
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:23,944
No. Please, no. God. Please, no.

434
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:26,655
No, God. I don't wanna die.

435
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:28,824
Tell me what you did, Walter!

436
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:32,328
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

437
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:36,290
-No!
-Tell me what you did!

438
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:44,381
We tried to poison you.

439
00:41:45,966 --> 00:41:48,093
We tried to poison you...

440
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:54,016
...because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth...

441
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:56,185
...and you deserve to die.

442
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:41,021
Who's the bitch now?

443
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,502
Let him bleed.

444
00:43:22,438 --> 00:43:24,106
The keys.

445
00:43:25,107 --> 00:43:26,692
Tuco.

446
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:29,153
Oh, my God.

447
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,615
The cousins?

448
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:30,840
What the hell is going on?

449
00:44:42,643 --> 00:44:44,520
Jesse Pinkman.

450
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:47,481
You're a hard man to find.

451
00:44:55,573 --> 00:44:57,908
Oh, shit.

452
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:10,880
Easy.

453
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:29,875
Oh, my God.

454
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:35,005
Oh, God. Hank.

455
00:46:35,214 --> 00:46:36,632
-Who?
-Hank.

456
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:38,217
What?

457
00:46:38,425 --> 00:46:40,135
-Oh, my God.
-What?

458
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:43,514
-Oh, my God.
-Stay. What are you doing?
