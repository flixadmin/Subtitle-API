1
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,703
Out! All of you!

2
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,458
Bastard's been meddling
where he shouldn't.

3
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:10,797
I want you and your men gone.

4
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:14,634
And you'll make this right.

5
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,430
Wait outside.

6
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,099
-Lord Commander…
-Now.

7
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,913
-Lord Commander…
-Leave us.

8
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,294
-What did you do?
-I followed him.

9
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,256
He took the baby into the woods,
the newborn…

10
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,092
-What business is that of yours?
-No, you don't understand.

11
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,344
He's killing them, all the boys. He…

12
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,685
You know.

13
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,902
The wildlings serve crueler Gods
then you or I.

14
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,073
Those boys are Craster's offerings.

15
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,785
Offerings? He's murdering
his own children! He's a monster…

16
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,581
Aye, many a time that monster's been
the difference between life and death

17
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,250
for our rangers, your uncle among them.

18
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,046
We have other wars to fight out there.

19
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,926
Like it or not, we need men like Craster.

20
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,225
I saw it…

21
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,647
I saw…

22
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,651
something take that child.

23
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,116
Whatever it was…
I dare say you'll see it again.

24
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,957
Now ready my horse. We leave at dawn.

25
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,381
Don't lose it again.

26
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,407
Gilly!

27
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,203
You're leaving.

28
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,624
I wanted to give you something.

29
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,921
It belonged to my mother.

30
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,511
-I can't take it.
-Please! I want you to.

31
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,891
My mother used it for sewing.

32
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,354
She'd let me sit with her
in her chamber while she sewed and…

33
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,648
I'd read to her.

34
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,570
My father put a stop
to it when he found out.

35
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,449
It's the only thing I have of hers.

36
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,369
She gave it to me
before I left for the Wall.

37
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,915
You shouldn't give it away.

38
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,584
I'm not giving it away.

39
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,879
I'm giving it to you.

40
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,841
Keep it safe for me.

41
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,552
Till I come back.

42
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,322
Hodor.

43
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:09,410
Hodor, rouse Bran, will you?
It's time for his lessons.

44
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,694
Every night it's the same.

45
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm walking. I'm running. But…

46
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,664
I'm not… I'm not me.

47
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,460
I'm running through the Godswood,
sniffing the dirt.

48
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,880
Tasting blood in my mouth
when I've made a fresh kill.

49
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:05,925
Howling.

50
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,056
Old Nan used to tell me stories
about magical people

51
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,811
who could live inside stags,
birds, wolves…

52
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,023
And that's exactly
what they are, Bran, stories.

53
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,153
-So she was lying? They don't exist?
-Well, they may have done.

54
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,824
But they're gone from the world,
along with much else.

55
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:36,038
These are dreams, Bran. Nothing more.

56
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,917
No. My dreams are different.
Mine are true.

57
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:45,631
I dreamt of my father dying.
And Rickon had the same dream.

58
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,885
What about all the dreams you've had
that didn't come true?

59
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,522
This link is made of Valyrian steel.

60
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,401
Only one maester
in a hundred wears it on his chain.

61
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,697
It signifies that I have studied
the higher mysteries.

62
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,535
And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.

63
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,955
I was no different. I was young.

64
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,752
And what boy doesn't secretly wish
for hidden powers

65
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,297
to lift him out of his dull life
into a special one?

66
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,884
But in the end for all my efforts,

67
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,304
I got no more out of it
than a thousand boys before me.

68
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,265
Come on.

69
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,364
Maybe magic once was
a mighty force in the world…

70
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,742
but not anymore.

71
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,539
The dragons are gone,
the giants are dead…

72
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,753
the Children of the Forest forgotten.

73
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,556
Loras! Highgarden!

74
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,572
Yield. I yield!

75
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,958
Well fought! Approach.

76
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,762
Rise. Remove your helm.

77
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,856
You are all your father promised
and more, my lady.

78
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,859
I've seen Ser Loras bested
once or twice, but…

79
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,278
never quite in that fashion.

80
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,490
Now, now, my love.
My brother fought valiantly for you.

81
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,287
That he did, my queen,
but there can be only one champion.

82
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,501
Brienne of Tarth. You may ask
anything of me you desire.

83
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,212
If it's within my power, it is yours.

84
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:18,427
Your Grace… I ask the honor
of a place in your Kingsguard.

85
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,641
I would be one of your seven,
pledge my life to yours,

86
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,559
and keep you safe from all harm.

87
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,193
Done! Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.

88
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,956
Your Grace, I have the honor
to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,

89
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,583
sent as an envoy by her son,
Robb, Lord of Winterfell.

90
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,087
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.

91
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,257
Lady Catelyn, I'm pleased to see you.

92
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,344
May I present my wife,
Margaery of House Tyrell?

93
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,014
You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.

94
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,058
I am so sorry for your loss.

95
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,811
You are most kind.

96
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:14,483
My lady, I swear to you
I will see the Lannisters answer

97
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,609
for your husband's murder.

98
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:21,031
When I take King's Landing,
I will bring you Joffrey's head!

99
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,294
It will be enough to know
that justice was done, my lord.

100
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,798
Your Grace. And you should kneel
when you approach the King.

101
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,177
There's no need for that.
Lady Stark is an honored guest.

102
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,721
Has your son marched
against Tywin Lannister yet?

103
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,558
I do not sit on my son's war counsels.

104
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:52,062
And if I did, I would not share
his strategies with you.

105
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,774
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself.

106
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,859
Not hide behind his mother's skirts.

107
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:01,739
My son is fighting a war.
Not playing at one.

108
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,589
Don't worry, my lady.
Our war is just beginning.

109
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,896
Your Grace.

110
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,941
-Gerard, how's your foot?
-Better, Your Grace.

111
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,569
-They don't know their own size, is all.
-Good man.

112
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,407
I have a hundred thousand men
at my command.

113
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,993
All the might
of the Stormlands and the Reach.

114
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,080
And all of them young and bold,
like your Knight of Flowers?

115
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,500
It's a game to you, isn't it?

116
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,794
I pity them.

117
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,796
-Why?
-Because it won't last.

118
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,675
Because they are the knights
of summer. And winter is coming.

119
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,597
Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.

120
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,850
-She's tired from her journey.
-At once, Your Grace.

121
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,645
-Shall I return after?
-That won't be necessary.

122
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,690
I would pray awhile. Alone.

123
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,360
If you'll follow me, my lady.

124
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,824
You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

125
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,829
I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight
for him on the battlefield.

126
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,831
Die for him if I must.

127
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,627
And, if it please you,
Brienne's enough.

128
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,005
I'm no lady.

129
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,081
-What are you doing here?
-I live here.

130
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,878
-Are you angry with me, brother?
-You lying bitch!

131
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,255
It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

132
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,759
Recognize you? How could I?

133
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,594
The last time I saw you…

134
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,890
You looked like a fat little boy!

135
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:38,395
You were a fat little boy, too.
But I recognized you.

136
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,439
Why didn't you tell me?

137
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,026
I wanted to see who you were first.
And I did.

138
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,823
The plans are made.
It's time you heard them.

139
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,200
-Father.
-Father.

140
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,332
The wolf pup has gone south,
with the entirety of the northern army

141
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,336
at his back. While he's tangling
with the lion in the Westerlands,

142
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,963
the North is ripe for the taking.

143
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,926
The Ironborn will reave and pillage
as it was in the old days,

144
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,469
all along the northern coast.

145
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,181
We will spread our dominion
across the green lands,

146
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,517
securing the Neck and everything above.

147
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,269
Every stronghold will yield to us
one by one.

148
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,314
Winterfell may defy us for a year,
but what of it?

149
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:27,403
The rest shall be ours.
Forest, field and hall.

150
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,450
Yara, my daughter.

151
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,537
You'll take thirty longships
to attack Deepwood Motte.

152
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,416
-I've always wanted a castle.
-What's my role in all this?

153
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,630
You'll take a ship to raid the fishing
villages on the Stony Shore

154
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,801
A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?

155
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,012
The Sea Bitch.
We thought she'd be perfect for you.

156
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,309
-I'm to fight fishermen?
-Be careful of their nets.

157
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,526
Father. I've fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

158
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,778
They won't give up the North so easily--

159
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,197
-They won't even know we're there--
-What do you know of it, woman?

160
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,826
-I'm a proven warrior--
-Your brothers were warriors.

161
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:20,622
Both of them dead at the hands
of those you seem so eager to protect.

162
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,920
I'm not protecting anyone.
I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait?

163
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,590
Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?

164
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,093
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

165
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,806
But if we pledge fealty to them,
they'll give us Casterly Rock.

166
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,974
What are our words?

167
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,561
Our words.

168
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,610
-We do not sow.
-We do not sow. We are Ironborn.

169
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,446
We're not subjects. We're not slaves.

170
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,741
We do not plow the field
or toil in the mine.

171
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,576
We take what is ours.

172
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,914
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

173
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,420
You act as if I volunteered to go!

174
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,882
You gave me away, if you remember,

175
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,259
the day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

176
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,222
After he crushed you.
Did you take what was yours then?

177
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:28,982
You gave me away. Your boy. Your last boy.

178
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,237
You gave me away like
I was some dog you didn't want anymore.

179
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,573
And now you curse me
because I've come home?

180
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,045
You'd have our father bow down
to your other family.

181
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,799
-I have no other family.
-Don't you?

182
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,470
Make your choice, Theon.
And do it quickly.

183
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,848
Our ships sail with or without you.

184
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,696
You won't let me leave this room,
you won't let me--

185
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,489
Keep your voice down.

186
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,453
Why? You think your father can hear me?

187
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,832
He's three hundred miles away!

188
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,587
I don't intend for you to stay here.

189
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,756
I might be able to bring you
into the castle kitchens.

190
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,634
Again, only temporary.

191
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,098
Every man who's tasted my cooking
has told me what a good whore I am.

192
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,100
You wouldn't be a cook.

193
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,686
You'd pose as a scullion.

194
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,024
A scullion? What is a scullion?

195
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,484
Kitchen wench.

196
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,946
-A kitchen wench.
-Yes, but…

197
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,658
Cleaning pots? Is that how
my lion wants to see me?

198
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,622
Your lion wants to see you alive.
We've come to a dangerous place.

199
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,959
My sister wants to hurt me.
She'll look for any weakness she can find.

200
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,878
She can't know about you.

201
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,882
-I am the weakness?
-It's a compliment, my lady.

202
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,509
How is being a weakness a compliment?

203
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,682
The language can be a bit tricky here.

204
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,854
I am too stupid to understand?
The stupid foreign girl?

205
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,693
I am not a kitchen wench.

206
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,679
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

207
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,723
Soon, darling. When the war is over.

208
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,851
Mother says I'll have a new gown
for the ceremony

209
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,061
and another for the feast.

210
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,856
But yours will be ivory,
since you're the bride.

211
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,323
-The princess just spoke to you.
-Pardon, Your Grace.

212
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,662
I'm sure your dress
will be beautiful, Myrcella.

213
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,832
I'm counting the days
until the fighting's done

214
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,876
and I can pledge my love
to the King in sight of the Gods.

215
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,342
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

216
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,346
He might.

217
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,559
Would you like that?

218
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,147
No. I don't think so.

219
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,110
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.

220
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,238
Won't you, little dove?

221
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,884
Come in.

222
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,224
-Who are you?
-I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden.

223
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,853
I didn't know I needed
a new handmaiden.

224
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,232
-You're not from here.
-No.

225
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,201
-What are you doing?
-Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

226
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,578
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.

227
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:55,248
-You should just do them.
-What things?

228
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,252
Change my linens,
wash my clothing, scrub the floor,

229
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,379
empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

230
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,807
No!

231
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,725
-You said to brush your--
-Not now.

232
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,605
Your chamber pot is empty.

233
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,149
Clean the table.

234
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,449
Have you ever been
a handmaiden before?

235
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,451
-Yes.
-For whom?

236
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,662
-Lady Zuriff.
-Lady Zuriff?

237
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,418
-Lady Zuriff.
-There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

238
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,963
She wasn't in this city.

239
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,883
Well I don't know how they did things
in that city, but in this city,

240
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,137
handmaidens wait on ladies,
not the other way around.

241
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,848
And I don't have the time
to answer a thousand questions

242
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,058
and teach you how to do your job.

243
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,272
Do you want me to leave?

244
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,614
Just brush my hair.

245
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,759
Thank the Gods.
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

246
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,888
I've encountered
this problem before, my lord.

247
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:37,976
The stresses of power
often have this insalubrious effect.

248
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,521
Two drops with water, daily.

249
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,649
I'm so grateful to have a man
of your vast knowledge and wisdom

250
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,943
on my side. Please.

251
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,820
Why thank you, my lord.

252
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,621
-I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?
-Why, yes, of course, my lord!

253
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,708
These are perilous times,
and the crown must forge new alliances.

254
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,671
And these alliances must often
be sealed in matrimony.

255
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,634
Matrimony? Yes…

256
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,722
I'm trusting the council with these plans,
but the Queen mustn't know.

257
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,892
I can't have her meddling
in affairs that could determine

258
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,894
the future of the realm.
There's too much at stake.

259
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:26,608
Oh yes. Yes, yes, indeed. Yes,
I shall be silent as the grave.

260
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,195
I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

261
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,115
Princess Myrcella
will marry their youngest son

262
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,743
when she comes of age,
insuring their loyalty

263
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,662
and their army, should we need it.

264
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,166
Myrcella… sent away to Dorne?

265
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,129
But remember, the Queen mustn't know.

266
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,133
"The Queen mustn't know."

267
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,345
I love conversations that begin this way.

268
00:25:56,554 --> 00:26:00,308
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off.
To Theon Greyjoy.

269
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,645
Theon Greyjoy?

270
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:10,110
Forgive me, my lord, but how?
He grew up a ward of Winterfell.

271
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,487
-He fights for Robb Stark.
-Precisely.

272
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,073
Theon's father loathes the Starks,

273
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,867
and will convince the boy
to come to our side.

274
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,621
Greyjoy can destroy
the Northern army from within,

275
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,415
and we can have his father's ships.

276
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,127
But remember, you must tell no one.

277
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,046
Tell no one… what?

278
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,925
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella
to Robin Arryn of the Vale.

279
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,972
Lysa is not fond of me.

280
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:42,183
But perhaps the promise
of a royal match will convince her

281
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,561
to let bygones be bygones.

282
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,565
She imprisoned you,
she tried to execute you,

283
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,109
and you offer her son a princess.

284
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:56,531
For men in our position, holding
grudges can be an encumbrance,

285
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:57,991
don't you think?

286
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,661
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

287
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:02,912
Who better?

288
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,588
Yes, I could sing
this song to Lysa, if I cared to.

289
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,299
What's in it for me?

290
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,138
The gratitude of the people of Westeros
for helping to end this war.

291
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,933
The adoration of the King
for bringing the Vale back into the fold.

292
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,939
-And Harrenhal.
-Harrenhal is cursed.

293
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,525
I never took you for a superstitious man.

294
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,695
By all means tear it down
and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it.

295
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,365
Plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

296
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:44,412
With a single stroke you'd make me
one of the greatest lords in the realm.

297
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,415
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

298
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,460
So did Janos Slynt.
And he was given Harrenhal too.

299
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,295
Until you snatched it away.

300
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,759
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.
I didn't need Janos Slynt.

301
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,055
It's settled, then?

302
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:05,850
Good.

303
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,023
-And remember…
-The Queen mustn't know.

304
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:52,647
That must hurt.

305
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:04,701
What?

306
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,121
What is it?

307
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,916
A member of the Kingsguard?

308
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,129
As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

309
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:22,260
Brienne is a very capable warrior.

310
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,138
And she's devoted to me.

311
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,184
You're jealous.

312
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,147
Jealous? Of "Brienne the Beauty"?

313
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,357
Don't make me laugh…

314
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,736
I'll make it up to you.

315
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:44,073
No, Your Grace. Not tonight.

316
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,827
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

317
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,623
You didn't win my father's support
or his army on charm alone.

318
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,306
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

319
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,101
Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks
after their wedding night.

320
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,813
-And Margaery's a virgin?
-Officially.

321
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,400
Shall I bring her to you?

322
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,056
I should warn you,
I've had quite a bit of wine.

323
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,183
As is your right. You are a king.

324
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:59,065
-You look very beautiful.
-Thank you, Your Grace.

325
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,527
-That's a lovely gown.
-You think so?

326
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,614
I can't decide how I like it better.
This way…

327
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,660
or this way.

328
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,751
You certainly don't need it.

329
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:27,385
Although, some say that beauty
most desired is the beauty conceal--

330
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,697
-It must be the wine, I…
-Here. Let me.

331
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,594
I'm sorry. I…

332
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,014
Do you want my brother
to come in and help?

333
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,394
-What?
-Well, he could get you started.

334
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,854
I know he wouldn't mind.

335
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:22,106
Or I can turn over
and you can pretend I'm him.

336
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,277
I don't know what you're talking about.

337
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,619
There's no need for us to play games.

338
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,247
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

339
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,018
Your enemies aren't happy about us.

340
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,898
They want to tear us apart.
And the best way to stop them…

341
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,818
is to put your baby…

342
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:09,904
in my belly.

343
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,326
We can try again later.

344
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,454
You decide how you want to do it,

345
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,374
with me, with me and Loras,
however else you like…

346
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,046
Whatever you need to do.

347
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,218
You are a king.

348
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,687
You monster.

349
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,107
Myrcella is my only daughter.

350
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,901
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

351
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,988
Myrcella's a princess.
Some would say she was born for this.

352
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,700
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne
as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon!

353
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,869
Dorne is the safest place for her.

354
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:03,708
-Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
-That's why we need to seduce them.

355
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,295
We're going to need their support
in the war your son started.

356
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,547
-She'll be a hostage.
-A guest.

357
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:12,258
You won't get away with this.

358
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,262
You think the piece of paper
father gave you keeps you safe?

359
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,392
Ned Stark had a piece of paper too.

360
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,022
-It's done, Cersei.
-No.

361
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,776
-You cannot stop it.
-No!

362
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,282
Just how safe do you think
Myrcella is if the city falls?

363
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,203
Do you want to see her raped?
Butchered like the Targaryen children?

364
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,248
Make no mistake, they'll mount
her pretty little head on a spike

365
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,043
-right beside yours.
-Get out! Get out.

366
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,357
Theon, of the House Greyjoy,

367
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,236
you would this day,
consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?

368
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,080
-I would.
-Kneel.

369
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,713
Let Theon, your servant,
be born again from the sea, as you were.

370
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,090
Bless him with salt.

371
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,887
Bless him with stone.

372
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,764
Bless him with steel.

373
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,024
-What is dead may never die.
-What is dead may never die.

374
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,321
But rises again, harder and stronger.

375
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,489
Stand.

376
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,688
I don't appreciate being made
a fool of, dwarf.

377
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,733
If Myrcella marries the Martell boy,

378
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,944
she can't very well
marry Robin Arryn, can she?

379
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:21,197
No, I'm afraid not. Sorry about that.

380
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,118
And Harrenhal? I suppose
that's off the table as well?

381
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:31,832
-Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that too.
-Leave me out of your next deception.

382
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,001
That's a shame.

383
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,754
You were to be the centerpiece
of my next deception.

384
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,132
My brother Jaime rots
in a northern stockade.

385
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,470
I would see him released.
That's where you come in.

386
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,098
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

387
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,934
No, he won't. But his mother might.

388
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,646
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

389
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,820
-Find him?
-Aye. And he has company.

390
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,616
Filthy old stoat…
almost hate to interrupt.

391
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,661
-No, you don't.
-No, I don't.

392
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,503
What is the meaning of this?

393
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:22,842
-No! Please…
-You disappoint me, Grand Maester.

394
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,719
I am your loyal servant…

395
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,014
So loyal that you told
the queen about my plan

396
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,306
to send Myrcella to Dorne.

397
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,895
No! Never! No, it's a falsehood,
I swear it, it wasn't me.

398
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,234
Varys. It was Varys, the Spider--

399
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:44,238
See, I told Varys I was giving
the princess to the Greyjoys.

400
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,659
I told Littlefinger that I planned
to wed her to Robin Arryn.

401
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:54,165
I told no one that I was offering
her to the Dornish. No one but you.

402
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,501
The eunuch has spies everywhere…

403
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,754
Cut off his manhood,
and feed it to the goats.

404
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,465
-No, no!
-There are no goats, halfman.

405
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,716
Well, make do.

406
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,679
How long have you been
spying for my sister?

407
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,767
All I did,
I did for House Lannister. Always.

408
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,062
Your lord father, ask him!
I have always been his servant…

409
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,688
since the days of the Mad King…

410
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,900
I don't like his beard.

411
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,071
What? What? No! No! No…

412
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:32,578
How many Hands have you betrayed,
Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?

413
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:36,665
No, Lord Arryn… he knew.
He knew the truth…

414
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:41,420
about the queen and… he planned to act.

415
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,631
To tell King Robert…

416
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,218
-So you poisoned him?
-No. Never!

417
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,845
But you let him die?
Made sure he succumbed?

418
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,848
Lannister… I always served Lannister…

419
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,267
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.

420
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,644
No! No, no…

421
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,021
No, please, don't!
You can't do this to me!

422
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,941
For your trouble.

423
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,093
You'll be pleased
to know our mutual friend

424
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,221
is doing quite well
in Lady Sansa's service.

425
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,474
Good. One of my better ideas.

426
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:40,271
And it seems the Grand Maester
has found his way into a black cell?

427
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,650
Well played, my Lord Hand.

428
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,070
But should I be worried?

429
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:53,701
Janos Slynt, Pycelle… the small
council grows smaller every day.

430
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,704
The council has a reputation
for serving past Hands poorly.

431
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,582
I don't mean to follow
Ned Stark to the grave.

432
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,669
Power is a curious thing, my lord.

433
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,465
-Are you fond of riddles?
-Why? Am I about to hear one?

434
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:13,429
Three great men sit in a room,
a king, a priest, and a rich man.

435
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,515
Between them stands a common sellsword.

436
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,352
Each great man bids
the sellsword kill the other two.

437
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,608
-Who lives and who dies?
-Depends on the sellsword.

438
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:30,237
Does it? He has neither crown nor gold,
nor favor with the Gods.

439
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,531
He has a sword.
The power of life and death.

440
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,743
But if it's swordsmen who rule,
why do we pretend

441
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,161
kings hold all the power?

442
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:41,457
When Ned Stark lost his head,
who was truly responsible?

443
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,045
Joffrey? The executioner?
Or something else?

444
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,172
I've decided I don't like riddles.

445
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:55,304
Power resides where men
believe it resides.

446
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,767
It's a trick. A shadow on the wall.

447
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:07,191
And… a very small man can cast
a very large shadow.

448
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:48,691
You should be sleeping.

449
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:55,572
Tomorrow's a long march.
Thirty miles if it don't piss on us.

450
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,701
I can't sleep.

451
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,873
I don't like the taste.

452
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,300
You don't drink it for the flavor,
to be honest.

453
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:23,892
What?

454
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:29,106
-How do you sleep?
-Same as most men, I think.

455
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,862
But… you've seen things, horrible things.

456
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,489
Aye.

457
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:43,245
I've seen pretty things too,
but not nearly so many.

458
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,874
How do you sleep when you…

459
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:53,339
when you have those… things in your head?

460
00:43:56,008 --> 00:44:02,181
-You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
-I close my eyes and I see them up there.

461
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,061
All of them standing there.

462
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,397
Joffrey…

463
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,651
the Queen… and…

464
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,280
and my sister.

465
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:32,586
You know, we got something in common,
me and you, you know that?

466
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,634
I must have been…
a couple years older than you.

467
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:44,973
I saw my brother stabbed through
the heart, right on our doorstep.

468
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,352
He weren't much of a villain
what skewered him.

469
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,355
Willem, the lad's name was.

470
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,776
He ran off before anyone could spit.

471
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,779
And I just stood there…

472
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,157
watching my brother die.

473
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,869
But here's the funny part.

474
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,998
I can't picture my brother's face anymore.

475
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,962
But Willem…
He was a nice looking boy.

476
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:21,051
He had good white teeth, blue eyes,

477
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,431
one of those dimpled chins
all the girls like.

478
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,310
I would think about him
when I was working,

479
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,897
when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.

480
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:39,570
It got to the point where
I would say his name every night

481
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:44,032
before I went to bed.
"Willem. Willem. Willem."

482
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,369
A prayer almost.

483
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,123
And one day…

484
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,295
Willem came riding back into town.

485
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:04,136
I buried an axe so deep
into Willem's skull

486
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,971
they had to bury him with it.

487
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:13,145
Willem's horse got me to the Wall,
and I been wearing black ever since.

488
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,570
Well, that'll help you sleep, eh?

489
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:35,250
Get up, you lazy sons of whores!
Arm yourselves!

490
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,836
Get up.

491
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,422
You keep out of sight. Both of you.

492
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,091
-No! I'm not afraid.
-Keep out of sight.

493
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,262
If things go wrong, you run.
Do you hear me?

494
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:50,724
You run along North and don't look back.

495
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,604
There's men out there who want
to fuck your corpses!

496
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,856
Outside! Now!

497
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,342
Where's the bastard, crow?

498
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,095
Got more than
a few bastards here. Who's asking?

499
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,431
Ser Amory Lorch.
Sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.

500
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,726
These men from the capital
requested our assistance.

501
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,396
Drop your weapons in the name of the King.

502
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:41,275
-Which king would that be?
-This is your last chance.

503
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,946
In the name of King Joffrey,
drop your weapons.

504
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,953
-I don't think I will.
-So be it.

505
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,752
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load!

506
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,125
Boy! Come here, boy!

507
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,294
Sweet boy! Help us!

508
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,420
Come here!

509
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,005
Help us, boy!

510
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,595
My men can fight! Free us!

511
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,312
Quick, give it to me.

512
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,336
What do we have here?

513
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,339
No!

514
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,008
That's a fine little blade.

515
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,514
-Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
-I yield! I yield!

516
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:39,935
Round up any survivors.
We'll take them back to Harrenhal.

517
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,229
You heard him! You're coming with us.

518
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,773
I yield!

519
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,906
Help. Help me…

520
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,455
-Something wrong with your leg, boy?
-Look at it!

521
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,843
-Can you walk?
-No. You got to carry me.

522
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:15,679
All right.

523
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,486
Carry him, he says.

524
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,498
We're looking for a bastard named Gendry!

525
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,462
Give him up.
Or I'll start taking eyeballs.

526
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:02,976
You want Gendry?

527
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,023
You already got him.

528
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,237
He loved that helmet.
