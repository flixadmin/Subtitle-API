ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE IN KOREA

2
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,849
Hello.

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:19,102
This is Orangibberish,
who gets to the truth behind rumors.

4
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,605
Today, I'll be uncovering the truth
behind the Hyosan zombie rumor.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,233
I'm on my way to see
if it really turned into Zombieland

6
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,194
as they say online and on social media.

7
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,030
-FINALLY
-HE'S REALLY GOING

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,198
Damn. It's insane here already.

9
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,283
Look.

10
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,578
-WHAT'S WITH THE TRAFFIC?
-WHY ARE YOU GOING TO HYOSAN, SON?

11
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,791
Do you see this?

12
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,626
It's bumper to bumper

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,754
with cars trying to get into Hyosan.

14
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,005
There are so many cars.

15
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,966
Hold on.
I'll have to get out and hike my way in.

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,470
I came up the mountain
to avoid the roadblock.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,472
See that down there?

18
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,891
That there is Hyosan.

19
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:02,437
Okay. Let me show you the equipment

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,105
that I've brought.

21
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,566
First. A helmet.

22
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,569
A hockey mask. Knee and elbow pads.

23
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,029
These are shin guards.

24
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,448
This is emergency food.

25
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,992
First aid kit. And water.

26
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,286
And most important of all, an axe.

27
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,789
If something grabs me,
I'll chop their necks, and…

28
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,831
I'm all set.

29
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,667
Please subscribe and like, okay?

30
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,920
-MY MOM TOLD ME TO STAY HOME
-LOOK AT YOU ALL GEARED UP

31
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:27,962
Hold on.

32
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,547
-RUN FASTER!
-IS THAT REALLY A ZOMBIE?

33
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,632
I'm fucked.

34
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,426
Damn it. These crazy assholes.

35
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,470
-RUN, BROTHER!
-DAMN

36
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,473
-IT SHOULD BE OVER SOON
-THIS FOOTAGE WILL HELP US

37
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,268
-LOOK AT THAT ACTING
-THIS IS FUN

38
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,187
Are they gone? You saw that, right?

39
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,647
-TAKE OUT YOUR AXE!
-WATCH OUT BEHIND YOU

40
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,817
Fuck. These bastards are so fast.

41
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,777
-SHOW US THE STREET
-COME BACK

42
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,243
-I DON'T THINK I CAN SLEEP TONIGHT
-GOODBYE

43
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,538
You saw that, right? Fuck.
Tell me you saw it, assholes.

44
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,999
-SO DAMN SCARY
-JUST RUN AWAY

45
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,960
-IT'S SCARY
-WHERE ARE THE REAL ZOMBIES?

46
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,005
-ZOMBIELAND! AWESOME!
-IS THAT A REAL ZOMBIE?

47
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,966
-YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN A GUN
-ZOMBIE!

48
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,359
Are you okay?

49
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,030
Your hand.

50
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,120
You're not okay.

51
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,547
Gyeong-su?

52
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,216
Gyeong-su. It's you, isn't it?

53
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,675
It's me.

54
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,928
Cheong-san's mom.

55
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,056
Gyeong-su. Where's Cheong-san?

56
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,559
I'm sorry to say this…

57
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,940
but be strong.

58
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,775
Don't comfort me.

59
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,195
You're not good at it.

60
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,323
No, I am.

61
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,662
Still, don't.

62
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,668
I didn't know…

63
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,131
I-sak was such a precious friend.

64
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,345
Thinking that she's gone

65
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,099
made me feel
like I had lost my whole world.

66
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,105
Gyeong-su…

67
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,110
must be out there somewhere.

68
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,653
Yes.

69
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,827
Gyeong-su!

70
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,622
Gyeong-su. I'm Cheong-san's mom.

71
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,340
Gyeong-su.

72
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,931
Cheong-san…

73
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,954
I wonder if things are okay outside.

74
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,875
Your dad's a firefighter,
so I'm sure he's fine.

75
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,754
My mom and dad
should be at the restaurant.

76
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,008
That's the most important thing
for my mom.

77
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,803
She might be serving chicken
to zombies right now.

78
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,933
I wish I could have her chicken right now.

79
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,104
-You said it was salty.
-But it still tasted good.

80
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,401
Let's have some

81
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,614
once this is all over
and we get out of here.

82
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,035
I didn't hear anything.

83
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,456
I couldn't hear anything.

84
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,584
-Like what?
-After Na-yeon went out…

85
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,049
and Ms. Park went out after her.

86
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,053
Ms. Park!

87
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,264
I didn't hear anything after that.

88
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,224
You mean, screaming?

89
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,601
Yes.

90
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,356
Maybe they didn't die, then.

91
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,068
They wouldn't have been quiet
if zombies were biting them.

92
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,446
They must be alive.

93
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,788
Why won't you respond?

94
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,667
No one's responding.
I'm always talking to myself.

95
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,044
-I think you're right.
-Forget it.

96
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,422
I didn't hear anything either.

97
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,715
Me neither.

98
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,928
I was scared because I didn't know
how I'd feel if I heard them screaming,

99
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,805
but I didn't hear anything.

100
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,058
Come to think of it, neither did I.

101
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,270
Then I'm right. They're alive, right?

102
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,398
Should she be?

103
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,942
What do you mean?

104
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,530
She's a murderer.

105
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,617
She killed Gyeong-su
and walked out on her own.

106
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,579
Is it right for her to be alive?
Aren't you all being pretentious?

107
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,747
What about Ms. Park?

108
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,374
Should she have died too?

109
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,709
Is that our fault?

110
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,504
Regardless, it happened because of us.

111
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,421
What?

112
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,882
What did we do?

113
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,177
Na-yeon killed someone
and played the victim

114
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,553
and left on her own.

115
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,807
Because we didn't listen to her?

116
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,228
If no one's on your side,
is it okay to kill?

117
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,273
Ms. Park talked
as if we were in the wrong.

118
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,611
We didn't tell Na-yeon to go out there.

119
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,282
We didn't tell Ms. Park
to go out there either.

120
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,078
Why should we feel bad?

121
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,000
Fuck. What the hell did we do wrong?

122
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,647
Hey.

123
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,192
I'm not sure if I should say this--

124
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,485
Then don't say it.

125
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,617
Doesn't anyone else
need to go to the bathroom?

126
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,752
Is it just me?

127
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,131
Me too.

128
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,509
We have to go, too,

129
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,136
but we can't go out.

130
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,029
See?

131
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,407
I told you no one would come.

132
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,911
No one cares about this school.

133
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,081
If they did,
they would've saved us sooner.

134
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,709
Would've saved us from being bullied.

135
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,861
I wish the school would burn down.

136
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,823
So that nothing remains.

137
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,992
They'll come and save us.

138
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,999
They have to.

139
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,964
Otherwise…

140
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,343
I don't know.

141
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,972
I hope a fire really does break out…

142
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,727
and kills everyone.

143
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,730
Right?

144
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,026
You want to die too, right?

145
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201
No.

146
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,954
I know you actually want to live.

147
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,543
I know that you're…

148
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,672
dying to live.

149
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,721
Why are you blaming me?
Su-hyeok is the one who brought it up.

150
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,931
It's not a crime to need to poop.

151
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,101
It's not a crime, but…

152
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,395
But what? Don't you need to go?

153
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,647
Yes, I do.

154
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,359
-But I don't need to poop.
-Cheong-san, what about you?

155
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,364
I don't need to poop either.

156
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,367
Don't you need to go?

157
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,202
Why are you asking me?

158
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,246
Why are you snapping at me?

159
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,374
What are we supposed to do?
We can't go out anyway.

160
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,838
I have a good idea.

161
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,635
First,

162
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,430
boys and girls will take turns.

163
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,848
Where?

164
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,808
Here.

165
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,269
He's lost his mind.

166
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,938
-Cut it out.
-Why?

167
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,899
Girls can wait in there,

168
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,109
and the guys can pee out the window.

169
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,320
What about poop?

170
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,781
Poop. Well,

171
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,117
you can pull down your pants
and hang out the window.

172
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,535
Like this.

173
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,496
See? Outside.

174
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,957
Like you're taking a dump
at the edge of a cliff.

175
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,626
What reaction is he hoping for?

176
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,044
Stop being ridiculous.

177
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,838
But someone has to hold you or you'd fall.

178
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,423
How will you wipe?

179
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,260
-We can wipe each other.
-What is he saying?

180
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,220
What a nutjob.

181
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,472
Let's just hold it in.

182
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,266
If the rescuers come--

183
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,185
It'll take a while for them to come.

184
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,606
It may be the same outside of the school.

185
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,734
I don't know how long we'll be here,

186
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,277
but my dad said

187
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,198
you have to separate the bathroom from
where you sleep if you're ever isolated.

188
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,700
Where can we make a bathroom and how?

189
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,994
Over there.

190
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,167
Yes, sir.

191
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,711
They're sending a chopper.

192
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,548
We have to get to the roof
by 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

193
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,091
Wait.

194
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,678
Go up to the roof?
When the infected are everywhere?

195
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,637
Also,

196
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,599
tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.?
Not 11:00 p.m. tonight?

197
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,352
Yes, tomorrow.
We'll have to spend the night here.

198
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,357
How can she sleep here? Radio in again.

199
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,777
We'll have to stay here tonight,
so we'll create a temporary bathroom.

200
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,320
-U-sin.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,416
Prez and you guys,
look for something to cover the window.

202
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,333
Okay.

203
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,335
Cheong-san and Joon-yeong,

204
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,089
make something that can absorb urine
and feces to use as a toilet.

205
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,843
Cheong-san.

206
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,597
The rest of you…

207
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,514
A screen?

208
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,182
-A screen?
-To block the view.

209
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,022
MUSIC 3

210
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,778
Come with me.

211
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,488
The bathroom is over there.

212
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,671
Put this in here.

213
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,383
Why don't we put this
on top of the basket?

214
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,384
Oh, okay.

215
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,555
Okay. We'll use this as a toilet

216
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,557
as it will absorb urine and feces.

217
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,395
Put this there too.

218
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,608
Dae-su's butt is big, so let's…

219
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,320
Why don't we tape CDs up there?

220
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,782
-Tape.
-Is there more tape?

221
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,964
Have they made the toilet yet?

222
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,340
What's taking them so long?

223
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,844
That's good.

224
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,429
This should be good enough.

225
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,600
How can we poop on this?

226
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,728
Use the cover for poop
and remove it to pee.

227
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,646
Get out.

228
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,772
-Oh.
-Out.

229
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,856
How do we use that?

230
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,108
-Get out.
-Don't push me!

231
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,317
Get out!

232
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,452
At least there are cops
and soldiers out there.

233
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,580
But in the movies,

234
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,167
cops and soldiers are helpless too.

235
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,337
Still, they always save people in the end.

236
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,385
-Take the toilet paper.
-I need to pee.

237
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,555
Damn it.

238
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,557
Just stay inside.

239
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,558
Does it smell?

240
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,935
-Shit.
-What?

241
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,063
Stop overreacting. It doesn't smell.

242
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,898
Sit somewhere else.

243
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,860
There's nobody out there.

244
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,946
There are no lights on
in the stores and apartments.

245
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,282
They all either fled or died.

246
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,658
What are you saying?

247
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,618
I'm saying no one will come to save us.

248
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,497
Don't be so pessimistic.

249
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,582
Don't you know my mom?

250
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,586
She would've torn the school apart
looking for me, but she isn't here yet.

251
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,795
What do you want to do?

252
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,716
I'm just pointing out the facts.

253
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,259
We all know no one's coming.

254
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,304
Let's discuss what we're going to do.

255
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,181
We have to wait to be rescued.

256
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,225
We shouldn't leave safety
and go somewhere dangerous.

257
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,144
What if no one ever comes?

258
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,689
We haven't waited that long yet.

259
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,693
Then how much longer?
Do you want to wait until we die?

260
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,652
No.

261
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,447
I'm saying let's wait
for as long as we can.

262
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,824
We can't go out right now anyway.

263
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,118
It's probably because it's nighttime.

264
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,996
I'm sure somebody will come
in the morning.

265
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,040
There are a lot of choppers flying around.

266
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,460
Let's wait until morning.

267
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,979
What are you saying?

268
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,148
You'll leave first for a personal matter?

269
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,194
How could a firefighter say that
during a disaster?

270
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:36,031
I'll accept any punishment later.
I'll resign if that's what they want.

271
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,908
Listen.

272
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,120
You'll leave all these people
and go by yourself?

273
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,498
You'll abandon your sick colleague
and leave a new kid in charge?

274
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,042
Kid? He is not a kid.

275
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,752
He's a firefighter.

276
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,429
Fine. That was a slip of the tongue.

277
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,766
My apologies if I offended you.

278
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,894
But this isn't just about you.

279
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,314
My daughter is at school,

280
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,025
but I can't reach her.

281
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,028
I know she's waiting for me.

282
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,783
I need to go. I'm sorry.

283
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,701
Wait.

284
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,244
I want to tell you something.

285
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,295
His home is right over there.

286
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,340
If he says he needs to go save his mother,

287
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,217
should I let him?

288
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,014
She lives over there.

289
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,558
She has a husband and children.

290
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,895
Would it be right
to let her go if she wants?

291
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,566
Knowing they'll all die if they go out?

292
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,696
I have to go, even if I die.

293
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,949
That's why I'm saying this.

294
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,246
You're a firefighter.

295
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,457
And I'm a politician.

296
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,128
Do you know
when it's the hardest for people like us?

297
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,881
Right now.

298
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,176
Because we have to save the most people,

299
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,346
not the people most precious to us.

300
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,919
Fuck, that's perfect.

301
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,089
I'll get away on that bike.

302
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,914
Fuck!

303
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,775
Damn it. Wash your hands.

304
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,989
Do you know where the juniors are?

305
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,949
I don't know.

306
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,787
They're all zombies. It's not like
they'd stay with their classmates.

307
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,707
Stop that. You're driving me crazy.

308
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,170
It's dark out now, right?

309
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,213
Let's go.

310
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,841
Let's just leave tomorrow.

311
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:09,137
It's too dark to see anything.
We won't see the zombies coming.

312
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,099
You said we should go at night
so the zombies don't see us.

313
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,268
People can change their minds.

314
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,312
Shut it and stand up.

315
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,356
No, I'm not going.

316
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,482
Damn it.

317
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,610
Forget it, then.

318
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,946
Hey. Grab your bow and follow me.

319
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,156
Shut up. Don't do anything.

320
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,909
That bitch.

321
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,537
Spoken like an athlete.

322
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,374
-What?
-Doing nothing is your specialty.

323
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,669
You do nothing but shoot arrows,
and you go to college and make money.

324
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,589
You have an easy life,
so you sit on your fucking ass and wait.

325
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,800
Who says shooting arrows
gets you into college?

326
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,926
Doesn't it?

327
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,095
Stop making it obvious
you're stupid and stay down.

328
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,263
You know nothing.

329
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,389
You bitch.

330
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,057
Hey.

331
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,184
What did you say?

332
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,352
Hey.

333
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,397
How did you know I was stupid?

334
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,816
Tell me. Is it on Facebook?

335
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,610
Stop it. Let it go.

336
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,362
Why the hell should she let it go?

337
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,156
Ha-ri, don't hold back.

338
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,994
You bitch.

339
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,205
You little--

340
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,040
Let go of me!

341
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,627
-Come at me.
-Stop it.

342
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,671
-Come at me, bitch.
-That's enough.

343
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,631
-Come at me! Let go!
-Stop it.

344
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,632
-Stop it!
-You bitch!

345
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,092
-Let go!
-Do you want to die?

346
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,177
Cut it out!

347
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,845
-Hey.
-You said not to hold back!

348
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,138
Are you touching my boobs?

349
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,640
-Get lost.
-Move.

350
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,142
Get out of the way!

351
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,810
-Stop it!
-Who do you think--

352
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,853
People.

353
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,396
-ANYONE ALIVE?
-ANYBODY THERE?

354
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,982
This is pure hell.

355
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,359
The cops won't pick up.

356
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,195
-IT'S SCARY
-LOOK AT THE VIEWS

357
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,989
And there are no first responders.
Damn it!

358
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,366
-LOOK AT HIS FACE LOL
-YOU REALLY WENT?

359
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,620
I'm going to hide and wait to be rescued.

360
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:01,958
Please subscribe
and like my channel, orangekay?

361
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,837
Fuck. Don't you think I deserve a like?

362
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,049
-IS THIS REAL?
-I RESPECT YOU, BROTHER

363
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,801
Okay. I'm going to go now.

364
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,639
-IS IT A VIRUS?
-WHERE'S YOUR BADASS AXE?

365
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:19,100
What the hell?
What asshole threw away garbage here?

366
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,895
-MY CONDOLENCES
-GARBAGE ASSHOLE LOL

367
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,981
-LET'S NOT GO THERE
-SURE THERE'S NO ZOMBIES?

368
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,866
Look, everyone.

369
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,243
-I CAN'T TURN THIS OFF
-DON'T GO FURTHER

370
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,410
It's clean.

371
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,371
I think it's safe.

372
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,081
-MY HEART'S RACING
-I HATE ZOMBIES

373
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,415
I'll go in now.

374
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,669
-IT'LL BE FULL OF ZOMBIES
-IS THIS REALLY SCARY?

375
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,421
-YOU'RE WORKING HARD
-SHOULD'VE BROUGHT A GUN

376
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,424
-WHY'D YOU GO TO HELL?
-STRAIGHT TO HELL

377
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,427
-YOU SHOULD HIDE
-STOP GOING

378
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,430
-BE CAREFUL
-WHAT IF THEY'RE IN THERE?

379
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,517
-IT'S EMPTY, SPEND THE NIGHT
-DON'T MAKE A SOUND!

380
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,353
It looks like there's no one here.

381
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,439
-I'M SCARED…
-SAFETY FIRST!

382
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,443
-IT'S TOO DARK…
-IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO RUN…

383
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,403
Hold on.

384
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,822
What is that?

385
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,448
-THANKS FOR EVERYTHING
-BYE BYE

386
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,535
-I HEAR SOMETHING
-WHAT IS IT?

387
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,245
-ALL THIS JUST FOR LIKES
-WE'RE WATCHING SOMETHING DIE

388
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,538
Damn it.

389
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,498
-YOU'RE INSANE
-CUTE ZOMBIES LOL

390
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,167
-RUN! RUN!
-I WANT TO GO THERE TOO

391
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,169
This is bad.

392
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,133
-SO SCARY
-IT'S ALL FAKE ANYWAY LOL

393
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,926
-IS THAT REAL?
-KEEP STREAMING!

394
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,679
Do you see that? Damn it. Where do I go?

395
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,727
-IS THIS FOR REAL?
-DAMN

396
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,024
Damn it.

397
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,152
Seriously?

398
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,577
Do you know

399
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,580
what's going on out there?

400
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,420
The strong are ripping apart the weak.

401
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,297
It happens all the time.

402
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,593
Are you crazy?

403
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,053
The world is crazy.

404
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,096
Why did you do this?

405
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,392
I tried to tell everyone,
but no one listened.

406
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,618
My son was bullied for a very long time.

407
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,854
I only found out
after he tried to kill himself.

408
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,483
I found out too late,

409
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,277
but I thought I could fix it.

410
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,780
SCHOOL VIOLENCE RESOLUTION COMMITTEE

411
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,823
We were just…

412
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,866
Well, we…

413
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,036
We were only fooling around.

414
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,795
Come on, guys.
We were just messing around.

415
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,549
That's what we do when we hang out, right?

416
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,261
Is that right?

417
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,102
Eun-ji?

418
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,695
Yes.

419
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,578
I'm sure you know this
since you work at the school,

420
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,164
but it's difficult to prove
what happened among kids,

421
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,957
and it's difficult to punish them.

422
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,792
They won't go to prison.

423
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,211
The kids were just fooling around.

424
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,798
How could you go to the police?
The school punished them. That's enough.

425
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,134
Is writing apologies
considered "punishment"?

426
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,719
They're students.

427
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,805
They apologized and promised
not to do it again. Isn't that enough?

428
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,515
We have evaluations coming up.

429
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,018
Why make an issue of it
and blow it out of proportion?

430
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,895
You're right.

431
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,190
You were kicked out
of a pharmaceutical company

432
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,858
and were a contract teacher.

433
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,028
But our principal took you in
as a permanent teacher.

434
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,573
You should think of the school too.

435
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,283
That's how they always were.

436
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,662
We transferred him immediately.

437
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,291
But they kept finding him
and harassing him.

438
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,544
It was fun for them.

439
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,506
Like playing with a toy.

440
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,966
Smile for the camera. Smile.

441
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,593
Look at him.

442
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,020
Dad.

443
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,860
Just fight back instead.

444
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,616
Fight as if your life depended on it!

445
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,703
I'm sorry, Dad.

446
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,373
I just want to die.

447
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,461
I think that would be easier.

448
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,631
That's when I realized it.

449
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,010
We live in a system of violence.

450
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,764
A nobody like me…

451
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,352
can't change the system.

452
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,449
That's why I decided to change my son.

453
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,745
I just hoped he wouldn't die.

454
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,207
I didn't want him
to try and commit suicide again.

455
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,751
Please stop!

456
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,046
You…

457
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,052
created a monster.

458
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,763
That's how desperate I was to save him.

459
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,641
Rather than die as a human,

460
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,561
I wanted him to survive as a monster.

461
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,773
Don't you realize
that monster is killing everyone?

462
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,818
Who cares if they all die?
They're all accomplices.

463
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,361
You crazy bastard.

464
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,864
Who made the world like this?

465
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,533
I warned you countless times
that ignoring minor violence

466
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,161
would result in violence
taking over the world.

467
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,412
But no one listened.

468
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,664
"It happens."

469
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,293
"Kids fight. They were bullied
because they deserved it."

470
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,254
Those who thought that and shunned them

471
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,340
made this world what it is!

472
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,190
No. You're the one who made this hellhole.

473
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,692
As a cop, I'm partly responsible.

474
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,779
Those who are out there dying
without knowing why?

475
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,989
Sure. They may be partly responsible.

476
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,743
But there are things
you must pay with death

477
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,954
and things we must amend
while still alive.

478
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,332
What you wanted was
for the world to change.

479
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,921
Not for everyone to die like this, right?

480
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,679
Day 39 of infection.

481
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,515
I've tested several sedatives.

482
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,975
The most effective…

483
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,694
Where's the cure?

484
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,406
There must be a form of treatment.

485
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,784
There isn't.

486
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,629
Let's go. We've been ordered to evacuate.

487
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,480
What are you looking at, asshole? Get in.

488
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,607
Shove them in.

489
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,192
Yes, sir. Come on.

490
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,362
Move quickly. Go.

491
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,064
Hey. What's wrong?

492
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,231
Help…

493
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,990
What the hell?

494
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,832
This is the closest they are
to following their raw instincts.

495
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,585
This is just one side of human nature.

496
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,798
Perhaps it's best
to accept them for what they are

497
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,802
and give up on trying to cure them.

498
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:06,831
Mr. Lee!

499
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,884
My laptop is in the school science lab.

500
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,801
Let's go.

501
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,554
The solution is in there.
That's the only way.

502
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,515
Fine, so let's get the laptop! Damn it.

503
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,561
Lee Byeong-chan!

504
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,773
Go! Get out of here!

505
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,234
Hurry!

506
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,560
Fuck. That was close.

507
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,291
What the hell?

508
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,253
Wait!

509
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,587
Help me.

510
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,964
I'm stuck.

511
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,466
Come on.

512
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,781
The standards of being human
emasculate human nature.

513
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,575
How are we different from a seeing eye dog

514
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,786
whose instincts to run
and bark are stripped?

515
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,165
Must all dogs abandon their instincts
and become seeing eye dogs?

516
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,836
Must everyone abandon their instincts
to become truly human?

517
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,485
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

518
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,280
We're going to
the Disaster and Safety Management.

519
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,783
We have to tell them to get the laptop
from the Hyosan High science lab.

520
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,787
The solution to this disaster is in there.
Understand?

521
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,831
Hyosan High. Science lab. Laptop.

522
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,666
Why are you telling me?

523
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,003
If I die, you have to stay alive
and tell them, you idiot.

524
00:38:59,086 --> 00:38:59,962
Me?

525
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,505
You dumbass.

526
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,757
Let's go.

527
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,718
Where are you going?

528
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,429
The Disaster and Safety Management.
I told you two seconds ago.

529
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,680
Get with the program.

530
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,933
-Where?
-Disaster and Safety Management.

531
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,062
-And tell them what?
-Hyosan High, science lab, laptop.

532
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,355
-That's right.
-Okay.

533
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,482
-Are you ready?
-No.

534
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,317
Let's go.

535
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,243
Follow me.

536
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,353
It's cold.

537
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,560
No one came.

538
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,576
This is driving me crazy.

539
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,996
No cops and no cigarettes.

540
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,498
Nothing.

541
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,835
Really? Nobody came?

542
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,961
Let me down.

543
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,839
-My back.
-Damn.

544
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,762
Hey. What do you want to do?

545
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,725
We need to leave.
No one's coming to save us.

546
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,481
All the zombies will see us right now.

547
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,899
Let's go at night.

548
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,984
Okay. You can stay right here.

549
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,988
Let's go out back
and leave through the back gate.

550
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,364
That's the fastest route.

551
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,658
-I'm going to the second floor first.
-Why?

552
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,579
My brother's a junior.
I need to check if he's there.

553
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,792
Hey. Would a zombie sit
and wait at his desk in his classroom?

554
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,879
Did you see him turn?

555
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,464
He may have.

556
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,216
There's no guarantee that he didn't.

557
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,675
You little…

558
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,511
Why are you guys arguing?

559
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,887
Just fight some more.

560
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,057
Sorry.

561
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,395
Come with me if you want.

562
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,695
She's so cool. Damn it.

563
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,364
So annoying.

564
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,452
Wait for me.

565
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,955
They'll come for us eventually.

566
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,498
How long do we wait?

567
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,291
Until they come.

568
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,919
We don't even know if they're coming.

569
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,880
So? You want to go out there?

570
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,467
But even if they come, they can't find us
if they don't know we're here.

571
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,262
-We can put up a signal for help.
-How?

572
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:40,182
My dad taught me a signal
that's used internationally.

573
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,892
What is it?

574
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,979
It's Cheong-san. See you later.

575
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,772
Eat another bite.

576
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,524
Hey!

577
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:52,194
It was red and blue arranged together

578
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:58,325
to create some sort of a pattern.

579
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,293
Should we just write "SOS"
on the curtains?

580
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,044
Yes, let's do that.

581
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,926
We can't last long anyway.
Three minutes of no oxygen,

582
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,970
three days of no water,
three weeks of no food.

583
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,221
What's that?

584
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,223
How long a person can survive.

585
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,727
It's only been a day.
We have to try the best we can.

586
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,939
We'll show signs of dehydration
after today.

587
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,192
-We won't be able to move by tomorrow.
-What are you getting at?

588
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,695
Are you saying we should go?

589
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:40,075
Or are you saying we'll die anyway,
so we shouldn't bother doing anything?

590
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:47,958
I don't know.

591
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,752
Then don't say anything.

592
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:57,426
I think Prez means
we should think about all of our options.

593
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,011
Right?

594
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,221
-No.
-No?

595
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,058
I mean, we know nothing.

596
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,894
We need to know more
to think and make plans--

597
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,145
What do you mean?

598
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,438
What she means--

599
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,399
You don't know what she's saying either.

600
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,318
Right.

601
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,573
Are you saying we need to grasp
the situation before taking action?

602
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,660
Yes, something like that.

603
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,244
I agree.

604
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,290
We need to know more to decide
whether to wait, run, or go out.

605
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,418
How can we do that right now?

606
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,754
We can go online if we have a phone.

607
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,590
But we don't have one.

608
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,509
In the teachers' office.

609
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,639
Why are you telling me that now?

610
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,598
Sorry.

611
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:48,394
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
What can I do about it now?

612
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,857
What time is it?

613
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,736
It's 9:00 a.m.

614
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,157
Hyosan High. Mo Eun-ji.

615
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,827
Nude. Kim Cheol-su.

616
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:05,869
SCHEDULE SETTINGS

617
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,913
Schedule post…

618
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,123
PROCESSING

619
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,666
…for 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

620
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,210
Bring the money by 9:00 a.m.

621
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,005
If you don't,
it'll be uploaded automatically.

622
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,886
I just had to give him the money.

623
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,056
But I couldn't because of the zombies.

624
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,518
I was going to ask the rescuers
to find his phone if they came, but…

625
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,061
It's past 9:00 a.m., right?

626
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,730
How would I know? I don't have my phone.

627
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,606
No.

628
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,567
It can't be 9:00 a.m. yet.

629
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,945
If that gets posted online, I'll…

630
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,536
What's wrong? Where are you going?

631
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,789
-Let go. I should've died yesterday.
-Don't say that.

632
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,833
Please stop it!

633
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,169
Whether or not you die,
the video will be posted.

634
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,045
What will it change?

635
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,137
You're right.

636
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,974
Even if I die, everyone will see my body.

637
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,059
Everyone will watch,

638
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:12,978
and my mom…

639
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,730
It'll be okay.

640
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,983
We did nothing wrong.

641
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,818
We were victims.

642
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,614
I'm going.

643
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,824
Where?

644
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,534
-To get his phone.
-Are you insane?

645
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,371
Will you come with me?

646
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,707
-You filmed me.
-But…

647
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,751
I had no choice. They made me do it.

648
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,796
It's the same as committing murder
because you had no choice.

649
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,757
Still,

650
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,594
we'll die if we go.

651
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,887
That's so you.

652
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,598
You don't have
the courage to live or to die.

653
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,226
You're a fucking coward, asshole.

654
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,462
Cheong-san.

655
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,007
Stop being so stubborn.

656
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,262
The teachers' office is two rooms across
and one floor down.

657
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,471
Don't go.

658
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,849
I'll come back
if I can't make it all the way.

659
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,018
-Don't worry.
-I'm not worried about you.

660
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,895
I'm angry.

661
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,023
Sure. Why would you worry about me?

662
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,029
Damn it.

663
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,826
Su-hyeok.

664
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,827
I'll be back.

665
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,542
Careful, Cheong-san.

666
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,714
Bare-su is a man of loyalty.

667
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,215
-You too?
-I'm going too.

668
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,384
-Stop it. Come down.
-Why?

669
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,511
You can't go out there
with that body, fatso.

670
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,430
What's wrong with my body?

671
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,098
What do you think?

672
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,278
Why do you keep following me?

673
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,572
Who else do you have?

674
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,950
Stay close.

675
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,372
Careful.

676
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,635
Can we go in?

677
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,553
Come back.

678
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,775
What are you going to do?

679
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,280
Let's hang by our hands and go.

680
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,534
No, I mean…

681
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,455
I heard that On-jo told you she likes you.

682
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,334
-Are you going to go out with her?
-Is that important right now?

683
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:27,673
I'm not asking because it's important.
I'm just curious.

684
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,509
Why?

685
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,345
-Should I go out with her?
-Hey.

686
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,514
Why are you asking me?

687
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,099
Do as you wish.

688
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,351
What do you think?

689
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,479
Go.

690
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,317
Go.

691
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,276
You go.

692
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,115
Be careful.

693
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,290
Why are you doing this to me?

694
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,335
What is it?

695
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,642
What is that?

696
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,937
I don't know. Let's go see.

697
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,326
I'll destroy them all.

698
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,036
All of them.

699
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,960
What the hell?

700
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,899
GWI-NAM
UPLOAD

701
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:19,988
That bastard.

702
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,406
I'll kill you!

703
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,744
Give it to me, fucker! I'll kill you!

704
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,459
Cheong-san.

705
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,923
Damn it.

706
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,732
Go first. I'll catch up.

707
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,868
Damn it.

708
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,585
Hey.

709
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,129
Wake up.

710
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,091
You're Yoon Gwi-nam, right?

711
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,509
What? Why?

712
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,220
How is it outside? The same?

713
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:12,934
I don't know.

714
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,229
You know how to drive, right?

715
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,024
-No.
-Yeah, right.

716
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,568
You guys drove your dad's car
and crashed it last year.

717
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,361
Do you know what a headache
that was for me?

718
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,572
But why do you ask?

719
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,870
My car is in the parking lot.
The plate number is 7340.

720
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,458
Bring it here.

721
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,505
Me?

722
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,717
Go through the window
of the night duty room to the lot.

723
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,677
I don't want to.

724
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,389
You punk. Listen to your principal!

725
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,891
I said I don't want to.

726
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,355
-Give me that.
-Let go. You punk.

727
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,648
Fuck! I said to let go.

728
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,400
Damn it.

729
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,196
Fine. Just go.

730
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,113
Come with me.

731
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,074
Why should I? Go.

732
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,867
Come with me to the car.

733
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:14,788
I wanted a shield anyway.

734
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,748
What's wrong with you? Stay away.

735
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,502
God.

736
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,214
Look, Mr. Principal.

737
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,508
If this were a game,

738
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:30,887
I'd be… taking down the final boss,

739
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:32,972
sir.

740
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,124
Is that okay?

741
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,208
Yes.

742
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,587
Okay. We'll go to the rooftop now.

743
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,674
Please work together as we practiced.

744
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,387
Hurry!

745
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,014
-How much longer?
-A little more.

746
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,099
Hold on!

747
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,270
-I'll do it. Block them with the desk.
-Yes, sir!

748
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,147
-Come with me.
-Okay!

749
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,155
Okay, come one by one.

750
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,074
Ma'am, go first.

751
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,784
-You go first.
-You first!

752
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,287
-Anybody! Come!
-Go! Hurry!

753
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,874
Go! Hurry! Go!

754
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,423
Okay. Run here together on my signal.

755
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,967
Three! Two! One!

756
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,927
Now!

757
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:56,723
Get back!

758
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,651
Charge!

759
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,741
Hurry!

760
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,204
-Back up!
-Yes, sir!

761
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,753
I've got it!

762
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,551
What now?

763
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,594
Hello…

764
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,641
Close the door!

765
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,103
Captain, downstairs!

766
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,868
Captain, here too!

767
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,173
Upstairs…

768
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,550
Go up first.

769
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,467
We can't.

770
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,262
The door to the rooftop is locked.

771
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,388
What?

772
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,098
The door is locked!

773
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,726
-U-sin, do you have the tools?
-Yes, I do.

774
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,187
-Go upstairs.
-What about the door?

775
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,106
Hurry!

776
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,650
Go up now!

777
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,569
Hurry.

778
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,088
-Get out of the way.
-Step aside.

779
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,184
Help him!

780
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,314
A little more!

781
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,239
-Okay. One more time.
-Okay. One, two, three.

782
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,821
-Hurry, ma'am.
-After you, ma'am.

783
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,657
All right, let's go.

784
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,075
Damn it.

785
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,910
Hurry up!

786
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:50,707
What happened?

787
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,167
Careful. Hold on.

788
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,360
You all did great.

789
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:21,571
Is anyone hurt?

790
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,749
-Sir.
-What are you doing? Grab this psycho!

791
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,459
Hey, Gwi-nam.

792
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,543
Cheong-san.

793
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,295
Come here and tie his arms.

794
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,339
He won't stay still.

795
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,674
Hey. What are you doing?

796
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,427
Come and tie him up.

797
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,138
You're finished.
You're expelled! Untie me!

798
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:31,974
Gwi-nam!

799
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,267
Don't do that.

800
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,606
Don't do what? This principal bastard

801
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,400
tried to kill me.

802
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,532
He told me to go out and get his car.

803
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,033
Is that okay?

804
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,203
-Hey.
-That's it. Good job.

805
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,996
I'm filming everything.

806
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,124
Let him go
or I'll send this to the police.

807
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,794
I'm going to kill you.

808
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:02,046
Please stop acting like human trash.

809
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,383
No one respects you
just because you act tough.

810
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,343
I'm the head boss of this school now.

811
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,095
Don't you get it?

812
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,555
My ass, you are.

813
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:15,393
You're just a loser scumbag
who'll spend his entire life

814
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,562
serving bullies.

815
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,863
Say that again.

816
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,917
You fucking…

817
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,256
Am I still a loser?

818
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,383
Am I?

819
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,178
Everyone who doesn't listen to me dies.
Give me the phone.

820
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,514
-You just killed--
-Give me the phone!

821
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:07,862
Damn it!

822
