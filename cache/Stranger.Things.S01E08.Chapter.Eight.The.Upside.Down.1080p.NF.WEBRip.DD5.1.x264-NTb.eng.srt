1
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,899
Let me out of here!

2
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,611
Somebody, please!

3
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:31,824
Let me out!

4
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,638
Your son.

5
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,933
We know you've been in contact with him.

6
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:02,063
- You have to let me--
- When...

7
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,775
and how did you make contact with him?

8
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,570
-What?
-Hmm?

9
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:11,864
Six.

10
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,242
What?

11
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,869
Six.

12
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:21,165
Six people have been taken this week.

13
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,795
This... thing that took your son...

14
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:29,841
we don't really understand it.

15
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,427
But its behavior is predictable.

16
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,597
Like all animals...

17
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:39,934
it eats.

18
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,187
It will take more sons.

19
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,273
More daughters.

20
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:47,942
I want to save them.

21
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,487
I want to save your son.

22
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,157
But I can't do that.

23
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,326
Not without your help.

24
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,619
Stop.

25
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,291
I know who you are.

26
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,835
I know what you've done.

27
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,131
You took my boy away from me!

28
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,968
You left him in that place to die!

29
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,054
You faked his death!

30
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,265
We had a funeral.

31
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,726
We buried him.

32
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:25,897
And now you're asking for my help?

33
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:31,569
Go to hell.

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,119
--Okay, now what do you know?

35
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,788
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:43,873
Did I stutter?

37
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,001
I told you.

38
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,461
Everything.

39
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,133
What do you know?

40
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:58,137
I know you do experiments
on kidnapped little kids,

41
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,598
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

42
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:03,267
And I know you went
a little too far this time

43
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,269
and you messed up in a big way.

44
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,399
I mean, you really messed up,
didn't you? Big time.

45
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,401
That's why you're trying
to cover your tracks.

46
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,446
You killed Benny Hammond,
you faked Will Byers' death.

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,949
You made it look like
that little girl just ran away.

48
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,450
See, I told you.

49
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,121
-I know everything.
-All right, who are you working with?

50
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,415
Nobody.

51
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,667
But I did give all this
over to my friend at the Times.

52
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,460
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.

53
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,929
You're just a junkie.

54
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,725
A small town cop
who had a really bad week.

55
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:46,060
Took one too many pills this time.

56
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,941
You made a mistake coming back here.

57
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,609
No, I didn't.

58
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,946
Here's what's gonna happen.

59
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,575
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go...

60
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,870
you're gonna give us anything we need,

61
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:05,997
and we're gonna find her son.

62
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,793
And then we're gonna forget
that any of this ever happened.

63
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:13,004
Oh, is that right?

64
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:15,590
Yeah.

65
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:18,760
That's right.

66
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,484
Nancy? Jonathan?

67
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,451
-They're gone.
-What?

68
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,827
Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.

69
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,454
They're probably
just sucking face somewhere.

70
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,456
- Gross.
- No. No way!

71
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,624
Did they go with the chief?

72
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:50,708
I don't know.

73
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:52,418
No.

74
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,797
What? Did you see them?
Do you know where they went?

75
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,091
-Yes.
-Where? Where did they go?

76
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,221
Demogorgon.

77
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,872
Where's the girl?

78
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,340
You gotta give me your word.

79
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,427
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

80
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,182
And those other three kids, those boys,
you're gonna leave them alone.

81
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,311
Then I'll tell you.

82
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,608
Tell you where
your little science experiment is.

83
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,134
I don't understand.

84
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:48,886
We came to an agreement.

85
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,554
What?

86
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:53,182
Look, everything that's happened here
and everything that's gonna happen,

87
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,684
we don't talk about.

88
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,977
You want Will back?

89
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,688
This place had nothing to do with it.

90
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,316
That's the deal.
You got it?

91
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,244
What is this?

92
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,163
Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.

93
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,624
But my son's in there. He...

94
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,834
Put it on.

95
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm telling you,
this is a mistake.

96
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,728
It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted?

97
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,563
And if they find the boy?

98
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,231
That's not gonna happen.

99
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,414
Hey, you all right?

100
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,540
Yeah.

101
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,292
I need you to relax, okay?

102
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,795
I want you to slow down your breathing,
take deep breaths.

103
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,964
In and out.

104
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,758
Deep breath in...

105
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,844
and out.

106
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,472
In and out.

107
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,810
-In and out.
-It's troll's favorite food!

108
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:26,562
- Princess!
- No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

109
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:30,691
-Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!
-No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy.

110
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,112
--Whoa, hey!

111
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,530
Hey.

112
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:37,990
--You all right?

113
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,366
-What's going on?
-Whoa.

114
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,535
-What happened? What happened?
-I don't know. I don't know.

115
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,038
Hey, you all right?

116
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,164
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

117
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,249
- Relax, relax. Honey, honey.

118
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,251
Honey, just breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

119
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:52,046
In and out.
Slow, slow, slow.

120
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,633
In and out with me.

121
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,717
In...

122
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,763
- You okay?
- Yeah.

123
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:01,972
Yeah.

124
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,744
Remember...

125
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,580
-Straight into Will's room. And--
-Don't step on the trap.

126
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,082
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

127
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,625
Then...

128
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,586
All right.

129
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:34,505
You ready?

130
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,299
Ready.

131
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,511
On three.

132
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,554
One...

133
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,224
two...

134
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,476
You don't have to do this--

135
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,560
Jonathan, stop talking.

136
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:49,812
-I'm just saying, you don't have to--
-Three.

137
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,524
Guys, guys! This is crazy.

138
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:54,900
We can't just wait around.

139
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,277
Mike, in case you forgot,
we're still fugitives.

140
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,737
The bad men are still looking for us.

141
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,698
Yeah, and we don't even know
where your sister is.

142
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,782
El can find them.

143
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:02,866
Mike, look at her.

144
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,619
I still think we should stick
to the chief's plan.

145
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:09,289
Exactly. We stay here,
keep El out of sight and keep her safe.

146
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,166
That's the most important thing, remember?

147
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,168
Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.

148
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,671
Yeah, and she's kind of
a badass now, so...

149
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,049
Well, where are you going?
You just said stick to the plan!

150
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,510
I am. I'm just gonna go get
some chocolate pudding.

151
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,679
I'm telling you,
Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.

152
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,014
Are you serious?

153
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:26,765
El needs to be recharged!

154
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,996
Did you hear that?

155
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,250
It's just the wind.

156
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,382
Don't worry.

157
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:03,802
My mom, she said the lights speak
when it comes.

158
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:04,970
Speak?

159
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,097
Blink.

160
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,266
Think of them as alarms.

161
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,818
Is that too tight?

162
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,196
No, it's fine.

163
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,489
Thanks.

164
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,043
Nancy?

165
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,505
Yeah?

166
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,469
Jonathan?

167
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,888
Are you there, man?
It's... it's Steve!

168
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,474
Listen, I just want to talk!

169
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,187
-Steve, listen to me.
-Hey. Nancy, what--

170
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,689
-You need to leave.
-I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

171
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:58,941
I don't care about that.
You need to leave.

172
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:02,361
No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

173
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,113
I messed... I messed up.

174
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,197
Okay?

175
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,032
Really. Please.

176
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,659
I just want to make things right.

177
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:12,037
Okay? Please. Please...

178
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,541
Hey, what happened to your hand?

179
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:16,875
Is that blood?

180
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,710
Nothing.
It was an accident.

181
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,671
-Yeah, what's going on?
-Nothing.

182
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,548
-Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
-No.

183
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,925
-Nancy, let me in!
-No. No! No, Steve!

184
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,970
-What is... What the...
-You need to get out of here.

185
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,847
-Whoa. What is all--
-Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

186
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,473
-I'm telling you, get out of here!
-What is that smell?

187
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:32,975
-Is that... is that gasoline?
-Steve, get out!

188
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,769
Wait.
What? What is going on?

189
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,146
You have five seconds
to get out of here.

190
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,647
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

191
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,524
-I'm doing this for you.
-Nancy.

192
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,775
-Wait. Is this a... What is this?
-Nancy.

193
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,861
-Three. Two.
-No, no, no! No, no!

194
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,654
Nancy! The lights.

195
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,532
- It's here.
- Wait, what's here?

196
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,616
- Where is it?
- Where is what? Whoa!

197
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,201
-Easy with that!
-Where is it?

198
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,369
I don't know.
I don't see it.

199
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:53,454
Where is what?

200
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,290
Hello? Will someone please explain to me
what the hell is going--

201
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:01,420
--No!

202
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,922
Go! Go! Run! Go!

203
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,340
Get out of here!

204
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,387
- Jump!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

205
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,891
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

206
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,392
- What the hell was that?
- Shut up!

207
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,318
What's it doing?

208
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,528
I don't know.

209
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,585
Do you hear anything?

210
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,545
No.

211
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,229
Will!

212
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,814
Will!

213
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,612
Will!

214
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:56,702
Will!

215
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,592
"I asked Mrs. Spencer what made
them red and she said she didn't know

216
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,552
and for pity's sake
not to ask her any more questions.

217
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,429
She said I must have asked her
a thousand already.

218
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,638
I suppose I had, too,

219
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,725
but how are you gonna find things out
if you don't ask questions?

220
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,685
And what does make roads red?

221
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,520
'Well, I don't know,' said Matthew.

222
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,231
It just makes me feel glad to be alive...

223
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,526
it's such an interesting world."

224
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,878
Will!

225
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,633
Will!

226
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,920
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy.

227
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,255
This is crazy! This is crazy!
This is crazy!

228
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,386
What are you do--
What are you doing? Are you insane?

229
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,637
It's going to come back!

230
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,472
So you need to leave.

231
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,432
Right now.

232
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,290
Where is it?

233
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,669
Come on.
Come on, you son of a bitch.

234
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,671
-You see it?
-No. Where--

235
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:13,839
Come on.

236
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,550
Where are you?
Come on!

237
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,640
- Jonathan!

238
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,435
--Jonathan!

239
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:28,645
Jonathan!

240
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,026
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

241
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,002
- Steve!

242
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,306
He's in the trap!

243
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,852
- He's stuck!
- Jonathan, now!

244
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,321
Did you hear that?

245
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,371
Get back!

246
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,893
- Where did it go?
- No.

247
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,394
It has to be dead.

248
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,647
It has to be.

249
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,324
Come on.

250
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,284
Is that my house?

251
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,235
It was hurt.

252
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,645
Mom.

253
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,647
Is that you?

254
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,192
Mom.

255
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,362
Jonathan?

256
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,951
Joyce, come on.

257
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,131
Where's it going?

258
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,551
I don't think that's the monster.

259
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:54,225
Found it!
I knew she was hoarding it.

260
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,644
-I knew it.
-Yeah.

261
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,187
Always lying, saying she's out.

262
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,855
Bald-faced liar.

263
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:02,233
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

264
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:03,693
Okay!

265
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:05,987
Are you feeling any better?

266
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,409
What's "putting"?

267
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,119
Pudding, it's...

268
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,746
it's this chocolate goo
you eat with a spoon.

269
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,289
Don't worry,

270
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,583
when all this is over,
you won't have to keep eating junk food

271
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,293
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

272
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,545
My mom,
she's a pretty awesome cook.

273
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,130
She can make you whatever you like.

274
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,507
Eggos?

275
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,843
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

276
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,681
See, I was thinking,

277
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:36,017
once all this is over and Will's back
and you're not a secret anymore,

278
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,603
my parents can get you
an actual bed for the basement.

279
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,397
Or you can take my room if you want,

280
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,024
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

281
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,235
My point is, they'll take care of you.

282
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,028
They'll be like your new parents,

283
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,864
and Nancy,
she'll be like your new sister.

284
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,742
Will you be like my brother?

285
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,537
What? No, no.

286
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,163
Why "no"?

287
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,623
Because...

288
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:00,750
'cause it's different.

289
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,085
Why?

290
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,213
I mean, I don't know,
I guess it's not.

291
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,590
It's stupid.

292
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,884
Mike?

293
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,136
Yeah?

294
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,346
Friends don't lie.

295
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,640
Well...

296
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,017
I was thinking...

297
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,311
I don't know...

298
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:24,149
maybe we can go
to the Snow Ball together.

299
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,192
-"Snow Ball"?
-It's this cheesy school dance,

300
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,987
where you go in the gym
and dance to music and stuff.

301
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,781
I've never been, but I know you're not
supposed to go with your sister.

302
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,576
-No?
-I mean...

303
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:36,786
you can, but it'd be really weird.

304
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,540
You go to school dances
with someone that, you know...

305
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,126
someone that you like.

306
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,170
-A friend?
-Not a friend.

307
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,630
Uh... uh...

308
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,300
Uh, someone like a...

309
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,318
Nancy.
Hold on, I'll be right back.

310
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,736
Stay here.

311
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,336
Go!

312
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:28,838
You two, on me.

313
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:34,093
This will charge your battery right up,
I'm telling you.

314
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:36,638
- Guys! Guys!
- What is it?

315
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,307
They found us.

316
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,017
We know they're here.

317
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,647
Be advised,
west side of the building is clear.

318
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,110
Sir, we've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of them.

319
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:56,699
Nothin'.

320
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,037
Keep it locked down.

321
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,330
All right.

322
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,457
Kitchen.

323
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:11,798
How did they find us?

324
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,383
I don't know,
but they knew we were in the gym.

325
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,634
Lando.

326
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,179
- Got 'em!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

327
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,430
Come on!

328
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,517
- There they are. Freeze.
- Back! Go back!

329
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,394
Go, go! Go left!

330
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,341
El, are you okay?

331
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,010
El!

332
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,428
-Something's wrong.
-She's just drained.

333
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,847
No, no, no,
she won't wake up. El!

334
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,599
El!
El!

335
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,019
There's more blood.

336
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,652
Oh, my God.

337
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,365
This way.

338
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,173
-She's barely breathing.
-We gotta go.

339
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:18,258
Leave her.

340
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,138
- Step away from the child.
- No!

341
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,932
You want her,
you have to kill us first.

342
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,809
-That's right!
-Eat shit!

343
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,686
-Oh, no! No, no!
-No! No! Get off me!

344
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:32,105
- You idiot!
- No!

345
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,316
- Get off me!
- Ow! Let go!

346
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,569
Eleven?
Eleven, can you hear me?

347
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:39,696
Eleven?

348
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:41,656
Papa?

349
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,200
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

350
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,119
- Get off of me.
- I'm here now.

351
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:49,247
Let her go!
Let her go, you bastard!

352
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,084
Shh, shh, you're sick.

353
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,253
You're sick,
but I'm going to make you better.

354
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:59,173
I'm going to take you back home,
where I can make you well again.

355
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,175
Where we can make all of this better,

356
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,177
so no one else gets hurt.

357
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:08,683
Bad.

358
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:11,853
Bad.

359
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,776
Mike. Mike.

360
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,528
--Mike.

361
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,035
Blood.

362
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,328
What?

363
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:29,954
Blood.

364
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,058
Demogorgon.

365
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,313
Go, go, go, go, go!

366
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,360
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go!

367
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:08,803
Oh, my God.

368
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:35,455
Will! Will!

369
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,125
Will! Oh, my God!

370
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,544
Will! Hopper!

371
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,464
Oh, my God!
You need to help get him out!

372
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:46,799
Get him out!

373
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,108
Oh, Jesus.

374
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,236
--Come on, come on!

375
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,988
Oh, my God!

376
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,161
Sorry. Hold on, we're almost there.
We're almost there.

377
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:20,082
Come on.
Come on.

378
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,044
Help, help.

379
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,795
Come on, get her on the table.

380
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,510
Just hold on a little longer,
okay?

381
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:33,387
He's gone.
The bad man's gone.

382
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:36,557
We'll be home soon, and my mom...

383
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:39,143
she'll get you your own bed.

384
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:41,729
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

385
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,942
And we can go to the Snow Ball.

386
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,364
Promise?

387
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,617
Promise.

388
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,302
Is... Is it dead?

389
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,599
Go, go, go, go!

390
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:20,643
Get the wrist rocket!
Get the wrist rocket now!

391
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,812
- Go, go, go, go, go!

392
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,564
- Go, go, go.
- Take it out now!

393
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:25,773
Get the rocks, get the rocks,
get the rocks!

394
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:26,857
Getting the rocks!

395
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,317
- Give me one.
- Come on!

396
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,735
-Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it!
-Fire! Fire!

397
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,780
-Give me another one.
-Kill it! Bastard!

398
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,949
- Kill it! Go, go, go, go!
- Kill it now!

399
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,201
Get, get, get...
Come on, kill the bastard!

400
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:38,286
It's not working!

401
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,121
-Hit him again.
-Kill him!

402
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:42,164
- Keep going! Come on!
- Get, get, get...

403
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,292
-Come on, kill it!
-Come on! Go, go, go!

404
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,984
Eleven, stop!

405
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:42,183
Goodbye, Mike.

406
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,204
No more.

407
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,676
El? El?

408
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,636
- El!
- Eleven!

409
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,722
- Eleven!
- El!

410
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:05,057
El, where are you?

411
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,185
Eleven!

412
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,520
El?

413
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,151
Oh, God.

414
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:19,238
He's not breathing,
he's not breathing.

415
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,741
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me,
listen to me, listen to me.

416
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:23,617
-I need you to tilt his head back...
-Okay.

417
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,619
-...and lift his chin.
-Okay.

418
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,204
One, two, three, four.

419
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,289
Now when I tell you,

420
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:32,168
you're gonna pinch his nostrils,
and breathe into his mouth...

421
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,170
-twice.
-Okay.

422
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,296
One second...

423
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:36,881
then pause.

424
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,632
22, 23.

425
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:39,759
-Then one second.
-Okay.

426
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:41,844
24, 25, 26, 27, 28...

427
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,805
29, 30.
Now! Go!

428
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:50,102
- Oh, come on, come on.
- Come on...

429
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,480
Come on, kid.

430
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:53,689
-Come on, kid!
-Will!

431
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:54,982
Will, listen to me.

432
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,318
It's me, it's your mom
and I love you so much.

433
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,527
I love you so much.

434
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:01,822
I love you more
than anything in the world.

435
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:03,824
Please...

436
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,160
--Blood pressure keeps dropping.

437
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,371
Her pulse ox is falling.

438
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:13,167
I love you so much. I love you more
than anything in the world.

439
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,003
Please,
please come back to me. Just...

440
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,255
-Come on, kid!
-Please, please wake up.

441
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,548
Please, please.

442
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,550
Breathe, Will, come on!

443
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,886
--Flatlining!

444
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,265
Come back to me, breathe.

445
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,267
I need you to wake up now.

446
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:31,685
I need you to breathe.

447
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:33,312
Please breathe!

448
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,148
Please!

449
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,318
That's it.

450
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:42,530
- Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.

451
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,116
That's it, baby. Breathe.

452
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,327
Breathe. All right. Come on.

453
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,787
Come on.

454
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,956
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

455
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,749
Good, good, good, good.

456
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,919
Just breathe, Will, breathe.

457
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:29,869
Michael?

458
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,122
Michael!

459
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,127
Michael?

460
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,341
Oh, my God.

461
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,885
Oh, my God.

462
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:48,012
You're okay.

463
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:50,723
You're okay.

464
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:29,762
Hey.

465
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,639
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey.

466
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,602
Where... where am I?

467
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,607
You're home.
You're home now.

468
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,484
You're safe.

469
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,194
Jonathan.

470
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,906
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

471
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,785
We missed you.

472
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,704
We really missed you.

473
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,248
Are you okay?

474
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,626
What, this?

475
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,837
It's just a cut.
It's nothing.

476
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:07,758
You're worried about my hand.

477
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:13,430
Oh, hey, uh...

478
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:15,140
We, uh...

479
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:17,434
We brought you some stuff...

480
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,104
so you don't get bored in here.

481
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:21,939
So...

482
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,986
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

483
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:30,489
There's some stuff on there
I think you really might like.

484
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,246
Guys. Guys, he's up.
Will is up. Guys, Will's up.

485
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,041
Guys, come on.

486
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,712
- Byers!

487
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,589
Be careful.
Be careful with him.

488
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,257
- Move.
- Guys, guys.

489
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,092
--Go easy on him.

490
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,678
You won't believe what happened
when you were gone, man.

491
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:36,388
- It was mental.
- You had a funeral.

492
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:38,307
-Jennifer Hayes was crying.
-And Troy peed himself.

493
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,059
-What?
-In front of the whole school!

494
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:41,185
- Yes!

495
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,649
You okay?

496
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:49,735
It got me.

497
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:51,904
The Demogorgon.

498
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:53,447
We know.

499
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,531
It's okay.

500
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:55,991
It's dead.

501
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:57,201
We made a new friend.

502
00:42:57,284 --> 00:43:00,245
She stopped it.
She saved us.

503
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,206
But she's gone now.

504
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:05,876
-Her name's Eleven.
-Like the number?

505
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,211
Well, we call her "El" for short.

506
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:08,378
She's basically a wizard.

507
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:09,630
She has superpowers.

508
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:10,714
More like a Yoda.

509
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:12,341
She flipped a van with her mind,

510
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:13,592
and these agents
were trying to shoot us--

511
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,677
-Yeah, it flipped over us--
-Then she squeezed the brains out...

512
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:17,805
And blood was pouring out
of their faces.

513
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:19,223
It was pouring out of their eyes.

514
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,724
Agents just started
grabbing us and stuff...

515
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:22,768
- ...shot out of the wall...

516
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:51,106
Something is coming.
Something angry.

517
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,441
Hungry for your blood.

518
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:54,359
It is almost here.

519
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:56,528
-What is it?
-It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

520
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:57,696
It's not the thessalhydra.

521
00:44:57,779 --> 00:44:59,323
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

522
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:00,866
--The thessalhydra!

523
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,534
- Damn it.
- It roars in anger!

524
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:04,328
-Will, your action!
-What should I do? I--

525
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,121
Fireball him!

526
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,292
Fireball the son of a bitch.

527
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:16,006
- Fourteen!

528
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:18,926
Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball
hits the thessalhydra.

529
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:21,011
It makes a painful...

530
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:24,056
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

531
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:27,517
Its clawed hand reaches for you
one last time

532
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:29,186
and, and, and...

533
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:30,687
and...

534
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:39,196
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

535
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:41,281
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

536
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:43,575
You carry the heads out of the dungeon,
victorious,

537
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,243
and you present them to King Tristan.

538
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:46,703
He thanks you
for your bravery and service.

539
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:49,748
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not it, is it?

540
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,124
No, there's a medal ceremony--

541
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,377
Oh, a medal ceremony?
What are you talking about?

542
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,420
-And--
-The campaign was way too short.

543
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:57,047
-Yeah!
-It was ten hours!

544
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,131
But it doesn't make any sense.

545
00:45:58,215 --> 00:46:00,676
-It makes sense.
-Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

546
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,219
And the proud princess?

547
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:03,637
And those weird flowers in the cave?

548
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,721
- I don't know, it's--

549
00:46:06,056 --> 00:46:07,140
Jeez, what's that smell?

550
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:08,892
Have you guys been playing games all day,
or just farting?

551
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:10,435
Oh, that's just Dustin.

552
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:11,687
He farted.

553
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,105
- Dustin farted.
- Okay.

554
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,439
- Dustin farted.
- Very mature, Lucas.

555
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:15,565
--Oh.

556
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,109
- Will.
- Shut up.

557
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,235
- Come on.
- Dustin farted!

558
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,320
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Will.

559
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:22,948
See you, Will.

560
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,367
- Stop.
- No, you stop.

561
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,703
- No, you stop.

562
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:31,665
Yeah, scream!
You're like a little girl.

563
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,636
-So, you have fun?
-Yeah.

564
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,762
Hey, boys.

565
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:46,847
-Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
-Hi.

566
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,932
Hey, wish your mom
a merry Christmas for me, okay?

567
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:50,851
-Yeah.
-Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas.

568
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:52,269
Merry Christmas.

569
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:54,938
-So, uh, you win?
-Yeah.

570
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:57,691
-Awesome.
-Hey, Jonathan, wait up.

571
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:03,905
-Uh...
-Merry Christmas.

572
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,657
Thanks, um...

573
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,160
I... I didn't get you anything.

574
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:10,162
-I... I feel bad.
-No.

575
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:14,166
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

576
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:18,378
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

577
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,055
Merry Christmas.

578
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:30,974
- You ready? Let's go.
- Yeah.

579
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,314
All right. Buckle up.

580
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:43,653
Can I open it?

581
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:46,198
Yeah, sure.

582
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,285
Whoa.

583
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,369
Pretty cool.

584
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:54,748
Yeah.

585
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:58,043
Yeah, pretty cool.

586
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:14,267
Did you give it to him?

587
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:16,394
Yeah.

588
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,968
You leaving already, Chief?

589
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:51,346
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted
to come to this thing? I was just hungry.

590
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,764
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

591
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:55,851
Well, your wife doesn't have time
to cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

592
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,688
Merry Christmas, Hop.

593
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,315
- Mmm.

594
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:12,802
- What you got there?

595
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:13,929
That one of yours?

596
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:16,014
- Yeah.
- Looks pretty big.

597
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:20,685
Be careful.
You'll break it.

598
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,901
What are you...
What are you doing?

599
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,402
Documenting.

600
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:30,862
Oh, why?

601
00:50:30,946 --> 00:50:32,322
- Because...

602
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:35,575
-It looks great.
-Oh, this is just so overcooked.

603
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:38,203
-And look, the potatoes are runny.
-Mom.

604
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:41,623
- They're so runny.
- Mom, it's gonna be great.

605
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,209
-It's definitely an Atari.
-An a-what-i?

606
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,585
The green present.
It's an Atari.

607
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:48,296
I felt Dustin's today,
it's the same exact weight.

608
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:51,258
- Really? Well...
- Yeah.

609
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:53,009
We'll have to see, won't we?

610
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:56,638
Hey, no more snooping.

611
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,890
No, I forgot to wash my hands.
I'll be right back.

612
00:50:58,974 --> 00:51:00,183
Okay.

613
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:03,311
- He's washing his hands?

614
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,353
- Thanks.

615
00:51:48,648 --> 00:51:49,733
Are you okay?

616
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,652
Yeah, I'm okay.

617
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:54,446
Mmm. Very good, Mom.

618
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,658
Mmm. Hey, Mom.
Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?

619
00:51:58,742 --> 00:51:59,909
-Oh, yeah.
-No. What game?

620
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:02,287
- I threw a fireball at him and...
- dead.

621
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,664
Wait, what is...
You mean, this is...

622
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,249
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

623
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:08,084
-Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
-It's fun.
