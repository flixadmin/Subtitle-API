1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,752
Come in close.

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,354
Closer.

3
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,232
Because the more you think you see,

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,755
the easier it'll be to fool you.

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,277
Because what is seeing?

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,394
You're looking, but what you're really doing
is filtering, interpreting,

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,437
searching for meaning.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,669
My job?

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,754
To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,711
and use it against you.

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,076
I'm going to flip through this deck.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,639
And I want you to see one card.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,159
Not this one. That's too obvious.

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,880
Pay close attention.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,760
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,035
Are you ready?

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,110
Okay.

18
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,958
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,031
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,958
Now, do you see your card here?

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,556
No.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,836
That's because you're looking too closely.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,957
And what have I been telling you all night?

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,519
The closer you look...

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,159
The less you see.

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,795
Now look into my eyes.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,037
And sleep. Okay.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,555
And...

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,314
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,352
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,074
If you can say your name, you can have it.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,629
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,109
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,713
- of your hubby's brain.
- No, no, no.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,955
I'm picturing...

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,031
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,231
Beach. Cocktails.

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,869
Florida?

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,439
Look, it was a business trip.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,631
I mean, it is a kind of business.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,599
Maybe the oldest business.

42
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,915
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

43
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,553
She can't move, Mack.

44
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,039
You're thinking of a woman's name.

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,594
A, B, C,

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,909
D, E, F, G,

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,115
H, I, J...

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,038
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,350
Who's Janet?

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,189
You know Janet?

51
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,549
It's not your best friend, is it?

52
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,558
- Your sister?
- No, please.

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,870
Her sister? My God.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,037
You weren't away on business.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,838
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,234
Your wife's sister!

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,918
Okay, we need to move over here,

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,514
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

59
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,830
You want this to go away?

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,558
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

61
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,599
Come on, get it out.

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,954
Do you shake down everybody like this?

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,832
No, only the special few.

64
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,991
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,151
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,230
You're a stick-up artist.

67
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,993
Yeah. Of course.

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,559
Okay, and sleep!

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,994
Now, when I snap my fingers,

70
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,559
you won't remember any of this.

71
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,835
And you, Warren Beatty,

72
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,913
every time you see or even think of Janet,

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,715
you're gonna picture me naked.

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,915
And that's not a pretty sight.

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,030
Yeah.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,270
And... You're wide awake!

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,874
Well, we did the best we could,

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,110
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,476
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

80
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,273
- No, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,635
Look after her.

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,438
Just have to hit an ATM first.

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,195
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

84
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,430
and I will give $100

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,830
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

86
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,550
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

87
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,074
Check it out.

88
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,835
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

89
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,396
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

90
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,995
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

91
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,593
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

92
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,911
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,115
I've got other tricks.

94
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,430
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,590
You said you would.

96
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,909
Nice wallet.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,229
You have a very good eye, sir.

98
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,310
Thanks.

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,800
Wallet.

100
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,190
My wallet. My watch!

101
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,950
Stop that guy!

102
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,155
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,230
He's got my wallet!

104
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,034
Okay, Los Angeles,

105
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,793
are we ready to end this thing?

106
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,870
Yeah!

107
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,997
When that timer hits zero,

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,790
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,791
will fall from above.

110
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,599
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

111
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,554
One, two, three!

112
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,190
Yeah!

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,233
Help! Stop it!

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,912
She's serious! She can't get out!

115
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,519
Go get some help!

116
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,389
Help, dude!

117
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,230
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

118
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,277
Come on! This is bullshit!

119
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,597
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

120
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,275
Yes!

121
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,639
I am your biggest fan.

122
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,671
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

123
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,989
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,673
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

125
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,319
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

126
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,879
How did you do that...

127
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,280
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,919
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,395
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

130
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,550
How much?

131
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,630
50 bucks.

132
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,797
- But it's so hard.
- Thank you.

133
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,990
Is it always a seven?

134
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,673
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

135
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,637
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

136
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,150
I'll see what I can do.

137
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,113
Magic man!

138
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,879
I love your shampoo.

139
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,429
- Hold up.
- What?

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,875
You need to leave.

141
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,950
Are you kidding me?

142
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,151
My God, this is so embarrassing.

143
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,390
Is this what you do?

144
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,437
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

145
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,756
"45 East Evan Street."

146
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,319
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

147
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,919
You don't have my number.

148
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,157
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

149
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,753
You are such an asshole.

150
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,355
Hey!

151
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,515
Henley.

152
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,917
Danny? Hey.

153
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,789
You got a card?

154
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,990
No, no, no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

155
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,070
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,474
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

157
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,755
You wait out here. I will come back

158
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,910
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,752
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

160
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,360
Nice hair.

161
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,158
So, actually, what have you been up to?

162
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,356
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

163
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,193
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

164
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,509
You have a website. That's good.

165
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,352
Good for you. Get the word out.

166
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,314
Okay.

167
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,552
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

168
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,274
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,510
Yeah. Excuse me.

170
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,398
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

171
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,074
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

172
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,759
Helen? No, no.

173
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,274
Henley.

174
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,589
It's on your coffee cup.

175
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,473
Thanks for keeping me honest.

176
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,073
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,270
It was just an observation.

178
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,956
Second observation, you are beautiful.

179
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,151
Thank you.

180
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,949
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

181
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,316
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,198
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

183
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,276
I'm not interested in you doing

184
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,509
your mentalism thing on us.

185
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,274
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

186
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,113
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

187
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,429
I'm sorry, have we met before?

188
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,954
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

189
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,110
You are a control freak.

190
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,271
Well, I take that as a compliment.

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,759
Only he would take it as a compliment.

192
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,831
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

193
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,276
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

194
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,475
A couple? No, no.

195
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,755
We were never a couple.

196
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,638
He used to saw me in half.

197
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,755
She was a very good assistant.

198
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,875
But I was too fat for Danny.

199
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,793
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

200
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,871
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

201
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,473
No one could fit through there. No one.

202
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,709
Rebecca fit through.

203
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,473
Rebecca fit for years.

204
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,233
Do you know how hard it is to stay

205
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,192
in those tiny little costumes?

206
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,232
No. I'm the main attraction.

207
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,477
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

208
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,474
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

209
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,994
That's a really nice story.

210
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,753
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,149
No way.

212
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,913
J. Daniel Atlas?

213
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,634
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

214
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,994
You're like...

215
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,309
I idolize you. Seriously.

216
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,913
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,513
I'm Jack, by the way.

218
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,999
Question. Did you get one of these?

219
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,916
Yeah. Death.

220
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,949
The High Priestess.

221
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,315
I'm the Lover.

222
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,515
Three minutes.

223
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,590
Hermit.

224
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

225
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,074
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

226
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,674
No, nothing's ever locked.

227
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,158
What is this place?

228
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,118
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

229
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,950
Man, it's freezing in here.

230
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,675
What's that?

231
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,075
I don't know.

232
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,350
What's it say?

233
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,159
"Now you don't."

234
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,271
"A rose by any other name..."

235
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,396
Guys, what's happening?

236
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,593
Look at that.

237
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,435
It's gas!

238
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,751
Relax. Just dry ice.

239
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,550
Cool.

240
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,999
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

241
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,832
Hang on. Hang on.

242
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,829
I got nothin'.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,752
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

244
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,951
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

245
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,599
Okay, so you're like Buddha,

246
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,114
if he wasn't so enlightened.

247
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,554
And you're like Jesus,

248
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,200
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

249
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,554
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.

250
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,472
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

251
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,675
No. Wait, did you?

252
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,114
I wish.

253
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,876
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

254
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,029
Great.

255
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,152
Electricity is out.

256
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,798
Well, let's check.

257
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,119
Blueprints.

258
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,319
They're incredible.

259
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,114
Who do you think did this?

260
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,430
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

261
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,959
It's a show.

262
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,234
Merritt McKinney,

263
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,314
Daniel Atlas,

264
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,949
Henley Reeves,

265
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,638
Jack Wilder.

266
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,354
Arthur Tressler
and the MGM Grand proudly presents

267
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,191
The Four Horsemen.

268
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,074
Thank you.

269
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,310
Tonight we would like to try something

270
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,954
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

271
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,553
For our final trick,

272
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,597
we're gonna do something never before

273
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,671
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

274
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,030
Or any stage for that matter.

275
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,672
Ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,710
tonight

277
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,756
we are going to rob a bank.

278
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,476
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

279
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,875
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

280
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,590
One, two, three!

281
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,191
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

282
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,549
during the performance.

283
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,631
Yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

284
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,790
Let me just put this away.

285
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,200
Actually, I need to take that.

286
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,715
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

287
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,794
Okay.

288
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,638
Okay, okay.

289
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,712
Now, please, please, settle down.

290
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,313
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

291
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,551
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

292
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,433
So we'll choose one at random then.

293
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,720
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

294
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,950
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,720
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

296
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,791
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,479
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

298
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,709
Where is Section B?

299
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,869
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

300
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,720
I don't know why everybody's happy.

301
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,835
It's only them.

302
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,713
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

303
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,670
Thank you, Merritt.

304
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,558
We are looking at row number 5.

305
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,755
Where is that?

306
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,673
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

307
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,119
Lucky number 13.

308
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,873
B-5-13. Where are you?

309
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,830
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

310
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,078
Could you just confirm for me that this

311
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,197
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

312
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,270
Yes.

313
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,351
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

314
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,794
your name and the name of your bank?

315
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,196
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

316
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,791
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

317
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,149
French. Okay.

318
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,913
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

319
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,276
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

320
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,397
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

321
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,709
Could you please come up to the stage

322
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,029
and we'll rob your bank.

323
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,276
And while he does that...

324
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,634
There is someone here tonight

325
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,472
without whom we would just be

326
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,551
four magicians working the circuit,

327
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,630
trying to get...

328
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,239
Well, actually, trying to get here.

329
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,595
You probably know this man,

330
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,193
if not from one of the many, many

331
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,549
companies he puts his name on.

332
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,756
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

333
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,160
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

334
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,311
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

335
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,390
The only man here with

336
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,630
the Queen's cell phone number.

337
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,151
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

338
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,436
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

339
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,875
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,070
the biggest name in magic.

341
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,594
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

342
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,671
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

343
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,831
we made sure we put your name on top.

344
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,071
If you turn out to be as good

345
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,998
as you think you are, dear girl,

346
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,271
that won't be necessary much longer.

347
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,749
We haven't done our closer yet.

348
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,035
Why don't you watch it

349
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,440
and then you can decide for yourself.

350
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,989
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

351
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,434
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

352
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,557
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

353
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,031
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

354
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,870
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

355
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,111
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

356
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,115
to literally fold through space and time

357
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,556
to your bank in the...

358
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,755
8th?

359
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,871
- 9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

360
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,872
Now, once you are there,

361
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,031
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

362
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,872
Now if...

363
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,832
My God, that's beautiful.

364
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,150
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

365
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,989
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

366
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,715
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

367
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,393
- Thank you. Thank you...
- It is.

368
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,074
Thank you. Thank you very much.

369
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,794
But before you go anywhere,

370
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,911
could you please, pick a card, any card.

371
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,235
Not that card.

372
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,751
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

373
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,394
Okay. This one?

374
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,591
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

375
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,277
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

376
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,829
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

377
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,674
- That's good.
- Thanks.

378
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,915
Put it in your pocket.

379
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,669
And now for one tiny detail.

380
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,671
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

381
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,110
And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance.

382
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,953
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

383
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,276
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

384
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,835
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

385
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,030
One,

386
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,190
two...

387
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,350
Three.

388
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,789
What the fuck?

389
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,638
- Etienne?
- Etienne?

390
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,757
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

391
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,114
Etienne?

392
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,471
I liked that little French guy.

393
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,715
Where did he go?

394
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,239
Wait, there he is.

395
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,557
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

396
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,480
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

397
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,829
Etienne? Are you okay?

398
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,990
Yes.

399
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,469
Perfect. What do you see in there?

400
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,510
Money.

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,115
Is this real?

402
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,714
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

403
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,513
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

404
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,557
I want you to take the card that you signed

405
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,869
out of your pocket.

406
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,430
And I want you to take the ticket stub

407
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,555
from tonight's show

408
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,795
and I want you to put it right there

409
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,951
in the middle of the money.

410
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,189
Now drop it.

411
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,471
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

412
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,880
Don't press it just yet.

413
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,712
That button activates an air duct

414
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,553
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

415
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,040
Okay, good. Now you can press it.

416
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,390
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

417
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,834
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

418
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,274
Wait a second.

419
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,276
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

420
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,509
We are The Four Horsemen.

421
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,715
And good night!

422
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,393
Good night!

423
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,955
Hold up here.

424
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,913
Dylan Rhodes.

425
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,550
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

426
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,074
Did you say magicians?

427
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,071
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

428
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,355
Where are you now?

429
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,471
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

430
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,591
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

431
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,034
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

432
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,158
Let's go. Get 'em up.

433
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,634
Put the book down.

434
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,592
Okay. You got me.

435
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,193
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- My!

436
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,433
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

437
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,035
Let's go.

438
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,837
Boss, please tell me this is a joke.

439
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,958
I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.

440
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,758
I'm a month, two tops,

441
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,319
away from blowing this whole thing open.

442
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,435
Get Turkelson.

443
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,635
He's in Atlantic City.

444
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,949
What about Cowan? Look at him.

445
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,474
He's just sitting there on his ass.

446
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,755
Hilarious, Rhodes.

447
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,355
I love you.

448
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,715
Asshole.

449
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,479
I don't have time for this magic crap.

450
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,120
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

451
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,349
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

452
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,953
Actually, 3.2.

453
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,590
Who is she?

454
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,590
Who are you?

455
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,358
Alma Dray from Interpol.

456
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,999
I'll be working the investigation with you.

457
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,275
You gotta be kidding me.

458
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,919
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

459
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,155
David Copperfield and Friends.

460
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,471
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

461
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,790
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

462
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,838
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

463
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,480
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

464
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,074
You did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

465
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,318
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

466
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,913
Besides, he's useless.

467
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,793
Really? Why is that?

468
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,156
Because he believes their magic was real.

469
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,913
He believes the magic was real?

470
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,434
You're right, he probably is useless.

471
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,876
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

472
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,519
Thank you.

473
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,312
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

474
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,789
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

475
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,315
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

476
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
- I did.
- Fine. Fantastic. You did.

477
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,600
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

478
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,069
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

479
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,312
With the teleportation helmet.

480
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,433
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

481
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,397
He was hypnotized during the show.

482
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,312
I told you, he's useless.

483
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,515
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done

484
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,159
with this other bullshit.

485
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,676
Hey!

486
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,433
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

487
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,794
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

488
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,196
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

489
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,750
Okay. Hey, hey. Écoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

490
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,114
You're not in the Philharmonic.

491
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,589
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

492
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,755
Tell him to stop.

493
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,073
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

494
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,232
Okay, I need a time-out.

495
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,833
Too many French people in one room.

496
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,473
Agent Rhodes!

497
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,234
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

498
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,398
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

499
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,039
So we can work together,

500
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,117
or you can continue to follow behind

501
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,356
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

502
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,629
It's up to you.

503
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,879
I'm not finished.

504
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,755
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

505
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,190
And I do not handle jet lag well.

506
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,709
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

507
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,911
I promise you, you will lose.

508
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,636
Fine. So which one of these idiots

509
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,119
do you want to talk to first?

510
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,235
Him?

511
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,915
Dylan, for the record,

512
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,116
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

513
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,270
Okay.

514
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,680
That is to say, that it's not a science.

515
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,069
It's more for entertainment.

516
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,429
All right.

517
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,876
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

518
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,673
Please convey my deepest apologies

519
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,552
to your colleague out there.

520
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,029
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

521
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,269
I was out of line.

522
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,589
Tranny Tuesday?

523
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,353
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

524
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,198
Or might not have, if you believe

525
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,755
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

526
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,434
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI

527
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,397
of men wearing dresses?

528
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,829
No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.

529
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,513
I'm just having fun.

530
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,910
Was this your card? No.

531
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,320
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

532
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,390
and I respect that.

533
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,357
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

534
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,475
but I understand protocol.

535
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,880
Okay, okay.

536
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,554
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

537
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,234
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

538
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,310
Yes. That would be...

539
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,913
What do the kids call it these days?

540
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,155
Yes, that's right. Magic.

541
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,231
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

542
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,914
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

543
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,877
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

544
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,072
It says here you are a mentalist.

545
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,314
What exactly is mentalism?

546
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,358
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

547
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,434
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

548
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,831
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

549
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,193
Voices in my head.

550
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,432
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

551
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,511
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

552
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,114
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

553
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,191
- two TV specials.
- Glory days.

554
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,870
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

555
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,280
Did your research, did you?

556
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,192
IRS audit. Back taxes.

557
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,032
You've had a long hard slog back

558
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,509
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

559
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,276
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

560
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,437
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

561
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,709
put on the magical helmet...

562
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,790
Listen to me.

563
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,480
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

564
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,675
Which makes you an accomplice.

565
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,149
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

566
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,315
Now you listen to me, unless you think

567
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,799
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

568
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,359
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

569
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,589
then we have a show to perform.

570
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,835
And you, Agent Rhodes,

571
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,274
have a drawing board to get back to.

572
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,794
Is this your first date?

573
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,029
What?

574
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,909
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

575
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,470
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

576
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,392
And before you get involved,

577
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,996
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

578
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,793
And I know the first one is that

579
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,998
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

580
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,879
You should have said something to him.

581
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,110
This is a weird way for you to find out.

582
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,032
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

583
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,515
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

584
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,034
Because if you did, it means that you,

585
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,191
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

586
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,756
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

587
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,478
The press would have a field day.

588
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,478
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

589
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,789
And you guys would look like idiots

590
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,200
even more then you already are.

591
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,750
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

592
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,513
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

593
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,034
"nothing up your sleeve."

594
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,270
And you know it.

595
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,431
Don't draw him in and then dump him

596
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,991
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

597
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,669
Mommy?

598
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,589
Daddy.

599
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,354
You have big daddy issues.

600
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,999
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

601
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,357
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

602
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,756
Me? I'll take a tenner.

603
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,398
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

604
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,391
I'll still take a tenner.

605
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,677
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

606
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,871
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

607
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,514
And you know who put them there?

608
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,511
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

609
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,559
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

610
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,473
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

611
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,676
And the instant that you even show

612
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,434
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

613
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,840
I'll be there.

614
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,479
I will be all over you like...

615
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,755
Like white on rice?

616
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,519
Sorry. That's unfair.

617
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,710
Let me warn you.

618
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,915
I want you to follow.

619
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,440
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

620
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,073
we will always be one step, three steps,

621
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,195
seven steps ahead of you.

622
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,509
And just when you think you're catching up,

623
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,954
that's when we'll be right behind you.

624
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,519
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

625
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,670
exactly where I want you to be.

626
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,398
So come close. Get all over me

627
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,800
because the closer you think you are,

628
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,279
the less you'll actually see.

629
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,350
I'm gonna nail you...

630
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,155
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

631
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,669
Shit!

632
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,793
First rule of magic.

633
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,876
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

634
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,837
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

635
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,117
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

636
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,237
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

637
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,072
- What changed?
- I met them.

638
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,150
Hey. Guys.

639
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,949
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

640
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,155
Most of it was just filler.

641
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,913
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

642
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,798
But guess who was sitting there in the back,

643
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,029
filming the whole damn thing?

644
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,150
I don't know.

645
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,719
Thaddeus Bradley.

646
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,390
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

647
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,510
No.

648
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,910
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

649
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,832
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

650
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,990
Get him on the phone.

651
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,753
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

652
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,875
Good.

653
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,714
Mr. Bradley started as a magician.

654
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,518
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

655
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,956
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

656
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,199
"The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion."

657
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,669
That's a man who loves his work.

658
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,958
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

659
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,873
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

660
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,469
I will take one.

661
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,600
That's incredible. That's amazing.

662
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,349
Red dye, palmed.

663
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,120
Is that how Jesus did it? That's incredible.

664
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,554
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

665
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,916
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

666
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,234
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

667
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,879
in the last half decade?

668
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,234
About 1.6 million.

669
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,631
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

670
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,040
Five million.

671
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,155
Right, so it's about the money.

672
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,719
Well, the money is only there

673
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,077
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

674
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,438
Like you, I detest those
who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

675
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,195
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

676
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,795
Cost?

677
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,154
I don't know. Careers.

678
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,355
Lives.

679
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,671
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

680
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,952
I'm sorry, who?

681
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,553
Lionel Shrike.

682
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,998
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

683
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,835
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

684
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,390
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

685
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,914
He was shackled inside a safe,

686
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,798
and dropped into the river.

687
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,029
But he never resurfaced.

688
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,350
You mean he died?

689
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,238
I didn't kill him.

690
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,553
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

691
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,870
You do realize this is a game?

692
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,758
Believe me, it's not a game.

693
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,989
It is a game.

694
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,832
You're the game. You're being played.

695
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,356
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

696
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,192
I mean, come on.

697
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,270
You got me.

698
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,634
If you really want to know

699
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,509
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

700
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,557
my special comes out next month.

701
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,755
Or I could just bring you in

702
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,309
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

703
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,913
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

704
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,118
you actually don't know how they did it.

705
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,270
Showmanship and theatrics.

706
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,596
When a magician waves his hand and says,

707
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,313
"This is where the magic is happening."

708
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,995
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

709
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,438
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

710
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,916
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

711
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,633
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

712
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,474
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

713
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,989
But don't take my word for it.

714
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,153
How about a trip to Paris?

715
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,758
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

716
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,600
You're joking, right?

717
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,030
You wanna know how they did it or not?

718
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,434
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

719
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,474
Step right up.

720
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,433
There you go.

721
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,750
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

722
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,713
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

723
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,950
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

724
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,111
just say the magic word.

725
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,589
Blow me?

726
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,352
- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.

727
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,518
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

728
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,117
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

729
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,072
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

730
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,675
My fun.

731
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,274
What?

732
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,714
Nothing.

733
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,629
So they got a vault set.

734
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,790
Yes.

735
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,995
And it's the exact replica

736
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,230
of the little French guy's bank.

737
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,355
So he's a plant.

738
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,919
He was a dupe, not a plant.

739
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,150
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

740
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,830
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

741
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,393
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

742
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,551
They let them think they picked the seat.

743
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,034
We'll choose one at random then.

744
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,392
Actually, they were just palming the ball

745
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,193
with the seat number they wanted.

746
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,512
We are looking at row number 5.

747
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,000
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

748
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,510
Lucky number 13.

749
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,637
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

750
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,313
He was selected.

751
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,077
They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.

752
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,349
Viva Las Vegas.

753
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,478
And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.

754
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,909
They trailed him.

755
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,155
They studied him.

756
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,992
Nothing was left to chance.

757
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,270
I got his measurements.

758
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,715
He had no idea he was their target.

759
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,996
And they simply activated him in Vegas.

760
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,355
When I snap my fingers...

761
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,029
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

762
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,230
But how did they know what bank was his?

763
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,715
- You're kidding.
- Really?

764
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,434
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

765
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,550
Yes.

766
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,310
Like this.

767
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,797
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

768
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,396
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

769
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,390
You ready?

770
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,790
Yes.

771
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,119
Credit card.

772
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,313
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

773
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,357
they left in the vault in Paris.

774
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,430
Very good.

775
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,159
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

776
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,273
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

777
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,913
You said they didn't steal the money.

778
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,639
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

779
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,194
I said they didn't rob the bank.

780
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,317
My guess is that they targeted

781
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,073
a shipment of freshly minted money

782
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,074
headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.

783
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,273
Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.

784
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,034
Unless you're already inside.

785
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,638
And despite what the banks
would have you believe,

786
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,553
the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.

787
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,839
For our Horsemen,

788
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,150
it was almost too easy.

789
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,629
Hey, boys.

790
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,595
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

791
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,434
Flash paper.

792
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,876
Magicians use it all the time.

793
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,879
Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.

794
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,595
Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,

795
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,360
but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.

796
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,909
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

797
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,753
Give your audience $3 million.

798
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,314
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

799
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,635
Best finale ever.

800
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,155
They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.

801
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,709
Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,

802
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,837
- put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Yes.

803
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,275
I always do. It's lawyer first,

804
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,397
- then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.

805
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,879
Yes. Then the children.

806
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,434
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

807
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,669
And what's that?

808
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,878
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

809
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,110
Unrequited and misguided,

810
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,999
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

811
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,754
Consequently, you're very tightly...

812
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,433
How should I put it?

813
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,950
Corked.

814
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,030
I am?

815
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,750
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

816
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,480
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

817
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,236
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

818
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,595
Wow. Thanks.

819
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,433
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

820
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,434
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

821
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,071
We should be getting there
a few minutes early.

822
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,230
So, sit back, relax.

823
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,072
We should be in the Big Easy soon.

824
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,878
Appreciate you flying with us today.

825
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,395
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

826
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,550
Ego.

827
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,992
Okay, pick your card.

828
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,949
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

829
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,872
No, don't tell me.

830
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,758
- Okay.
- Okay.

831
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,239
Thaddeus was there that night.

832
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,755
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

833
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,513
What are you saying?

834
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,079
You think they could be working together.

835
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,594
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

836
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,114
were a bunch of street magicians

837
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,759
a year ago with no resources.

838
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,400
So, how do they go from doing that to this

839
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,914
without some kind of outside help?

840
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,434
Is this your card?

841
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,911
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

842
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,278
Nice shuffle.

843
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,509
You know, this is hard.

844
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,635
According to this book,

845
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,759
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

846
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,918
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

847
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,230
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

848
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,550
Or specifically those guys?

849
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,914
I could care less about magicians in general.

850
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,833
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

851
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,035
Exploit them how?

852
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,474
Try again.

853
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,511
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

854
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,353
Their need
to believe in something that's unexplainable

855
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,319
in order to make their lives more bearable.

856
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,193
I see it as a strength.

857
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,237
My life is happier when I believe that.

858
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,634
Is this your card?

859
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,915
Yeah.

860
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,830
Yeah?

861
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,473
- Yeah.
- Cool.

862
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,236
That smile on your face. Is it real?

863
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,549
Maybe.

864
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,429
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

865
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,954
Do you feel exploited?

866
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,271
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

867
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,789
Guy goes to the doctor.

868
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,915
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna

869
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,070
"have to stop masturbating."

870
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,150
He says, "Why?"

871
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,719
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

872
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,870
Danny, can I talk to you about

873
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,519
- my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

874
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,829
Hey, guys.

875
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,719
We got a show to prepare for.

876
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,155
Do we now?

877
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,275
No, no, no, don't do that.

878
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,509
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

879
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,914
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

880
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,593
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

881
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,079
I know all of your little tricks.

882
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,309
That what they are to you? Tricks?

883
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,118
Yes, it's gimmicks. It's Barnum statements.

884
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,918
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

885
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,638
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

886
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,472
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

887
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,756
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

888
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,319
No.

889
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,675
Do me.

890
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,159
Yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

891
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,230
Okay.

892
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,395
Even better.

893
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,470
- Art.
- Yeah.

894
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,352
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

895
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,475
when I want to be.

896
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,756
Just stay with me, okay?

897
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,271
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

898
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,437
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

899
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,431
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

900
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,431
A brutish breed. Like a real...

901
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,670
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

902
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,195
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

903
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,352
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

904
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,200
Sorry.

905
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,475
Wait, let me try one.

906
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,630
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

907
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,790
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

908
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,479
He can do way better than that.

909
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,550
Let's do family.

910
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,877
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

911
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,600
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

912
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,950
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

913
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,553
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

914
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,793
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

915
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,553
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

916
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,119
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

917
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,636
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

918
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,359
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

919
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,475
That was your childhood?

920
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,915
I certainly hope
tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

921
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,916
Don't worry. Just you wait.

922
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,312
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

923
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,515
What, are you kidding me?

924
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,159
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

925
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,151
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

926
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,595
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

927
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,437
Hey, hey! There you are.

928
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,114
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

929
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,230
while she's in New Orleans?

930
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,550
No. In fact, here, speaking French

931
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,313
is actually an asset.

932
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,913
Do you see that woman up there?

933
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,075
That's Marie Claire.

934
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,436
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

935
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,080
You're welcome.

936
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,714
Yeah.

937
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,438
We got a place.

938
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,597
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

939
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,079
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

940
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,232
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

941
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,154
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

942
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,120
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

943
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,792
This other guy, Maximillian...

944
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,958
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

945
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,869
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

946
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,871
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

947
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,156
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

948
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,039
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

949
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,316
This what? This magic?

950
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,080
Lionel Shrike.

951
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,836
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

952
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,912
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

953
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,519
They saw the tree in half.

954
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,671
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

955
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,592
is the card with the signature.

956
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,795
How did he do that?

957
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,231
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

958
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,914
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

959
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,559
No, but I do have some good news.

960
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,757
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

961
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,592
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

962
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,954
What tracking bracelets?

963
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,269
He has every member of his crew

964
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,953
wearing a tracking bracelet.

965
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,111
Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.

966
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,395
So as long as Atlas is tracking them...

967
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,550
Next.

968
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,710
our boys can track Atlas

969
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,199
from right here in the mobile command unit.

970
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,277
Okay, call me if you get any movement.

971
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,680
Copy that.

972
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,835
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

973
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,830
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

974
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,834
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

975
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,878
And I watch the people make a wish

976
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,071
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

977
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,834
Then throw the key into the Seine.

978
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,231
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

979
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,477
Watching the key sink into the water

980
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,791
and their secret is locked away forever.

981
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,992
Real and, at the same time, magical.

982
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,355
So,

983
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,875
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

984
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,589
Yeah.

985
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,951
There is a legend of a secret order

986
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,917
born in ancient Egypt called

987
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,680
"The Eye."

988
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,829
It is said they perfected sleight of hand

989
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,991
to steal food from the Pharaohs

990
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,878
and give it to the slaves.

991
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,475
Their purpose?

992
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,554
Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.

993
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,752
Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?

994
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,916
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

995
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,998
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

996
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,153
get the better of them?

997
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,079
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

998
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,231
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

999
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,630
which you don't, or you should leave.

1000
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,595
If I want something to cease or desist,

1001
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,909
it does.

1002
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,315
Take five.

1003
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,438
According to your potential backers,

1004
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,270
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

1005
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,953
from your best special.

1006
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,840
I have here a check

1007
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,829
for 3.5 million.

1008
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,110
To walk away?

1009
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,955
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

1010
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,794
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

1011
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,431
You're in this to ride them up.

1012
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,951
I'm in it to ride them down.

1013
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,272
I take it that we do not have a deal.

1014
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,112
And therein lies our conflict.

1015
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,789
Let me be blunt.

1016
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,677
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

1017
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,713
And my lawyers are much stronger.

1018
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,152
And they will manacle you

1019
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,232
with so many injunctions.

1020
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,710
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

1021
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,480
everything that you own drain away

1022
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,834
in front of your greedy little eyes.

1023
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,156
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

1024
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,039
And I'm still here.

1025
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,478
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

1026
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,757
And if you do anything
to sully my investment,

1027
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,229
the ride down, which you mentioned,

1028
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:38,554
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

1029
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,191
You shouldn't have done that.

1030
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,113
According to superstition,

1031
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,312
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

1032
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,871
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

1033
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,193
Isn't that funny?

1034
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,031
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

1035
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,030
Do me a favor.

1036
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:13,159
Visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience.

1037
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,315
Stay out of my head, you perv.

1038
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,075
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

1039
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,191
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

1040
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,157
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

1041
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,800
I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.

1042
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,474
What, so you can try to expose us later
on your little website?

1043
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,755
And on demand.

1044
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,832
- That's not gonna happen.
- No?

1045
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,912
Operating on a special plane
because of The Eye?

1046
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,436
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

1047
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,989
Make any magician's wish come true.

1048
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,514
You've come a long way,

1049
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,398
much further
than anyone would have expected

1050
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,511
of a bunch of wanna-bes and has-beens.

1051
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,753
If by "has-been" you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

1052
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,231
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

1053
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,470
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

1054
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,270
By all means.

1055
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,911
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

1056
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,953
He wants to be a great magician someday.

1057
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,792
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

1058
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,993
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

1059
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,630
feeding off of those
who have the talent that he never did.

1060
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,274
Tell me. Am I getting close?

1061
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,952
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

1062
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,473
Okay. Name a card.

1063
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,119
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

1064
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,429
Okay.

1065
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,712
- It's up your left sleeve.
- Is it?

1066
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,552
No. No, I don't see it up there.

1067
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,349
You know, why don't you check
your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

1068
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,190
Yeah.

1069
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,635
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by,
but this is kind of a talent only area, so...

1070
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,910
Break a leg.

1071
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,150
Hey, you break something, too.

1072
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,560
Ladies and gentlemen,

1073
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,313
the Savoy management welcomes you

1074
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,073
to tonight's special performance,

1075
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,913
The Four Horsemen, Act Two.

1076
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,037
Unlike traditional performances,

1077
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,316
The Four Horsemen encourage you to film,

1078
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,390
call your friends,

1079
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,552
upload, stream, and tweet the show freely.

1080
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,996
Thank you. The show
will begin in a few minutes.

1081
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,473
Nice watch.

1082
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,995
It's a family heirloom.

1083
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,919
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1084
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,559
- Who?
- Shrike.

1085
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,916
So, when he was 14,

1086
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,150
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1087
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,915
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1088
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,640
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1089
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,869
And?

1090
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,113
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1091
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,477
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

1092
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,119
and presto!

1093
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,958
The card is in the tree.

1094
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,917
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1095
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,479
The card was in the tree.

1096
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,554
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1097
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,553
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1098
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,631
It was to look so far

1099
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,519
that you see 20 years into the past.

1100
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,479
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1101
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,358
What are you suggesting?

1102
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,150
Arthur Tressler presents

1103
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,389
Jack Wilder,

1104
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,840
Henley Reeves,

1105
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,955
Merritt McKinney,

1106
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,713
and Daniel Atlas.

1107
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,757
The Four Horsemen.

1108
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,593
Thank you. Before we begin,

1109
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,717
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1110
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,269
A man and a woman to whom
we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

1111
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,192
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

1112
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:57,992
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

1113
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,039
Yeah, Agent Rhodes has personally vowed
to "nail us."

1114
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,591
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

1115
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,030
What is magic?

1116
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,634
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1117
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,719
So I want you to look.

1118
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,351
Look as closely as possible.

1119
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,478
Because the tricks you are about to see

1120
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,718
may not seem connected.

1121
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,711
But we assure you, they are.

1122
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,479
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1123
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,475
Or is it one giant illusion?

1124
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,112
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1125
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,356
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1126
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,716
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1127
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,914
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1128
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,350
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1129
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,279
and put her inside this mystery box.

1130
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,438
There are two pencils out there.

1131
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,749
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1132
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,319
- Here!
- Yeah!

1133
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,717
And now, you will say the magic word.

1134
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,029
Abracadabra.

1135
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,514
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

1136
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,193
for no reason. And then...

1137
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,669
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

1138
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,270
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

1139
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,509
you're about to.

1140
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,875
And sleep.

1141
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,793
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

1142
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,439
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1143
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,557
And now we are gonna debunk

1144
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,790
a few magic myths this evening.

1145
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,032
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1146
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,880
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1147
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,473
As has the mirror

1148
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,949
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1149
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,111
When you hear the word "freeze"

1150
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,556
you are all football players.

1151
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,554
And your job is to tackle,

1152
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,040
dismantle,

1153
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,389
crush,

1154
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,950
tear limb from limb,

1155
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,078
the quarterback.

1156
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,956
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1157
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,032
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1158
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,909
You will know who the quarterback is.

1159
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,311
He will be the one saying that word.

1160
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,595
Freeze.

1161
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,391
Three, two, one...

1162
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,717
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1163
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,234
Kill the quarterback!

1164
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,913
Get on back to your seats.

1165
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,276
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1166
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,358
I guess you have lost some weight.

1167
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,069
At the intermission,

1168
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,635
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1169
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,194
and seal it in an envelope.

1170
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,918
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

1171
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,115
Everyone take 'em out.

1172
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,039
Now, everybody,

1173
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,078
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1174
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,359
Shout 'em out.

1175
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,351
Clement? Frannick?

1176
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,597
- Yeah! Up here!
- Way up there.

1177
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,637
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1178
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,239
That's me!

1179
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,630
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1180
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,997
Josepha Hickey?

1181
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,070
That's me!

1182
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,073
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

1183
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,157
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1184
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,998
One, two, three, four, five...

1185
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,309
Stop.

1186
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,352
Is the first digit 5?

1187
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,396
Yes.

1188
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,834
Do it again. This time, faster.

1189
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,319
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1190
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,470
Stop.

1191
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,713
Six. Again.

1192
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,790
One, two...

1193
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,959
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1194
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,356
Yeah. That's what I got.

1195
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,639
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1196
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,835
Okay, Dina,

1197
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,795
1,

1198
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,435
4,

1199
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,150
7,

1200
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,713
- 7.
- Yeah.

1201
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,555
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1202
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,789
Clement.

1203
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,878
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1204
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,869
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1205
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,679
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1206
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,639
Focus on your number.

1207
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,952
This is... Dear. Just as I feared.

1208
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,276
This is strange.

1209
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,832
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1210
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,872
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1211
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,110
about what you think is in your account.

1212
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,599
Okay, you can sit down now.

1213
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,516
Yeah. I almost forgot.

1214
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,519
This evening would not be possible

1215
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,116
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1216
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,278
Big applause! Big applause!

1217
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,834
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

1218
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,069
for the finale?

1219
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,958
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1220
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,951
There he goes. Okay, good.

1221
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,075
Are we on red?

1222
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,197
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1223
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,759
All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

1224
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,989
There he goes.

1225
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,836
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1226
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,752
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1227
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,239
Now, Art, I took a guess.

1228
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,516
North of 140. Am I right?

1229
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,314
That's 140 million, by the way.

1230
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,910
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1231
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,031
How can he be right about his balance

1232
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,269
and everyone else be wrong?

1233
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,756
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

1234
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,076
Everybody, take out your paper.

1235
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,800
And using the flashlight under your seat,

1236
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,792
start to warm up that paper.

1237
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,112
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

1238
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,957
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1239
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,315
Yes.

1240
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,479
Look.

1241
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,640
What's going on there, Daniel?

1242
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,233
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

1243
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,235
$144,579,651.

1244
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,310
But now...

1245
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,832
Now it says $70,000 less.

1246
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,594
Josepha, can you stand up?

1247
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,750
Yes.

1248
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,638
Now, what is your new number?

1249
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,272
$70,562 now in my account.

1250
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,791
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

1251
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,991
the exact amount that Art's went down?

1252
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,634
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1253
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,075
Is it?

1254
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,830
Wow. It is.

1255
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,352
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1256
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,557
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1257
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,555
$281,477.

1258
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,073
We have a confession to make.

1259
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,271
She's right. We lied about something.

1260
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,033
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1261
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,549
All of you have one thing in common.

1262
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,997
Everyone in this room was a victim

1263
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,959
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1264
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,634
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1265
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,070
Your businesses.

1266
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,230
Your loved ones.

1267
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,557
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1268
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,597
Tressler Insurance.

1269
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,869
You were abandoned.

1270
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,030
You were loopholed...

1271
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,349
out of your settlements.

1272
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,360
This is all for show. Correct?

1273
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,954
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

1274
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,873
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1275
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,669
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1276
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,672
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1277
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,078
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

1278
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,870
Is this for real?

1279
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,229
I don't know.

1280
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,630
Is this happening?

1281
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,359
I don't know! I can't tell!

1282
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,236
Hey! Did you do this?

1283
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,675
How could we, Art?

1284
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,909
We don't have your password.

1285
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,560
We'd need access to information

1286
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,551
we could never get our hands on.

1287
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,717
Yes, security questions, for instance, like,

1288
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,479
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1289
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,079
or the name of your first pet.

1290
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,912
Where would we get that information, Art?

1291
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,078
You certainly would never tell us.

1292
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,956
We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.

1293
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,714
Do not let them get away.

1294
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,831
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

1295
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,120
You got hell to pay!

1296
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,110
Stop!

1297
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,638
Stop! Nobody move!

1298
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,670
Freeze!

1299
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,479
Quarterback!

1300
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,351
We are The Four Horsemen.

1301
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,910
Good night.

1302
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,514
Get 'em off me!

1303
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,873
Get off! Get off me!

1304
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,599
Get off me!

1305
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,196
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1306
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,877
- Quarterback!
- Quarterback!

1307
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,839
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

1308
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,519
and bring the tracker.

1309
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,989
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

1310
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,195
Give me the tracker.

1311
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,630
Let's go.

1312
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,074
FBI! Clear!

1313
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,949
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1314
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,030
What have you got?

1315
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,633
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1316
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,758
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1317
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,233
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1318
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,519
Hey! Move!

1319
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,920
Move! Move!

1320
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,318
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1321
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,277
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1322
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,351
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1323
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,473
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1324
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,871
Damn! Where are you?

1325
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,035
Excuse me.

1326
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,111
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

1327
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,555
Stop!

1328
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,914
What are you doing?

1329
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,476
He's going in Napoleon House.

1330
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,079
Move! Move!

1331
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,473
Move out of the way!

1332
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,190
Hey!

1333
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,030
Move!

1334
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,636
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1335
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,036
No! No! No!

1336
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,069
Freeze!

1337
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,194
Lower your weapons!

1338
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,550
What?

1339
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,791
I'm tracking myself!

1340
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,277
The Horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call

1341
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,998
the alphabet agencies,

1342
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,269
calling into question

1343
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,630
the efficacy of the FBI's task force

1344
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,479
as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,

1345
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,039
Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,

1346
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,758
who was publicly ridiculed,

1347
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,759
and even tackled at tonight's performance.

1348
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,349
Talk about a fumble.

1349
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,272
This is quickly becoming a national story,

1350
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,359
as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible

1351
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,876
for the second time in as many days.

1352
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,838
Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen

1353
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,314
seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...

1354
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,789
Hey.

1355
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,075
What are you doing?

1356
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,559
I'm having a drink.

1357
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,994
I came to get you.

1358
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,795
I'm worried about you.

1359
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,473
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1360
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,715
Atlas. You had him.

1361
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,074
He didn't have a weapon.

1362
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,639
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1363
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,593
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1364
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,989
Didn't you?

1365
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,233
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

1366
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,038
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

1367
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,235
Let go of my arm.

1368
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,993
Who exactly are you anyway?

1369
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,151
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1370
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,429
Not bad.

1371
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,350
What is this?

1372
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,834
What's the Eye of Horus?

1373
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,992
Certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1374
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,680
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1375
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,350
Find your way back yourself.

1376
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,512
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would like you
to join him for a drink.

1377
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,995
Sir.

1378
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,429
Thank you.

1379
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,036
What is your role with them?

1380
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,190
Role?

1381
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,118
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1382
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,998
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1383
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,873
If it makes you feel any better,

1384
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,195
this wasn't about you.

1385
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,750
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1386
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,080
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1387
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,670
Played out on a global scale.

1388
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,999
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1389
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,359
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

1390
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,713
I was a $140-million distraction?

1391
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,709
Yes.

1392
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,553
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1393
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,553
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1394
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,233
- You know...
- "I can destroy you."

1395
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,759
Yes, I do know.

1396
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,234
Well, you won't.

1397
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,950
And you won't destroy them.

1398
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,117
Whatever this grand trick is,

1399
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,193
it was designed a long time ago.

1400
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,957
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1401
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,351
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1402
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,474
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1403
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,717
Whatever you stand to make

1404
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,390
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1405
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,999
And destroy them.

1406
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,391
I stand to make five million.

1407
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,349
Am I flinching?

1408
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,073
No, you're not.

1409
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:29,995
Hey.

1410
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,590
I'm sorry for your arm.

1411
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,239
No. I'm sorry.

1412
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,596
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1413
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,154
I'm at a loss.

1414
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,473
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

1415
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,837
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1416
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,840
So what's this all about?

1417
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,234
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1418
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,674
The Eye are the keepers

1419
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,955
of real magic

1420
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,953
and the protectors of those who practice it.

1421
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,951
"Candidates for initiations

1422
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,192
"must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience."

1423
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,397
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

1424
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,393
May I?

1425
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:24,512
According to this,
they only take new people twice a century.

1426
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,991
So what? The Horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing?

1427
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,309
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1428
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:34,395
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

1429
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,790
They don't have to put on a show for that.

1430
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,393
It's probably just a myth.

1431
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,599
But it doesn't make any sense,
and I don't think logic will solve this for us.

1432
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,274
- You don't say?
- No.

1433
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,151
I believe
that some things are only discovered

1434
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:55,632
if you take certain leaps.

1435
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,758
- Well, I gotta get to...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1436
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,990
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

1437
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,878
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1438
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,836
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to assume
they were watching us, right?

1439
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,194
Shit.

1440
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,874
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

1441
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,952
Your fears are correct.
This is not and has never been your phone.

1442
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,716
It's a clone in every way, except for this.

1443
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,114
A bug.

1444
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:33,034
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

1445
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,475
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

1446
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,431
God damn it!

1447
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,598
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1448
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,433
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1449
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,350
Picture's up.

1450
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,592
Okay, fast forward.

1451
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,439
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1452
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,998
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1453
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,915
Play it through.

1454
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,350
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1455
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,598
There. That's where he took my phone.

1456
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,075
Is that thing transmitting?

1457
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,639
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

1458
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,796
Plus I removed the bug.

1459
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,439
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1460
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,478
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

1461
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,671
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1462
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,910
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1463
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,640
Find my real phone and track it.

1464
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,071
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1465
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,315
Good.

1466
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,393
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1467
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,595
They got power? Cut it.

1468
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,077
They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

1469
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,315
Squeeze 'em out.

1470
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,152
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1471
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,753
And get me an airplane!

1472
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,352
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

1473
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,396
They who?

1474
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,278
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

1475
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,629
Who are we working for?

1476
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,831
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1477
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,910
Stop being paranoid.

1478
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,230
It really does happen.

1479
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,033
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1480
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,719
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

1481
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,120
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1482
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,998
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

1483
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,275
wanting to be treated like an adult.

1484
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,509
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1485
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,796
Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

1486
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,075
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1487
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,236
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

1488
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,789
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1489
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,270
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1490
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,510
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1491
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,836
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1492
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,957
Hey, guys. They're here.

1493
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,791
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1494
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,200
- No.
- What?

1495
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,475
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1496
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,994
She's Interpol. She's with me.

1497
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,070
She stays.

1498
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,434
What? What?

1499
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,510
Stay in the car.

1500
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,995
Let's go.

1501
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,675
Okay. Let's do it.

1502
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,110
FBI!

1503
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,720
Ladies first.

1504
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,515
Don't move!

1505
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,994
Tell me.

1506
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,838
Is my money being well-spent?

1507
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,271
Exceedingly well.

1508
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,519
Now you tell me,

1509
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,993
how do you like your Horsemen?

1510
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,197
Fricasseed or fried?

1511
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,475
Shredded.

1512
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,039
I'll tell the chef.

1513
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,590
Freeze!

1514
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,790
Dylan!

1515
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,909
Hold on!

1516
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,275
You little...

1517
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,790
Come here!

1518
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,471
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1519
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,910
You little shit!

1520
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,230
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1521
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,597
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1522
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,717
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1523
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,391
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

1524
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,109
Hey!

1525
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,069
Come here!

1526
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,229
Come here!

1527
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,993
All right, hold on, hold on!

1528
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,752
- Really?
- Yup.

1529
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,950
You...

1530
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,239
You little...

1531
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,315
Shit!

1532
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,755
Shit!

1533
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,514
Give me that!

1534
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,477
All units, cover the north exit now!

1535
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,834
Clear on Evan.

1536
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,752
Block every possible exit.

1537
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,353
Hey! Get back. Shit.

1538
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,990
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1539
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,070
What?

1540
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,793
Stop! Stop!

1541
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,995
Hey!

1542
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,750
Good. Follow him!

1543
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,917
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

1544
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,320
I didn't have tactical command.

1545
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,789
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

1546
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,439
Promise me, next time, you will back me up.

1547
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,597
Could we have
this conversation later, please?

1548
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,239
No!

1549
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,596
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

1550
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,554
- Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

1551
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,313
I don't know. She just took some guy's car.

1552
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,834
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

1553
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:39,955
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

1554
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,514
Let's go.

1555
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,110
There he is!

1556
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:20,990
Move!

1557
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,435
Left!

1558
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,558
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

1559
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,472
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1560
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,597
- We're heading north on the FDR Drive.
- What?

1561
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,791
We're coming to you live above the FDR,

1562
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,793
where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,

1563
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,791
are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,

1564
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,109
following a black sedan.

1565
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,270
Fuller, where are you?

1566
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,358
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

1567
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,477
We're now trying to get you a better shot.

1568
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,030
Come on!

1569
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,955
It looks like they're turning

1570
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,156
onto the 59th Street Bridge.

1571
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,793
As soon as we have them within range,

1572
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,712
we will bring you those pictures live.

1573
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,429
Good. Just stay with him.

1574
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,029
Go, go, go!

1575
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,599
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1576
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,235
Get over!

1577
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,870
Shit!

1578
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,550
Come here!

1579
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,234
Get back! Get back!

1580
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,994
Dylan, let's go, man!

1581
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,230
Come on, you...

1582
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,757
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1583
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,239
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1584
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,231
Let's go! Leave him!

1585
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,394
- The paper!
- Dylan!

1586
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,551
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1587
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,993
Today, the unfolding story of a popular
and controversial group of magicians,

1588
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,111
who have been fast capturing
the public's imagination,

1589
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,511
took a dark turn when a police action
that began in Chinatown

1590
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,389
developed into a dramatic, high-speed
chase across the 59th Street Bridge,

1591
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,438
which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of Jack Wilder,

1592
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,830
one of the so-called Four Horsemen.

1593
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:28,113
The whereabouts of the other three
Horsemen remain unknown at this time.

1594
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,674
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

1595
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,034
So they know what it is?

1596
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,838
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1597
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:40,593
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1598
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,239
Let's go.

1599
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,594
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

1600
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,670
What's that?

1601
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,036
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1602
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,789
Rhodes.

1603
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,518
You do understand the function

1604
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,716
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1605
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,514
Yeah, she's there to distract them

1606
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,795
while he sets up the trick.

1607
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,230
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1608
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,392
While you're watching the magician,

1609
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,470
that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.

1610
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,838
Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you

1611
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,356
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1612
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,990
Why did she request to be put on the case?

1613
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,311
She was assigned to the case.

1614
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,599
Luck of the draw.

1615
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,278
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1616
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,990
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

1617
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,229
What's in it for you?

1618
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,232
Just trying to even the game.

1619
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,434
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1620
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,355
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1621
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,270
Hey.

1622
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,789
We got a problem.

1623
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,030
Here's the safe.

1624
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,554
No, no, no. Hey.

1625
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,954
What's he doing here?

1626
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,713
Giving us our first solid lead.

1627
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,677
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

1628
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,909
called Elkhorn

1629
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,957
- for the last five years.
- And?

1630
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,713
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1631
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,235
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1632
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,950
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1633
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,634
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1634
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,711
The magician who died on the bridge...

1635
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,270
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1636
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,631
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1637
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,797
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1638
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,109
How did they get the file?

1639
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,390
This is the part you're gonna find

1640
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,437
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1641
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,950
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1642
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,316
your mobile command center
in New Orleans

1643
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,993
with codes they got from your phone.

1644
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,992
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1645
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,994
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1646
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,594
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1647
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,910
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1648
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,237
Boss, he's taking over?

1649
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,791
Let's go, gentlemen.

1650
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,559
Hey.

1651
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,074
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1652
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,349
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1653
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,477
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1654
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,710
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

1655
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,234
Do you understand it?

1656
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,355
Yes.

1657
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,710
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1658
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,189
If I find out that you are anything other than

1659
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,554
who you say you are, I swear...

1660
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,478
And we French also have an expression.

1661
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,993
"Faith can move mountains."

1662
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,753
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

1663
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,672
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1664
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,911
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1665
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,753
I just got my ass handed to me.

1666
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,353
I am losing this case.

1667
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,791
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1668
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,230
More than anything in his life,

1669
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:38,679
Jack wanted to be
the most famous magician who ever lived.

1670
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,159
And I can't say he achieved it,

1671
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:44,199
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

1672
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,270
But the point is... Sorry.

1673
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,839
The point is...

1674
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:56,110
The point of why we are here is to say
that we are not... We cannot quit now.

1675
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,760
We've started something
bigger than all of us.

1676
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,672
We have to finish it.

1677
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,790
Approaching the warehouse.

1678
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,394
Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.

1679
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,709
We are going for the vault.

1680
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,713
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1681
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:27,910
What is this?

1682
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,354
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1683
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,317
We just moved it while you were outside.

1684
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:32,549
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1685
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,710
I never said that.

1686
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,120
Sir, you got a phone call

1687
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,833
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1688
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,991
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, Agent.

1689
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:39,751
What happened?

1690
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,556
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1691
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,710
No!

1692
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,079
Jesus Christ.

1693
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,278
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1694
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,237
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto in D-Major.

1695
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,310
Where's the safe?

1696
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,470
His team is loading the truck.

1697
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,433
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1698
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,149
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1699
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,310
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1700
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,837
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1701
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,672
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1702
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,438
Okay. Here's what I want.

1703
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,750
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1704
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,115
So we stay with it.

1705
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,111
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

1706
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,470
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1707
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,799
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1708
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,115
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1709
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,195
You two are with me.

1710
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,069
Guys.

1711
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,509
Look. Office just called with this.

1712
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,472
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1713
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,475
The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...

1714
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,552
We cannot quit now.

1715
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,189
We've started something
bigger than all of us.

1716
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,959
We have to finish it.

1717
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,600
Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,

1718
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,557
5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.

1719
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,870
Their show is in a half an hour.

1720
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,234
It's exactly where we're headed.

1721
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,516
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1722
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,677
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1723
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,400
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1724
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,070
A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz

1725
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:34,994
as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.

1726
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,479
The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round

1727
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,756
of their three-act face-off with the FBI.

1728
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:42,596
What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.

1729
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,150
All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.

1730
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,600
Copy that.

1731
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,592
Agents Rhodes, Fuller?

1732
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,270
Go, for us.

1733
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,080
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1734
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,679
It's a woman.

1735
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,595
- Freeze!
- Shit!

1736
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,873
What the hell's going on?

1737
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,270
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1738
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,435
Put your guns down.

1739
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,473
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1740
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,630
Are you kidding?

1741
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,552
I'm following them, just like you are.

1742
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,233
I'm not following anybody anymore.

1743
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,038
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1744
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,753
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1745
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,598
Your ass is mine.

1746
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,552
You guys are still idiots.

1747
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,795
Yeah?

1748
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:51,995
This happens to be the former

1749
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:54,157
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1750
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,432
It's where I did my first show.

1751
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:59,439
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1752
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:00,914
why not open it?

1753
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,918
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1754
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,838
would you mind reenacting your look

1755
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,951
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1756
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,191
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1757
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,789
Open the safe.

1758
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,359
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1759
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:18,755
What the hell?

1760
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,275
What?

1761
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,590
Give me that.

1762
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,835
No.

1763
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,990
No!

1764
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,675
What is this?

1765
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,790
Get back!

1766
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,516
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1767
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,510
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1768
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,032
Once again, misdirection.

1769
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,638
The show is starting. Move out!

1770
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,234
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1771
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,836
"What happened to the real one?"

1772
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,232
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1773
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,913
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1774
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,197
FBI! Give me a path!

1775
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,399
Clear out! Clear out!

1776
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,034
What is magic?

1777
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,915
Magic is deception.

1778
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,758
But deception designed to delight,

1779
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,673
to entertain, to inspire.

1780
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,235
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1781
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,670
It is about belief

1782
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,750
Faith.

1783
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:47,870
Trust.

1784
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,279
Without those qualities,

1785
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,751
magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.

1786
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,192
But what happens if these qualities

1787
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,357
are not used for their higher purpose?

1788
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,359
And instead they're used to cheat, lie.

1789
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,790
For personal gain or for greed.

1790
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,598
Then it's no longer magic.

1791
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,870
It's crime.

1792
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,072
So tonight, for our final act,

1793
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,993
you're gonna help us set a few things right.

1794
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,269
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1795
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,709
I don't know.

1796
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:24,949
Showtime.

1797
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,150
Look!

1798
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,391
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1799
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,754
Go, go, go!

1800
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:40,800
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1801
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:43,435
What are you doing here?

1802
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,630
They're going in the wrong direction

1803
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,835
and you know it.

1804
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,430
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1805
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,916
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1806
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:53,830
Wait.

1807
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,269
I'm going to go with her.

1808
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,714
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1809
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,595
Go ahead!

1810
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,159
That's on you, Fuller.

1811
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,599
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1812
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,790
Daniel?

1813
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,789
Yeah?

1814
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:39,551
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1815
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,071
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1816
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,954
I'd like to express a sentiment

1817
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,633
to you about our relationship.

1818
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:48,915
Okay.

1819
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,790
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

1820
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,630
dick.

1821
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,195
And?

1822
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,638
No, that's it.

1823
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,915
That's very nice.

1824
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,479
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1825
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,119
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1826
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,913
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

1827
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,075
You!

1828
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,318
God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1829
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:15,675
We're on our own.

1830
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,398
Our instructions run out after the show.

1831
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,197
Even if there is no "Eye,"

1832
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,998
if we were completely played and we spend

1833
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,111
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1834
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,353
I just want to say that...

1835
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,955
I know. Me, too.

1836
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,231
Little too sentimental for me.

1837
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,270
There they are!

1838
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,033
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1839
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,150
Grab 'em!

1840
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,195
Get up!

1841
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:54,835
What the hell?

1842
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,789
Shit!

1843
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,229
Hello, New York!

1844
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,677
Thank you for the magic.

1845
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,950
And thank you for being such

1846
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,072
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1847
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,471
Unfortunately, like all good things,

1848
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,358
it must come to an end.

1849
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,549
So we would like to start our show tonight...

1850
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,199
By saying goodbye.

1851
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:38,914
All we wanted was to

1852
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,957
bring the world to a magic show.

1853
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,519
And thereby bring a little magic

1854
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:43,749
back to the world.

1855
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,909
Clear the way!

1856
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,877
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1857
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,750
But it's time for us to disappear.

1858
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,274
Good night, New York.

1859
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,954
And thank you for believing in us.

1860
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,715
Stop!

1861
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,230
Freeze!

1862
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:17,835
No!

1863
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,240
God damn it!

1864
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,035
I'm sorry.

1865
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,711
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1866
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:14,753
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1867
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,718
So I guess this is it.

1868
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,909
Is it?

1869
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,314
Dylan!

1870
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:52,155
Dylan! Dylan!

1871
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:53,275
Hey.

1872
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:56,597
- You see that?
- What?

1873
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,594
Where's the real money?

1874
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:21,799
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1875
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,115
I've been framed.

1876
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:16,515
I'm sure you were.

1877
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,874
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1878
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,629
I always do.

1879
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,957
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1880
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,554
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1881
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,950
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1882
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,669
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1883
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,592
Sure.

1884
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,595
All right.

1885
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,278
I got information to trade.

1886
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,549
I believe that's how it's done.

1887
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,393
If it's of some value.

1888
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:49,032
These bars give a man time to think.

1889
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,517
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1890
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,076
Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?

1891
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,072
The box was never empty.

1892
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,589
The room wasn't either.

1893
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:06,269
After gaining access to the warehouse,

1894
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,671
The Horsemen left the real safe

1895
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,195
and transformed the whole room

1896
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,749
into a giant rabbit box.

1897
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,510
You go charging in there,

1898
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,195
thinking the safe was already gone.

1899
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,396
Hey!

1900
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,800
Hey! Stop!

1901
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,399
Missing the trick. Again.

1902
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:25,515
Which was to make you think

1903
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,313
the safe had already been stolen,

1904
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,630
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1905
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,158
Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,

1906
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,954
someone was breaking into the warehouse.

1907
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,629
Who?

1908
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,559
Jack Wilder.

1909
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:00,640
Holy shit.

1910
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:03,229
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

1911
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,156
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1912
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:14,754
It's locked.

1913
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,755
Weren't you listening?

1914
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:18,310
Nothing's ever locked.

1915
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:22,519
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1916
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,512
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1917
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,035
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

1918
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,194
Led you to the bridge.

1919
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:34,033
Where the other Horsemen were waiting

1920
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,077
with an identical replacement car.

1921
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:38,070
It only took a split second

1922
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,156
for you to lose contact with it

1923
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,230
and make the switch.

1924
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,552
When you crawled into that burning car,

1925
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,911
quite heroically, I might add,

1926
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,871
you almost died trying to rescue

1927
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:14,952
what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.

1928
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:20,155
Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan

1929
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,393
just to frame one guy?

1930
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:23,755
I don't know.

1931
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,319
They never kept any of the money they took.

1932
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:27,835
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1933
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,594
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1934
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,433
- No. Not really.
- What?

1935
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:37,071
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

1936
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,113
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1937
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:44,596
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

1938
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:45,995
Tressler Insurance.

1939
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,150
The bank that carried the note?

1940
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,918
Credit Republican of Paris.

1941
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:54,758
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1942
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,519
What do you make of that?

1943
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,750
A sucker is born every minute.

1944
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:03,114
What if all this was just leading up to

1945
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,919
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

1946
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,674
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1947
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:09,875
We just have to find...

1948
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,075
That?

1949
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,318
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1950
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,794
And the card encased in glass.

1951
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:21,758
What do we do now?

1952
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,834
Nice!

1953
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:57,154
So, here's my new theory.

1954
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:01,071
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

1955
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,909
Waiting

1956
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:07,075
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1957
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,838
from the mediocre ones.

1958
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:11,875
Maybe that was you.

1959
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,750
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

1960
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:17,480
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

1961
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:20,712
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1962
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,679
You pissed them off.

1963
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,438
The Eye isn't real.

1964
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,592
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

1965
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,200
Somebody with an obsession.

1966
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,874
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1967
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:37,271
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1968
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,954
Somebody so prepared to lose

1969
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,509
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

1970
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:45,439
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

1971
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,198
I don't know who.

1972
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,796
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

1973
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,200
to plant the mirrors.

1974
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,394
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1975
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,711
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1976
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,680
Almost as if they were on the...

1977
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:16,959
The inside.

1978
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,115
You.

1979
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:35,750
Why?

1980
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,910
That is the question, isn't it?

1981
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,319
You're right.

1982
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,275
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1983
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,317
to see the look on your face.

1984
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,273
Who are you?

1985
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:52,759
What do you want from me?

1986
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,113
What do I want?

1987
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,433
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1988
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:02,514
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

1989
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,272
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1990
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,269
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1991
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,113
when you were always two steps behind.

1992
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:17,995
Dylan?

1993
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,950
Wait a minute.

1994
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,150
Dylan! How did this happen?

1995
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,473
Dylan!

1996
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,590
Why?

1997
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,310
Why?

1998
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,470
My God.

1999
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,357
I did not see that coming.

2000
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:45,754
That's impossible!

2001
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:46,830
No way.

2002
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:49,309
That was actually pretty good.

2003
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:50,830
Thank you.

2004
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,470
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

2005
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,595
We were in agreement.

2006
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:55,989
Okay. Right.

2007
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,390
Henley.

2008
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,992
I've never seen her speechless.

2009
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,673
I take that as a huge compliment.

2010
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,040
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

2011
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,353
Hey, listen, for the record,

2012
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:11,036
I have always been a 100% believer.

2013
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,430
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

2014
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,636
these infidels on point...

2015
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:17,757
Merritt, you're in.

2016
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:19,670
God bless.

2017
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:20,835
Come.

2018
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:25,032
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

2019
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:27,117
and making them all work together.

2020
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,670
And that's exactly what you did.

2021
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:31,710
So welcome.

2022
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,077
Welcome to the Eye.

2023
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,351
It was all connected.

2024
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,992
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

2025
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,680
And Elkhorn?

2026
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,711
What's the connection to Shrike?

2027
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:08,431
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

2028
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,876
They used cheap steel.

2029
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:13,754
They cut corners.

2030
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,071
When he got
to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

2031
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,514
And he was trapped.

2032
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:21,639
He was your father.

2033
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,876
The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.

2034
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:32,915
When my father said he had to go to work,
he could see that I didn't want him to leave.

2035
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:40,280
So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.

2036
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:44,154
I have never let his watch stop since then.

2037
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:46,390
And from that moment on,

2038
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,994
I created a persona.

2039
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:51,551
I planned. I worked out every detail.

2040
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,917
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

2041
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,509
was you.

2042
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:01,158
And I know that
the logical conclusion for you

2043
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:04,393
is to take this case to its resolution.

2044
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:07,518
And for you to turn me in.

2045
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:13,715
Yeah.

2046
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:19,514
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

2047
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,200
And you also know

2048
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:27,438
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

2049
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,718
One more secret to lock away.

2050
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,793
Come in close.

2051
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,554
Closer.

2052
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:08,870
Because now you know our secret.

2053
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,315
We could be anywhere. Watching you.

2054
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:15,550
We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.

2055
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:18,200
On the count of three, open your eyes

2056
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,237
and tell me what you see.

2057
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:22,310
One.

2058
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:23,430
Two...

2059
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,157
Please, stop, stop, stop.

2060
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:01,229
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

2061
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:03,719
Thank God.

2062
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:07,751
Where are we?

2063
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,229
Great, another shit hole.

2064
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:12,231
Okay, feeling it.

2065
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:16,513
I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

2066
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:19,437
Check out this place.

2067
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,319
- Where'd you bring us?
- Was there no landfill where we were?

2068
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,277
This place is awesome.

2069
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:26,790
Is this our new gear?

2070
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,439
There'd better not be, like,
matching jumpsuits in there.

2071
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:29,555
You know I don't wear spandex.

2072
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:32,029
- It's locked.
- Guys, the cards.

2073
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:34,634
- What card?
- What do you mean, "what card"?

2074
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:39,750
Okay.
