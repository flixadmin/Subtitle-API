1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,643
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,807
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,361
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,521
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,851
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,523
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,208
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,169
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,171
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,004
The Man in the Yellow, he took Eddie.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,766
Hi, Barry. Or should I say the Flash?

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,127
Observe, Barry marries Iris...

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,446
...and not you.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,483
- I've been having dreams.
- What happens?

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,324
Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash...

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,726
...and he kills me.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,605
If this is Dr. Wells, then who
have we been working for this whole time?

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,808
A completely different person.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,041
Oh, my God.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,131
I don't wanna kill you, Barry. I need you.
We will face each other again.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,971
Very soon.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,126
I want you to take a moment...

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,002
...and think about all the things
that define your life.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,244
All the people you love.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,842
Your job...

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,362
your coworkers...

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,082
your home.

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,881
And now imagine if, one day, in a flash...

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,249
...all of that vanished.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,170
Would you simply accept your new life
and continue on...

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,489
...or would you do whatever it takes...

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,685
...to get back what was taken from you?

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,128
Because I can assure you...

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,571
...I will get everything that was taken...

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,683
...from me.

_H6Y-
_H6Y-

38
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,691
What's all this?

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,123
Return labels for Eddie and me.

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,366
I ordered 200 to start,
but this afternoon, 2000 arrived.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,204
I guess I ordered wrong.

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,928
I have so many now.

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,609
Iris, we're gonna find Eddie.

44
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,886
How?

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,691
You've searched everywhere.
More than once.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,002
And you haven't found anything.

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,526
I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you.

48
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,806
It's just...

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,411
You miss him, right?

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,571
Yeah, I do.

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,124
Look.

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,765
Wells took my mom from me.

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,650
I won't let him take someone from you too.

54
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,881
It's Cisco. I gotta go.

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,565
Yeah, go.

56
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,165
I kept asking myself...

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,802
...why would Wells pretend
to need a wheelchair?

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,082
- Sympathy.
- That's what I thought at first.

59
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,369
He's the Man in Yellow, the Reverse-Flash.
He's much smarter than that.

60
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,284
Sympathy can't be the only reason.

61
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,011
Misdirect.
Like everything else Wells has done.

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,084
I mean, the last person we'd suspect
to be the Man in Yellow...

63
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,323
...is someone who lost the use of their legs.
- Exactly right, Joe.

64
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,324
Which is why I started messing around
with the wheelchair.

65
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,089
And that's when I found this.

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,848
Damn. You can't get that at RadioShack.

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,287
It looks like the tech inside Gideon.

68
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,161
I measured the output, and this
thing is kicking off serious juice.

69
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,130
I mean, we're talking enough
to power all of Central City.

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,203
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,045
What do you think Wells was using it for?

72
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,363
I think this thing is some kind of battery.

73
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,730
- Battery?
- As in Wells was using it to power himself.

74
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,361
To gain more speed.

75
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,603
And that's why he's so
much faster than you.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,171
The accelerator, it's been reactivated.

77
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,647
- It can't be.
- How is that possible? It blew up.

78
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,970
It had to have been rebuilt.

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,246
Wells.

80
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,450
Even if he did rebuild it, how did Dr.
Wells turn the particle accelerator on?

81
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,326
He's here.

82
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,166
That's why we couldn't find him. He's
been inside S.T.A.R. Labs the whole time.

83
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,049
Stay here.

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,007
Cisco, what'd you bring
that orange soda for?

85
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,881
Whenever something happens with the
Reverse-Flash, liquid floats in the air.

86
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,690
You know, Barry's fish tank...

87
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,080
...Wells's champagne...

88
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,884
...Lance's coffee. Remember that?

89
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,526
If this does the same thing,
we'll know that Wells is in there.

90
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,130
Do it.

91
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,407
Man.

92
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,129
This is big.

93
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,645
Oh, God.

94
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,046
Guys.

95
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,610
Barry!

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do we do now?

97
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,523
Prisoner release protocol initiated.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,365
Oh, no, no, no.

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,964
No!

100
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,767
Peekaboo.

101
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,529
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be stuck in that box?

102
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,967
Now you're the one
who's gonna go into a box.

103
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,050
In the ground.

104
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,244
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I will be...

105
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,686
...thanks to Iris.

106
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,001
I'm glad you showed up.

107
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,569
How do you think she got out of there?

108
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,166
- Wells must have released her.
- Help!

109
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,527
Wait a sec. Did you hear that?

110
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,449
I checked all the containment cells.
Everyone's accounted for.

111
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,409
No, no. Listen.

112
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,369
Help!

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,282
Down here!

114
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,681
Help.

115
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,324
Eddie?

116
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,846
Oh, partner.

117
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,447
Oh, my God. I got you.

118
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,524
Oh, my God. Eddie.

119
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,769
- You okay?
- Let's get him out of here.

120
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,322
Come on.

121
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,971
There you go. Go slow.

122
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,805
Go slow.

123
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,569
Your vitals are normal,
but you're just a little dehydrated.

124
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,964
The IV should help with that, but drink
some fluids and stay off your feet.

125
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,565
- Okay, Eddie?
- Thanks, Caitlin.

126
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,441
Wells got away.

127
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,090
Ahh. He was too fast.

128
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,049
He's always too fast.

129
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,124
- Eddie.
- We found him under that hatch in the pipeline.

130
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,609
I'm so sorry.
I thought I looked everywhere for you.

131
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,650
It's not your fault.
Sometimes you just can't see the clues...

132
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,802
...even if they're right in front of you.

133
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,925
Um, well, you know, all that's
important is that we're all safe...

134
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,969
...and back together, right?

135
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,560
Eddie, Why'd he take you?

136
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,647
I don't know.

137
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,691
He said that we're family.

138
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,129
Said his real name is Eobard Thawne.

139
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,126
Eobard Thawne. It's just like in my dream.

140
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,525
Did he say anything else?

141
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,651
I mean, anything that could help us
figure out what he's really after?

142
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,731
He didn't say much.
Just kept working on some tube.

143
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,803
A tube? What did it look like?

144
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,851
Metallic and futuristic.
He said it was the key...

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,049
...to him getting back
everything that was taken from him.

146
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,968
The key? I don't understand. What...?

147
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,522
I don't know. Look, I just wanna go home.

148
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,082
- Is that okay?
- Yes. Of course.

149
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,886
I'll make sure he gets some rest.

150
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,411
Okay.

151
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,207
What do you think Wells was talking about?
I mean...

152
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,121
- Oh, no, no, no.
- What?

153
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,967
What now?

154
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,966
Um, are you seeing this?

155
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,202
That's the tube Eddie was talking about.

156
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,842
It's some sort of power source.
That's what's charging up the accelerator.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,126
Can you shut it down?

158
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,729
Do you see a power button
anywhere on this thing?

159
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,326
Dude, this thing is from the future.

160
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,121
It's beyond me.
I press or touch or cut the wrong thing...

161
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,964
...I could bring the building down.

162
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,447
Okay, how long until it's fully functional?

163
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,046
Best I can tell, 36 hours.

164
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,370
That's when Wells will be back.

165
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,330
Why would Wells want
the particle accelerator to work again?

166
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,804
I don't know. It's not like it
was a success the first time.

167
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,881
- It made me the Flash.
- That's not all it did.

168
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,405
So, what happens
if the particle accelerator turns on...

169
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,648
...while the metahumans are in containment?

170
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,966
They're toast.

171
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,090
We put them there. Now their lives
are in danger because of us.

172
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,687
Look, I think you all know I've never been
a fan of this arrangement here.

173
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,001
I thought the whole plan
was to rehabilitate them and set them free.

174
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,726
It was. We've been a little busy.

175
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,211
Well, if they stay in there, they die. And
if we let them go, they destroy the city.

176
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,331
- We're gonna have to move them.
- Move them where?

177
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,131
- Iron Heights can't handle metahumans.
- You're right.

178
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,520
But Lian Yu can.

179
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,491
What the hell's a Lian Yu?

180
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,530
Lian Yu's the island where Oliver
was stranded for five years.

181
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,927
A.R.G.U.S. built a covert
military prison on it.

182
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,849
It's where we sent Captain Boomerang.

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,243
Oliver keeps his worst criminals there.
They won't be able to escape.

184
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,448
More importantly, they won't hurt anybody.

185
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,840
Great.

186
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,163
So we ship them
from one illegal black site to another.

187
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,281
Yeah, I guess so. Yes.

188
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,365
How do we move them
to Oliver's own private Alcatraz?

189
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,324
I'll call him. Maybe he can help.

190
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,371
And, Cisco, if we do this,
nobody can get loose.

191
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,208
I might have a way
of getting them out safely.

192
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,890
All right, get on it.

193
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,202
Bar, this is insane.

194
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,600
Joe, we have to do this.

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,641
You don't think that if we start bussing
supervillains through downtown...

196
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,046
...nobody's gonna notice?

197
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,601
Oh, they'll notice.
That's where you'll come in.

198
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,485
Oh.

199
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,449
Cecile.

200
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,731
Aw. Mwah. How's my favorite DA?

201
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,487
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Hey, anything for my favorite detective.

202
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,168
Hey. So, what can I do for you?
You sounded a little cryptic on the phone.

203
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,642
Yeah, I wanted your opinion on something.

204
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,043
These people with powers?
The metahumans?

205
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,170
Is that what they're calling them?
People love their labels.

206
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,089
Yeah. So let's say, hypothetically,
I know a prison, of sorts.

207
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,766
A place that can do what
Iron Heights can't...

208
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,640
...where these metahumans, the bad ones...

209
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,248
...are being locked up.

210
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,765
I'd be very concerned.

211
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,848
Especially if, hypothetically,
you had anything to do with it.

212
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,730
Why are you asking me about this?

213
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,688
Well, because Singh's on his honeymoon...

214
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,401
...and you're the only other person
I can trust to know this.

215
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,568
Okay, what are you asking me to do?

216
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,122
I need to clear a route through the city.

217
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,251
- Barricades, police cars. The works.
- What am I to tell people? President's in town?

218
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,688
- I don't know. You think they'll believe you?
- No, Joe. They wouldn't.

219
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,201
What you're doing, it's called unlawful
imprisonment and human smuggling.

220
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,203
Joe, those are very bad things.

221
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,081
These are some bad people, Cecile.

222
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,129
But their lives are in danger.

223
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,770
I can't. I can't get involved in this, Joe.
I can't.

224
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,044
And as your friend, and possibly the attorney
who will one day be prosecuting you...

225
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,763
...I am telling you,
get as far away from this as possible.

226
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,286
Okay, so A.R.G.U.S. has a transport plane
that can take the metahumans to Lian Yu.

227
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,683
- We need to get them to Ferris Airfield.
- Oliver Queen came through.

228
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,964
No, actually. It was not him.
Apparently he's in Nanda Parbat.

229
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,402
- What?
- Wherever that is. I don't know.

230
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,409
I called Lyla, Diggle's wife.

231
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,807
She's gonna hook us up.

232
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,201
So, what about C.C.P.D.
giving us an escort?

233
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,450
Man, it ain't happening.
You saw me talking to the DA.

234
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,090
She was very clear.

235
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,443
I could lose my badge. I could go to jail.
We could go to jail.

236
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,807
We are protecting people.

237
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,761
We are, Barry, but I'm a cop. There's a
certain set of rules I need to follow.

238
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,491
And this year, I broke all of them.
Lying to my boss...

239
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,881
- I know.
- ...ignoring the law.

240
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,362
At what point do we become no different
than the people we're fighting?

241
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,045
- We are way different.
- How?

242
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,811
We only break the rules to help people.

243
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,845
Give me another one.

244
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,765
Ice cold.

245
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,768
Well, well, well.

246
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,167
If it isn't the Scarlet Speedster.

247
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,448
We need to talk.

248
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,441
You want anything? Beer? Food?

249
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,410
Pickled eggs here are fantastic.

250
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,291
No, I'm good.
I need your help with a problem.

251
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,764
Must be pretty desperate to come
asking for my assistance, but I'll bite.

252
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,081
What do you need?

253
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,607
Help transporting
some people out of the city.

254
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,841
How many?

255
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,889
Five.

256
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,284
Five very bad, very angry people...

257
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,921
...who have powers.

258
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,170
Powers, hmm?

259
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,766
So you want me to, what,
freeze the problem?

260
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,605
Protect you from them
if anything goes wrong?

261
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,171
First rule of business,
always protect yourself.

262
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,130
I'm not gonna help
usher your enemies out of town.

263
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,448
They're not just my enemies.
They're yours too.

264
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,090
I doubt it.

265
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,366
They will destroy Central City.

266
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,363
It's not my problem.

267
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,688
You said you love it here.
That this is home.

268
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,205
I do, and it is.

269
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,805
Well, guess what.

270
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,646
These people get loose,
there won't be a city to love anymore.

271
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,562
You won't be able to rob anyone
if everybody's dead.

272
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,688
It's a compelling argument.

273
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,641
If I'm gonna help you out...

274
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,564
...I'll need something in return.

275
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,004
- Like what?
- This.

276
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,086
No. This is impossible. I can't do that.

277
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,641
- Then I can't help you.
- There has to...

278
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,889
Snart, there has to be something you want
that I can get.

279
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,286
Let me think about it.

280
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,966
You're as cold as ice, I know

281
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,009
You're as cold as ice

282
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,245
Eddie.

283
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,330
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

284
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,531
Here, work.

285
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,207
You were kidnapped for two weeks, and
your first thought is to go back to work?

286
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,045
I just needed something
constant in my life.

287
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,406
I thought that was us.

288
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,882
Eddie, I miss you.

289
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,361
I love you. Hey.

290
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,642
I saw this when we found you.

291
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,202
This was for me, wasn't it?
When you took me to the waterfront...

292
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,330
...and Dr. Wells abducted you,
you were going to propose.

293
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,530
I was.

294
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,246
But now you're not?

295
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,729
What did he do to you?

296
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,406
He didn't do anything to me, Iris.
It's what he showed me.

297
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,564
What could he have shown you
that would make you change your mind?

298
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,245
The future.

299
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,206
He showed me the future, Iris.

300
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,971
We don't get married.

301
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,245
You and Barry do.

302
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,801
I gotta go.

303
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,250
Are you out of your mind? What do you mean
you talked to Leonard Snart?

304
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,526
I asked him for help.

305
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,569
Why would you do something so stupid?

306
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,087
Because, Joe,
we have already tried everyone else.

307
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,609
Look, you tried the C.C.P.D. I tried
Oliver. I even tried Ronnie and Dr. Stein.

308
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,570
- The particle accelerator goes online in...
- Sixteen hours.

309
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,085
16 hours, Joe.

310
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,242
I'm not willing to let the metas die,
and we can't let them escape either.

311
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,846
So like it or not, Snart,
with his cold-gun...

312
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,965
...is the only one that can stop them
if Cisco's transportation does not hold.

313
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,761
Then lucky for you,
I figured out what it is you can get me.

314
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,122
Hello, detective. Nice to see you again.

315
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,123
Caitlin, Cisco.

316
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,883
I thought about your proposal.

317
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,451
You want my help...

318
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,808
...this is what I want.

319
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,042
My fingerprints, dental records...

320
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,806
...DNA, criminal records, family tree.

321
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,088
Everything there is in this world
concerning Leonard Snart...

322
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,208
...I want it destroyed.

323
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,526
All of it.

324
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,685
At C.C.P.D., online, everywhere.

325
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,330
The brass on this dude.

326
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,167
You really think we'd do that for you?

327
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,481
I'll do it.

328
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,724
If it's the only way, fine.

329
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,646
You and me need to talk right now.

330
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,682
What is wrong with you? You can't
just erase Snarfs criminal records.

331
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,047
Yeah, I can. And I'll do
whatever I have to do.

332
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,806
- Bar, there's gotta be a different way.
- What is it?

333
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,169
Tell me what it is, and we'll do it.
We're running out of time!

334
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,250
What is going on with you?

335
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,362
You working with that killer?
This isn't who you are.

336
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,251
Who I am is the guy
who's not fast enough to stop Wells.

337
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,370
He hasn't been one step ahead of us, Joe.
He's been a thousand.

338
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,329
I can't catch him. I can't beat him.

339
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,206
What I can do
is save those people down there.

340
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,203
Wells turned them into what they are...

341
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,410
...and I'm pretty sure he does not care
if they live or die. I do.

342
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,566
Bye-bye, Leonard Snart.

343
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,570
I've deleted everything the C.C.P.D.,
A.R.G.U.S. and the FBI had on you...

344
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,281
...and sent a virus to erase
every digital record of you online.

345
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,128
And this is every single piece
of physical evidence the police had.

346
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,441
Good.

347
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,001
I hear we're all going
to be working together.

348
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,686
That's right, sis.

349
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,330
Partners.

350
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,327
- Please tell me this is a joke.
- Oh.

351
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,290
You were right, Lenny. She is very uptight.

352
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,249
I am not uptight.

353
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,366
You can't call me uptight.

354
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,329
Look, guys...

355
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,921
...we need their help
if we're gonna pull this off.

356
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,606
Why are you wearing your mask?
Snart knows who you are.

357
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,526
And I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.
That includes my sister.

358
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,603
- Jerk.
- Train wreck.

359
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,804
Don't look so surprised, detective.
I am a man of my word.

360
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,209
Yeah, you better be, or I'll make sure
you're on that damn plane too.

361
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,480
Hey, Cisco.

362
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,807
Oh, hey, Captain Cold's evil sister.

363
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,362
Oh. You're not still mad at me, are you?

364
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,488
I really did enjoy kissing you.

365
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,926
You kissed her?

366
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,487
Under duress. Calm down.

367
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,291
You know, I've thought a lot about you.

368
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,446
Have you really?

369
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,684
Well, stop.

370
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,526
Because this right here...

371
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,765
...it ain't gonna happen.

372
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,525
A girl can hope.

373
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,690
Really not enjoying
being one of the good guys this week.

374
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,649
- Really not.
- Hey, dude.

375
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,883
Have you figured out a way
to get the metahumans to the airport?

376
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,849
I have, actually.

377
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,240
And it's pretty dope.

378
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,724
This is cool. Where'd you get this?

379
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,169
My uncle owns it. His company hauls
frozen food cross-country.

380
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,046
Okay, so I retrofitted the cooling system
with the wheelchair's power source...

381
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,202
...to create an energy damper.

382
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,409
Which means what, exactly?

383
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,683
The back of this rig is being flooded
with so much power...

384
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,890
...it's creating a transient pulse strong
enough to disrupt the metahumans' powers.

385
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,767
We can get them to the airport and on
the plane without them getting fresh.

386
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,444
We need somebody with a Class A
Commercial Driver's License to drive this.

387
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,887
I can drive it.

388
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
What? I have a Class A CDL.

389
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,010
- You do?
- We can't all be doctors.

390
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,163
All right, well, let's do this.
Plane's gonna be here in two hours.

391
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,245
Hey! What the hell?

392
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,404
Hey! Hey!

393
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,242
It's done. They're all unconscious.

394
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,122
- The dampers are fully functional.
- All right.

395
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,807
I'll make sure the roads are clear.
Do not stop for anything.

396
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,325
Let's move out.

397
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,081
After you.

398
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,967
- We got traffic up ahead.
- I'm on it.

399
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,366
How's our cargo doing?

400
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,808
All quiet so far.

401
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,925
Don't bother.

402
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,805
Your powers don't work in here.
None of ours do.

403
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,367
- What the hell is going on?
- They're moving us.

404
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,081
- Where?
- Funny, I didn't get an itinerary.

405
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,647
Hey, tall, dark and handsome,
I said your powers are off-line.

406
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
All brawn, no brains.

407
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,089
I know you, don't I?

408
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,366
Kyle Nimbus.

409
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,087
Used to be a member
of the Darbinyan Crime Family.

410
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,649
- That's right.
- Weren't you executed about a year ago?

411
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,006
- It didn't take.
- Huh.

412
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,004
Darbinyans weren't known
for hiring the best and brightest.

413
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,525
You couldn't even die right.

414
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,362
So you're so stupid-mad right now, Mardon,
you're just gonna pick a fight with anyone?

415
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,769
- Guess so.
- If I had my powers right now...

416
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,083
...I would gas you all out of existence.

417
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,528
And then you'd be standing in a container
with four corpses.

418
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,484
What would that get you?

419
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,846
Peace and quiet.

420
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,090
I don't know about you guys, but I don't need
my powers to fill this rig full of bodies.

421
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,006
Come on.

422
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,051
- What was that?
- Wherever they're taking us...

423
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,685
...we're here.

424
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,566
Ferris Air?
I thought this place got shut down.

425
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,445
It did. One of their
test pilots disappeared.

426
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,608
Where's the plane? I want this over with.

427
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,086
Should be here any minute.

428
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,082
- Look, Joe, I know you don't agree with this...
- Save it, Bar. I just wanna get it done.

429
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,243
How come you haven't given me
a code name?

430
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,289
I heard you came up with Captain Cold.
What do you think I should be called?

431
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,609
Female inmate?

432
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,245
Come on.

433
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,644
You made my gun. Least you can
do is give me a bad-ass alias.

434
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,924
Please?

435
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,684
Fine.

436
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,602
Golden Glider.

437
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,487
Smart is sexy, Cisco.

438
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,845
Your A.R.G.U.S. friends aren't very prompt.

439
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,283
Maybe that's why they've never
been able to catch me.

440
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,930
Oh. There it is.

441
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,282
Turning on each other won't solve anything.

442
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,850
- Don't ever touch me.
- Wait.

443
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,610
Look.

444
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,560
Whoops.

445
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,244
- Uh-oh.
- What's wrong?

446
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,482
That's not good.

447
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,006
Guys.

448
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,162
Guys, we have a problem.

449
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,847
The damper's fluctuating.
The rig's losing power. I don't know why.

450
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,684
- Can you do something?
- I'm trying.

451
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,764
Oh, God.

452
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,970
Mardon.

453
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,807
Trip's canceled!

454
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,765
Take your last breath.

455
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,404
I'm out of here.

456
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,126
Caitlin, get down.

457
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,884
You locked Ronnie in the pipeline
and you killed Ronnie!

458
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,764
- Caitlin!
- He killed Ronnie!

459
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,803
- What are you doing?
- He killed Ronnie!

460
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,248
Finish him, Simmons.

461
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,771
How about we call tonight a tie?

462
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,321
I'd power down if you don't want me
to melt your face.

463
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,761
Let's all go our separate ways.

464
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,683
My name is Leonard Snart.

465
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,850
- I know who you are.
- Always pleased to meet a fan.

466
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,607
Just remember who it was made sure
you didn't get thrown on that plane...

467
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,404
...bound for nowhere.

468
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,767
You're just letting us go?

469
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,166
Why'd you shoot that guy?

470
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,445
He owed me money.

471
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,610
Hmm.

472
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,690
What? You want a thank-you?

473
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,604
Who doesn't like a thank-you?

474
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,047
Thank you.

475
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,644
You are so very welcome.

476
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,042
You sabotaged the truck, didn't you?

477
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,131
Why did you let them escape?

478
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,649
Because now they all owe me.

479
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,646
And something tells me they'll be a lot
more use to me as part of my Rogues...

480
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,485
...than rotting away in
the North China Sea.

481
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,491
You gave me your word.

482
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,522
Heh, heh. It's true, I did. But here's
the thing: I'm a criminal and a liar.

483
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,843
And I hurt people and I rob them.

484
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,601
What did you expect me to do?
Not be what I am?

485
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,162
I saw an opportunity
to turn things to my advantage...

486
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,609
...and I did.
Who you're really mad at is yourself.

487
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,686
This is on you, Barry.

488
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,763
Then why don't you just kill me?

489
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,926
Well, I guess you owe me one now too.

490
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,250
Good luck with all of this.

491
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,006
I'm actually really excited
to see how it all turns out.

492
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,409
Hey, hey, hey.

493
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,120
Bye, Cisco.

494
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,720
H9)'-

495
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,769
Cisco told me you were in here.

496
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,967
How's Caitlin doing?

497
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,084
He used that light thingy on her.
She's fine.

498
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,845
Mostly embarrassed.

499
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,365
Yeah.

500
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,489
Thanks for not saying "I told you so."

501
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,049
But I did tell you so.

502
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,325
Repeatedly.

503
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,527
I just...

504
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,765
Man, I've seen the way
that Oliver does things...

505
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,491
...and he's not afraid
to just do whatever it takes...

506
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,644
...to get what he needs,
and I thought that I could do that too.

507
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,727
I thought I could just use Snart,
but instead he used me.

508
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,605
You're not the Arrow, Barry.

509
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,087
No.

510
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,247
That's not the kind of hero you are.

511
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,165
What kind am I?

512
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,927
The kind that cares about whether or not
those criminals lived or died.

513
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,041
I mean, whatever Mardon and Nimbus
and Shawna did, they're human beings...

514
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,171
...and you knew letting Wells use them
as pawns was wrong.

515
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,081
You know the difference
between right and wrong.

516
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,807
And you weren't willing to blur the lines
between the two.

517
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,926
That's the kind of man you are.

518
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,847
And that's what makes you different
than the Arrow.

519
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,566
So please...

520
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,728
...no more walks on the dark side.

521
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,081
- Ag reed?
- Yeah.

522
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,968
- What the hell is that?
- Guys?

523
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,646
The particle accelerator
is fully charged and online.

524
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,485
Whatever Wells needs it for, it's ready.

525
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,609
- Iris, there really isn't anything else to say.
- Are you kidding me?

526
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,651
You're gonna end this relationship because
some lunatic from the future told you...

527
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,928
...that I am destined to marry Barry?

528
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,449
Well, I don't believe that, okay?
I believe that we choose our own destiny.

529
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,286
I decide who I love, and I love you.

530
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,321
Whatever future Wells showed you,
it is not my future.

531
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,165
It's not our future.

532
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,527
Please, let me prove it.

533
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,686
This isn't about the future, Iris.

534
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,046
It's about here...

535
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,806
...now, today.

536
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,646
Ever since the very beginning, there's
been three people in this relationship.

537
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,201
You, me and Barry.

538
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,521
That is not true.

539
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,287
You can deny it all you want,
but Barry knows it...

540
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,405
...Joe knows it...

541
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,643
...and if I'm gonna be completely honest
with myself...

542
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,290
...I knew.

543
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,087
I always knew.

544
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,204
I guess I just thought
I could love you enough to change things.

545
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,809
I'm sorry...

546
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,685
...but if you really do love me,
you'll let this end.

547
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,044
Fine.

548
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,721
Then it ends.

549
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,968
Barry, don't even think about it.

550
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,963
Bar, no.

551
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,884
You can't go out there by yourself.

552
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,849
Yeah, I can.

553
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,610
Well, I heard your prison transfer
didn't go so well.

554
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,046
I'm so sorry.

555
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,884
All a part of your plan, I assume.

556
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,722
Actually, that didn't
factor into my plan at all.

557
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,961
But I'm impressed...

558
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,767
...you went to such great lengths
to keep those people from harm.

559
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,368
Ever the hero, huh, Barry?

560
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,287
- You've hurt enough people.
- I know. You see me as the villain...

561
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,364
...but, Barry, if you were to look back...

562
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,842
...look back carefully
at everything I've done...

563
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,131
...every wheel...

564
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,802
...I have set in motion,
you would realize...

565
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,802
...I have only done what I had to do.

566
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,930
Nothing more...

567
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,324
...nothing less.

568
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,729
And the particle accelerator?

569
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,083
- How does that fit into your grand plan?
- Why don't you go on inside?

570
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,290
- Let me show you.
- You know, I just learned the hard way...

571
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,044
...not to trust the bad guy.

572
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,531
And yet I've shown you
time and time again...

573
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,406
...you can't beat me, Barry.

574
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,129
- Ronnie.
- Firestorm.

575
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,891
Wow. You brought yourself a friend.

576
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,607
Welcome, Mr. Queen.

577
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,161
Hope we're not too late.

578
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,606
You're just in time.

579
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,444
I don't care how fast you are.

580
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,646
You can't fight all three of us
at the same time.

581
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,331
Oh, I can't?

582
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,801
Trust me, this?

583
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,288
This is gonna be fun.

584
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,290
Move, Barry.

585
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,371
Barry, move!

586
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,726
Come on.

587
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,531
Ronnie.

588
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,322
Nanites, courtesy of Ray Palmer.

589
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,081
They're delivering a high-frequency pulse
that's disabling your speed.

590
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,250
You're not gonna be running around
for quite a while.

591
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,888
The history books say
you live to be 86 years old, Mr. Queen.

592
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,007
Well, I guess the history books are wrong.

593
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,009
That's the spirit.

594
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,890
You can't stop me, Flash.

595
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,122
And you never will.

596
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,649
Now!

597
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,206
- Thanks, fellas.
- No problem.

598
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,448
Nice haircut.

599
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,682
I see we've abandoned
our traditional green.

600
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,606
Trying something different.

601
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,280
Look, I might need a favor from you.

602
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,930
Wherever, whenever.

603
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,369
L 90'! you.

604
