1
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:29,445
Hey.
Hey.

2
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:33,532
Hey.
Hey.

3
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:37,369
Hey.
Hey.

4
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:58,182
Hmm?

5
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:04,647
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

6
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:05,940
It can't be.

7
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,108
Tai Lung.

8
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:10,861
I have returned to take what is mine.

9
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,156
Which is everything that is yours.

10
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:27,628
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

11
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:30,798
and no one will stand in his way.

12
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:34,802
Not even the great Dragon Warrior.

13
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:45,771
Oh, where is Po?

14
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:48,524
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

15
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:51,527
Ping, will you please just relax?

16
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,487
I am relaxed!

17
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,198
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

18
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:58,784
But what if he's sick? What if he's hurt?

19
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:00,411
- What if he's hungry?

20
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:02,162
Don't get your noodles in a twist.

21
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:06,709
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

22
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:14,216
Kung fu!

23
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:17,511
Whoa! That's bad.

24
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:20,389
Whoa! Getting worse.

25
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:22,808
Whoa!

26
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:25,644
Ah, come on!

27
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,830
Ha-ha!

28
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:52,546
Okay, big guy.
We're really gonna have to wrap this up.

29
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:06,644
Whee!

30
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,146
- Oink.
- Oink.

31
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:10,231
- Again, again!

32
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,149
- That was fun.
- Let's do that again.

33
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:16,986
And next time,
keep your surf off their turf.

34
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:24,995
I'm late. I'm late. Ooh, I'm late.

35
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,415
The Dragon Warrior is back!
- It's the Dragon Warrior!

36
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:31,043
Was, is and always will be.

37
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,920
We love you, Dragon Warrior!

38
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,547
And I love you too, adoring fan.

39
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,131
Sign my scroll.
Sign my hat.

40
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:37,299
- Sign my shirt.
Okay, okay.

41
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:38,717
I'll sign whatever you want.

42
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:40,594
Po!

43
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,721
Master Shifu!

44
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,348
Here, let me just--

45
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:47,810
There, that's much... worse.

46
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:50,145
We have to talk.

47
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:53,023
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

48
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:55,109
- Let's go!
- Ceremony?

49
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:56,402
What ceremony?

50
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:58,863
The Staff of Wisdom.
Ooh.

51
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:01,657
- Given to me by Master Oogway himself.
Aah.

52
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,826
It is said that
whoever possesses this staff

53
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:06,787
has the power
to travel between the realms.

54
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:09,707
The power to unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm.

55
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:12,126
And now, the power to open...

56
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:16,922
the all-new
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

57
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:23,053
Where the broth has kick
and the bean curd's a knockout.

58
00:05:27,224 --> 00:05:28,559
Dragon Warrior!

59
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,686
Will the Furious Five be here too?

60
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:32,062
Unfortunately, no.

61
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:34,732
They're off on
super cool kung fu missions.

62
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:37,193
Tigress is taking on
the free-range chicken gang.

63
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:39,403
<i>Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.</i>

64
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:41,238
<i>Crane was crowned
king of the Crocodilians.</i>

65
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:42,615
Crane!
<i>Long story.</i>

66
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:45,492
<i>Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.</i>

67
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:46,452
<i>Or is it mongeese?</i>

68
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:47,745
<i>And Mantis?</i>

69
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:50,789
<i>Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.</i>

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,418
Just 'cause they're not here in person

71
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:57,087
doesn't mean they're not here
as life-sized cut-outs.

72
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:00,174
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

73
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:01,967
- Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
- You.

74
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:04,637
My turn! My turn!

75
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:05,721
And then you.

76
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,562
He really captured
your disapproving scowl.

77
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,772
We need to talk.

78
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,441
- Now.

79
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,527
Hey, can I get one of those
in a wallet size?

80
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:20,861
Po!
- Coming.

81
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:26,325
Do you remember the first time you climbed
these steps to the Jade Palace?

82
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,120
How could I forget?
I thought I'd never make it to the top.

83
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,622
Yes, but you persevered.

84
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:35,876
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

85
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,795
The next step?
What are you talking about?

86
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:40,172
I've already taken all the steps.
Haven't I?

87
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:42,967
It is time for you
to choose your successor.

88
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,385
Successor for what?

89
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:47,805
A successor to be
the next Dragon Warrior.

90
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:49,765
Oh... [chuckles] Yeah, I get it.

91
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,184
Funny, 'cause I'm the Dragon Warrior.

92
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:56,897
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

93
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:59,650
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

94
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,610
- Exactly.
- Then what am I gonna be?

95
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,279
Once a successor is chosen,

96
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,407
you will advance
to the highest level in all of kung fu.

97
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:09,493
Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Peace.

98
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:11,871
Whoa.

99
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:14,331
I don't know what that means.

100
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,750
It's just like
Master Oogway before you.

101
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,380
You will oversee the Valley,
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope.

102
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,632
Look, I appreciate the promotion.

103
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:27,261
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

104
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:30,180
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

105
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,348
A cookie.

106
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:32,641
Other hand.

107
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:34,351
The Staff of Wisdom.

108
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:36,353
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

109
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:38,689
Do you really think it was so you could
open a restaurant?

110
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:39,940
Or pose for pictures?

111
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,692
He wasn't super specific.

112
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:45,988
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

113
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:48,949
and become something better
than you already are.

114
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:50,201
You take it.

115
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:52,828
No. Oogway did not give it to me.

116
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:56,290
Being the next Oogway is not my destiny,
which I have accepted

117
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,583
and am at peace with.

118
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,627
- Really. It's fine.
- You don't sound fine.

119
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:02,254
- You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
- Okay, you're fine.

120
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:03,422
This is an honor.

121
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:07,551
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

122
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:10,346
Master Shifu,
I finally found something I'm good at,

123
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:12,139
and now you want to
just take it away from me?

124
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,308
No one is taking anything away, Po.

125
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:16,852
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

126
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:19,605
Yeah, but where's the "skadoosh"?
You know what I mean?

127
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:21,357
The "shasha-booie"?

128
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:22,858
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

129
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,528
but I don't know anything
about passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

130
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,571
All I know are two things.

131
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:30,908
Kicking butt and taking names.

132
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:33,994
And if I'm being completely honest,
I'm not even that good at the name-taking.

133
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:36,162
Like, who was
that fire-breathing crocodile?

134
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:37,665
I wanna say Steve...

135
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:39,999
You were chosen
to bring peace to the Valley,

136
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:44,338
and there are other ways to bring peace
than simply kicking butt.

137
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,507
Well, sure. But not any fun ones.

138
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:49,843
Please. Being the Dragon Warrior
is all I know.

139
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:52,012
- It's who I am.
- Not anymore.

140
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:54,181
The Valley of Peace needs
a Spiritual Leader,

141
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:56,058
and Master Oogway chose you.

142
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:59,019
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

143
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,522
Candidates? What candidates?

144
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,742
Awesome!

145
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,167
No way!

146
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:26,839
Wow!

147
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:28,883
Skadoosh.

148
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:30,301
Fantastic pose.

149
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:42,688
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

150
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:49,195
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

151
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:54,074
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

152
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:58,078
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

153
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:00,206
So many great candidates.

154
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,209
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

155
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,378
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

156
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:08,255
What is happening?

157
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:11,592
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

158
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,142
Like it or not, Po,
you have to choose a successor.

159
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:24,104
Eh. Nothing about them
says "dragon" or "warrior."

160
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:25,814
You will know when you know.

161
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:28,609
How do I know when I know?
You know?

162
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:33,072
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

163
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:35,324
Just as Oogway did before me.

164
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:38,369
I'm not conflicted.
I'm just not ready for a next step.

165
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,578
What is that you're holding?

166
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,038
The Staff of Wisdom?

167
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:42,122
Other hand.

168
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:43,707
A chewed-up peach pit?

169
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:45,167
Exactly.

170
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:49,547
Every pit holds the promise
of a mighty tree.

171
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:51,799
Uh, how is this gonna help me
find the answers?

172
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,969
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

173
00:10:54,969 --> 00:10:57,638
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

174
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:01,976
There we go.

175
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,602
All right, universe.

176
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,272
Give me some guidance.

177
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:09,483
<i>Inner peace.</i>

178
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,735
<i>Inner peace.</i>

179
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,779
<i>Inner peace.</i>

180
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,614
<i>Dinner, please.</i>

181
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:17,658
<i>Dinner with peas.</i>

182
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:19,827
<i>Snow peas?</i>

183
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:22,079
<i>In a sesame soy glaze.</i>

184
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:24,498
Inner peace.

185
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:26,375
Inner peace.

186
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,546
This is not working at all.

187
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,214
Maybe focus on your breathing?

188
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:34,967
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

189
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:37,803
Technically, you're talking to you,
if you think about it.

190
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,556
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

191
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:42,892
Wait, if I'm Po's inner voice,
then who are you?

192
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:44,935
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

193
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:46,520
How many voices do I have in there?

194
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,689
- You do not want to know.
- This dirt is itchy.

195
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:50,357
- I just love kung fu.
- What am I gonna be?

196
00:11:50,357 --> 00:11:53,194
- Are we alone in the universe?
- You guys thought it was awesome, right?

197
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:57,281
Anyone want a cookie?

198
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:04,747
Universe?

199
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,292
Is that you?

200
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:28,145
Attention, mysterious figure!

201
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:32,441
The Dragon Warrior's here
to perform justice.

202
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,197
I know you're in here.

203
00:12:38,197 --> 00:12:40,824
Just a matter of time before I find you.

204
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:43,452
Ooh.

205
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,547
You can't hide from justice forever.

206
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,054
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

207
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:04,014
You've got excellent taste,
I'll give you that.

208
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,350
But I can't give you that.
Give it back.

209
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,102
If you insist.

210
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,240
- Oh, no!

211
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,535
He's got a walking stick.
What are you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

212
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:28,163
This stick is not for the strolling.
It's the Staff of Wisdom.

213
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:30,833
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

214
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,751
I am the Dragon Warrior.

215
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:37,214
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing about you
says "dragon" or "warrior."

216
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:49,393
Whoa.

217
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:52,021
Hi-yah!

218
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,150
How dare you desecrate the Hall of Heroes?

219
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,693
Who's desecrating what now?

220
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,486
Master Ostrich's Egg!

221
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:02,198
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

222
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,575
The Indestructible Chain Hammer
of Master Pangolin.

223
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:05,826
Whoopsies.

224
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:11,332
Ha-ha! [grunts] Oh!

225
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,049
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

226
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:22,593
Which I've already broken! Twice!

227
00:14:23,844 --> 00:14:26,764
Why would you keep an urn of souls?
Feels kinda creepy.

228
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:32,603
Are you doing okay there, big guy?
You're looking a little tired.

229
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,480
- I've never felt more awake!

230
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:39,026
The War Hammer of Master Chipmunk?

231
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:43,948
You're gonna pay for that.

232
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:48,577
Hello?

233
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,631
You faker.

234
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:02,716
It's not faking. It's called Method.

235
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:05,010
Catch ya later, panda.

236
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,845
No.

237
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,062
I think I'll catch you now.

238
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:21,861
Whoa!

239
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:29,702
Whoa!

240
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,121
Whoa!

241
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:36,709
Told ya.

242
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:39,837
You got me,
oh-great-and-powerful Dumpling Warrior.

243
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,797
That's Dragon Warrior--

244
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,341
Let go of me.

245
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,676
Just tell me one thing.

246
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:48,095
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

247
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,389
That's a mystery for you to solve
during your two-year stay

248
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:51,807
at the Valley of Peace prison.

249
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,768
Valley of Peace prison?
Sounds like a day care.

250
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:56,520
It is a day care on the weekends.

251
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,731
But it's also a prison.

252
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,940
There he is!

253
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,983
Dragon Warrior!

254
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,985
Tai Lung is back.
- Tai Lung has returned?

255
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:06,155
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

256
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,741
- He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
- Well, he's back.

257
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:11,619
He said that he's not gonna stop
until the Valley of Peace falls

258
00:16:11,619 --> 00:16:13,954
and the Dragon Warrior
bows before him.

259
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:16,123
- He's back.
- Please, you've got to do something.

260
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:20,169
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

261
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,171
Well, you know what they say...

262
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:27,009
every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

263
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:51,200
Every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

264
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:58,624
Very clever, fox. You know something.

265
00:16:58,624 --> 00:17:00,793
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

266
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:03,170
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

267
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,838
- Tell me.
- And why should I?

268
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:06,048
I mean, what's in it for me?

269
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:08,133
The peace of mind
knowing you did the right thing.

270
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,678
You're adorable.
Has anyone ever told you that?

271
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:12,471
And I don't mean just in, like,
the cuddly sense.

272
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:13,764
I don't have time for games.

273
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:15,933
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

274
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:20,104
Maybe. Or maybe she wants you to think
it was Tai Lung.

275
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,355
Wait. She?

276
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:22,648
Mine!

277
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:26,694
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

278
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:27,986
<i>mimicking any shape.</i>

279
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:29,113
<i>The master of deception.</i>

280
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:31,490
<i>The lizard of lies
with the glowing teal eyes.</i>

281
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,700
<i>I'm talking 'bout...</i>

282
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:35,452
The Chameleon.

283
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,707
This is kind of a private conversation.

284
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,459
Who's The Chameleon?

285
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,837
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

286
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:47,298
So she shape-shifted into Tai Lung.

287
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:49,967
But what does she have against me
and the Valley of Peace?

288
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,136
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

289
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:56,056
You're right.
How do I find this "The Chameleon"?

290
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:57,725
She isn't someone who can be found.

291
00:17:57,725 --> 00:18:00,519
At least not without someone in the know.

292
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,397
And how do I find someone "in the know"?

293
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:06,483
Oh! It's me.
It's obviously-- It's me.

294
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:07,776
I'm in the know.

295
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:10,321
Forget it. I'll find her on my own.

296
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:11,947
Good luck.

297
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:15,117
After all, how hard can it be
to find someone who can look like anyone,

298
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:16,410
blend in anywhere?

299
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,374
Fine. You lead me to The Chameleon,

300
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,752
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

301
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,045
Deal.

302
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:28,255
Po!

303
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:29,548
What do you think you're doing?

304
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:33,010
There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and--

305
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,095
That's a job for the Furious Five.

306
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:38,140
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

307
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,017
Look, I know that change is difficult

308
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:42,561
and that you enjoy
being the Dragon Warrior,

309
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:45,022
but your job is finding a successor.

310
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:48,484
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.
Mind your own business, squirrel.

311
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:50,194
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

312
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:51,445
I'm a red panda.

313
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:54,573
You know what? I love that for you.

314
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:56,200
Po, this is your decision.

315
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,663
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

316
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,419
- Thanks for the free stay.
What are you doing?

317
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:08,837
- Little dank for a day care.
- Wait!

318
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:10,381
- Not bad for a jail.
- Where is she going?

319
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,465
You can't leave.

320
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:14,718
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

321
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:17,930
You are supposed to be
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope!

322
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,683
Just think of it as
one last Dragon Warrior adventure.

323
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:23,060
I'll be back soon.
Tell my dads I love 'em.

324
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,396
- I can't hear you anymore! Bye!

325
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:31,443
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

326
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:33,112
That's a good back scratcher.

327
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:34,446
- Yoink!
- Hey!

328
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,699
So, does this really unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm?

329
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,325
It doesn't work like that.

330
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:41,120
It has to be given
in order to gain its powers.

331
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,081
Gotcha. Given to gain.
So, can I have it?

332
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:45,833
No! What do you take me for?

333
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,917
An easy mark.

334
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,002
What's an easy mark?

335
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:49,670
Someone who's easy to steal from,

336
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,881
usually because they're generous
and too trusting.

337
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:54,049
- Like you.
- Aw, thank you.

338
00:19:56,385 --> 00:20:00,764
I heard The Chameleon is a monster
with an appetite of a thousand predators,

339
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,892
and her favorite food is panda.

340
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:06,687
They say this Chameleon character
has magical powers.

341
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:10,441
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

342
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:15,905
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

343
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:17,406
Or you.

344
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:22,995
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

345
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:25,789
Po's going to
take down an evil sorceress?

346
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:27,750
The-- The Chameleon?

347
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,086
Well, a Dragon Warrior's work
is never done.

348
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:34,340
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming up
with a convicted felon

349
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,219
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

350
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:43,182
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

351
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:44,391
He's always come out on top.

352
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:46,602
You're right. You're right.

353
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:48,479
But what if you're wrong?

354
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,231
Calm down, Ping.

355
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:53,234
How bad can one evil sorceress be?

356
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:57,655
Who is she to summon us?

357
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:58,906
Classic power move.

358
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:02,284
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

359
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:05,913
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

360
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:07,623
You left out the evil sorceress part.

361
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:09,500
We used to run this city.

362
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,086
Now we pay her half the money we swindle.

363
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:14,672
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

364
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,173
Yeah, but what could we do?

365
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:19,385
Together, we can take her down.

366
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:22,304
- Are you nuts? She's a shape-shifter.

367
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:26,308
She could be at this very table,
and we'd have no idea.

368
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,187
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

369
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:32,106
Or you're The Chameleon.

370
00:21:32,106 --> 00:21:33,858
- Or maybe...
- Oh, no.

371
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:35,234
- Maybe...
- Don't say it.

372
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,528
...I'm The Chameleon.

373
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:38,737
I said don't say it.

374
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:48,163
We obviously spoke out of turn.

375
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:49,248
Sorry, Chameleon.

376
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:51,125
No, no. Don't apologize.

377
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:55,629
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

378
00:21:55,629 --> 00:21:59,383
so it doesn't feel good
when you're the one being squeezed.

379
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:02,052
Especially when the one
doing the squeezing

380
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:05,556
is just a "bug-eyed, power-hungry"...

381
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:07,141
What was the rest?

382
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:09,059
Reptilian runt.

383
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:13,230
Well, this "reptilian runt" wants more.

384
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,274
You already have the city.

385
00:22:15,274 --> 00:22:17,234
What else could you possibly want?

386
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:21,322
I have something special in mind.
I'm very close to achieving it.

387
00:22:21,322 --> 00:22:24,116
As close as the blood moon.

388
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:25,784
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

389
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:28,412
So little time, so many expenses.

390
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:33,834
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

391
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:34,960
No.

392
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:41,342
What was that now?

393
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:44,428
I mean no disrespect.

394
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,723
Don't worry.

395
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:53,687
I forgive you for the impudence
and the backstabbing.

396
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:59,109
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

397
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:01,987
But I never forget.

398
00:23:01,987 --> 00:23:04,281
You might say I have the memory...

399
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,491
Oh, don't say it.

400
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:07,618
...of an elephant.

401
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:26,637
You think
I've pushed you too far?

402
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:30,808
Then you, my friend, can't begin to fathom

403
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:34,645
just how far I can push.

404
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,737
I'll expect your tributes by dawn.

405
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:49,702
Are we gonna stop
for lunch soon?

406
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:51,787
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

407
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:54,665
But it does take the occasional time-out
for snackage.

408
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,458
Wanna split my almond cookie?

409
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,045
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

410
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:02,423
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

411
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:03,382
The "bam-what-le"?

412
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:05,426
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

413
00:24:05,426 --> 00:24:07,011
Do you want the cookie or not?

414
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,474
I got my eye on you.

415
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:16,979
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

416
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:18,188
Just a little farther.

417
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:36,624
Li! What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

418
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:40,294
Well, I-- I-- I... didn't wanna miss
the blood moon rising.

419
00:24:40,294 --> 00:24:43,047
Oh, pooh.
You are just as worried as I am.

420
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:44,465
All right, all right.

421
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:47,301
I know pandas come across as
calm, gentle and chill,

422
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:49,637
but... [chuckles] ...the truth is

423
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:51,222
I'm kinda freaking out!

424
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:52,264
So am I.

425
00:24:52,264 --> 00:24:56,560
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

426
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,438
- What if he's captured?
- What if he's tortured?

427
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:01,357
Our baby!

428
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:03,943
Okay, okay.

429
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:06,195
Maybe Po has finally met his match,

430
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:10,157
but there is still something that he has
that The Chameleon does not.

431
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:12,284
- What's that?
- Us.

432
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:15,204
Now, let's go find our son.

433
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:16,413
I hope Po's okay.

434
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:19,458
You know, Li,
a wise goose once said,

435
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:22,503
"Worrying doesn't make
the broth boil any faster."

436
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:25,005
Who was that idiot?
Me, of course.

437
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:26,549
I was the wise goose.

438
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:28,300
Oh, yeah.

439
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,219
Whoa.

440
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:32,263
That's the biggest village I've ever seen.

441
00:25:32,263 --> 00:25:34,056
That's no village.

442
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:36,016
That's Juniper City.

443
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:37,851
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

444
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:39,395
Just a boat ride away.

445
00:25:39,395 --> 00:25:41,981
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

446
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:43,941
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

447
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:46,819
For the right price, those cutthroats will
take us anywhere we want to go.

448
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:50,531
Of course, we could always opt for
the four-finger discount.

449
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:51,824
No stealing.

450
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,326
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

451
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:56,203
Well, that sounds inviting.

452
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,127
Anybody lose a rabbit?

453
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:10,634
Stir faster!

454
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,140
Welcome to the Happy Bunny Tavern.

455
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,976
I'll find us a ride.
Maybe you can get us some food.

456
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:20,936
And stay out of trouble.

457
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,565
Hey, what you guys playing?

458
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:26,317
Mah-jongg.

459
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:27,985
And the stakes are high.

460
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:29,069
Can I play?

461
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:32,489
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,
'cause I'm very beginning.

462
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:36,368
- Hey there.
- What can I get you?

463
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:38,245
A boat ride to Juniper City.

464
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:39,330
Ask this guy.

465
00:26:41,874 --> 00:26:43,876
- Who's he?
- He's the captain.

466
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:45,419
- Thanks.

467
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:51,342
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

468
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,219
Never played before, huh?

469
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:55,221
I'm sorry, are you accusing me
of cheating?

470
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:57,514
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

471
00:26:57,514 --> 00:26:59,516
I am the manager.

472
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:04,230
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper City,
but I won't carry anything illegal.

473
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,606
I don't want any trouble.

474
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:07,566
Trouble runs from me.

475
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:09,026
Then it'll cost you double.

476
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:11,570
I'm confused.
Should I have said that I like trouble?

477
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,405
In that case, it'll cost you triple.

478
00:27:13,405 --> 00:27:16,075
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go back
to the double price?

479
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:20,496
You got a deal.

480
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:23,457
Great.
Do I shake his hand or your hand?

481
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,876
Can I get anything else for you, ma'am?

482
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:27,336
Yes. Everything, again.

483
00:27:27,336 --> 00:27:29,380
Except for the broth. It was very bland.

484
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,965
- Keep stirring!

485
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:35,135
Whoa! One of everything is my go-to order.

486
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:37,179
But how did you pay for this?

487
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:39,139
Legally. Lawfully. Fair and square.

488
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:40,599
- I'm proud of you.

489
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,695
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

490
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:55,614
Remember we have to do that thing
down by the place with that guy?

491
00:27:55,614 --> 00:28:00,119
Did you actually think you could
grift a meal out of me?

492
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,163
There's gotta be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

493
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:07,585
And apparently,
I'm the one misunderstanding.

494
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,713
Please allow us to pay for our meal
and yours too.

495
00:28:10,713 --> 00:28:12,715
I'm only hungry for...

496
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,174
- Dumplings?
- ...vengeance!

497
00:28:14,174 --> 00:28:16,135
Well, then, come and get it.

498
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:18,137
No! No, no, no! Don't come and get it!

499
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:20,180
- Destroy them!

500
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,903
I got it!

501
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:45,414
There you go.

502
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,834
- All better.

503
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,587
- Come on! Gotcha.

504
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:52,838
Keep stirring!

505
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,723
Oh, yeah!

506
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:22,993
I'll take that.

507
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,373
Think this belongs to you.

508
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:41,845
No stealing!

509
00:29:46,392 --> 00:29:49,103
Yeah, I think it's
a little too late for that.

510
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:51,397
It's never too late to do the right thing.

511
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:53,023
- Get them!

512
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:54,775
Watch out!
- Whoa!

513
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:03,993
- Skadoosh!

514
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:14,211
- Whoa. Nice move. You gotta teach me that.

515
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:16,338
You die, panda!

516
00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:30,811
Ah! Uh.

517
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:33,314
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

518
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:37,401
Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

519
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,112
I shouldn't have eaten
all those dumplings.

520
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:42,698
- Huh?

521
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:43,949
Uh-oh.

522
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:49,914
Sail ho!

523
00:30:56,503 --> 00:30:59,423
Back up! Move, move, move!

524
00:31:02,718 --> 00:31:04,762
- Not that I'm worried, but...

525
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,181
...what if The Chameleon knows
we're coming?

526
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,391
Why, she could be anywhere, anyone.

527
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:12,269
Li, would you please show
a little backbone?

528
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:15,773
I'm sorry, but bravery was never
really my specialty.

529
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:20,569
You don't have to be brave.
You just have to act brave.

530
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,738
Act brave? Got it.

531
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:25,407
- Ah!
- Oh!

532
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:26,825
Oh, Li!

533
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:29,203
- Hold on!

534
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:32,039
Hold me, Ping! It's all been for nothing!

535
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,541
Please, no.

536
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,960
- I'm too young!

537
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:41,257
How was that for acting brave?

538
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:43,175
Keep working on it.

539
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,431
Juniper City.

540
00:31:49,431 --> 00:31:51,350
It's going to be great
to be back home again.

541
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,352
Does your family live there too?

542
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:55,688
They would. If I had a family.

543
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:58,858
It wasn't easy being a little fox
in a big city.

544
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:02,027
<i>So I had to survive any way I could.</i>

545
00:32:02,027 --> 00:32:03,070
Hey!

546
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,198
<i>Grifting. Shilling. Gaffing.</i>

547
00:32:06,198 --> 00:32:08,826
Stop running! Stop running!

548
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,917
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

549
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,377
Well, I mean I was.

550
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:22,298
My goose dad adopted me,
and then later, my panda dad found me.

551
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:26,010
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

552
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,553
- Right, Mom?

553
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,431
Then, one day, a local took me in.

554
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:33,893
Put a roof over my head,
gave me clothes to wear, food to eat.

555
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:36,270
After that, I was never alone again.

556
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,479
I guess we both got lucky.

557
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:38,522
I guess.

558
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:40,900
Hey, tell me something.
Back in the Valley of Geese...

559
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,942
Peace.

560
00:32:41,942 --> 00:32:43,444
...what did that angry little squirrel
mean...

561
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:44,361
Red panda.

562
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:46,405
...when he said you had to
find your successor?

563
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:49,992
Now that I'm supposed to become
Spiritual Leader,

564
00:32:49,992 --> 00:32:53,078
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

565
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:55,247
Once you're on top,
that's where you wanna stay, right?

566
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:58,334
No, it's just that-- What do I know
about being a Spiritual Leader?

567
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,878
I can't even come up with
one of those cool-sounding proverbs.

568
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,547
"Life's greatest enemy is"...

569
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:05,758
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

570
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:07,468
Okay.

571
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:09,845
Everyone knows
life's greatest enemy is time.

572
00:33:10,804 --> 00:33:13,891
I guess it's just easier to hold on
to the life you know

573
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,392
than move on to the one you don't.

574
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:17,186
Hey, that was pretty good.

575
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:18,103
Yeah.

576
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:21,941
Maybe she should be the Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Geese.

577
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:25,903
Whoa, that guy.
He drinks like a fish.

578
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,446
Should he be driving?

579
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:55,599
We've come to pay tribute,
as you requested.

580
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,476
Looks a little light.

581
00:33:57,476 --> 00:33:59,353
Go back out and get me more!

582
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:00,271
More?

583
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,438
But-- But, Chameleon--

584
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:05,067
Go! Before I toss you
down another flight of stairs.

585
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:11,198
At last, my destiny approaches.

586
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:20,415
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City
to every city and town and village

587
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:24,044
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond!

588
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:33,344
They will all know the name
of The Chameleon!

589
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,680
<i>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</i>

590
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,893
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

591
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:41,937
She's gonna take over cities and towns
and the Valley of Peace.

592
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:43,647
A vision?

593
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,190
While you were asleep?

594
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,609
I'm pretty sure that's just a dream.

595
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:48,402
Not a dream, a vision.

596
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:50,487
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

597
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,323
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

598
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,325
We got to get to The Chameleon
and take her down.

599
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,285
Well, then you're in luck.

600
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:58,454
Welcome to Juniper City.

601
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,085
Whoa!

602
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:10,382
This is the place where you can be
whatever you wanna be,

603
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:12,676
do whatever you wanna do,

604
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:15,971
and steal whatever you wanna steal.

605
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:17,056
Uh, if that's your thing.

606
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:20,684
Land ho!

607
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:23,896
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

608
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:35,199
Ah!

609
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:37,576
- Whoa!
- Move!

610
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:39,328
- Look out!
- Sorry!

611
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:40,412
Out of the way!

612
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,207
I've never seen so much traffic before.

613
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,292
You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Peace?

614
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:47,586
No one's ever in that much of a rush. Oof.

615
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:50,631
Come on!

616
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:57,179
Well, sure is good to be home again.

617
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:59,014
The sights. The sounds.

618
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:01,725
The smells.

619
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:09,567
It's a wonton wonderland!

620
00:36:11,694 --> 00:36:12,736
Yeah!

621
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:17,658
Po. Po!

622
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:19,159
Focus!

623
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,245
This city is the most amazing place
I've ever seen!

624
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:24,623
I used to feel the same way
until The Chameleon got her claws into it.

625
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:38,012
Tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

626
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,138
Oh, yeah.

627
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:42,808
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

628
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:45,853
Is she lurking in that villainous tower
dominating the city?

629
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:48,647
How'd you know?

630
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:50,649
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

631
00:36:50,649 --> 00:36:51,734
Let's keep moving.

632
00:36:51,734 --> 00:36:53,152
Hey, Zhen!
- Heya, Zhen.

633
00:36:53,152 --> 00:36:54,320
Long time no see.

634
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,237
How you doing, Zhen?

635
00:36:55,237 --> 00:36:57,489
Wow, you're quite the local celeb.

636
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:00,743
Yeah, well, let's just say
a face like mine is hard to forget.

637
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,581
What? You're a wanted criminal?

638
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:09,168
You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

639
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:11,170
You never mentioned
you were wanted.

640
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,504
Don't worry.

641
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:14,715
The law has better things to do
than look for me.

642
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:17,343
- Hey, fox.
- We've been looking for you.

643
00:37:17,343 --> 00:37:18,469
Must be a slow workweek.

644
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,720
I'll handle this.

645
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,890
Morning, officers.
Dragon Warrior here.

646
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,352
The fox and I are here
on official Dragon Warrior biz.

647
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:27,978
- Dragon who?
- Warrior what?

648
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,438
Dragon Warrior.

649
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:31,732
Anyone? Nothing?

650
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:33,734
Perhaps you know me better as...

651
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:36,862
the Kung Fu Panda!

652
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,907
- Wait, wait!

653
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:41,784
Can you believe that guy?

654
00:37:41,784 --> 00:37:42,952
Aw, come on!

655
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:46,247
Okay, so we tried it your way.
Now we try it mine.

656
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:52,670
- Wait, what's your way--

657
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,754
Sorry.

658
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,840
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

659
00:37:57,466 --> 00:38:00,052
You can't run away from the law.
You're a wanted criminal!

660
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:02,763
Yeah? Well, it looks like
I'm not the only one.

661
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:05,057
Wow. City life really is fast-paced.

662
00:38:05,057 --> 00:38:07,017
We gotta get out of here
before they call for...

663
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,563
...backup.

664
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:16,735
That's a lot of bull.

665
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:18,279
- Run!

666
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:26,871
- Let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

667
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,214
Ow!

668
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:05,826
Let's go.

669
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:09,538
Whoa! Whoa!

670
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:13,751
I'm falling...

671
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,586
very slowly.

672
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:19,673
Ow!

673
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:32,353
Sorry.

674
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:49,662
Whew.

675
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:58,128
There they are!

676
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,216
We don't have time for a drum solo!

677
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:05,261
We're trapped.

678
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:18,691
It isn't much farther now.

679
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:21,360
You always say that,
and it's always so much farther.

680
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,490
Whoa. What is this place?

681
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,950
Home sweet home.

682
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,537
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

683
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:37,084
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

684
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:41,797
Uh-oh.

685
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:44,049
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

686
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,763
Ooh!

687
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,186
Ow!

688
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:03,485
Oh!

689
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:05,738
So you're friends
with all these people?

690
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:07,031
They're practically family.

691
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,365
Zhen!

692
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:15,706
Oh! Is that really you?

693
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,167
Han, my old mentor.

694
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:21,128
I always knew someday you'll find your way
home back to the den.

695
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:22,588
And when you did...

696
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:27,218
...I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

697
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,552
Family, huh?

698
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,887
More like distant cousins.

699
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,805
All right. How should we do this?

700
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:34,975
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

701
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:38,395
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

702
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,148
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

703
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:42,691
- Hooray!
- Yay!

704
00:41:42,691 --> 00:41:44,276
You really don't wanna do this.

705
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:45,361
And why is that?

706
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:47,613
Because if you so much as
lay one claw on me,

707
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:49,281
you're gonna have to answer to...

708
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,992
the Dragon Warrior.

709
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:54,620
Warrior, warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior.

710
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:56,914
Who?

711
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,628
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

712
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:04,046
Introduce them, Po,

713
00:42:04,964 --> 00:42:07,132
to your fists.

714
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:16,392
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

715
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:18,394
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

716
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:20,271
Yes, now.

717
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,607
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner Shifus
have differing opinions?

718
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:24,984
We are in total agreement...

719
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:26,986
...with our mutual disappointment...

720
00:42:26,986 --> 00:42:28,153
...in you.

721
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:30,990
Wait.

722
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:35,661
He who resorts to violence now...

723
00:42:36,871 --> 00:42:40,207
will only find more violence later.

724
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:41,166
Huh?

725
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:46,714
So what you're saying is,
if we don't hurt Zhen a little now...

726
00:42:46,714 --> 00:42:48,674
We can hurt her a lot later.

727
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:50,509
What? No, that's not what I said.

728
00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:54,555
Yes! And more violence later
is better than less violence now.

729
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:56,932
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of--

730
00:42:56,932 --> 00:42:58,350
- More violence!
- Hooray!

731
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,936
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

732
00:43:00,936 --> 00:43:03,063
You know, that panda
makes a lot of good points.

733
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:06,692
- I like it.
Violence, violence, violence.

734
00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:07,902
No, no, no! Wait!

735
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:08,986
Come back!

736
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,946
I'll come up with better wisdom.

737
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:13,908
You have got to workshop
those proverbs.

738
00:43:15,618 --> 00:43:17,953
Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
- Nope.

739
00:43:17,953 --> 00:43:19,788
The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

740
00:43:19,788 --> 00:43:21,707
Those are both very common names.

741
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:23,500
- Mentored by Oogway?
- Sorry.

742
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,169
Trained by Master Shifu?

743
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,379
- Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
- Aha!

744
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:29,840
Everyone's heard of
the legendary Master Shifu.

745
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,883
But not you.

746
00:43:31,884 --> 00:43:34,345
Did someone say "legendary"?
Bring it in.

747
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:37,723
Look, Han.

748
00:43:37,723 --> 00:43:40,726
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

749
00:43:40,726 --> 00:43:42,436
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

750
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:44,271
- Thank you.
- Don't drink that.

751
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:49,735
Oh!

752
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:52,863
We just need someplace to lie low
for a while until the heat cools off.

753
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,406
And why should I help you?

754
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:57,076
Because deep down
beneath that iron-scaled exterior

755
00:43:57,076 --> 00:43:58,577
is a good-hearted soul

756
00:43:58,577 --> 00:44:00,496
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

757
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:02,665
Fine.

758
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:06,210
But if you're still here by nightfall,
I'm calling the bulls myself.

759
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:07,878
Sleep tight.

760
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:14,218
So tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

761
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,803
After you get your pants back.

762
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:18,389
Not cool! You guys--

763
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,015
Come on! Give them back.

764
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,433
Those are custom.

765
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:31,151
Yeah, this place doesn't
look very friendly.

766
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:34,363
Oh! Oh, my tail.

767
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:37,533
I'm sure everything is fine.

768
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:38,993
This is a restaurant.

769
00:44:38,993 --> 00:44:41,996
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

770
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:43,247
You wait here.

771
00:44:45,374 --> 00:44:47,126
Salutations!

772
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:49,712
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

773
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:51,171
I know you're having a good time,

774
00:44:51,171 --> 00:44:55,843
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

775
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,887
There was a panda here.

776
00:44:58,554 --> 00:44:59,638
You know him?

777
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:02,433
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

778
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,729
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

779
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:10,941
You need to pay
for what your son did to my tavern.

780
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,240
My boy wouldn't have done this
for no reason.

781
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,201
Is it possible your broth was bland?

782
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:21,577
Try it.

783
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:24,330
No, no!

784
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,332
The broth smells excellent.

785
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:30,085
You should not add a single thing,
especially not me!

786
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:31,629
Hands off the goose.

787
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,634
The panda's back.

788
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:38,093
- He's back?
- He's back?

789
00:45:38,093 --> 00:45:39,178
No.

790
00:45:39,845 --> 00:45:42,932
But you're about to wish he was,

791
00:45:42,932 --> 00:45:45,392
'cause if you think he made a mess
of this place,

792
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:48,354
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

793
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:51,315
Everything he learned, he learned from me.

794
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,528
Except one thing.

795
00:45:56,111 --> 00:45:57,071
Mercy.

796
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,784
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

797
00:46:03,118 --> 00:46:06,622
Now, this can go one of two ways.

798
00:46:06,622 --> 00:46:11,001
The easy way,
in which you tell me where he is,

799
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,086
or the hard way,

800
00:46:12,086 --> 00:46:14,838
in which you tell me where he is,

801
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,799
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

802
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:18,175
because you have no teeth.

803
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:26,850
Mah-jongg.

804
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,937
I eat mah-jongg tiles for breakfast!

805
00:46:57,464 --> 00:46:58,674
Huh?

806
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:11,770
Stay there!

807
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,813
Where's our son?

808
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:14,690
He took a boat to Juniper City.

809
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,858
Which way?

810
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,111
You know, a wise goose once--

811
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:20,404
Time to go.

812
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,739
Uh, yeah. Right.

813
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:54,104
Okay, let's try this again.

814
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:58,859
Stir the pot, roll the wok,
serve the dish, and ska-blam!

815
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:02,696
Hey, where's the golden dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

816
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:04,532
Not gonna happen with a broom.

817
00:48:04,532 --> 00:48:05,699
Yeah? Still not bad though.

818
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:11,038
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

819
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:12,498
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

820
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:14,667
- And "ska-blam" is?

821
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:20,631
Ska-blam!

822
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:29,765
I gotta say, you're not
like any of the other masters I've met.

823
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:31,892
Yeah, I know.
There's not a lot of pandas.

824
00:48:31,892 --> 00:48:34,812
No, you're, like, a good guy.

825
00:48:34,812 --> 00:48:37,231
Listen up. The coast is clear.

826
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:39,692
Thieves, hit the streets.

827
00:48:39,692 --> 00:48:41,026
And you two,

828
00:48:41,026 --> 00:48:42,695
get out of my sight.

829
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,499
Huh?

830
00:49:03,382 --> 00:49:06,302
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

831
00:49:06,302 --> 00:49:09,054
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

832
00:49:09,054 --> 00:49:13,392
I gotta say, Zhen,
you really are a fox of your word.

833
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:15,519
A chewed-up peach pit?

834
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,480
One from Master Oogway's peach tree
of heavenly wisdom.

835
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,859
Eh, it's a Valley of Peace thing.

836
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:26,113
It's supposed to remind me that every pit
holds the promise of a mighty tree.

837
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,117
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

838
00:49:36,415 --> 00:49:37,708
Are you sure you wanna do this?

839
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,586
As a wise Spiritual Leader once said,

840
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:45,633
how may one kick butt,
if one doesn't seek a butt to kick?

841
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,887
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

842
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,138
Thank you.

843
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:53,766
Wait, was that a compliment or an insult?

844
00:49:53,766 --> 00:49:54,892
Yes.

845
00:50:03,526 --> 00:50:04,485
Whoa.

846
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,073
Have you seen our son?

847
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,206
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

848
00:50:17,206 --> 00:50:18,499
- Nope.
- Nah.

849
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:20,459
Tell us you've seen our son.

850
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,381
Wait, why are they leaving? You said yes.

851
00:50:26,215 --> 00:50:29,009
Hey, look. Po was here.

852
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:31,470
Amazing, Li, but how can you tell?

853
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,515
Oh, we pandas have a gift
for seeing what others cannot.

854
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:36,934
Come on. There may be more clues up ahead.

855
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,345
Why?

856
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,691
That was close.

857
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,068
Look out!

858
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:10,319
Huh?

859
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,198
- Po!
- Stand back.

860
00:52:16,784 --> 00:52:18,327
- Whoa!

861
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,289
- They're coming!
- Hurry! Help me lift the cage!

862
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:30,130
It's no use.

863
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:33,050
- We gotta brace it with something.
- Here, use my staff.

864
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,219
All right, stand back. Here I go.

865
00:52:37,346 --> 00:52:38,389
Zhen?

866
00:52:40,432 --> 00:52:42,184
Where are you taking my staff?

867
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:46,897
I think you mean my staff?

868
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:50,734
You gave it to Zhen,
and now Zhen has given it to me.

869
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,946
"Given to gain,"
I believe, is how it works?

870
00:52:53,946 --> 00:52:55,573
You were right, Zhen.

871
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:56,991
He was an easy mark.

872
00:52:56,991 --> 00:52:58,367
Zhen...

873
00:52:58,367 --> 00:53:01,537
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

874
00:53:01,537 --> 00:53:03,539
I taught her that.

875
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:06,250
And you thought my apprentice
was your friend?

876
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,501
Apprentice?

877
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:09,420
She's the one that took you in?

878
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,839
Best thing that ever happened to her.

879
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,217
You should have seen
the little guttersnipe before I found her.

880
00:53:15,217 --> 00:53:17,303
<i>Mangy and half-starved,</i>

881
00:53:18,721 --> 00:53:21,807
<i>hanging out with those rejects
from the Den of Thieves.</i>

882
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:44,955
<i>She had no fear.</i>

883
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,750
<i>Such potential.</i>

884
00:53:54,423 --> 00:53:56,050
So I took her in.

885
00:53:57,635 --> 00:53:59,929
I made her what she is today.

886
00:53:59,929 --> 00:54:01,513
Stand up straight.

887
00:54:01,513 --> 00:54:02,681
Yes, master.

888
00:54:02,681 --> 00:54:06,352
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

889
00:54:06,352 --> 00:54:07,436
Why?

890
00:54:07,436 --> 00:54:13,317
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

891
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,361
I wanted respect and power.

892
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:18,113
I wanted to be a master of kung fu.

893
00:54:18,113 --> 00:54:19,198
Say what?

894
00:54:19,198 --> 00:54:22,785
I was turned away
from every training hall I went to.

895
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:26,872
They would say I was too small, too lowly,

896
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:30,084
and that kung fu was not my destiny.

897
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:33,337
And so, I chose a different path.

898
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,089
Sorcery.

899
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:36,340
I grew.

900
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:38,634
I excelled.

901
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:42,471
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

902
00:54:42,471 --> 00:54:45,432
- Everything except kung fu.

903
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:49,645
Just because I can look like Tai Lung
doesn't mean I can fight like him.

904
00:54:50,771 --> 00:54:54,900
You see, Po, kung fu may be
performed by the body,

905
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,987
but its secrets are housed in the spirit.

906
00:54:57,987 --> 00:55:00,614
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm--

907
00:55:00,614 --> 00:55:02,825
You're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu.

908
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:06,412
His and those of every master villain
that came before me.

909
00:55:06,412 --> 00:55:11,333
And once I do, no one will dare
underestimate me again.

910
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:13,377
You forgot about me.

911
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,173
Don't bother, Po.

912
00:55:18,173 --> 00:55:23,345
Those bars are enchanted with
some very old and very powerful magic.

913
00:55:23,345 --> 00:55:27,308
You'd need at least ten Dragon Warriors
to get through them.

914
00:55:27,308 --> 00:55:28,851
Then I won't go through them.

915
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:30,978
I'll go under them.

916
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:47,912
Well, that's frustrating
for all sorts of reasons.

917
00:55:56,337 --> 00:55:57,671
Whoa!

918
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:27,201
- Po!
- Zhen?

919
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:29,328
My staff! Hand it over.

920
00:56:29,328 --> 00:56:32,331
I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I was just doing what I was told.

921
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:34,667
Apologize later.
Right now, I have to stop The Chameleon.

922
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:36,418
Po!

923
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:37,753
Zhen?

924
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:44,385
No!

925
00:56:50,474 --> 00:56:52,226
Well done, Zhen.

926
00:56:52,226 --> 00:56:54,436
You never said you were gonna hurt him.

927
00:56:54,436 --> 00:56:56,647
What's the second rule
of the streets?

928
00:56:57,606 --> 00:56:59,233
Someone always gets hurt.

929
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:01,318
And make sure it's never you.

930
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:05,114
I just wish there had been another way.

931
00:57:05,114 --> 00:57:06,824
Third rule of the streets?

932
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:08,576
Third rule?

933
00:57:08,576 --> 00:57:11,203
Some would say
it's the most important:

934
00:57:11,203 --> 00:57:14,832
No one is interested in your feelings.

935
00:57:16,584 --> 00:57:19,086
Chop-chop!
We have a Spirit Realm to plunder.

936
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,006
And smile.

937
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,216
Nobody likes a grouch.

938
00:57:24,216 --> 00:57:27,845
Honestly, Zhen, I don't know where
you pick up such bad habits.

939
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:36,562
If I could--

940
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:41,400
Hey there.

941
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:43,736
Whoa!

942
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:47,781
Get off me! Ow! Ow!

943
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:54,371
Son!

944
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:04,590
- Now save me.

945
00:58:05,925 --> 00:58:06,926
Hi, Son.

946
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:13,349
It's okay. We've got you, Po.
We've got you.

947
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,102
So you followed me.

948
00:58:17,102 --> 00:58:18,479
- It was his idea.

949
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:20,439
Okay, okay. It was both our ideas.

950
00:58:20,439 --> 00:58:22,608
We only follow because we love.

951
00:58:22,608 --> 00:58:25,569
No, you followed
because you didn't believe in me.

952
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:27,905
And because we love?

953
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:31,075
Well, you're right.

954
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,536
I screwed up big-time.

955
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:36,247
I trusted the wrong person.

956
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:38,832
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

957
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:41,502
Oh...

958
00:58:42,211 --> 00:58:46,840
Po, that was a very big-time screw-up.

959
00:58:49,677 --> 00:58:53,222
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

960
00:58:53,222 --> 00:58:56,809
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,
and none of this would be happening.

961
00:58:56,809 --> 00:58:59,770
I was just so determined
to keep things the way they were.

962
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,940
Everyone is afraid of change, Po.

963
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,567
Even me.

964
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:07,444
There was a time not so long ago

965
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:12,366
when all I wanted to be was
the greatest noodle chef in the valley.

966
00:59:12,366 --> 00:59:13,826
So what happened?

967
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,912
I became the greatest noodle chef
in the valley.

968
00:59:16,912 --> 00:59:18,038
It's true.

969
00:59:18,038 --> 00:59:20,082
But I also became a father.

970
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,919
And nothing...
nothing's ever been the same since.

971
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:27,381
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

972
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:30,968
Why do you think I always change
the menu at the restaurant?

973
00:59:32,595 --> 00:59:35,139
Because if things stayed the same forever,

974
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:38,017
sooner or later,
they would lose their flavor.

975
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:40,769
He's right, Po.

976
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:44,064
Since I left my village,
I've become a bit of a warrior.

977
00:59:44,064 --> 00:59:45,983
- Strong. Brave.

978
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:49,236
Move it.

979
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:50,321
This way.

980
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:53,657
Get those cages up there. Come on.

981
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:56,577
Hmm. This looks bad.

982
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:57,703
Really bad.

983
00:59:57,703 --> 00:59:58,787
Move it.

984
00:59:58,787 --> 01:00:00,706
Come on.

985
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:10,174
Don't tell me you were actually starting
to become friends with that panda.

986
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:12,801
What? No. It's-It's just--

987
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:16,555
When we want something, we must use
whatever is at our disposal to get it.

988
01:00:16,555 --> 01:00:19,808
That's all that panda was,
something to use.

989
01:00:21,477 --> 01:00:26,190
Is that why you took me in?
So I could help you get what you wanted?

990
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,608
Zhen.

991
01:00:27,608 --> 01:00:32,071
I took you in because you were clever
and ruthless and unsentimental,

992
01:00:32,071 --> 01:00:33,155
like me.

993
01:00:33,155 --> 01:00:35,533
And the day you stop being those things

994
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:39,912
is the day when, yes,
you stop being useful to me.

995
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:43,499
So for both of our sakes,
don't change.

996
01:00:49,755 --> 01:00:55,636
Tonight, when the blood moon rises
to its highest point in the night sky,

997
01:00:55,636 --> 01:01:01,559
I will open the door to the Spirit Realm,
and all of its secrets will be mine!

998
01:01:07,773 --> 01:01:10,067
Does the blood moon
always rise this slowly?

999
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:14,572
I seem to remember it rising faster.

1000
01:01:16,282 --> 01:01:17,575
No?

1001
01:01:17,575 --> 01:01:18,659
Just me?

1002
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:20,828
Hmm.

1003
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:24,123
Ugh.

1004
01:01:24,123 --> 01:01:26,292
It's just for dramatic effect anyway.

1005
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:29,253
I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

1006
01:01:41,223 --> 01:01:42,892
Bring me Tai Lung!

1007
01:01:53,152 --> 01:01:54,153
Tai Lung.

1008
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:56,238
Big fan.

1009
01:01:56,238 --> 01:01:59,116
Who are you,
and what are you doing with that staff?

1010
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:02,244
This was given to me
by an old friend of yours.

1011
01:02:02,244 --> 01:02:03,746
The puffy panda?

1012
01:02:03,746 --> 01:02:05,206
Po might be an idiot,

1013
01:02:05,206 --> 01:02:09,168
but he'd never willingly hand over
Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

1014
01:02:09,168 --> 01:02:11,545
Who said anything about willingly?

1015
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:24,808
Hmm. Apparently I misjudged you, lizard.

1016
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:27,311
Now, why have you brought me back?

1017
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:29,480
I summoned you here
so that you could teach me

1018
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,565
your most legendary kung fu moves.

1019
01:02:31,565 --> 01:02:34,693
I don't share my skills with anyone.

1020
01:02:34,693 --> 01:02:36,403
It wasn't a request.

1021
01:03:27,454 --> 01:03:29,456
Yes, I got it!

1022
01:03:29,456 --> 01:03:31,542
The Tai Lung nerve strike.

1023
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:33,711
The power, the precision.

1024
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:39,592
What have you done to me?

1025
01:03:39,592 --> 01:03:43,178
All of your kung fu is now mine.

1026
01:03:44,096 --> 01:03:48,559
And the best part is,
I'm just getting warmed up.

1027
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,936
Bring me General Kai.

1028
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:57,276
Bring me Master Osprey.

1029
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,530
Master Bull.

1030
01:04:08,204 --> 01:04:09,288
Po, wait!

1031
01:04:09,288 --> 01:04:11,582
Please be reasonable.

1032
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:13,792
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my staff back.

1033
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:15,878
No staff is worth your life.

1034
01:04:15,878 --> 01:04:18,297
As long as I'm still the Dragon Warrior,

1035
01:04:18,297 --> 01:04:20,925
I won't let anyone else get hurt
because of me.

1036
01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:38,817
Po!

1037
01:04:39,777 --> 01:04:40,903
You're alive!

1038
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:46,033
Please. I made a mistake.

1039
01:04:46,033 --> 01:04:48,911
So did I. Trusting you.

1040
01:04:49,495 --> 01:04:50,454
I'm sorry.

1041
01:04:51,038 --> 01:04:52,873
Did your master tell you
to say that too?

1042
01:04:52,873 --> 01:04:56,085
She's not my master.
I'm leaving, for good.

1043
01:04:56,919 --> 01:04:58,212
It's the truth.

1044
01:04:58,212 --> 01:05:00,297
I was wrong about everything.

1045
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,009
- What are you doing?

1046
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:05,636
Stopping you.

1047
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:07,513
Get out of my way, Zhen.

1048
01:05:07,513 --> 01:05:08,764
No.

1049
01:05:09,557 --> 01:05:10,474
Move.

1050
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:12,226
You want me to move?

1051
01:05:12,226 --> 01:05:13,519
Move me.

1052
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:16,105
First you betray me,
and now you wanna fight me?

1053
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:18,691
- Why are you doing this?

1054
01:05:18,691 --> 01:05:21,694
To stop you from getting killed.

1055
01:05:49,722 --> 01:05:51,891
What do you care
if I get killed or not?

1056
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,366
Please, Po.

1057
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:11,577
Just let me do one thing right.

1058
01:06:16,749 --> 01:06:19,585
You're not the only one
who's made some bad choices lately.

1059
01:06:21,587 --> 01:06:23,714
You're really gonna
go through with this, aren't you?

1060
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:24,840
'Fraid so.

1061
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,760
And there's nothing I can do
to talk you out of it?

1062
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,928
I'm afraid not.

1063
01:06:28,928 --> 01:06:30,930
You can't beat her, you know.

1064
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,514
You're probably right.

1065
01:06:33,974 --> 01:06:35,392
But I have to try.

1066
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:38,979
Get as far away from this place
as you can.

1067
01:06:38,979 --> 01:06:40,064
Po!

1068
01:06:40,064 --> 01:06:42,274
We should never have
let him come here.

1069
01:06:42,274 --> 01:06:44,527
We are such terrible fathers.

1070
01:06:44,527 --> 01:06:46,445
At least you didn't lie and betray him.

1071
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:48,864
Well, that's true.
You're worse.

1072
01:06:48,864 --> 01:06:50,783
I am a terrible friend.

1073
01:06:50,783 --> 01:06:53,494
"Friend"?
That feels a little generous, no?

1074
01:06:53,494 --> 01:06:55,704
Uh, l-let's just give up.
Surrender.

1075
01:06:55,704 --> 01:06:57,373
We can't let him go in there alone.

1076
01:06:57,373 --> 01:06:58,958
What can we do?

1077
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:01,418
There are just three of us
against an army.

1078
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:04,213
Then I guess we'll just have to
get an army of our own.

1079
01:07:17,226 --> 01:07:19,103
Hey! Listen up, everybody!

1080
01:07:22,898 --> 01:07:25,526
Quack!

1081
01:07:27,903 --> 01:07:29,154
Thank you.

1082
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:31,240
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

1083
01:07:32,157 --> 01:07:34,243
- Who?
- You know, Po.

1084
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:36,871
The panda.

1085
01:07:39,915 --> 01:07:42,001
No, no. A different panda.

1086
01:07:42,001 --> 01:07:44,211
- I'm his father.
- I'm also his father.

1087
01:07:44,962 --> 01:07:46,130
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1088
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:49,800
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

1089
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,760
So, I need yours.

1090
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,596
Why should we help you?

1091
01:07:53,596 --> 01:07:54,930
Because--

1092
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,015
Because...

1093
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:58,434
it's the right thing to do.

1094
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:04,732
Stop it. Stop.

1095
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:06,066
Stop laughing.

1096
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,695
Look, I know you think
it might be too late

1097
01:08:09,695 --> 01:08:14,450
for a bunch of cheats, thieves and
cutthroats like us to change our ways,

1098
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:19,537
but a good friend once told me
it's never too late to do the right thing.

1099
01:08:19,537 --> 01:08:23,082
So what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

1100
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:25,126
the more wrong we can do later.

1101
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:26,336
- What? No.

1102
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:28,881
And with The Chameleon out of the way...

1103
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:31,091
We can finally do all the wrong we want.

1104
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:33,135
I-I think you're missing
the fundamental point.

1105
01:08:33,135 --> 01:08:35,763
Violence, violence, violence.

1106
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:39,600
Are you guys ready to do the right thing
for the wrong reasons?

1107
01:08:44,647 --> 01:08:47,191
Now, you see, this mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made

1108
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:48,984
was underestimating his opponent.

1109
01:08:48,984 --> 01:08:51,946
I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

1110
01:08:51,946 --> 01:08:53,447
Hey.

1111
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:58,702
Now, you see, the mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made was that--

1112
01:08:58,702 --> 01:09:00,371
Shut up, Larry.

1113
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:07,419
This place is crawling
with more guards than I've ever seen.

1114
01:09:07,419 --> 01:09:09,505
I'm never gonna get to Po in time.

1115
01:09:09,505 --> 01:09:12,299
You just get to Po.
We'll take care of the guards.

1116
01:09:12,299 --> 01:09:13,676
We will?

1117
01:09:13,676 --> 01:09:15,176
I-I mean, we will.

1118
01:09:15,176 --> 01:09:16,387
But how?

1119
01:09:16,887 --> 01:09:18,555
Just leave that to me.

1120
01:09:49,795 --> 01:09:51,255
General Kai?

1121
01:09:52,006 --> 01:09:53,256
Lord Shen?

1122
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:57,219
Those are all my old nemesis-es.
Nemes-ee. Nemes-i?

1123
01:09:57,219 --> 01:10:00,264
The Chameleon is pulling spirits
from the Spirit Realm

1124
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:02,308
and draining us of all our moves.

1125
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:05,144
And she's using your staff to do it.

1126
01:10:05,144 --> 01:10:07,146
- I'm here to get it back.

1127
01:10:07,146 --> 01:10:08,647
I won't hold my breath.

1128
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:10,191
Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?

1129
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:11,984
Do you know me? It's Scott.

1130
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:15,738
The fire-breathing crocodile?

1131
01:10:15,738 --> 01:10:18,824
Oh, right! Scott!

1132
01:10:18,824 --> 01:10:21,118
Master Shifu and I
were just talking about you.

1133
01:10:21,118 --> 01:10:22,578
Panda.

1134
01:10:23,204 --> 01:10:26,957
Oogway made a mistake
choosing you as the Dragon Warrior.

1135
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:32,213
I just didn't realize
how big a mistake it was until now.

1136
01:10:32,213 --> 01:10:34,757
Whoa. Tai Lung?

1137
01:10:34,757 --> 01:10:38,302
I'm gonna get that staff back,
restore your kung fu,

1138
01:10:38,302 --> 01:10:40,763
and return you all
back to the Spirit Realm.

1139
01:10:40,763 --> 01:10:42,097
You'll see.

1140
01:10:42,097 --> 01:10:43,432
All I see

1141
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:46,185
is a broken promise.

1142
01:10:51,315 --> 01:10:55,819
All right, you bunch of
cantankerous Komodos.

1143
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:59,114
Now, this can go one of two ways.

1144
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:02,910
The easy way,
in which you surrender willingly,

1145
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:07,039
or the hard way,
where you surrender woundedly.

1146
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:09,833
The choice is yours.

1147
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:16,090
- I was kidding! I was kidding!

1148
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:26,016
Aw.

1149
01:11:28,227 --> 01:11:29,770
- Ow! Ow!

1150
01:11:32,106 --> 01:11:33,107
Thanks, Ping.

1151
01:11:37,444 --> 01:11:38,571
Run away!

1152
01:11:42,825 --> 01:11:45,661
Cannonball!

1153
01:11:54,128 --> 01:11:55,337
- Oh, is it too spicy?

1154
01:11:55,337 --> 01:11:58,090
Mmm. No. It's got the perfect kick.

1155
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:01,343
Ginseng. That's the secret
to my mulberry punch.

1156
01:12:08,309 --> 01:12:11,562
That panda was right.
More violence later is better!

1157
01:12:12,187 --> 01:12:13,522
Yay!

1158
01:12:19,486 --> 01:12:22,072
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1159
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:27,620
Can't you even die right?

1160
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,580
Can't you even kill wrong?

1161
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,916
No.
Wordplay didn't come together.

1162
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:33,250
Now, about that staff...

1163
01:12:35,628 --> 01:12:36,629
Take it.

1164
01:12:36,629 --> 01:12:39,298
I already have everything I need
from it anyway.

1165
01:12:39,882 --> 01:12:42,092
I think this was destiny.

1166
01:12:42,092 --> 01:12:46,597
A final face-off
between formidable adversaries,

1167
01:12:46,597 --> 01:12:49,433
alike in so many ways.

1168
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:51,060
If only I had a dumpling for every time

1169
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,978
a villain told me
how much we had in common.

1170
01:12:52,978 --> 01:12:54,063
It's true.

1171
01:12:54,063 --> 01:12:56,398
We've both risen
to the highest of heights.

1172
01:12:56,398 --> 01:12:59,527
It's a shame only one of us can
come out on top.

1173
01:12:59,527 --> 01:13:02,154
It is a shame, for you.

1174
01:13:02,154 --> 01:13:07,117
My combined powers of sorcery and kung fu
make me unstoppable.

1175
01:13:07,117 --> 01:13:11,580
And once I dispense with you,
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City to--

1176
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,374
Every other city and town and village

1177
01:13:13,374 --> 01:13:15,125
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond.

1178
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,335
Yeah, I know.

1179
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:18,420
But how did you know?

1180
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:22,383
I saw it in a vision
because I'm the Dragon Warrior...

1181
01:13:24,552 --> 01:13:25,886
for now at least.

1182
01:13:25,886 --> 01:13:29,473
But I've realized
that it's probably time I made a change.

1183
01:13:30,558 --> 01:13:31,976
And so should you.

1184
01:13:31,976 --> 01:13:34,853
I'm The Chameleon.
I do nothing but change.

1185
01:13:34,853 --> 01:13:36,689
Only on the outside.

1186
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:39,441
Real change happens from within.

1187
01:13:39,441 --> 01:13:41,902
And if we're really as alike as you say,

1188
01:13:41,902 --> 01:13:43,946
then maybe we could both let go
of who we were

1189
01:13:43,946 --> 01:13:46,365
and become something better
than we already are.

1190
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:49,660
- What do you say?
- I say...

1191
01:13:52,246 --> 01:13:53,747
Well, I saw that coming.

1192
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:57,751
We're very proud of you.

1193
01:13:57,751 --> 01:13:58,961
You tried it our way.

1194
01:13:58,961 --> 01:14:01,088
Now try it yours.

1195
01:14:01,088 --> 01:14:03,340
Kick her butt.

1196
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,259
I'm way ahead of you.

1197
01:14:13,309 --> 01:14:15,477
Master Elephant's Trunk Twist.

1198
01:14:18,856 --> 01:14:20,774
Master Boar's Tusks of Terror.

1199
01:14:21,859 --> 01:14:23,861
Master Wolf's Fangs of Fury.

1200
01:14:28,908 --> 01:14:30,868
Master Bull's Horns of Doom.

1201
01:14:33,287 --> 01:14:34,496
What?

1202
01:14:34,496 --> 01:14:35,831
Recognize this move?

1203
01:14:38,459 --> 01:14:41,170
Is that how I sound?
I don't sound like that, do I?

1204
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:44,423
You didn't earn those skills.
You just stole them!

1205
01:14:45,507 --> 01:14:47,092
Give him a left, a right, uppercut.

1206
01:14:47,092 --> 01:14:50,679
- Which one are you rooting for?
- I'm not sure. This is all very confusing.

1207
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:53,432
I'm stronger than every opponent
you've ever faced,

1208
01:14:53,432 --> 01:14:56,852
because I am every opponent
you've ever faced.

1209
01:14:56,852 --> 01:14:57,770
Po!

1210
01:15:10,407 --> 01:15:13,202
Whoa. I gotta workshop
those heroic entrances.

1211
01:15:13,202 --> 01:15:15,496
Nah, it was just right.

1212
01:15:17,331 --> 01:15:20,668
I knew I should have left you
to rot in the gutter where you belong.

1213
01:15:20,668 --> 01:15:23,295
Better to rot in the gutter
than under your thumb.

1214
01:15:31,387 --> 01:15:33,305
- Two against one?

1215
01:15:33,305 --> 01:15:35,516
Well, now, that doesn't seem fair.

1216
01:15:35,516 --> 01:15:37,685
I'll have to even the odds.

1217
01:15:38,894 --> 01:15:40,563
Master Cobra.

1218
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:43,315
Master Osprey.

1219
01:15:43,315 --> 01:15:45,359
Master Scorpion.

1220
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:47,403
Master Wolf.

1221
01:15:47,403 --> 01:15:49,864
General Kai.

1222
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:51,156
Lord Shen.

1223
01:15:55,369 --> 01:15:58,414
That is awesome!

1224
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,542
I mean, it's disturbing, but it's awesome.

1225
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:19,768
Whoa!

1226
01:16:20,686 --> 01:16:22,187
Zhen!

1227
01:16:34,575 --> 01:16:36,619
No!

1228
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:44,293
Whoa, whoa!

1229
01:16:56,847 --> 01:16:58,098
Po!

1230
01:17:04,939 --> 01:17:06,607
I thought we were friends.

1231
01:17:08,484 --> 01:17:09,568
Stand back.

1232
01:17:09,568 --> 01:17:11,904
I'm gonna kick my butt.

1233
01:18:34,653 --> 01:18:35,946
Come on, Po, get out of there.

1234
01:18:35,946 --> 01:18:38,407
- You have to do this.
- I can't beat The Chameleon.

1235
01:18:38,407 --> 01:18:40,034
A wise, old tortoise once told me

1236
01:18:40,034 --> 01:18:42,286
that you never know what you can do
until you do it.

1237
01:18:42,286 --> 01:18:44,455
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance,

1238
01:18:44,455 --> 01:18:47,041
and you're here giving me life advice
from a tortoise?

1239
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:48,626
Be the pit, Zhen.

1240
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:50,961
Be the pit.

1241
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:02,389
And what do you think you're doing?

1242
01:19:02,389 --> 01:19:04,141
Finishing what Po started.

1243
01:19:04,141 --> 01:19:07,019
Oh, please. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1244
01:19:09,021 --> 01:19:10,439
Don't slouch.

1245
01:19:20,449 --> 01:19:22,743
You ungrateful little urchin.

1246
01:19:22,743 --> 01:19:26,914
After all I've done for you,
you betrayed me for the panda?

1247
01:19:27,915 --> 01:19:31,669
First rule
of the streets: Never trust anyone.

1248
01:19:31,669 --> 01:19:35,089
Ha! You can't defeat me.
I know all your moves.

1249
01:19:35,089 --> 01:19:36,674
Not this one.

1250
01:19:36,674 --> 01:19:40,302
Roll, stir, serve,

1251
01:19:40,302 --> 01:19:42,429
and ska-blam!

1252
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:50,020
Yes!

1253
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,315
Second rule: Someone always gets hurt.

1254
01:19:53,941 --> 01:19:55,568
Now, that's a cool move.

1255
01:19:55,568 --> 01:19:58,404
Po! You could have gotten out of that cage
anytime you wanted?

1256
01:19:58,404 --> 01:19:59,572
You faker.

1257
01:19:59,572 --> 01:20:01,657
It's not faking. It's Method.

1258
01:20:01,657 --> 01:20:04,869
Besides, how's a peach pit
ever supposed to become a tree

1259
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:07,663
if you never give it
the chance to grow?

1260
01:20:09,915 --> 01:20:12,751
And, hey, you stirred faster
and rolled higher.

1261
01:20:12,751 --> 01:20:15,754
But for the last time, the word is...

1262
01:20:22,887 --> 01:20:24,013
..."skadoosh."

1263
01:20:49,788 --> 01:20:52,499
Maybe Oogway was right about you.

1264
01:20:55,252 --> 01:20:57,588
You aren't completely useless after all.

1265
01:20:58,464 --> 01:21:00,007
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much.

1266
01:21:10,434 --> 01:21:12,895
That's my son.

1267
01:21:12,895 --> 01:21:14,063
Our son.

1268
01:21:15,105 --> 01:21:19,276
I think it's time you send us home, panda.

1269
01:21:53,686 --> 01:21:56,063
Zhen, do something!

1270
01:21:56,063 --> 01:21:59,859
Third rule:
No one's interested in your feelings.

1271
01:22:04,947 --> 01:22:08,951
See you on the other side, Dragon Warrior.

1272
01:22:31,432 --> 01:22:33,601
We packed some food
for your time in jail.

1273
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:36,395
Let's hope it's not
your final meal.

1274
01:22:36,395 --> 01:22:37,938
Thanks, guys.

1275
01:22:38,814 --> 01:22:43,527
I was thinking, after I serve my time
and I'm a free fox again,

1276
01:22:43,527 --> 01:22:46,363
maybe I'll open one of those
acupuncture places that are all the rage.

1277
01:22:46,363 --> 01:22:51,202
I think you're better suited for a job
with a little more room for growth.

1278
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:56,040
Jade Palace?

1279
01:22:57,875 --> 01:22:59,627
Her?

1280
01:22:59,627 --> 01:23:03,505
Out of all the candidates you choose
to train as your worthy successor,

1281
01:23:03,505 --> 01:23:05,216
you chose the fox?

1282
01:23:05,216 --> 01:23:07,301
You know when you know,
you know?

1283
01:23:07,301 --> 01:23:09,929
Fine, choose who you want.
A thief, a stick, a carrot.

1284
01:23:09,929 --> 01:23:11,722
I don't even know why I bother.

1285
01:23:11,722 --> 01:23:14,558
I'm going to go meditate... a lot.

1286
01:23:17,019 --> 01:23:18,896
Don't worry. He'll come around.

1287
01:23:19,563 --> 01:23:21,565
Probably. Maybe.

1288
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:24,944
Hey, you okay?

1289
01:23:26,904 --> 01:23:29,615
He's right.
What about me says I'm ready for this?

1290
01:23:30,824 --> 01:23:33,118
Well, as I learned
from working in my dad's kitchen,

1291
01:23:33,118 --> 01:23:37,706
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

1292
01:23:37,706 --> 01:23:39,792
Hey, that's not bad.

1293
01:23:39,792 --> 01:23:41,627
Okay, I see you, Spiritual Leader.

1294
01:23:41,627 --> 01:23:44,463
Yeah. I'm getting the hang of
this proverb thing.

1295
01:23:44,463 --> 01:23:47,591
One shouldn't do a deep squat
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

1296
01:23:47,591 --> 01:23:49,593
Maybe you should
just stick to kicking butt.

1297
01:23:49,593 --> 01:23:53,472
Money can't buy happiness,
but it sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

1298
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,808
Why does it always come back
to dumplings with you?

1299
01:23:55,808 --> 01:24:00,563
When life gives you lemons,
make pear juice and blow everyone's minds.

1300
01:24:00,563 --> 01:24:01,647
We get it.

1301
01:24:01,647 --> 01:24:04,567
You can't have your mooncake
and eat it too.

1302
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:08,404
Although, I guess you could have mooncake
and then order mango pudding on the side.

1303
01:24:08,404 --> 01:24:10,322
Can we just start the training now?

1304
01:24:12,908 --> 01:24:14,326
Inner peace.

1305
01:24:15,202 --> 01:24:16,662
Inner peace.

1306
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:18,747
Inner peace.

1307
01:24:18,747 --> 01:24:19,832
Hey, Master Shifu.

1308
01:24:19,832 --> 01:24:20,916
Look, there's two of us.

1309
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:23,043
- You're doing great, Shifu.
- You're not breathing with your belly.

1310
01:24:23,043 --> 01:24:24,879
- You look a little tired.
- Are you tired?

1311
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:28,841
- You do look like a squirrel.
- Do you want a cookie?

1312
01:24:33,596 --> 01:24:35,264
Inner peace.

1313
01:24:36,682 --> 01:24:38,142
Inner peace.

1314
01:24:39,518 --> 01:24:41,312
Inner peace.

1315
01:24:49,778 --> 01:24:51,572
Are you ready to begin your training?

1316
01:24:52,156 --> 01:24:53,407
Are you?

1317
01:24:53,407 --> 01:24:55,993
Yes, and I brought a little help.

1318
