1
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,033
It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood...

2
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,243
you know.

3
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:25,412
I've come a long way from being
the boy who was bit by a spider.

4
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,457
Back then, nothing seemed
to go right for me. Now...

5
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:30,000
Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

6
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,836
- Super cool!
- Spider-man!

7
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,004
People really like me.

8
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:36,924
Stick around. It's gonna start again
in a couple minutes.

9
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,426
That's okay.

10
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,596
The city is safe and sound.

11
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,723
I guess I've had something
to do with that.

12
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,226
My Uncle Ben would be proud.

13
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:55,151
I still get to school. Top of my class.

14
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,694
The Hamiltonian shows us...

15
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,073
that the energy levels
are perturbed by the electric field.

16
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:08,038
From the form of this matrix,
we can see...?

17
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,207
Miss Stacy?

18
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:13,669
That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.

19
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,881
Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.

20
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:24,263
Parker? You got something to add?

21
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,807
No, sir.

22
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:33,314
And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.

23
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,830
Hi.

24
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:54,793
Miss Watson left a ticket for me.
Peter Parker.

25
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:57,379
Excuse me. Sorry.

26
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,924
Thank you. Sorry.

27
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,349
I'm so nervous.

28
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,250
That's my girlfriend.

29
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,076
- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.

30
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:53,787
Harry?

31
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:55,372
Harry!

32
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,249
I need to talk to you.

33
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,918
Explain things.

34
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,549
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.

35
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,096
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.

36
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,273
M.J.!

37
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,734
- Peter!
- Congrats!

38
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,195
- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.

39
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,863
- You were...
- You said great.

40
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:32,409
I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.

41
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:36,497
- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

42
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:39,792
- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.

43
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,002
Tell me again. Was I really good?

44
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:44,546
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

45
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:47,216
- Your knees were fine.
- The applause wasn't very loud.

46
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,301
Yes, it was. Well, it's the acoustics.

47
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,638
It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.

48
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,641
When the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an...

49
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,768
You are such a nerd.

50
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,573
Did you see that one?

51
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,375
You know what?

52
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:08,547
I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life...

53
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,133
with you in the first row.

54
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,303
I'll be there.

55
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,515
Tell me you love me.

56
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,644
I love you.

57
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,355
I love you so much.

58
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,150
I always have.

59
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:17,324
- Ready?
- Yep.

60
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,275
You can't hide here, Flint.

61
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:19,863
- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.

62
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,784
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.

63
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:27,496
You're nothing but a common thief.

64
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,166
- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.

65
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,418
It wasn't.

66
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:36,046
I had good reason for what I was doing.

67
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,422
And that's the truth.

68
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:41,802
You and the truth, sitting in prison,
having three meals a day together.

69
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:44,554
I live in the presence of great truth...

70
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:47,057
and that is the truth
that you left behind...

71
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,018
right there in that bedroom.

72
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:04,741
Penny.

73
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:07,536
I missed you.

74
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:11,289
I miss you too, Daddy.

75
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,804
I promise, I'll make you healthy again.

76
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,932
Whatever it takes, I'll get the money.

77
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,144
You get out of here. Now.

78
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,823
I'm not a bad person.

79
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,411
Just had bad luck.

80
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:08,889
Peter, what is it?

81
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:11,850
It's M.J.

82
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:16,813
- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter.

83
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:23,612
The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.

84
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,614
And excited.

85
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,574
And very young.

86
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,660
And I loved him so fiercely.

87
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,871
- And you said yes, right?
- No.

88
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,457
I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

89
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,335
I wasn't ready. Neither was he.

90
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,837
So we took our time.

91
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,381
Looked forward to it.

92
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:47,135
Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.

93
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:51,389
A man has to be understanding...

94
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:54,601
and put his wife before himself.

95
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:57,938
Can you do that, Peter?

96
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:02,359
Yeah, I think I can.

97
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,821
Then you have my blessing.

98
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:11,034
I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.

99
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,538
Your uncle had it all planned.

100
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:16,665
He took me to the beach one Sunday.

101
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,042
Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit.

102
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:22,295
And I didn't look too bad myself.

103
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:24,464
We were very good swimmers.

104
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:27,175
And it was a beautiful day
and he said:

105
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:29,261
"Let's swim to the island."

106
00:15:29,427 --> 00:15:31,471
And at the island...

107
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,850
we found a perfect spot
by an old tree...

108
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:38,562
and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.

109
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:41,982
And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."

110
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:44,901
And I did.
And then he said, "Open them."

111
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:46,903
And I did.

112
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,906
And he was holding this ring.

113
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,742
Dazzling...

114
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,619
in front of me.

115
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,416
I thought it was the sun.

116
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,671
We'd be married 50 years...

117
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,425
come August if...

118
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,433
So...

119
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:23,440
I hope you'll make it very special
for Mary Jane.

120
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:27,319
Do something she'll never forget.

121
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,907
Give her this.

122
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:36,286
Go on. Take it.

123
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,949
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

124
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,205
Listen to me. I didn't kill your father.

125
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,042
He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself!

126
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,961
Shut up!

127
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:52,315
I'm still here, Peter.

128
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,424
Hate those things.

129
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:18,568
Harry?

130
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,990
Harry.

131
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,576
Harry.

132
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,540
Oh, my God.

133
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:41,466
Harry!

134
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:45,261
Come on!

135
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,599
God.

136
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,479
- Defib.
- Two hundred.

137
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,439
And clear.

138
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,815
No response.

139
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,776
- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.

140
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,237
- Charging.
- And clear.

141
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:03,529
No response.

142
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:06,908
Let's recharge and do it
one more time. And clear.

143
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,290
Captain Stacy.

144
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,167
- What's this?
- Flint Marko.

145
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,461
The guy we tied
to the Ben Parker homicide.

146
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,463
- What about him?
- Broke out of Rikers.

147
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,965
- And?
- He's on the run.

148
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:24,259
He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.

149
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,473
There he is!

150
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,828
You two, take the west side.
Tommy, take the east.

151
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:57,875
Where'd he go?

152
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,566
- Capacitors charged.
- Right.

153
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,860
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on one.

154
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,739
- There's a change in the silicon mass.
- It's probably a bird. It'll fly away.

155
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:29,657
Initiating demolecularization.

156
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,707
- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.

157
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:04,293
But there's been
some memory impairment.

158
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,129
Particularly his short-term memory.

159
00:25:06,295 --> 00:25:08,339
Right now he can't remember
the accident...

160
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,633
or anything that happened
to him recently.

161
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,051
Is it permanent?

162
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:15,263
It could be. Only time will tell.

163
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:17,849
He's awake if you wanna see him.

164
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:19,308
Maybe I should wait.

165
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:23,187
No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.

166
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,207
Hey, buddy.

167
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,334
Hey.

168
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:47,545
Hit my head.

169
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,338
Yeah.

170
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:51,841
Doctor said I was in an accident.

171
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,050
Hit-and-run.

172
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,345
I don't remember much of anything.

173
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,515
My father...

174
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:01,559
he died, right?

175
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,355
This is all so weird.

176
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:08,941
Hi.

177
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,236
- I got here as fast as I could.
- I know that face.

178
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,656
- How you doing?
- I don't know.

179
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:17,867
Last thing I remember, I was fine.

180
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,160
Somewhere.

181
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,162
You're still fine.

182
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,540
We love you, Harry.

183
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,210
It feels like...

184
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:31,506
somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.

185
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:34,759
And now I'm back home.

186
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:37,637
It's good to have you back.

187
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,724
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask
you guys to scoot, okay?

188
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,227
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

189
00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:46,354
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

190
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,523
Yeah. Great.

191
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,858
Get some sleep.

192
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,864
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I think so.

193
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,659
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

194
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:04,455
You have lovely friends.

195
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,707
My best friends.

196
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,504
I'd give my life for them.

197
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,320
- Yeah?
- It's me.

198
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:25,740
Hey.

199
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:28,284
Peter, you know I can't open the door.

200
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,119
It's stuck again?

201
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,455
Just come on and help me.

202
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:34,165
I'm coming.

203
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,590
- Hey.
- The review.

204
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,469
- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.

205
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:48,888
"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl...

206
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:51,182
easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.

207
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,642
Her small voice didn't
carry past the first row."

208
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:55,895
That's ridiculous, I was right there.

209
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:57,646
You were in the first row.

210
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:01,150
Yeah, this... Listen, you were great.

211
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,738
That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.

212
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:09,408
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.

213
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:13,579
This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.

214
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:17,583
I know, and I'm just saying,
you can't let it bring you down.

215
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,169
You gotta believe in yourself
and pull yourself together.

216
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,004
You get right back
on the horse and...

217
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,006
Don't give me the horse thing.

218
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,592
Try and understand how I feel.

219
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:33,224
It's just...

220
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,354
look at these words...

221
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:41,607
and it's like my father wrote them.

222
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,904
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of 54th
and Sixth Avenue, please report.

223
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,740
Crane out of control,
approach with caution.

224
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:54,954
"Go get them, tiger"?

225
00:31:56,997 --> 00:31:58,582
I'm sorry.

226
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,076
Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.

227
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,079
That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.

228
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,583
We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.

229
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,342
Shut it down at the generator. Now!

230
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:57,099
Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.

231
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,063
What is that thing doing
in my background?

232
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,550
They got some kind of short.
Can't shut down the crane.

233
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:34,511
Get Edison on the phone.
Kill the power to the whole block.

234
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:39,308
Are you all right?

235
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,060
It's coming back.

236
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,188
Oh, no.

237
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,923
- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?

238
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:17,513
What's she doing up there?

239
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,474
I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modeling gig.

240
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,602
- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

241
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,688
And I work at the Daily Bugle.

242
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:28,607
And I'm dating your daughter.

243
00:35:23,912 --> 00:35:25,164
You okay?

244
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,875
Yeah, I'm fine.

245
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,126
Thank you.

246
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,670
Hey, Spidey, hold on.
Bugle needs a photo.

247
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:33,672
- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy!

248
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,009
- Hey. I'm the new guy.
- New guy?

249
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,427
Sweetie.

250
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,720
You okay?

251
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,765
From now on, I am gonna be
taking shots of you for the Bugle.

252
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:45,768
So smile.
Are you smiling? Just kidding.

253
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:48,270
- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?

254
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:53,067
Yeah, look, just between you and me,
guy's kind of an amateur.

255
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,944
Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?

256
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:57,780
Just... Yeah, a little chunky.

257
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:00,407
Okay.

258
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,161
But you don't have to worry
about that anymore, buddy.

259
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:13,462
Dazzle me.

260
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:23,972
Just something the boys in
the Ad Department and I whipped up.

261
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:27,059
As you know, circulation at the Bugle's
been pretty good.

262
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,144
Though not as good
as The New York Times.

263
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:32,022
Or the Daily News, or the Post,
or several other smaller...

264
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:34,191
Get on with it, you moron...!

265
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,360
- What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson.

266
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,696
- Your wife told you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...

267
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:45,077
Thank you.

268
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,998
So I propose this campaign.

269
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:52,626
"Daily Bugle." That's obvious.

270
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,921
"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.

271
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,550
"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.

272
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:02,052
We gave him a couple lattes, he's like:

273
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:05,180
"And how." That's me again.

274
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,432
Time to take your pill.

275
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,352
Not that one.

276
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,813
Not that one.

277
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:23,365
Drink plenty of water.

278
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,704
Thank you.

279
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,040
Continue.

280
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,255
- He's busy.
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.

281
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,965
What's that smell?

282
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:43,427
That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?

283
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,220
It's called Go Away.

284
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:47,347
That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had...

285
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:50,392
- and you have had some doozies!
- Blood pressure.

286
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:52,561
Hey, where are you going?

287
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,815
- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.

288
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:59,860
- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

289
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,363
Can I just say I really like that shirt?
It's the crane accident.

290
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,407
- Check out the light.
- He likes my shirt.

291
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,700
- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.

292
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,619
You better get in there. New guy.

293
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:11,622
He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.

294
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,708
Thanks.

295
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,836
Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner beat you to it.

296
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:19,588
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.

297
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,090
- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.

298
00:38:22,257 --> 00:38:24,635
I didn't see you there.
How'd you get that high?

299
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:27,638
- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?

300
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:30,557
- Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

301
00:38:30,724 --> 00:38:32,100
- It's better.
- Cheaper too.

302
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:34,978
Congratulations, we'll use yours.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

303
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:36,563
All right, J.J., I'm your man.

304
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,441
I know more about a good picture
than any photographer.

305
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,320
See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, flagpoles or whatever.

306
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,697
It's about lighting.
Composition. Drama.

307
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,033
I want a staff job, sir.

308
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,370
I have a girl that I intend to marry...

309
00:38:51,536 --> 00:38:54,456
and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream...

310
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:58,085
of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time.

311
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,003
J. Jonah Jameson.

312
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,260
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?

313
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:07,594
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

314
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:10,722
I know what makes a good picture
and I've been here a long time.

315
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:12,975
If there's a staff job,
I think I deserve it.

316
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:16,895
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us
for years. He's done a great job.

317
00:39:17,062 --> 00:39:19,022
You want a staff job,
you want a staff job.

318
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:21,024
- Anybody care about what I want?
- I do.

319
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,985
Shut up. Get out.

320
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:26,613
I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.

321
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,617
He's a fake, he's full of stick um.
Catch him in the act.

322
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:33,453
Spider-Man with his hand
in a cookie jar.

323
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,580
Whoever brings me that photo gets a job.

324
00:39:35,747 --> 00:39:37,666
What're you waiting for,
Chinese New Year?

325
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,251
I'm on it, boss.

326
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:43,505
- You'll never get that shot.
- Oh, we'll see.

327
00:39:57,894 --> 00:40:03,025
You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.

328
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:06,236
Enough said.

329
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,036
Welcome home, Harry.

330
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,206
- Thank God you're all right.
- Thanks, Bernard.

331
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:20,542
- Bernard.
- Sir.

332
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:25,047
Got you a little homecoming present.

333
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,841
- It's your old ball.
- Yeah.

334
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,092
Thanks, buddy.

335
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,137
We were pretty good in the backyard,
weren't we?

336
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:35,974
We were terrible.
And we tried out for the varsity team.

337
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:38,185
- For the cheerleaders.
- Right.

338
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,896
- Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
- I don't know.

339
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,230
You don't?

340
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,400
Hey, Bernard. Do I have any girlfriends?

341
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:48,070
Not that I know of, sir.

342
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:55,243
It's a pretty cool pad, huh?

343
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,079
It's okay.

344
00:40:57,245 --> 00:41:00,207
- Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
- No.

345
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:04,169
Well, maybe I can turn
this no-girlfriend thing around.

346
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:16,807
You know, he always appreciated how
you helped me through high school.

347
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,935
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

348
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:24,940
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

349
00:41:26,024 --> 00:41:30,445
Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.

350
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:31,738
Okay.

351
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,533
Heads up.

352
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:38,912
Did you see that?

353
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:41,915
- Still got the moves.
- Yeah.

354
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,700
Why are we stopping?

355
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:21,872
What is she doing here?

356
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:23,957
Well, Gary was supposed
to call her agent.

357
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:29,254
Hi, honey. We tried to reach you.

358
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,964
I'm sorry.

359
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,592
- One critic?
- No, all the papers, dear.

360
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:37,012
Mary Jane, honey, sit down.
Let us explain it to you.

361
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,764
Listen, if you'd like,
we could say you became ill.

362
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,777
That was so poorly handled.

363
00:42:52,944 --> 00:42:54,446
Yeah.

364
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:56,781
Let's just rehearse.

365
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,831
All right, Spidey!

366
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,977
Go, Spidey!

367
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,688
All right!

368
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,112
Yeah, Spidey!

369
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,121
Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!

370
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:48,875
Excuse me, miss? Could I please see
that gorgeous smile?

371
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,710
Hi, Eddie.

372
00:43:50,877 --> 00:43:54,130
You're so beautiful.
This is front-page stuff.

373
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:55,882
I gotta practice. See you later.

374
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:57,926
- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

375
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,553
Why not?

376
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:03,598
What about that amazing,
amazing night that we had?

377
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:07,852
We had a coffee, Eddie.

378
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:09,729
Hey, beautiful!

379
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,856
One more.

380
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,487
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

381
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:21,825
- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, Peter, I'm proud of you.

382
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,077
Hey, I'm gonna be swinging in
from over there.

383
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,871
- Oh, yeah?
- So you know where to look.

384
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,249
Give them a good show.

385
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,501
Don't worry about that review.

386
00:44:31,668 --> 00:44:35,171
We're gonna be laughing about it
tomorrow night, I promise.

387
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:36,881
Yeah.

388
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:56,276
Isn't that that guy from that prison break?

389
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,902
He fits.

390
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:00,530
Hey, you. Halt!

391
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,033
Cover the back.

392
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,331
- Hon, be careful.
- Come on, let's go.

393
00:45:57,128 --> 00:45:58,296
He's in the truck!

394
00:45:58,463 --> 00:46:00,340
Around the front!

395
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,979
Fire!

396
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,714
People of the city of New York...

397
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,384
I am here today
because I fell 62 stories...

398
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,177
and someone caught me.

399
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:49,347
Someone who never asks
for anything in return.

400
00:46:49,514 --> 00:46:53,184
Someone who doesn't even want us
to know who he is.

401
00:46:53,351 --> 00:46:54,436
Hey, M.J.

402
00:46:54,602 --> 00:46:56,980
- Harry!
- Hey.

403
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,523
Where's Pete?

404
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:01,443
- Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
- Right.

405
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:04,404
I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.

406
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,905
I've never felt better.

407
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:08,199
It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.

408
00:47:08,366 --> 00:47:11,161
Bump on the head,
I'm as free as a bird.

409
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:13,621
Will you bump me on the head?

410
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,084
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

411
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:20,920
You came. You sent me flowers.

412
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,548
I did? I'll come again tonight.

413
00:47:24,215 --> 00:47:27,302
You can't. I was let go.

414
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,179
What happened?

415
00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:32,265
I wasn't very good.

416
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,810
You know, this is embarrassing...

417
00:47:35,977 --> 00:47:38,271
but I once wrote you a play
in high school.

418
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,106
- You wrote me a play?
- Yeah.

419
00:47:40,273 --> 00:47:41,858
Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

420
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,236
So I ask you: When you're dropping
without a parachute...

421
00:47:45,403 --> 00:47:48,823
or your store's being robbed,
or your house is on fire...

422
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,075
who is it that breaks your fall...

423
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:54,913
puts out the flames
and saves your children?

424
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:56,748
Spider-Man!

425
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:57,999
They love me.

426
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,503
Then let's hear it
for your one and only...

427
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:06,174
friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!

428
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:21,397
Hey. What's up? All right.
How you doing?

429
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,984
Shazam!

430
00:48:26,986 --> 00:48:28,029
Hey, guys.

431
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,823
Spider-Man. Spider-Man.

432
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:32,158
Hey there. Hi.

433
00:48:34,035 --> 00:48:35,286
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.

434
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:38,164
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

435
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:40,792
Go ahead, lay one on me.

436
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,752
- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

437
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,420
- Kiss her.
- Kiss him.

438
00:48:44,587 --> 00:48:45,880
No, Spider-Man, no.

439
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:47,924
All right.

440
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:59,394
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

441
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,776
Hey, hey, are you okay?

442
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,486
Yeah, I'm fine.

443
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,284
Hey, man,
we got something on the roof.

444
00:50:18,973 --> 00:50:20,099
Jig's up, pal.

445
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,770
I don't wanna hurt you. Leave now.

446
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:27,190
I guess you haven't heard.
I'm the sheriff around these parts.

447
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,399
Okay.

448
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,564
Help!

449
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,560
Where do all these guys come from?

450
00:52:39,113 --> 00:52:40,865
I'm sorry, I don't speak...

451
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,910
But this is a French restaurant, non?

452
00:52:47,288 --> 00:52:49,957
- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

453
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,088
Here we are.

454
00:52:55,254 --> 00:52:57,423
Table for two. Parker.

455
00:52:58,549 --> 00:53:00,718
- Parker.
- That is what I said:

456
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,678
Parker.

457
00:53:05,598 --> 00:53:07,058
I have a request.

458
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:11,646
My girlfriend will be coming
and I have this ring.

459
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:18,361
Hello.

460
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,572
Oh, so you want to pop
the question tonight, huh?

461
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:24,575
Yes, and I wanna do something
very special.

462
00:53:24,742 --> 00:53:27,203
I love it. Romance.

463
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,913
I am French.

464
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:34,502
When I signal you, if you'd bring
some champagne with the ring...

465
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,963
- In the bottom of her glass?
- Perfect.

466
00:53:37,922 --> 00:53:40,216
Also, I thought at the same time...

467
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,928
If the musicians would play this song...

468
00:53:45,012 --> 00:53:47,056
Their favorite.

469
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:49,934
And take good care of the ring.

470
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,645
Oui, with my life, monsieur.

471
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,358
I like you.

472
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,988
Thank you.

473
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:15,418
Okay, so...

474
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,296
Oh, would you like some champagne?

475
00:54:21,966 --> 00:54:24,051
How'd that get in there?

476
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,513
Oh, don't cry.

477
00:54:32,643 --> 00:54:34,061
Hi.

478
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,939
Look at you. Wow, beautiful.

479
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:38,691
Thanks.

480
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,488
This place in your budget?

481
00:54:44,655 --> 00:54:46,824
Oh, well, it's a special occasion.

482
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,076
You're on Broadway.

483
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:52,455
I don't feel like much of a star tonight.

484
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,917
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.

485
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:57,668
Peter...

486
00:54:59,253 --> 00:55:01,214
you have no idea
how I feel right now.

487
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,383
Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel.

488
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,011
Listen, I have been through this.

489
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,305
It happens to me all the time.

490
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,432
I see Spider-Man posters
in the window...

491
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,935
kids running around
with me on their sweaters...

492
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:15,770
Big Halloween item.

493
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:18,773
I don't know, I guess
I've become something of an icon.

494
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,611
Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."

495
00:55:24,278 --> 00:55:27,865
I don't know, you know,
I mean, I'm thinking to myself:

496
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:31,953
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens.
Do I deserve this?"

497
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,331
Hi, Pete.

498
00:55:35,748 --> 00:55:36,791
Hi.

499
00:55:44,715 --> 00:55:47,593
Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.

500
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,513
- Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
- Hi.

501
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,057
This is Mary Jane Watson.

502
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:58,396
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
Pete talks about you all the time.

503
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:04,485
Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.

504
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,822
Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.

505
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,907
Which actually reminds me...

506
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:13,244
Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man...

507
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,663
could you bring it to class?

508
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,709
I'd really love it. For my portfolio.

509
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:23,087
After all, who gets kissed
by Spider-Man, right?

510
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:25,589
I can't imagine.

511
00:56:26,757 --> 00:56:29,468
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

512
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,929
- Good night.
- Good night.

513
00:56:43,065 --> 00:56:45,151
Oh, she's in my science class.

514
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,194
It's not her best subject.

515
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:50,781
What?

516
00:56:50,948 --> 00:56:53,200
How come you never mentioned her?

517
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,704
She's your lab partner?

518
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:59,165
You saved her life?

519
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,833
She thinks you're a genius...

520
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,295
and she had her polished fingernails
all over you?

521
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,005
Or didn't you notice?

522
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:10,760
And she gave Spider-Man
the key to the city.

523
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,013
I'll never forget that.

524
00:57:17,558 --> 00:57:19,143
She's just a girl in my class.

525
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,103
Let me ask you something.

526
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,230
When you kissed her...

527
00:57:23,397 --> 00:57:25,816
who was kissing her?

528
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:28,694
Spider-Man or Peter?

529
00:57:28,861 --> 00:57:31,781
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

530
00:57:31,947 --> 00:57:34,116
That was our Kiss.

531
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:35,951
Why would you do that?

532
00:57:36,827 --> 00:57:39,997
You must have known
how it'd make me feel.

533
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:44,043
- Do you wanna push me away?
- Push you away?

534
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,754
Why would I wanna push you away?
I love you.

535
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:50,883
You're my girlfriend.
She's a girl in my class, M.J.

536
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,512
I don't feel well.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

537
00:57:54,678 --> 00:57:55,763
No, w...

538
00:57:57,306 --> 00:58:00,267
- Where are you going?
- Please, don't follow me.

539
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,106
Here we are.

540
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,645
Hi, it's M.J.
Sing your song at the beep.

541
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:47,481
Hello.

542
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:53,904
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on, or...

543
00:58:54,071 --> 00:58:57,074
I don't know
if you got the messages or what.

544
00:58:57,616 --> 00:58:58,742
But...

545
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,204
I just wanna talk to you.

546
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,292
Okay, call me. Bye.

547
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,221
- Hello?
- Mr. Parker?

548
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:20,514
Yeah?

549
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:23,184
This is Detective Neil Garrett
from the 32nd Precinct.

550
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:25,144
I'm calling
on behalf of Captain Stacy.

551
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,730
He would like you
to come down to the station.

552
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:31,358
Originally, we thought that this man,
Dennis Carradine...

553
00:59:31,525 --> 00:59:33,402
was your husband's killer.

554
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:35,446
We were wrong.

555
00:59:35,946 --> 00:59:37,031
What?

556
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,034
Turns out
Mr. Carradine was only an accomplice.

557
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,620
The actual killer is still at large.

558
00:59:42,786 --> 00:59:44,497
What are you talking about?

559
00:59:44,663 --> 00:59:47,416
This is the man
who killed your husband.

560
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,214
His name is Flint Marko.

561
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,383
He's a small-time crook
who's been in and out of prison.

562
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,010
You got this wrong.

563
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,386
Two days ago he escaped.

564
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:02,890
Evidently, he confessed his guilt
to a cellmate...

565
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:06,894
<i>and we have a couple of witnesses
who will corroborate the story.</i>

566
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:21,575
No, wait, son. You don't wanna do this.

567
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,205
No!

568
01:00:35,047 --> 01:00:37,841
Hey, get in! What are you doing?

569
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,571
Would you put these photos away,
please?

570
01:00:58,737 --> 01:01:00,990
I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker.
I know this isn't easy...

571
01:01:01,156 --> 01:01:03,617
but, please, be patient with us.

572
01:01:03,784 --> 01:01:05,619
We're doing our job.
We will catch him.

573
01:01:05,786 --> 01:01:07,454
No, you're not doing your job.

574
01:01:07,621 --> 01:01:10,416
I watched my uncle die,
and we chased down the wrong man.

575
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,627
<i>Now you're telling me you had
suspicions for two years? Witnesses?</i>

576
01:01:13,794 --> 01:01:15,963
- Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down.

577
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,881
I have no intention of settling down.

578
01:01:18,048 --> 01:01:20,634
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!

579
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:31,186
L-20 Parkway.

580
01:01:31,353 --> 01:01:33,981
All officers in the vicinity,
please report.

581
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,608
We have an abandoned vehicle...

582
01:01:35,774 --> 01:01:38,027
and an elderly man
in the middle of the street.

583
01:01:38,193 --> 01:01:40,529
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.

584
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,783
Peter, it's M.J.

585
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,287
I'm not here about
what happened at dinner.

586
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,663
Just please open up.

587
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,673
Aunt May called me.
She told me about what happened.

588
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,467
She's worried about you.

589
01:02:02,134 --> 01:02:03,719
I'm worried about you.

590
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,346
Don't be. I'm fine.

591
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:07,890
I don't want you
to do something stupid.

592
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,517
Like try to find my uncle's killer?

593
01:02:10,684 --> 01:02:13,020
And do something you'll regret.

594
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:16,190
Like with that other guy.

595
01:02:16,732 --> 01:02:20,069
He had a gun on me. I made a move
and he fell. I told you that.

596
01:02:20,235 --> 01:02:23,489
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
- Ten-22, auto at 556...

597
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:27,576
- Will you turn that thing off?
- Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.

598
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:32,581
Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9 responding
to your Sixth Avenue call.

599
01:02:32,748 --> 01:02:36,168
Peter, I'm here
because I care about you.

600
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,880
And I know that you made a mistake
and that you feel guilty...

601
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:43,592
but I wanna be here for you.

602
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:46,887
Okay. I get it. Thank you.

603
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,598
But I'm fine. I...

604
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:51,642
I don't need your help.

605
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,944
Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter.

606
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,946
Even Spider-Man.

607
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:14,748
Ninety X-ray, 98.

608
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:21,213
Two-four King, respond to 1031
at 642 Madison Ave.

609
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:26,427
One-three Thomas, respond to 1020
at 540 East 107.

610
01:03:26,593 --> 01:03:30,431
Male complainant inside apartment.
May be on first floor.

611
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:38,272
Three Henry 10-11,
I have a residence. 73815...

612
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,333
Don't hurt me.
Just give me a chance!

613
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,461
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?

614
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:43,921
Did you?

615
01:04:55,849 --> 01:04:57,810
Where am I?

616
01:05:13,992 --> 01:05:15,702
What is this?

617
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,540
I feel...

618
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:26,380
This feels good.

619
01:05:38,183 --> 01:05:40,143
Yeah!

620
01:05:56,368 --> 01:05:57,995
This is something else.

621
01:06:00,038 --> 01:06:01,415
What do you think?

622
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,667
I've never seen anything like it.

623
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,669
I'm a physicist, not a biologist...

624
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:08,547
but let me look at it in the morning.
Run some tests.

625
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:09,882
Can we do that now?

626
01:06:14,636 --> 01:06:17,055
It seems to like you.

627
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:22,144
- Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?

628
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,897
It has the characteristics
of a symbiote...

629
01:06:25,063 --> 01:06:28,191
which needs to bond
to a host to survive.

630
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:31,945
And sometimes these things in nature,
when they bind...

631
01:06:32,112 --> 01:06:34,489
they can be hard to unbind.

632
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:39,620
Bank robbery in progress,
First Eastern Bank at 202 Bismark.

633
01:06:39,786 --> 01:06:42,331
Another sandstorm
is reported in the vicinity.

634
01:06:42,497 --> 01:06:45,709
- All cars proceed with caution.
- Marko.

635
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:43,016
Buddy, love the new outfit.

636
01:07:43,183 --> 01:07:45,185
This is exactly what I need
to scoop Parker.

637
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,104
Give me some of that web action.

638
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,024
See you, chump.

639
01:07:52,442 --> 01:07:54,361
What the hell?!

640
01:08:36,486 --> 01:08:37,779
Flint Marko.

641
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:43,618
- What do you want from me?
- Remember Ben Parker?

642
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:47,456
The old man you shot down
in cold blood?

643
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,667
What does it matter to you anyway?

644
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:53,795
Everything!

645
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:33,835
It's time to pay, Marko!

646
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:45,782
Good riddance.

647
01:11:06,678 --> 01:11:09,472
- Rent.
- Not now.

648
01:11:09,639 --> 01:11:12,350
Listen, it's a free country.
It's not rent-free country.

649
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,728
- Leave me alone.
- Give me rent.

650
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:17,856
You'll get your rent
when you fix this damn door!

651
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:30,952
That wasn't cool.

652
01:11:31,244 --> 01:11:35,415
He is a good boy.

653
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:39,002
He must be in some kind of trouble.

654
01:12:27,133 --> 01:12:30,428
Flint Marko,
the man who killed Uncle Ben...

655
01:12:31,304 --> 01:12:33,848
he was killed last night.

656
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:35,475
Oh, my.

657
01:12:36,184 --> 01:12:37,269
What happened?

658
01:12:37,769 --> 01:12:39,354
Spider-Man killed him.

659
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:42,482
Spider-Man?

660
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:45,277
I don't understand.

661
01:12:45,443 --> 01:12:48,280
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

662
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,741
What happened?

663
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:56,037
I...

664
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,373
He...

665
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,709
He was...

666
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:07,757
I thought that you'd feel...

667
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:12,262
He deserved it, didn't he?

668
01:13:12,887 --> 01:13:14,681
I don't think it's for us to say...

669
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:18,852
whether a person deserves
to live or die.

670
01:13:19,227 --> 01:13:22,063
But, Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben.

671
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,733
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

672
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:28,403
But he wouldn't want us
living one second...

673
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,281
with revenge in our hearts.

674
01:13:33,616 --> 01:13:36,161
It's like a poison. It can...

675
01:13:36,953 --> 01:13:39,080
It can take you over.

676
01:13:40,957 --> 01:13:43,084
Before you know it...

677
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:45,962
turn us into something ugly.

678
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:02,645
- He said it was a good idea.
- Yeah.

679
01:14:47,607 --> 01:14:48,775
Hello?

680
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,485
Hey, Harry, it's M.J.

681
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:51,736
Hi.

682
01:14:51,903 --> 01:14:53,321
I need some company.

683
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:55,782
Are you doing anything?
Can I stop by?

684
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:58,159
Yeah, sure, come on over.

685
01:14:58,326 --> 01:15:00,662
Okay. Are you sure it's okay?

686
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,415
No, I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.

687
01:15:03,581 --> 01:15:06,126
- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Great.

688
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:07,836
Bye.

689
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,005
- Bernard.
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?

690
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:13,425
We're having a guest.
Can you get some food?

691
01:15:13,591 --> 01:15:15,802
- A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.

692
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:19,347
- A "guest" guest?
- Will you just get some food?

693
01:15:19,514 --> 01:15:21,141
Right away, sir.

694
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:40,910
Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch.

695
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:44,330
- An orange?
- No, thanks.

696
01:15:44,497 --> 01:15:48,418
Listen, I'm really sorry
for what happened earlier.

697
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:51,505
I shouldn't have yelled about that door.
It was nothing to be angry about.

698
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,007
It's no big deal.

699
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:58,261
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza sometime.

700
01:15:58,428 --> 01:15:59,721
Today's good.

701
01:16:00,346 --> 01:16:01,723
Okay.

702
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,559
- Have problem with the phone?
- No, no. I was just...

703
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,769
Well, I was trying
to figure out what to say.

704
01:16:06,936 --> 01:16:10,565
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say:

705
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:14,194
"You're a good woman.
I am good man.”

706
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:21,075
-Hi, Pete.

707
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:22,535
He's calling a woman.

708
01:16:22,702 --> 01:16:24,621
Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...

709
01:16:24,787 --> 01:16:28,666
This is none of your business.
Go. Go. Call.

710
01:16:30,376 --> 01:16:32,962
- You should call.
- Thanks.

711
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:37,759
- Bye.
- Bye.

712
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:52,732
Hi.

713
01:16:55,818 --> 01:16:58,321
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

714
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:00,990
Come on.

715
01:17:04,994 --> 01:17:07,413
- I hope you like peppers.
- I love them.

716
01:17:31,312 --> 01:17:33,231
No. Please.

717
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,411
Oh, the butter.

718
01:17:56,504 --> 01:17:58,214
Beautiful.

719
01:18:02,677 --> 01:18:04,387
Check this out.

720
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:13,855
Well, we can use that part.

721
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:17,650
You've been dreaming.

722
01:18:17,817 --> 01:18:21,195
Nothing like a little self-deception
to get you through the night.

723
01:18:21,362 --> 01:18:24,198
- All right.
- When did you write that?

724
01:18:24,365 --> 01:18:26,909
- Twelfth grade.
- It's intense.

725
01:18:27,076 --> 01:18:30,747
- So you want the part?
- I'd love to be in your play.

726
01:18:30,913 --> 01:18:32,498
It's yours.

727
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:38,129
You know, there's not even a scar.

728
01:18:39,589 --> 01:18:41,299
Barely.

729
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:00,401
- Sorry.
- Me too.

730
01:19:00,568 --> 01:19:04,656
- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.

731
01:19:05,865 --> 01:19:07,033
Mary Jane.

732
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:10,328
Mary Jane.

733
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:13,790
- Mary Jane, please.
- I'm sorry.

734
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:15,708
Just...

735
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:31,224
You've taken your eye off the ball.

736
01:19:37,271 --> 01:19:38,773
Harry.

737
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,162
What have you done?!

738
01:19:55,915 --> 01:19:57,375
Avenge me!

739
01:20:00,586 --> 01:20:04,674
- My father, he died, right?
- Yeah.

740
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:07,051
Just wish I could remember
more about him.

741
01:20:07,218 --> 01:20:10,054
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.

742
01:20:10,221 --> 01:20:13,516
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

743
01:20:14,183 --> 01:20:15,810
Harry.

744
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:19,689
Remember me?

745
01:20:21,524 --> 01:20:24,527
Yes, Father. I remember.

746
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:27,905
I was right about her. About Peter.

747
01:20:28,072 --> 01:20:30,324
About everything.

748
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:35,455
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer.

749
01:20:35,621 --> 01:20:37,957
Make him wish he were dead.

750
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:42,086
First, we attack his heart!

751
01:20:52,346 --> 01:20:55,349
Hi, it's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

752
01:20:55,516 --> 01:20:58,186
Hey, M.J. It's Peter.

753
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:03,316
I wanna talk to you about last night.

754
01:21:03,983 --> 01:21:06,068
I don't know what I was thinking.

755
01:21:06,235 --> 01:21:11,157
I know you were just there
to help and I...

756
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:14,160
I don't know. I wanna see you.

757
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:22,585
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.

758
01:21:26,714 --> 01:21:28,341
- Yeah?
- It's Ursula.

759
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:30,092
Come in.

760
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,686
-Hi, Pete.

761
01:21:40,853 --> 01:21:43,022
There's a phone call for you.

762
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,150
It's Mary Jane, she called back.

763
01:21:46,317 --> 01:21:48,236
- Really?
- Yeah.

764
01:21:49,904 --> 01:21:55,117
- I put the phone on top of the thing.
- Thanks. Okay.

765
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:59,163
-Hey.

766
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,999
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to...

767
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:04,961
- Can you meet me?
- You bet.

768
01:22:05,127 --> 01:22:07,547
- Now?
- Okay. Where?

769
01:22:07,713 --> 01:22:09,549
At the bridge in the park.

770
01:22:09,715 --> 01:22:11,050
- On my way.
- Okay.

771
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:14,220
Okay. Hey. I love you.

772
01:22:33,489 --> 01:22:35,575
You look beautiful.

773
01:22:36,909 --> 01:22:38,452
Peonies.

774
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:43,583
- You okay?
- No.

775
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:46,586
There's something
I have to tell you, Pete.

776
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:48,546
Okay.

777
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:51,465
It's not working.

778
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,135
You and me.

779
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:56,637
What?

780
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:59,348
I don't wanna see you anymore.

781
01:22:59,974 --> 01:23:01,767
What are you talking about?

782
01:23:01,934 --> 01:23:03,978
I don't know.

783
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,482
I'm lonely.

784
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:11,944
You aren't there for me.

785
01:23:13,112 --> 01:23:15,531
I can't do this.

786
01:23:15,698 --> 01:23:17,700
- It's over.
- No.

787
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:20,995
Please. Please don't say that.

788
01:23:21,954 --> 01:23:24,790
I know I've been selfish,
but I can do better. I can change.

789
01:23:24,957 --> 01:23:28,544
- It's not that simple.
- We love each other. I love you.

790
01:23:28,711 --> 01:23:30,922
We have problems.
When people have problems...

791
01:23:31,088 --> 01:23:33,799
they work it out.
They talk to each other.

792
01:23:38,804 --> 01:23:40,640
Look, you see?

793
01:23:41,849 --> 01:23:43,893
You know what this is?

794
01:23:45,102 --> 01:23:48,189
- You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else!

795
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,150
I've fallen in love with someone else.

796
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,465
Bravo.

797
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,854
She says that she's lonely,
that I'm not there for her.

798
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,608
There's another guy.

799
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:37,363
Well, how you holding up?

800
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:39,824
Not good.

801
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,787
Harry, I was gonna propose to her.

802
01:24:45,454 --> 01:24:46,956
Really?

803
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:53,170
Well, she's been going through
a tough time lately. Career.

804
01:24:53,337 --> 01:24:56,173
I mean, a singing waitress
at a jazz club?

805
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,176
It's not exactly
what she had in mind for herself.

806
01:24:59,343 --> 01:25:02,596
Singing waitress? What are you...?
What are you talking about?

807
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:05,307
Well, she was fired from the show.

808
01:25:05,474 --> 01:25:07,309
Didn't she tell you?

809
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:09,061
She was fired?

810
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:13,607
She was fired and she told you?

811
01:25:13,774 --> 01:25:15,901
She didn't tell me?

812
01:25:17,486 --> 01:25:19,989
Well, that's why I asked you here, Pete.

813
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,200
I'm the other guy.

814
01:25:25,077 --> 01:25:26,829
What?

815
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:29,999
Look, she came to me one afternoon,
troubled.

816
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:33,085
She needed someone
and I was there for her.

817
01:25:33,961 --> 01:25:37,048
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.

818
01:25:37,214 --> 01:25:39,008
It just...

819
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:41,177
started.

820
01:25:48,559 --> 01:25:51,896
I don't believe this.
I don't... I don't believe you.

821
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:54,398
Look, I'm really sorry.

822
01:25:55,941 --> 01:25:58,277
I just thought you should know.

823
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:09,705
- Can I warm you up?
- Yes, please.

824
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:13,250
How's the pie?

825
01:26:14,001 --> 01:26:15,669
So good.

826
01:27:19,024 --> 01:27:20,860
Would you like a drink?

827
01:27:23,654 --> 01:27:26,240
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

828
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,826
Bad for the public image,
right, Mr. Key-to-the-City?

829
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:30,327
What did you do to her?

830
01:27:32,454 --> 01:27:35,207
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.

831
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:38,335
Mary Jane and I,
we understand each other.

832
01:27:38,502 --> 01:27:43,507
- She doesn't know what you are.
- Peter, she knows me very well.

833
01:27:43,674 --> 01:27:47,845
And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.

834
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:49,972
That taste...

835
01:27:51,473 --> 01:27:52,850
Strawberries.

836
01:28:28,552 --> 01:28:30,054
How'd you like that, Spidey?

837
01:28:33,933 --> 01:28:35,226
That all you got?

838
01:28:42,566 --> 01:28:45,110
- Stings, doesn't it?
- I protected you in high school.

839
01:28:45,277 --> 01:28:47,446
Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.

840
01:29:34,785 --> 01:29:36,662
Gonna kill me
like you killed my father?

841
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:38,956
I'm done trying to convince you.

842
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:41,625
You took him from me.

843
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:43,210
He loved me.

844
01:29:43,377 --> 01:29:44,753
No.

845
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:47,339
He despised you.

846
01:29:47,506 --> 01:29:49,717
You were an embarrassment to him.

847
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:57,308
Look at little Goblin Junior.
Gonna cry?

848
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:36,513
Spider-Man used to make me feel safe.

849
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,599
Now I'm afraid to walk home from work.

850
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:42,436
- My son thought the world of this guy.
- I have a daughter, loves Spider-Man.

851
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:45,814
- Who's she to look up to now?
- This is the guy they gave the key to?

852
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:50,027
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.

853
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:55,199
- Cheers to the new staff photographer.
- Hey, I just got lucky.

854
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:56,950
This is so wonderful for you.

855
01:30:57,117 --> 01:31:00,913
Well, you might wanna tell J.J.
to make a little more wall space.

856
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:09,421
Wow, good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

857
01:31:09,588 --> 01:31:12,007
What was it you said?
I'll never get that picture?

858
01:31:12,674 --> 01:31:14,593
There's your hero.

859
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:19,681
- I never thought he'd really do that.
- See? Right there.

860
01:31:19,848 --> 01:31:22,476
You made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.

861
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,019
Funny you should say that...

862
01:31:24,186 --> 01:31:28,357
because I was looking through
some old photos and it looks very...

863
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:30,442
Similar.

864
01:31:31,568 --> 01:31:34,446
Okay. Well, I gotta get back to work.

865
01:31:35,697 --> 01:31:38,659
- You're trash, Brock.
- Excuse me?

866
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,786
Your picture's a fake.

867
01:31:43,288 --> 01:31:45,791
Parker, you are such a boy scout.

868
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:48,043
When are you gonna give
a guy a break?

869
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,339
You want forgiveness? Get religion.

870
01:31:52,506 --> 01:31:56,093
- What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?

871
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:02,808
Yeah. No, we...
We're just horsing around.

872
01:32:03,142 --> 01:32:07,187
Look, I'm begging you.
If you do this, I will lose everything.

873
01:32:07,354 --> 01:32:09,606
There's not a paper in town
that will hire me.

874
01:32:09,773 --> 01:32:12,109
You should've thought of that earlier.

875
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:15,070
What are you doing, Peter?

876
01:32:15,237 --> 01:32:19,450
Show this to your editor.
Tell him to check his source next time.

877
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,207
It's a fake.

878
01:32:27,374 --> 01:32:31,336
Empire State
Photographic Department confirms it.

879
01:32:34,965 --> 01:32:36,925
Pack your things.
Get out of my building.

880
01:32:37,342 --> 01:32:39,553
- I was just trying...
- You're fired!

881
01:32:41,096 --> 01:32:43,515
We're gonna have to print
a retraction now.

882
01:32:43,682 --> 01:32:45,642
I haven't printed a retraction
in 20 years!

883
01:32:51,773 --> 01:32:54,526
- Hello.
- Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.

884
01:32:54,693 --> 01:32:56,153
Oh, Dr. Connors.

885
01:32:57,321 --> 01:32:58,864
How are you?

886
01:32:59,031 --> 01:33:02,242
Quite a specimen you left me, Parker.

887
01:33:02,659 --> 01:33:07,164
Its chemistry is not unlike
the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.

888
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:08,540
Thanks.

889
01:33:08,707 --> 01:33:11,168
- That's good.
- You know what, Parker?

890
01:33:13,003 --> 01:33:15,964
- Parker?
- Get me some milk.

891
01:33:16,715 --> 01:33:20,302
It amplifies characteristics of its host.

892
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:24,139
- Hey, give me another cookie.
- Especially aggression.

893
01:33:25,098 --> 01:33:27,100
This could be dangerous.

894
01:33:27,267 --> 01:33:30,771
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?

895
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:34,650
- You got any with nuts?
- I have some nuts. I could make some.

896
01:33:34,816 --> 01:33:36,527
- Go make me some.
- Peter?

897
01:33:36,693 --> 01:33:39,238
No, no, no. Course not.

898
01:33:53,627 --> 01:33:55,337
These shots are so good.

899
01:33:55,504 --> 01:33:58,048
I'd love to shoot you sometime.

900
01:33:58,715 --> 01:34:02,010
Peter Parker. Peter.

901
01:34:02,177 --> 01:34:06,473
Parker! Miss Brant, that's not
the position I hired you for.

902
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,267
Black-suit Spider-Man.

903
01:34:09,601 --> 01:34:11,853
Peter, these are incredible.

904
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:14,898
- We gotta have these, Jonah.
- I'll pay you the usual rate.

905
01:34:16,692 --> 01:34:19,528
If you want the shots,
I'll take the staff job...

906
01:34:19,695 --> 01:34:21,488
double the money.

907
01:35:46,448 --> 01:35:48,033
Penny.

908
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:56,792
You are really gonna dig this joint.

909
01:35:57,959 --> 01:35:59,836
Do you think I'm...?
I'm dressed all right?

910
01:36:00,003 --> 01:36:01,880
Too fancy or too...

911
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:05,425
Are you kidding me?
You're looking fine, babe.

912
01:36:06,134 --> 01:36:09,680
- Thank you.
- Love that little giggle.

913
01:36:12,683 --> 01:36:14,643
Hey, keep it open there, pops.

914
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:21,358
Oh, this is so cool.

915
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:24,236
I have never been
to a jazz club before.

916
01:36:27,781 --> 01:36:30,450
I hope we can get a table.

917
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:37,624
Find us some shade.

918
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:40,836
Thanks, hot legs.

919
01:36:41,169 --> 01:36:43,588
Right this way, sir.

920
01:36:51,054 --> 01:36:53,265
Oh, why, thank you.

921
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:02,232
- I am so loving this.
- Oh, me too.

922
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:11,491
- Isn't that your old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

923
01:37:11,658 --> 01:37:15,996
- Do you wanna go someplace else?
- Oh, no, no. I'll... I'll be okay.

924
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:19,040
- Mary Jane, show us what you got.
- I'll take that.

925
01:37:24,629 --> 01:37:27,674
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

926
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,018
Peter?

927
01:37:41,104 --> 01:37:43,148
This is for you.

928
01:37:48,695 --> 01:37:50,322
Double-time.

929
01:37:55,494 --> 01:37:57,162
Thanks.

930
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:25,774
Now dig on this.

931
01:38:26,983 --> 01:38:28,235
That is hot!

932
01:38:31,196 --> 01:38:33,073
Yeah, sexy!

933
01:39:09,401 --> 01:39:11,111
That was all for her?

934
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:21,329
I'm so sorry.

935
01:39:33,675 --> 01:39:36,136
- You all right, Mary Jane?
- I'm fine.

936
01:39:36,303 --> 01:39:37,846
Okay.

937
01:39:40,682 --> 01:39:42,267
Hey.

938
01:39:44,352 --> 01:39:45,729
What's wrong with you?

939
01:39:47,063 --> 01:39:48,481
You.

940
01:39:48,899 --> 01:39:51,985
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

941
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:54,237
Is everything okay here, Paul?

942
01:39:54,404 --> 01:39:56,656
Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul?

943
01:39:56,823 --> 01:39:59,200
- Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.

944
01:39:59,367 --> 01:40:02,203
- Take your hand off of me.
- Now.

945
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:05,749
- Okay.
- Hey, get off. Let go.

946
01:40:08,251 --> 01:40:10,128
Peter, stop it!

947
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:22,891
Who are you?

948
01:40:25,393 --> 01:40:27,020
I don't know.

949
01:41:59,696 --> 01:42:01,614
It's Brock, sir.

950
01:42:01,781 --> 01:42:04,200
Edward Brock Jr.

951
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:08,538
I come before you today...

952
01:42:10,081 --> 01:42:11,708
humbled...

953
01:42:13,585 --> 01:42:15,712
and humiliated...

954
01:42:18,548 --> 01:42:20,717
to ask you for one thing.

955
01:42:26,431 --> 01:42:28,183
I want you to kill Peter Parker.

956
01:43:19,192 --> 01:43:20,235
Parker.

957
01:45:04,339 --> 01:45:06,549
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi.

958
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:13,431
You don't seem to have changed
the room around very much.

959
01:45:13,848 --> 01:45:18,144
Of course, there's not much
you could do, is there?

960
01:45:24,442 --> 01:45:26,653
When we spoke on the phone...

961
01:45:26,819 --> 01:45:29,280
I sensed that something
was bothering you...

962
01:45:29,989 --> 01:45:33,409
So I thought I'd just come by.

963
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:38,164
How's Mary Jane?

964
01:45:38,581 --> 01:45:40,333
I don't know.

965
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:45,171
I never heard from you.

966
01:45:45,338 --> 01:45:47,840
Did you ever propose?

967
01:45:51,844 --> 01:45:53,513
You said...

968
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:57,934
a husband's gotta put a wife
before himself.

969
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:05,191
I'm not ready.

970
01:46:07,443 --> 01:46:09,570
But what happened?

971
01:46:10,571 --> 01:46:12,907
You seemed so sure.

972
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,785
Yeah.

973
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,663
I...

974
01:46:29,173 --> 01:46:31,426
I hurt her, Aunt May.

975
01:46:32,802 --> 01:46:34,846
I don't know what to do.

976
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:40,518
Well, you start
by doing the hardest thing:

977
01:46:41,269 --> 01:46:44,230
You forgive yourself.

978
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,902
I believe in you, Peter.

979
01:46:50,069 --> 01:46:52,780
You're a good person.

980
01:46:54,032 --> 01:46:58,786
And I know you will find a way
to put it right.

981
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:08,421
In time.

982
01:47:26,481 --> 01:47:28,858
End of the line, Spider-Man.

983
01:47:32,945 --> 01:47:35,198
I want him dead too, Flint.

984
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:38,117
That's why I've been looking for you.

985
01:47:38,284 --> 01:47:41,537
Oh, yeah. I know all about you.

986
01:47:41,704 --> 01:47:45,958
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.

987
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:49,420
It's just...
That doesn't seem right to me.

988
01:47:49,587 --> 01:47:54,509
Look, I wanna kill the spider,
you wanna kill the spider.

989
01:47:54,675 --> 01:47:57,929
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.

990
01:47:58,971 --> 01:48:01,015
Interested?

991
01:48:02,433 --> 01:48:03,935
Yeah.

992
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:06,873
So...

993
01:49:08,499 --> 01:49:09,667
where to?

994
01:49:10,835 --> 01:49:10,875
All New York is holding its breath...

995
01:49:10,876 --> 01:49:12,545
All New York is holding its breath...

996
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:15,381
as the hostage crisis continues
to unfold.

997
01:49:17,091 --> 01:49:18,384
Just 30 minutes ago...

998
01:49:18,551 --> 01:49:20,636
police came across this startling sight:

999
01:49:20,803 --> 01:49:22,930
A young woman, held hostage in a taxi...

1000
01:49:23,097 --> 01:49:25,391
suspended 80 stories
above the ground...

1001
01:49:25,558 --> 01:49:28,436
In what appears to be a giant web.

1002
01:49:28,603 --> 01:49:31,272
Every attempt by the police
to rescue the hostage...

1003
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:33,274
has been thwarted
by the Sandman.

1004
01:49:36,652 --> 01:49:37,904
Compounding the danger...

1005
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:40,990
Is the appearance
of a strange black-suited figure.

1006
01:49:41,157 --> 01:49:44,827
Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man...

1007
01:49:44,994 --> 01:49:48,539
but he has now been identified
as something entirely different.

1008
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:53,753
The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson...

1009
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:58,007
an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on Broadway.

1010
01:50:23,699 --> 01:50:26,118
We're now going to take you
live to the scene...

1011
01:50:26,285 --> 01:50:28,037
with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?

1012
01:50:28,204 --> 01:50:30,665
We're only about
100 feet away now, Hal, and...

1013
01:50:30,831 --> 01:50:34,627
Wait. There seems to be
some kind of activity in the web.

1014
01:50:34,794 --> 01:50:38,381
They seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering.

1015
01:50:41,384 --> 01:50:44,178
Spider-Man's being challenged
to some sort of confrontation.

1016
01:50:44,345 --> 01:50:46,013
And that raises serious questions...

1017
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:49,934
about what kind of chance
he'd stand against such overwhelming...

1018
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:01,279
Harry?

1019
01:51:04,824 --> 01:51:06,784
I need your help.

1020
01:51:07,243 --> 01:51:10,621
I can't take them both,
not by myself.

1021
01:51:17,128 --> 01:51:19,880
You don't deserve my help.

1022
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,302
Harry...

1023
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:27,013
She needs us.

1024
01:51:31,601 --> 01:51:33,185
Get out.

1025
01:51:49,785 --> 01:51:52,038
If I may, sir?

1026
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:58,210
I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.

1027
01:51:58,628 --> 01:52:00,421
What are you trying to tell me?

1028
01:52:01,255 --> 01:52:04,008
The night your father died...

1029
01:52:04,175 --> 01:52:06,594
I cleaned his wound.

1030
01:52:08,137 --> 01:52:11,766
The blade that pierced his body...

1031
01:52:11,932 --> 01:52:14,602
came from his glider.

1032
01:52:15,478 --> 01:52:20,274
I know you're trying to defend
your father's honor...

1033
01:52:20,441 --> 01:52:22,610
but there's no question...

1034
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:25,821
that he died by his own hand.

1035
01:52:28,949 --> 01:52:31,327
I loved your father...

1036
01:52:32,662 --> 01:52:35,581
as I have loved you, Harry.

1037
01:52:36,248 --> 01:52:39,085
As your friends love you.

1038
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:27,341
Look.

1039
01:53:48,279 --> 01:53:51,782
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

1040
01:53:57,329 --> 01:53:59,290
He seems to have come out of nowhere...

1041
01:53:59,457 --> 01:54:01,459
to answer the prayers of the city...

1042
01:54:01,625 --> 01:54:03,627
just when all hope seemed to be lost.

1043
01:54:09,592 --> 01:54:12,511
Peter. They're gonna kill us both.

1044
01:54:12,678 --> 01:54:16,098
- I'm gonna get you out of this.
- Watch out.

1045
01:54:25,608 --> 01:54:27,067
Hey, Parker.

1046
01:54:27,234 --> 01:54:28,444
My God. Eddie.

1047
01:54:29,028 --> 01:54:30,821
My spider-sense is tingling...

1048
01:54:32,531 --> 01:54:35,242
if you know what I'm talking about.

1049
01:54:54,345 --> 01:54:56,263
We can find a way to settle this.

1050
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:57,848
You're so right.

1051
01:54:58,015 --> 01:55:01,393
I'm thinking humiliation.

1052
01:55:02,228 --> 01:55:04,522
Kind of like how you humiliated me.

1053
01:55:05,397 --> 01:55:07,149
Do you remember?

1054
01:55:08,984 --> 01:55:11,779
Do you remember
what you did to me?

1055
01:55:27,294 --> 01:55:30,881
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.

1056
01:55:32,758 --> 01:55:34,677
How's that sound, tiger?

1057
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:36,238
Hold on, Mary Jane!

1058
01:57:06,435 --> 01:57:08,729
Mary Jane!

1059
01:58:09,248 --> 01:58:13,002
It's hard to believe what's happening.

1060
01:58:13,168 --> 01:58:15,504
The brutality of it.

1061
01:58:16,255 --> 01:58:18,048
I don't know how
he can take any more.

1062
01:58:18,215 --> 01:58:21,760
This could be a tragic day
for the people of New York.

1063
01:58:21,927 --> 01:58:23,929
It could be the end of Spider-Man.

1064
01:58:50,372 --> 01:58:52,541
- Awesome.
- Wicked cool.

1065
01:59:17,608 --> 01:59:19,026
You came.

1066
01:59:27,034 --> 01:59:29,078
Looks like just in the nick of time.

1067
01:59:29,244 --> 01:59:31,747
A couple minutes ago
wouldn't have been so bad either.

1068
01:59:31,914 --> 01:59:33,499
What are you gonna do?

1069
01:59:37,002 --> 01:59:38,921
I may need some help over here.

1070
01:59:39,088 --> 01:59:41,507
I'm a little busy right now.

1071
01:59:42,674 --> 01:59:44,510
Give me your hand!

1072
01:59:58,857 --> 02:00:01,735
Parker! Parker, where...?

1073
02:00:01,902 --> 02:00:03,487
I need a photographer.

1074
02:00:03,654 --> 02:00:04,947
Hey, kid, you want a job?

1075
02:00:05,114 --> 02:00:08,450
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.

1076
02:00:08,617 --> 02:00:11,537
- All right, how much for the camera?
- One hundred bucks.

1077
02:00:11,703 --> 02:00:13,122
A hundred bucks?

1078
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:18,669
All right, you little crook. Here.

1079
02:00:20,504 --> 02:00:21,839
What the...?

1080
02:00:23,841 --> 02:00:25,425
Film's extra.

1081
02:00:31,348 --> 02:00:33,100
Gotcha.

1082
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:42,401
Pete, up top!

1083
02:01:02,212 --> 02:01:04,256
Mary Jane.

1084
02:01:06,466 --> 02:01:08,260
- This thing got any more?
- Hang on.

1085
02:01:08,427 --> 02:01:09,553
To what?

1086
02:01:14,016 --> 02:01:15,809
- Go, buddy!
- Got her!

1087
02:01:27,154 --> 02:01:28,197
You okay?

1088
02:01:30,324 --> 02:01:31,867
Yeah.

1089
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:35,828
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

1090
02:01:35,829 --> 02:01:36,997
- Good.
- Hey, Pete.

1091
02:01:39,291 --> 02:01:41,084
Am I interrupting?

1092
02:02:57,369 --> 02:02:59,204
Never wound...

1093
02:03:00,038 --> 02:03:02,082
what you can't kill.

1094
02:03:05,877 --> 02:03:09,423
Eddie, the suit, you gotta take it off.

1095
02:03:09,589 --> 02:03:11,258
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1096
02:03:14,177 --> 02:03:15,929
I know what it feels like.

1097
02:03:16,555 --> 02:03:18,181
It feels good.

1098
02:03:18,348 --> 02:03:20,892
The power. Everything.

1099
02:03:21,059 --> 02:03:23,520
But you'll lose yourself.

1100
02:03:24,104 --> 02:03:26,023
Let it go.

1101
02:03:26,189 --> 02:03:28,233
I like being bad.

1102
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:31,111
It makes me happy.

1103
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:21,703
Harry!

1104
02:05:34,776 --> 02:05:36,486
Peter. What are you doing?!

1105
02:05:37,988 --> 02:05:39,865
No!

1106
02:05:41,658 --> 02:05:43,243
Eddie!

1107
02:06:02,137 --> 02:06:04,139
- Harry.
- Mary Jane.

1108
02:06:04,306 --> 02:06:06,266
- I'm gonna get help.
- No.

1109
02:06:06,975 --> 02:06:08,477
Stay.

1110
02:06:17,068 --> 02:06:19,196
I didn't want this.

1111
02:06:23,658 --> 02:06:25,869
But I had no choice.

1112
02:06:29,581 --> 02:06:31,708
We always have a choice.

1113
02:06:31,875 --> 02:06:34,085
You had a choice
when you killed my uncle.

1114
02:06:36,588 --> 02:06:38,590
My daughter was dying.

1115
02:06:40,759 --> 02:06:42,636
I needed money.

1116
02:06:47,432 --> 02:06:49,392
I was scared.

1117
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:59,986
I told your uncle
all I wanted was the car.

1118
02:07:00,153 --> 02:07:02,072
- What is it?
- I need your car.

1119
02:07:02,531 --> 02:07:04,616
He said to me:

1120
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:08,036
"Why don't you just put down the gun
and go home?"

1121
02:07:12,123 --> 02:07:15,126
I realize now
he was just trying to help me.

1122
02:07:21,925 --> 02:07:24,844
Then I saw my partner
running over with the cash.

1123
02:07:25,011 --> 02:07:27,305
And the gun was in my hand.

1124
02:07:37,816 --> 02:07:39,234
Get in!

1125
02:07:41,027 --> 02:07:43,488
I did a terrible thing to you...

1126
02:07:44,864 --> 02:07:48,285
and I spent a lot of nights
wishing I could take it back.

1127
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:56,126
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

1128
02:07:57,043 --> 02:07:59,379
I just want you to understand.

1129
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:11,808
I've done terrible things too.

1130
02:08:28,074 --> 02:08:30,827
I didn't choose to be this.

1131
02:08:39,586 --> 02:08:42,088
The only thing left of me now...

1132
02:08:44,257 --> 02:08:46,176
is my daughter.

1133
02:08:58,396 --> 02:09:00,357
I forgive you.

1134
02:09:43,608 --> 02:09:46,653
Hey, pal. How you doing?

1135
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:48,446
Been better.

1136
02:09:49,989 --> 02:09:51,908
We'll get you through this.

1137
02:09:55,662 --> 02:09:57,163
No.

1138
02:10:04,838 --> 02:10:07,465
I should never have hurt you...

1139
02:10:08,883 --> 02:10:11,177
said those things.

1140
02:10:12,846 --> 02:10:15,390
None of that matters, Peter.

1141
02:10:17,225 --> 02:10:19,227
You're my friend.

1142
02:10:23,815 --> 02:10:25,775
Best friend.

1143
02:10:44,669 --> 02:10:46,337
Harry.

1144
02:11:32,342 --> 02:11:34,511
Whatever comes our way...

1145
02:11:35,178 --> 02:11:37,347
whatever battle
we have raging inside us...

1146
02:11:37,514 --> 02:11:39,808
we always have a choice.

1147
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:43,978
My friend Harry taught me that.

1148
02:11:44,145 --> 02:11:47,398
He chose to be the best of himself.

1149
02:11:48,233 --> 02:11:51,236
It's the choices
that make us who we are...

1150
02:11:51,402 --> 02:11:54,823
and we can always choose
to do what's right.
