1
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:28,099


2
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,090
THE GREAT WALL HAS STOOD FOR CENTURIES

3
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,310
AS ONE OF MANKIND'S MOST ENDURING WONDERS.

4
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,870
IT SPANS OVER 5500 MILES

5
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,660
AND TOOK MORE THAN 1700 YEARS TO BUILD.

6
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,830
IT PROTECTED FROM MANY DANGERS.
SOME ARE KNOWN. SOME ARE LEGEND.

7
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,610
THIS IS ONE OF THE LEGENDS.

8
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,580
THE GREAT WALL

9
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,090
Najid, cut the horses loose!

10
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,390
We have to turn back.

11
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,650
We have been riding
for six months.

12
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,630
- And we've lost twenty men.
- But we survived.

13
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,730
Yes. By chance.

14
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,750
Any one of us could have
met that same fate.

15
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,270
We were the strongest.
Remember why you're here.

16
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,470
In the West, we would be enemies,
and I wouldd have to kill you.

17
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,750
At least here we
have a common goal.

18
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,550
Oh, yes.
This black powder.

19
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,450
It turns air into fire.
And kills a dozen men at one time.

20
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,310
- It is a weapon of our dreams.
- What if it's just a myth?

21
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,790
Men have sent word
that it's real.

22
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,370
And those men are dead.

23
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,190
And we are next.

24
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,930
We have no maps,

25
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,310
no medicines,

26
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,450
and no food.

27
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,430
No one is going back.

28
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,990
We take inventory
of what we have left

29
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,310
and finish what we started.

30
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,310
There's not much here.

31
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,950
The moon is strong.
When the horse are fresh, we move.

32
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,170
- To where?
- North.

33
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,670
If they keep after us,
we'll kill them in the mountains.

34
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,130
The magnet.

35
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,210
Too heavy.

36
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,450
- Useless.
- I'll have it.

37
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,730
It's all yours.

38
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,910
Amigo, only you would carry
a stupid magnet through the desert.

39
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,550
I can use it to make a compass.

40
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,210
Rizzeti won't make it.

41
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,150
The wound is festering.

42
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,710
- We'll be dragging a corpse.
- I heard that.

43
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,530
He's earned the right
to die where he wants.

44
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,190
I've been left for dead twice.

45
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,270
- It was bad luck.
- For who?

46
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,730
The people who left me.

47
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,190
Where are they?

48
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,210
Hill tribes?

49
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,230
It's no man.

50
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,990
Then what is it?

51
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,050
Whatever it is...

52
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,570
it's hunting.

53
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,790
- What was that?
- I don't know.

54
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,890
I took its hand.

55
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,210
We need to move.

56
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,390
Agreed.

57
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,990
I'll take the hands with us.

58
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,290
What the hell for?

59
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,910
So someone can tell me what I just killed.

60
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,870
Persistent bastards,
aren't they?

61
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,930
We'll take the rise,
make a stand there.

62
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,030
What a long shitting way to go to die.

63
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,230
Mother of God.

64
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,430
Fire!

65
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,470
I have no need to
go down fighting.

66
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,130
Agreed.

67
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,310
I say we take our chanches
with the gents in front of us.

68
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,750
I haven't surrendered in a while, eh.

69
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,630
It'll come back to you.

70
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,110
Follow my lead.
We'll be fine.

71
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,070
Of course, my friend.

72
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,710
Where you go, I follow.

73
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,270
You're doing such a
great job already.

74
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,630
All commanders to
the great hall!

75
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,630
All commanders report
to the General!

76
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,710
Make way!

77
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,870
Make way!

78
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,790
All commanders to the large hall!

79
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,790
Make way!

80
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,790
Commander Lin is needed immediately!

81
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,270
Calling Commander Lin!

82
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,690
Commander Lin is needed immediately!

83
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,930
They know what it is.

84
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,990
And they don't look
so happy to see it.

85
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,370
All the more reason to get
the hell out of here.

86
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,610
Our weapons are on that table.

87
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,650
Have you lost your mind?

88
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,470
I can take the guards on
the perimeter with my bow.

89
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,670
You cut the legs out
from under the officers.

90
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,050
I must confess this is
not my favorite plan.

91
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,930
Where was this found?

92
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,770
You speak English.

93
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,790
Fantastic.

94
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,590
Where was this found?

95
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,050
It wasn't found.

96
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,050
It was taken.

97
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,750
That thing killed three men
before we took it down.

98
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,790
Where?

99
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,950
Two days ride.

100
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,090
North, in the mountains.

101
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,510
He says two days ride north,
in the mountains.

102
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,310
- They claim to have killed it.
- Two days?

103
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,270
Earlier than we expected.

104
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,870
Strategist Wang!

105
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,350
I'm listening, General.

106
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,550
The two of them killed it?

107
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,510
- Two of you, you did this?
- Well...

108
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,330
- I killed it.
- Alone?

109
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,450
- He claims to have killed it alone.
- By himself?

110
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,210
Impossible.

111
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,370
Tell me how.

112
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,070
A swing of the sword.

113
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,950
The hand came away clean.

114
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,190
The beast fell
back into a chasm.

115
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,710
- Why are you here?
- We came to trade.

116
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,750
We were ambushed.

117
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,630
Guards!

118
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,510
You are soldiers.

119
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,770
Commander Lin.

120
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,910
Wait.

121
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,130
General.

122
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,030
They claim to be traders
who were ambushed.

123
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,170
These barbarians are liars.

124
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,770
Perhaps not.

125
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,530
They brought the claw here.

126
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,670
The wound is fresh.

127
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,870
There is green blood
on his sword.

128
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,750
Those prove his story.

129
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,890
To protect our secret,
we must kill them.

130
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,230
- Eliminate the possibility of trouble.
- I agree.

131
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,890
We should kill them!

132
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,150
General.

133
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,170
Until we find the truth,

134
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,490
- I advise we keep them alive.
- Alert!

135
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,470
General, signals from
the smoke towers!

136
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,410
We are under attack!

137
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,590
Take them to the stockade.

138
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,250
- All stations on full alert!
- Yes! All stations on full alert!

139
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,650
Are you killing us, Sister?

140
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,870
Two lost travelers?

141
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,670
What's happening here?

142
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,070
Is this bitch going to kill us?

143
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,790
I think she'd like that.

144
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,590
If it is death, my dear,

145
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,730
we need time to pray.

146
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,950
I'm trying here.

147
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,610
Sister, I know a siege when I see one.

148
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,310
What comes at you so hard
you need a wall like this?

149
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,290
- What the hell did we kill out there?
- Tao Tei.

150
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,150
You killed a Tao Tei scout.

151
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,330
You killed it alone.

152
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,610
You are correct.
We are under siege.

153
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,230
But we did not expect the
attack for another nine days.

154
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,190
Attack?

155
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,510
- Tao Tei?
- What the hell is a Tao Tei?

156
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,330
Many things about your
story have importance.

157
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,070
You are not to die today.

158
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,770
Hurry!

159
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,930
I'm sorry, sir.
I can not find the key.

160
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,670
Forget it!

161
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,550
Bring them to the wall.
Keep an eye on them!

162
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,950
General.

163
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,610
It's finally happening.

164
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,490
Yes.

165
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,710
Sixty years preparing for this moment.

166
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,210
Stop! Stop!

167
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,870
Go. Go!

168
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,250
Inside!

169
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,450
Stand still!

170
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,250
Get down! Get down!

171
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,550
The black are the foot soldiers.

172
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,730
- And the red?
- Those are the archers.

173
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,980
- And the blue? - They're all women.
- What the hell do they do?

174
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,810
Look at this army.

175
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,270
- Have you ever seen anything like this?
- Incredible.

176
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,170
Catch it!

177
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,030
They look nervous.

178
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,910
It's a big wall to be so nervous.

179
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,850
Do you hear it?

180
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,690
- Long distance weapons!
- Yes! Drums signal long distance weapons!

181
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,910
Grab it!

182
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,610
Light it!

183
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,430
Aim for the eyes! Aim for the eyes!

184
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,310
Crane Corps attack!

185
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,470
William, over there.

186
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,650
Why isn't he tied up?

187
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,410
There's our escape.

188
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,430
General. There's the queen.
She commands them.

189
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,190
Attack the queen!

190
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,210
- Close combat!
- Yes! Close combat!

191
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,010
Drums signal close combat.

192
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,090
We need to move!
We need to move or we die!

193
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,410
Go, go!

194
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,850
Go and fight!

195
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,530
Cut me loose!

196
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,750
- Fight or run?
- Run where?

197
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,650
Aim for the eyes!

198
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,190
William!

199
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,610
Hey! Bitch!

200
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,190
- William.
- I need a shot.

201
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,290
What god made those things?

202
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,310
None that we know.

203
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:11,230
- Think they'll hang us now?
- I could use the rest.

204
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,030
- You fought well today.
- You've earned General Shao's praise.

205
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,890
- Will they come back?
- Yes.

206
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,590
All we can do is prepare.

207
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,510
Take them to the barracks.

208
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,830
- They need rest.
- Yes!

209
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,670
Thank you for saving my life.

210
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,990
Commander Lin.

211
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,570
You grew up in the
Nameless Order.

212
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,410
I've taught you many things,

213
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,050
and you have been learning,

214
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,890
but they have been learning also.

215
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,350
Strategist Wang warned
they are evolving.

216
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,170
No one listened.

217
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,030
The enemies we're facing today

218
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,450
are more intelligent than 60 years ago.

219
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,090
Watch the foreigners closely.

220
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,810
They can never leave.

221
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,650
- We must protect the secrets of the Wall.
- Yes sir!

222
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,710
Who are you?

223
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,150
Easy.

224
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,910
I'm Ballard.

225
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,070
William.

226
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,550
This is Tovar.

227
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,290
What are you doing here?

228
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,370
- We came looking for black powder.
- I bet you did.

229
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,610
I came with merceneries for the same thing,

230
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,650
25 years ago.

231
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,410
And did you find it?

232
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:58,030
Finding it and leaving with it
alive are two different things.

233
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,650
You saved the west turret.
That was extremely diplomatic.

234
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,570
We weren't being diplomatic.

235
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,490
We were trying to stay alive.

236
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,090
- You smell like animals.
- Thank you.

237
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,030
Clean up and they'll feed you.

238
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,130
He knows where the powder is.

239
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,990
Then why is he still here?

240
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,310
He needs help getting out?

241
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,150
Right.

242
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,250
We play our part,

243
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,950
take the powder and go home.

244
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,430
- I didn't sign up for this.
- Which part?

245
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,190
Well... All of it.
But mostly the monsters.

246
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,130
There's a lot of them.

247
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,910
We really do smell.

248
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,430
General Shao welcomes
you as honored guests

249
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,430
of the Nameless Order,

250
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,650
and thanks you for your skill and courage.

251
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,070
We are honored to be honored.

252
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,370
Is that the best you've got?

253
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,790
General.

254
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,630
I couldn't help wondering,

255
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,370
why would such an
accomplished archer

256
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,210
used such a primitive bow.

257
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,230
Commander Chen thinks your bow
is not worthy of your skill.

258
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,670
Tell him there's no better weapon here.

259
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,690
He claims his weapon is second to none.

260
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,070
Let him show us.
Give him some space!

261
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,030
- They wish to see you shoot.
- In here?

262
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,970
Unless he's afraid.
It's a large audience.

263
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,110
- What was that?
- He thinks you have fear.

264
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,370
Too many people.

265
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,690
- Get one of the cups.
- Now?

266
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,830
- Get one of the cups.
- I want to eat.

267
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,210
You remember how to do this?
Last Time didn't go so good.

268
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,530
- We were drunk.
- How high?

269
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,770
Ten yards. Six hands
to the right.

270
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,790
- Turn around.
- No. I'll do it this way.

271
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,870
- On my count.
- Amigo...

272
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,750
One.

273
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,650
Two.

274
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,710
Three.

275
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,710
Pull.

276
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,070
Good luck with that.
I want food.

277
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,930
- Who taught you English?
- Sir Ballard.

278
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,990
English and Latin.

279
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,230
Heard he's been here
for twenty five years.

280
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,950
You won't let him leave.

281
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,580
He must stay here.

282
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,470
What about us?

283
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,530
Pace yourself.
The meals are regular here.

284
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,930
I hope not to stay that long.

285
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,630
I like your thinking,

286
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,610
but I suggest you keep your plans private.

287
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,310
You aren't the first Westerners to
come here looking for black powder.

288
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,330
We'll discuss it tonight.
Bring your partner.

289
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,550
- How long have you been here?
- Always.

290
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,570
I was not five years
old when I came here.

291
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,610
I have no other family.

292
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,010
We're the same.

293
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,470
I was given to an army
before I can remember.

294
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:48,650
- As a soldier?
- Worse. As a gleaner.

295
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,770
Packs of children,
we'd clean the battlefields.

296
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,630
After, when the fighting's over,
I became a page.

297
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,190
- a pikeman's boy.
- For Your country?

298
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,170
No. I fought for food.

299
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,550
You fight to eat.

300
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,670
You live long enough,
you fight for money.

301
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,850
How many flag do you fight for?

302
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,310
I don't know.

303
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,250
I fought for Harold against the Danes.

304
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,610
I saved a Duke's life.
I fought for him until he died.

305
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,570
Fought for Spain
against the Franks.

306
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,170
Fought for Franks
against Boulogne.

307
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,730
I fought for the Pope.

308
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,170
Many flags.

309
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,810
We are not the same.

310
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,330
Meet me on the Wall.
I have something to show you.

311
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,930
He should be careful with her.

312
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,570
She's very powerful here.

313
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,850
Then it is a fair contest.

314
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,610
Come.

315
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,130
You wish to try?

316
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,470
Men are too heavy.
Do you think we can pull him up?

317
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,180
She says men have so much to teach us.

318
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,490
I don't think
that's what she said.

319
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,090
You know what I think?

320
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,910
I think you're afraid.

321
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,530
You said that this morning.

322
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,550
And yet,

323
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,010
here I am.

324
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,970
Yes.

325
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,650
Here you are.

326
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,210
Will you jump?
Or not?

327
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,010
- These men know what they're doing?
- Wrong question.

328
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,830
Whether or not the cable is attached,
that is the question.

329
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,630
- And the answer?
- Xin ren.

330
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,210
Xin ren?

331
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,330
Xin ren means trust.
To have faith.

332
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:52,770
Here, in this army,
we fight for more than food or money.

333
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,340
We give our lives to something more.

334
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:02,310
Xin ren is our flag.
Trust in each other.

335
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,450
In all ways, at all times.

336
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,250
Well, that's all well and good,
but I'm not jumping.

337
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,140
I'm alive today because I trust no one.

338
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,690
A man must learn to trust,
before he can be trusted.

339
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,910
Then you were right.

340
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,010
We're not the same.

341
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,550
Stay vigilant!
The next attack is coming!

342
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,250
My god!

343
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,410
A taste, a glimpse,

344
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,250
a few pilfered grains

345
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,390
from Strategist Wang's
supply of black powder.

346
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:05,770
He's mastered the transmutation
of these elements.

347
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,430
People speak of a weapon.

348
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,250
There are many weapons here.

349
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,610
Why have we not seen them?

350
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,450
There are many things you have not seen.

351
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,410
And many things you should pray

352
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,490
will not be needed
before the siege is through.

353
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,730
The Tao Tei will return.

354
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,410
When the drums call to battle,

355
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:31,890
the guards leave their post and
take their positions on the Wall.

356
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,810
That is our moment.

357
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,650
We want to be riding away
as the battle rages.

358
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,470
And the armory doors?

359
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,050
- You have keys?
- I have black powder,

360
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,350
enough for several doors.

361
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,290
He brings us in.
We get us out.

362
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,410
Strategist Wang request your presence.

363
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,070
As you fought, where was this stone?

364
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,130
In my bag.

365
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,570
Its unseen force is powerfull.

366
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,670
I believe this strange
stone could help us.

367
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,890
We try everything.

368
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:19,510
- Where are the Tao Tei now?
- The mountains, regrouping.

369
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,060
Where do they come from?

370
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,330
About 20 centuries ago,

371
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,290
There was an emperor whose greed
brought deep suffering to all of China.

372
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,840
The heaven sent a meteor
that struck Gouwu Mountain

373
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,690
turning it green and
releasing Tao Tei.

374
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:41,450
From that day on,
the Tao Tei rise every sixty years,

375
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,750
to scourge the north of China.

376
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:49,270
They come to remind us of what happens
when greed is unchecked.

377
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,330
They eat anything, alive or dead,

378
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:59,210
and take food to their queen.
She depends on her soldiers to feed her.

379
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,150
Only with the food they
provide is she able to multiply.

380
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,010
The capital and its 2 million people,

381
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,150
is only 800 li away.

382
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,470
If the Tao Tei ever had
that much nourisment

383
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,670
no corner of the world would be safe.

384
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:24,150
- You cann't hunt them?
- Men try. They disappear.

385
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,190
We never find their bones.

386
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,770
Troops unaccounted for at the West Tower!

387
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,890
Why did they leave the bodies?

388
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,090
Dismount!

389
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,230
Formation!

390
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,330
Advance!

391
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,890
Stop.

392
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,830
Commander Lin.

393
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,510
General...

394
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,270
They led us into a trap.

395
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,890
We underestimated their intelligence.

396
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,050
The Nameless Order...

397
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,570
- is yours to command.
- General...

398
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,530
Commanders, this is
my final order...

399
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,890
from this day forward,

400
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:22,290
Commander Lin will lead you.

401
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,350
The soldiers of the Nameless Order
will stand firm.

402
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,370
The wall must not fall!
We will defeat the Tao Tei!

403
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:37,470
- Rest in peace.
- Rest in peace!

404
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,190
This is envoy Shen from the palace.

405
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,970
He has brought important records
to help with the coming battle.

406
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:27,410
- This is a 900 years old batte report.
- A 900 years old battle report.

407
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:33,210
At the Hans Gate,
three beasts mounted the wall.

408
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,630
They killed many men as they went forward.

409
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:41,270
Then, by the grace of the ancient gods,

410
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,170
the beasts stopped

411
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:49,880
and sat peacefully,
as we slaughtered them.

412
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,250
There was a magnet on
site just like this one.

413
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:57,070
At the Hans Gate,
was a magnet just like this one.

414
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:02,550
I believe that magnet was
the reason the two of you Westerners

415
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,990
killed the Tao Tei so easily.

416
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:09,650
I believe the magnet
makes the Tao Tei deaf.

417
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,110
Without instruction,
they fall still.

418
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,590
- How to prove that?
- How can we be sure?

419
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,070
Why not try it?

420
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,010
Capture a Tao Tei.
See if it works.

421
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:28,650
- He wants to try. He wants to catch one.
- How?

422
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,790
No net is strong enough.

423
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,910
Hunt them. Like a whale.
You know what that is.

424
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,850
A water beast.
A hundred times the size of a Tao Tei.

425
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,910
A spear that grabs.
Hook the bone.

426
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,130
Pulled them up.

427
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:48,010
Use a spear, hook them.
So we can catch them.

428
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,690
I've seen it done in Spain.

429
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,610
He claims to have seen
it done in Spain.

430
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,330
What the hell are you doing?

431
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,490
We need to be free when
the attack comes.

432
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,430
How many chances do you think we will get?

433
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,950
Be injured. Be missing.
Be a coward.

434
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,030
Get out of this.

435
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,890
We did enough.

436
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,570
The mixture must be strong
to put the creature to sleep.

437
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,350
- Spread it on evenly.
- Yes, Commander!

438
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:09,950
Snap out of it!

439
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,350
Useless idiot! report to the kitchen
where you belong!

440
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,330
- Yes, Commander.
- Go!

441
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,390
- He'll be here.
- When? When it was over?

442
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,230
- We will start and he will find us.
- Start?

443
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:15,130
We're jumping off a cliff here.
I have everything.

444
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,410
Powder, tools, maps.

445
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:19,310
It's all hidden and
arranged along the route.

446
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,350
Once we start, there's no going back.

447
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,550
- Death Squad ready!
- Yes! Death Squad go!

448
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,610
Blades ready!

449
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,950
Blades forward!

450
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,410
- Attack!
- Go!

451
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,310
Left! Right!

452
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,330
- I'll find him.
- Forget him.

453
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,390
He'd rather die trying
to impress the new general

454
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:16,910
than grab the key to every counting room
and brothel in the world.

455
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:21,390
Good God, man. The time is now.
I can't go without him.

456
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:24,690
- More the spoils for us!
- We need his bow!

457
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,670
Harpoons!

458
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,950
- Harpoons, Now!
- Yes! Harpoons, fire!

459
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,050
Fire!

460
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,770
There!

461
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,990
- Move!
- It's the last one!

462
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:50,530
- Pull!
- No, no, no. Stop!

463
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:50,930
Hold!

464
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,990
There's too much tension!
Chain will break.

465
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,750
- That way. That way.
- Let him run!

466
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:04,870
Stop! Stop! We need longer
for the sleeping potion to work.

467
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,230
That way. That way.

468
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,190
We need to isolate it.
Sparate it from the others.

469
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:18,150
- Ring of Fire!
- Yes! Ring of Fire!

470
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:38,430
- The chain won't hold much longer!
- We're losing him!

471
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:49,950
- William, wait. Screaming arrows!
- Yes! Screaming arrows!

472
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,810
These arrows will scream
as the Tao Tei run.

473
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,150
Aim for the sound.

474
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,950
Aim inside the circle.
Blanket the whole area.

475
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,470
Fire!

476
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,690
Pull!

477
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:24,830
I'm only saving you
so I can kill you myself.

478
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,350
Grab the axe, we're fighting blind.

479
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,750
- Not yet!
- I know what to do!

480
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:13,610
- The fire is not holding them back here.
- Die well, brother.

481
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,190
- What the hell are you doing?
- She's listening.

482
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,630
- Prepare black powder weapon!
- Prepare black powder weapon!

483
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,750
Prepare to light the fuses!

484
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,430
Yes!
Prepare to light the fuses!

485
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,510
- Did it work?
- Yes.

486
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,450
The beast was captured.

487
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:12,950
- My friend...
- He was unharmed.

488
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,650
Why did you go over the Wall?

489
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:36,050
Xin ren.
Did I say that right?

490
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,210
Thank you.

491
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,310
Black powder.

492
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:53,010
It is a terrible weapon.

493
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:58,030
It would be better if you had never see it.

494
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:05,470
I know very little of the outside world.

495
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:11,330
But it seems to me, the greed of men
is not that different than the Tao Tei.

496
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,430
Is that true?

497
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,890
The strong take what they want.

498
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,450
Forget what you have seen.

499
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,310
Excellent! Send it to the
capital immediately.

500
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,930
No! We need to study it here.

501
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,930
If a Tao Tei is captured alive,
it must be sent to the emperor.

502
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:32,490
This is an Imperial Order.

503
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:57,390
You're much braver than they think.

504
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,490
You're wounded?

505
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:31,930
I was looking for you.

506
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:34,750
To say thank you.

507
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:44,610
You feel good, huh?
Maybe you sing a little song, eh?

508
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,550
I will join you.

509
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:51,330
We can sing together
how you saved the gratefull Chinos.

510
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,770
You saw what happened out there,
and that's what you say?

511
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,190
I see black powder.

512
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:00,650
- I see a man forget his friends.
- The black powder's not going anywhere.

513
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:02,810
What goes nowhere is you.

514
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,690
You'll never get what
you want from this.

515
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:12,350
You think they see you
as some kind of hero?

516
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:16,710
A man of virtue?
Maybe you can fool them,

517
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,490
but I know what you are.

518
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,250
You know what you are.

519
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,450
A thief, a liar,

520
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,270
and a killer.

521
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:36,050
You can never undo things you've done.

522
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:38,770
and you will never be anything.

523
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,550
Good to see you again, amigo.

524
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:03,270
Tao Tei movement!

525
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:07,230
All troops to the Wall!

526
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,530
- Nothing?
- No.

527
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,670
- How do you know he won't betray us?
- I don't.

528
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,190
They'll kill him.
They'll kill him no matter what.

529
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,870
The time they spend killing him,

530
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:21,070
is time they are not chasing us.

531
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:06,210
Careful with that.
There's powder here.

532
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,510
Tovar.

533
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,290
General, it goes all the way through.
Tao Tei have breached the wall.

534
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,230
They're smarter than we thought.

535
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:59,270
- Summon my commanders immediately!
- Yes, General!

536
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,150
Have a look.
See if it's gone out.

537
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:25,350
- Is it safe?
- Of course it is.

538
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,990
Shake it off, man.
To work.

539
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:01,930
I thought you said it was safe?

540
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:04,670
We're in, didn't we?

541
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:20,570
- You're here.
- We've come to our senses, eh?

542
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:23,650
Ballard has planned well.
Getting out is easy.

543
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:28,130
There's a gate. Twenty miles west.
We dodge the hill tribes.

544
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:32,830
- We can make it.
- They need us here.

545
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:34,230
They need more than us.

546
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,150
- These people are doomed.
- Don't be a fool.

547
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:39,570
I've been a fool.

548
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:40,950
I'm done with it.

549
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,130
Brother, please.

550
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:46,110
We've been fighting for nothing.

551
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,530
For greed.

552
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:54,730
Amigo, after all the blood,
the cold, and pain,

553
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:58,710
with this black powder
in our saddle bags, we win.

554
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:01,310
You come with me.

555
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:05,030
I can't do that now.

556
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:10,010
- Stay and fight.
- William...

557
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:18,030
- Think he's dead?
- It'd take a lot more than that.

558
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:26,290
All of the attacks have been a diversion,
while they dug this tunnel.

559
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:28,150
They have breached the wall.

560
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:33,650
Once they reach the capital,
nothing in the world can stop them.

561
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:37,870
At a full gallop,
it's two days to the capital.

562
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:42,190
- There's no way we can catch them.
- The wind is strong now.

563
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:47,490
It blows from the north all day tomorrow.
We have to use the balloons.

564
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:51,710
- If it works, how long to Bianliang?
- Six hours if the wind hold.

565
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:53,250
If we make it alive.

566
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:57,350
General, none of the tests have worked.

567
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:00,490
Get ready!

568
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,930
Come on!

569
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,620
THE CAPITAL
BIANLIANG

570
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:04,590
- How did you capture it?
- Your Excellency!

571
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:09,850
Your Excellency, It's the magnet.
It keeps the beast under control.

572
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:14,590
This is the most important discovery
in the history of the Tao Tei.

573
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:18,970
- We will investigate immediately.
- Bring him here!

574
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:39,130
- I tried to stop...
- You dare to speak to me?

575
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:45,190
- I didn't do this.
- And you came here to trade.

576
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,550
And you knew nothing of black powder.

577
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:52,250
What a fool you must think I am.

578
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:56,270
If I was with them, why would I be here?
I tried to stop them.

579
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,450
Liar!

580
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:00,130
You lie.

581
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:06,370
- Some part of you knows that's not true.
- If I were not the General,

582
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:08,790
I would kill you myself.

583
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:12,030
General!

584
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:19,830
- General.
- Speak up.

585
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:26,150
I was there when it happened.
I saw him try to stop them.

586
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,430
Are you sure?

587
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:41,890
If you're lying, I'll have your head!

588
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:45,450
I swear on my vow to the Nameless Order!

589
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,770
Lock him up.

590
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:03,090
Send the cavalry.
Go after the two that got away.

591
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:03,950
Yes, General.

592
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,770
Which way, left or right?

593
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:33,030
Go up and take a look
from the high ground.

594
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:52,490
No! Bastard!

595
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,750
- Keep it steady!
- Yes, General!

596
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:39,250
- Watch the powder!
- Yes, General!

597
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:15,010
What happened?

598
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:20,730
What happened?
We have failed.

599
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,570
The Tao Tei are in the kingdom.

600
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,870
You are free to leave.
Take what you wish and go.

601
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,510
- This was the General's final order.
- Where is she?

602
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:38,490
To do what? To fight?

603
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:41,390
- Is there a chance?
- There's only one.

604
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:46,770
Kill the Queen.
Kill the Queen, or we all die.

605
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:51,350
Leave.
Tell the world what you have seen,

606
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,990
and tell them what is coming.

607
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,410
I'll need my bow.

608
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:24,470
If I'm to join you, I'll need my bow.

609
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:35,430
Strategist Wang!
Please take me with you.

610
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:38,290
He wishes to join us.

611
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,180
The distance is the key.

612
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:05,290
The magnet is only effective
when close to the beast.

613
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:10,310
Therefore, the effect
weakens as it gets further away.

614
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:13,310
You see I have it
under complete control.

615
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,430
Write down nine feet.

616
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:10,170
- Steer to the rear of the palace.
- Yes! To the rear of the palace!

617
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:12,010
Above you!

618
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:23,030
- Light a grenade!
- Yes, sir!

619
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:27,430
Behind you!

620
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:41,890
I set you free.

621
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:44,190
And here I am.

622
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,150
There's the queen!

623
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:54,350
They will not attack while
the queen is feeding.

624
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:58,170
We have a chance!
Hold on!

625
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:13,370
State your purpose!

626
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,950
General Lin Mae from Nameless Order.
At your service!

627
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:41,030
What took you so long?

628
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,430
The Tao Tei overrun the city!

629
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:47,230
Thousands of soldiers
and innocent are dead.

630
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,230
You're too late!

631
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:51,470
Where is the captured Tao Tei?

632
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:54,410
- In the dungeon!
- We need it to kill the queen.

633
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:56,450
Once she is dead,
The Tao Tei can not function.

634
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:59,370
Without her signal, their
whole army will freeze.

635
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,490
There is an underground canal here.

636
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:22,870
Has it been breached?

637
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:25,490
The Tao Tei should all be above ground.

638
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:27,110
And the one we captured?

639
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:28,590
We load it up.

640
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,710
We feed him.
And it will return to its queen.

641
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,170
Good.

642
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,870
You'll have one hell of a scar,

643
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:48,070
- but you'll live.
- He says you will live.

644
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:50,050
We'll come back for him.

645
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:10,040
They've broken through!

646
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:35,080
Patience, William.

647
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:54,710
And it will go to the Queen when it's done?

648
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,760
It should.

649
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:00,310
It will.

650
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:13,670
Let it in.

651
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:38,530
I can get a shot from above.

652
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:45,820
Go!
I'll hold them back.

653
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,720
Wait. Not yet.

654
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,750
Hit.

655
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,560
Go higher.
I'll get a better shot.

656
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,400
General! It's up to you now!

657
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,350
We have one black powder weapon left.
Give me the spear.

658
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,250
I've trained for this my whole life.

659
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:50,080
Trust.

660
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:55,880
I'll get you the shot.

661
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,630
I've got you.

662
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:03,010
So, how's life without me?

663
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,030
A little slow.

664
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,880
- You're a hero after all.
- Oh, it looks that way.

665
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,840
You seem pleased with yourself..

666
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,350
And what are they giving you
for all your troubles?

667
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:18,650
A bag of gold?

668
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,330
A victory parade along the top of the Wall?

669
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:23,200
All the black powder I can carry.

670
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:26,520
And a cavalry escort
to get me home safely.

671
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,730
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

672
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,440
So what is this?

673
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:35,970
- You're here to rub my nose in it?
- Well, would you blame me?

674
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,520
The last time I saw you,
you left me for dead.

675
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:40,410
And the time before, I saved your life.

676
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:41,630
True.

677
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,400
You know, the Emperor gave me a choice.

678
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:50,520
I could take the black powder
or I could take you.

679
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,440
Please tell me you chose the powder.

680
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:04,400
I don't even know you anymore.

681
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:10,470
The horses are saddled and waiting.
Best we ride before nightfall.

682
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,790
I'll be inside.

683
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,650
Don't leave without me.

684
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,290
I came to say goodbye.

685
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:37,160
I understand congratulations are in order.

686
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:40,000
General of the northwest territory.

687
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:42,190
Quite an honor.

688
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,330
Seems you've made your choice.

689
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:50,890
Oh, him? Believe me, I'm already think
about trading him back for the powder.

690
01:29:51,330 --> 01:29:52,630
I heard that.

691
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,830
Perhaps we were both wrong.

692
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:04,400
We are more similar than I thought.

693
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:11,880
Thank you General.

694
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:42,250
- Are you sure you don't want to go back?
- Of course I do.

695
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:45,330
I just don't trust you
to make it out of here alone.
