1
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:00,369
Manuel.

2
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,496
Manuel!

3
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,429
Manuel.

4
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,737
I think...

5
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,116
I think I found you one.

6
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,706
Look, I called you, right?

7
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,087
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself, I called you, John.

8
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:33,105
It's okay, it's okay. We had to tie her down, okay?

9
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,149
It's okay.

10
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,038
This is Constantine.

11
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:36,335
John Constantine, asshole.

12
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,845
Sure.

13
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,036
What the hell?

14
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,013
I need a mirror.

15
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,308
Now. At least 3 feet high.

16
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,144
Move! Go, now!

17
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,035
This is Kramer.

18
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,580
Chas Kramer, asshole.

19
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,457
Asshole.

20
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:01,838
What? Oh, this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, asshole.

21
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,131
Chas! What?

22
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,051
Move the car. Why?

23
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,012
Move the damn car!

24
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,433
"Chas, move the car."

25
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,979
There, car's moved.

26
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,117
Lift it up over the bed.

27
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:37,206
Tie that end off. Hennessy, over the top.

28
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:43,880
Close your eyes. And whatever happens, don't look.

29
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,935
No!

30
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,319
Show yourself.

31
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,450
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

32
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,336
For your boss.

33
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,421
Pull it!

34
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,824
Ma? Ma?

35
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:34,198
Like I said, I found you something, didn't I, John? Didn't I?

36
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,033
What happened in there?

37
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,710
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

38
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,004
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

39
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,632
I have to sleep, John.

40
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,844
I need some help, Father.

41
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,138
You do?

42
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,056
From me?

43
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,933
What kind of...?

44
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,356
Hey, listen, I... That exorcism wasn't right.

45
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,195
Listen to the ether.

46
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,782
Anything unusual, you let me know.

47
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:22,330
Come on, you don't need its protection. It'll be like back in the day.

48
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,710
A few days.

49
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,212
Okay.

50
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,798
Okay. For you, John.

51
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,764
John, why would you do that if you know it's not my car?

52
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,517
I told you to move it. You did tell me to move it...

53
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:46,187
...but if you'd said you were dropping a 300-pound mirror with a demon...

54
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,189
...I would've moved it further, John.

55
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,026
Take Alvarado. Yeah, thank you. I know what to take.

56
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,073
You ever think if you told me more now that maybe I could help out?

57
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,574
No? Nope.

58
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,076
Nope?

59
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,328
Of course it's a nope.

60
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,992
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

61
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,247
It's been...

62
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,459
...two weeks since my last confession.

63
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,007
I killed a man today.

64
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,801
Another one.

65
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,227
I didn't even see his face, I just...

66
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,647
...pulled the trigger, and he went away.

67
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:19,030
Most cops go 20 years without firing their guns.

68
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,285
Why do I always know where these guys are?

69
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,788
Where to aim, when to fire.

70
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,376
I'm wondering, is there something wrong with me, Father?

71
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,213
Something damned?

72
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:40,718
God has a plan for you. He has a plan for us all.

73
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:45,306
You mustn't let your faith be overshadowed by guilt.

74
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,517
Yeah, I'm trying.

75
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,770
I'm trying real hard.

76
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,689
Isabel.

77
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,909
Isabel.

78
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,843
Things I've beaten.

79
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,722
Things most people never even heard of.

80
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,309
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

81
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,771
Wouldn't be the first, John.

82
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,691
Come on, Les.

83
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,194
You saved me before, you can do it again, right?

84
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,239
This is aggressive.

85
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,493
Twenty years ago, you didn't wanna be here.

86
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,663
Now you don't wanna leave.

87
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,499
Yeah, that's a good idea.

88
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,462
John, you really need to prepare.

89
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,011
Make arrangements. No need.

90
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,348
I already know exactly where I'm going.

91
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,312
Morning. Good morning.

92
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,440
Good morning. Detective.

93
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,442
No, no, no. Angela, wait.

94
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,279
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

95
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,948
Give us the room, please.

96
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,231
Isabel.

97
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,240
She fell from the roof?

98
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,242
She jumped.

99
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,996
No. Look...

100
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:41,334
...I know it's hard to accept. She was sick.

101
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,387
Isabel wouldn't kill herself. Angie.

102
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,098
She wouldn't kill herself. Detective.

103
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,600
Period. Detective.

104
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,393
Period!

105
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,148
Angie, there were security cameras.

106
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,953
Hold the door. You going down? Not if I can help it.

107
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,255
A new case?

108
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:15,178
The big score? The mother lode? The one you've been waiting for?

109
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,389
Humor me. Don't I always?

110
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,981
Oh, yeah, that's... Much obliged. Thank you.

111
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,693
How you feeling, John?

112
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,528
So, what's new?

113
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,578
Bullet shavings from the assassination attempt on the pope...

114
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,373
...holy-water ampoules from the River Jordan...

115
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,462
...and... Oh, you'll love this. screech beetle from Amityville.

116
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,718
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

117
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,013
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

118
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,099
I just like them.

119
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,143
Yeah. Who doesn't?

120
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,356
Yeah, easy there, hero.

121
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:12,109
That's dragon's breath. I thought you couldn't get it anymore.

122
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:17,073
Yeah, well, I know a guy who knows a guy.

123
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,833
So, what's the action?

124
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,087
I just pulled a soldier demon out of a little girl.

125
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,340
Looked like it was trying to come through.

126
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,385
Yeah, I know how it sounds.

127
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,846
No, we're finger puppets to them, John...

128
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,389
...not doorways.

129
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:45,643
They can work us, but they can't come through onto our plane.

130
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,437
Check the scrolls anyway. See if there's any precedent.

131
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,523
Sure thing, John.

132
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,276
Anything else?

133
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,487
Wouldn't happen to have anything for a...?

134
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,490
On the house.

135
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:04,036
All right, question. How much longer do I have to be your slave, John?

136
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,124
You're not my slave, Chas.

137
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,003
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

138
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,338
Like Tonto or Robin.

139
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,216
Or that skinny fellow with the fat friend.

140
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:21,262
Right. So then why don't I apprentice something besides driving, then, John?

141
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,850
John? John.

142
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,770
I love our little talks, John.

143
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,203
May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

144
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,164
No, thanks, I'm not gonna be staying long.

145
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:52,919
How about you, ma'am? Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

146
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,588
I really need to speak with him. It's important.

147
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,466
First come, first served.

148
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,722
So you're rude no matter where you are.

149
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,316
Father. Hi.

150
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,612
You have news. Yes. Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

151
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,287
I know what you want, son.

152
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,999
Still keeping your all-seeing eye on me, Gabriel?

153
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,586
I'm flattered.

154
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,006
Well, I could offer something...

155
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:43,427
...about how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock...

156
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,680
...but it might sound disingenuous.

157
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,599
She has to have a Catholic funeral, Father. She has to.

158
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,979
Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin. She didn't commit suicide.

159
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,773
The bishop believes otherwise. You know the rules.

160
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,025
Oh, rules.

161
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,027
Father.

162
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,779
David.

163
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,366
This is Isabel.

164
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,287
God was the only one she ever believed loved her.

165
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,914
Please.

166
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,500
I'm sorry.

167
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,840
I've been seeing some unusual soul traffic lately.

168
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,759
You might consider giving me an extension.

169
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,512
I could do your side some good these days.

170
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,931
You still trying to buy your way into heaven?

171
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,852
What about the minions I've sent back?

172
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,190
That alone should guarantee my entry. How many times have I told you?

173
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,358
That's not the way this works.

174
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,236
Why, haven't I served him enough?

175
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,157
What does he want from me? Only the usual.

176
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:49,410
Self-sacrifice, belief.

177
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,788
Oh, I believe, for chrissake. No, no, you know.

178
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,208
And there's a difference. You've seen.

179
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,046
I never asked to see. I was born with this curse.

180
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,298
A gift, John.

181
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,967
One that you've squandered on selfish endeavors.

182
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,679
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

183
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,681
Who's that for?

184
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:15,394
Everything you've ever done, you've only ever done for yourself.

185
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,813
To earn your way back into his good graces.

186
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,608
Impossible rules, endless regulations...

187
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:24,904
...who goes up, who goes down and why.

188
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,994
You don't even understand us.

189
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,289
You're the one who should go to hell, half-breed.

190
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,012
Why me, Gabriel?

191
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,850
It's personal, isn't it?

192
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:59,730
I didn't go to church enough, I didn't pray enough...

193
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:04,360
...I was 5 bucks short in the collection plate. Why?

194
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,115
You are going to die young...

195
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:13,202
...because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15.

196
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,247
And you're going to go to hell...

197
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:19,458
...because of the life you took.

198
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,340
You're fucked.

199
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,396
At least it's nice out.

200
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,277
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

201
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,495
And his punch lines are killers.

202
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,169
John!

203
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:07,507
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

204
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,689
Twenty-two women were found buried in the assailant's back yard.

205
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,568
So much damage had been done to the bodies, police had to match...

206
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,196
Police report she had been physically penetrated...

207
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:33,115
...over 100 times and buried alive.

208
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:37,036
found locked in a storage freezer, his head severed and his organs...

209
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,996
He stuffed Holly's body into...

210
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:43,167
The bodies ravished by the unknown... He used a small handsaw...

211
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:46,796
Had nearly decapitated... Even his eyes were gouged out.

212
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,631
Isabel.

213
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,699
I'm so sorry, lzzy.

214
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:16,951
Constantine.

215
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,945
Dodson.

216
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,906
Hello?

217
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,366
Hello.

218
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,624
Hello?

219
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:10,064
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

220
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,224
Should've minded your own business, exorcist.

221
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,417
I know where you're going, John. You're going to Midnite's.

222
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,252
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

223
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:17,215
It's a haven for those who rise and fall. I remember reading about this, John.

224
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,134
You read too much, kid. It's a bar. It's a bar?

225
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:24,680
It's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

226
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,475
John, the man's a legend. Yeah.

227
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:30,144
Can you please get me into this bar, John, please?

228
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,854
I'm begging you, John, please?

229
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,191
Sure, you can get in. I can get in?

230
00:29:35,358 --> 00:29:37,568
If you can get in.

231
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,031
If I can get...? It's a bear, though, right? Or two ducks in a cloud?

232
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,787
Two frogs on a bench.

233
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,085
Two frogs on a bench.

234
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,254
No, no, I'm with the guy you just...

235
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,297
John! John!

236
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,466
I'm with him, though.

237
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,553
Rat in a dress.

238
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:07,098
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

239
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:09,225
I'm just testing. I'm just testing.

240
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,364
Don't get up.

241
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,035
You've been absent some time.

242
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,205
Have you come here with relics to sell?

243
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,791
No, I'm out of that now. I've been too busy.

244
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,837
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up being bad for your health.

245
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,964
Midnite, Jesus...

246
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:25,551
...I thought the thing was authentic.

247
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,181
I see now.

248
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:33,684
Your health is bad for other reasons. How long?

249
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,645
A few months, maybe a year.

250
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,481
I thought I heard thunder last night.

251
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,776
Must have been Satan's stomach growling.

252
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,072
You're the one soul he'd come up here himself to collect.

253
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,574
So I've heard.

254
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,036
Well, I am most certain you did not come here...

255
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:55,373
...for a sympathetic shoulder to cry on.

256
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:01,462
A demon just attacked me, right out in the open on Figueroa.

257
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:03,881
They don't like you, John.

258
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,925
How many have you deported back to hell?

259
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:10,638
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite. A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

260
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,558
Clearly I do not have to remind you that is impossible.

261
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,060
And yesterday I saw a soldier demon...

262
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,729
...trying to chew its way out through a little girl.

263
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:23,651
Listen, John, demons stay in hell, angels in heaven...

264
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:26,362
...the great detente of the original superpowers.

265
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:31,450
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite. You've been a tremendous help.

266
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,202
Now...

267
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,831
...I need to use the chair.

268
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:44,630
John, forgetting the fact that it would almost certainly kill you...

269
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,507
...you know I am neutral.

270
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:50,928
And as long as the balance is maintained, I take no sides.

271
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:54,724
Before you were a bartender...

272
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:59,270
...you were one witch doctor against, what, 30 Ashgar?

273
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:03,149
And I... You were Constantine.

274
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,694
The John Constantine.

275
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,155
Once.

276
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,910
This isn't the usual game, I can feel it.

277
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,496
Something's coming.

278
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,290
Spooky.

279
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,292
Balthazar.

280
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:25,546
That expression alone has made my entire night.

281
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,673
I'll make your night.

282
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,552
I'll deport your sorry ass right where you stand, you half-breed shit!

283
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:38,059
You know the rules of my house. While here, you will abide by them.

284
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,186
Johnny boy.

285
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:46,859
Word is you're on your way down.

286
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,237
Fresh meat.

287
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,867
Finger-licking good.

288
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,036
We have a meeting now, John.

289
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:07,338
What? I didn't catch that.

290
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,134
Welcome to my life.

291
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,020
Mr. Constantine.

292
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:08,566
I saw you... I remember.

293
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:12,195
And then I saw you at the... Regular kismet.

294
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:16,908
I'd like to ask you a few questions, if that would be okay.

295
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:20,161
I'm not really in the talking mood right now.

296
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:22,997
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

297
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:25,291
Please?

298
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:31,088
Always a catch.

299
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,648
My sister was murdered yesterday.

300
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,776
Sorry to hear. Thanks.

301
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:57,031
She was a patient at Ravenscar. She jumped off the roof.

302
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,659
Thought you said she was murdered.

303
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:02,829
Yeah, well, Isabel wouldn't have taken her own life.

304
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:06,666
Yeah, what kind of mental patient kills herself?

305
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,752
That's just crazy.

306
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:17,635
Look, I've heard your name around the precinct.

307
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:23,015
I know the circles you travel in. The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

308
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:26,811
Just before my sister was committed, she became deeply paranoid.

309
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:31,691
She started talking about demons, angels.

310
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:34,610
Now, I think someone got to her, Mr. Constantine.

311
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:38,573
I think they brainwashed her into stepping off that roof.

312
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:43,202
Some kind of legion or cult.

313
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:46,330
Sounds like a theory, detective.

314
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:47,915
Good luck.

315
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,795
I thought with your background, you could at least...

316
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,630
...point me in the right direction.

317
00:36:54,797 --> 00:36:57,133
Yeah, okay, sure.

318
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:02,471
It wasn't a suicide.

319
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,807
My sister was a devout Catholic.

320
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,476
Do you understand that? If she took her own life...

321
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,438
Her soul would go straight to hell...

322
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:15,735
...where she'd be ripped apart over and over in screaming, brutal agony...

323
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:19,155
...for all eternity. That it?

324
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,365
That about right?

325
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,458
Goddamn you.

326
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,281
Detective.

327
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:05,284
What if I told you that God and the devil made a wager...

328
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:08,955
...a kind of standing bet for the souls of all mankind?

329
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,624
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

330
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:16,087
Humor me. No direct contact with humans. That would be the rule.

331
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,633
Just influence. See who would win. Okay, I'm humoring you.

332
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,885
Why? Who knows.

333
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:26,138
Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling. Oh, so it's fun.

334
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:31,310
It's fun when a man beats his wife to death, when a mother drowns her baby.

335
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:35,231
And you think the devil is responsible?

336
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:38,151
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

337
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:41,779
You're right. We're born capable of terrible things.

338
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:45,700
Then sometimes something else comes along and gives us just the right nudge.

339
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:49,328
Well, this has been real educational...

340
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,205
...but I don't believe in the devil.

341
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:54,834
You should. He believes in you.

342
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:17,190
It's a power outage.

343
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:19,317
Not likely.

344
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:25,364
What? We should go. Now.

345
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:32,497
What is that?

346
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,333
Wings.

347
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,252
Maybe talons.

348
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:41,297
You're kidding. Of what?

349
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,301
Something that's not supposed to be here.

350
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:51,849
That's really not going to help.

351
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:59,106
Close your eyes. Why?

352
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:00,608
Suit yourself.

353
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:26,259
Demons stay in hell, huh?

354
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,679
Tell them that.

355
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:36,686
Don't worry. Happens to everyone the first time.

356
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,980
It's the sulfur.

357
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:41,566
Sulfur.

358
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,195
What were those things?

359
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,240
Demons.

360
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,454
Scavengers of the damned. No, no. It's impossible.

361
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:59,417
Yeah. And I don't think they were after me.

362
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:04,589
You really believe she wouldn't commit suicide.

363
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:06,174
Isabel?

364
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:09,051
Never in a million years.

365
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:11,512
Well, let's be sure.

366
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:14,223
Let's see if she's in hell.

367
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:40,875
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

368
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:43,503
In front of the chair.

369
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,216
I can't believe I'm doing this.

370
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:51,010
These are all Isabel's things? Yeah.

371
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,055
How about the cat? Duck?

372
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:56,849
Yeah, why?

373
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,227
Duck.

374
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,729
Oh, you think that's strange.

375
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:03,356
Cats are good.

376
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:05,149
Half in, half out anyway.

377
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:26,671
If this is some kind of spell or something...

378
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:30,007
...don't you need candles and a pentagram for it to work?

379
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:32,510
Why, do you have any?

380
00:42:32,802 --> 00:42:35,763
This is crazy. Yes.

381
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:41,644
I need you to leave.

382
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:45,314
I'm sorry? Angela, please.

383
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,612
The apartment.

384
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,449
Okay.

385
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:04,333
Be careful with that cat.

386
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:11,174
God, I hate this part.

387
00:45:14,005 --> 00:45:16,799
Isabel. Constantine.

388
00:46:02,345 --> 00:46:03,763
Angela.

389
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:08,768
Jesus.

390
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,732
Constantine, what...? Twins.

391
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:16,818
Jesus. What?

392
00:46:17,735 --> 00:46:20,238
You were twins. What did you say?

393
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:23,074
She killed herself. What?

394
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,828
And she's damned for it.

395
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:41,551
How is this possible?

396
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:45,930
I need to eat.

397
00:48:33,746 --> 00:48:36,165
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

398
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:41,087
Relax, man.

399
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:43,506
Slow down!

400
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:09,657
What the hell kind of place is this?

401
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:02,043
John.

402
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:36,369
When I was a kid, I could see things.

403
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:38,913
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

404
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:43,376
Things you shouldn't have to see.

405
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:05,273
My parents were normal. They did what most parents would do.

406
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:07,942
They made it worse.

407
00:51:10,403 --> 00:51:13,197
You think you're crazy long enough...

408
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:14,991
...you find a way out.

409
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:19,245
You tried to kill yourself. I didn't try anything.

410
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,127
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

411
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:29,422
But when you cross over...

412
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,925
...time stops.

413
00:51:34,343 --> 00:51:37,221
Take it from me, two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

414
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,434
When I came back...

415
00:51:43,352 --> 00:51:45,146
...I knew...

416
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,232
...all the things I could see were real.

417
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:54,697
Heaven and hell are right here. Behind every wall, every window.

418
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:59,869
The world behind the world, and we're smack in the middle.

419
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,581
Angels and demons can't cross over onto our plane.

420
00:52:03,748 --> 00:52:06,667
So instead we get what I call half-breeds.

421
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:10,046
The influence peddlers.

422
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:15,676
They can only whisper in our ears, but a single word can give you courage...

423
00:52:15,843 --> 00:52:19,889
...or turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare.

424
00:52:20,056 --> 00:52:23,100
Those with the demon's touch...

425
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:28,314
...like those part angel, living alongside us.

426
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:30,983
They call it the balance.

427
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,529
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

428
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:38,658
So when a half-breed breaks the rules...

429
00:52:39,158 --> 00:52:43,120
...I deport their sorry ass straight back to hell.

430
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:46,374
I don't get them all...

431
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:50,837
...but I've been hoping to get enough to ensure my...

432
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,841
...retirement. I don't understand.

433
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:59,011
I'm a suicide, Angela.

434
00:52:59,178 --> 00:53:02,723
When I die, the rules say I've got just one place to go.

435
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,934
You're trying to buy your way into heaven.

436
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:07,645
What would you do if you were sentenced to a prison...

437
00:53:07,812 --> 00:53:10,148
...where half the inmates were put there by you?

438
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:15,069
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

439
00:53:15,486 --> 00:53:18,614
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

440
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:20,825
He's not planning anything.

441
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,202
When we were little...

442
00:53:24,203 --> 00:53:26,789
...Isabel saw things too.

443
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:33,629
Dodson.

444
00:53:36,215 --> 00:53:39,719
Guard spotted him groping the body, then he ran across the street.

445
00:53:39,886 --> 00:53:42,972
Came in here, and he had a go at the entire stock.

446
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:46,392
He drowned himself in alcohol in under a minute.

447
00:53:46,976 --> 00:53:49,604
Could've been a member of my fraternity.

448
00:53:52,064 --> 00:53:54,025
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

449
00:53:54,317 --> 00:53:55,818
He's okay.

450
00:54:05,286 --> 00:54:08,915
Why didn't you call me, you son of a bitch?

451
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:45,284
Yes?

452
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:48,079
What do you mean?

453
00:54:48,996 --> 00:54:50,498
What?

454
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:52,208
How?

455
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:06,848
Got it. Bye.

456
00:55:13,354 --> 00:55:16,357
I need to see where Isabel died.

457
00:55:16,524 --> 00:55:19,694
Seances, Ouija boards, channeling.

458
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,906
Our father thought she was just trying to get attention.

459
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:26,617
She certainly did that.

460
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:30,329
She'd tell everyone about the things she said she saw.

461
00:55:30,496 --> 00:55:34,208
She'd scare my mother half to death.

462
00:55:36,002 --> 00:55:38,671
And then she stopped talking for almost a year.

463
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,090
So you had her committed.

464
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:42,592
Yeah.

465
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:44,427
How long?

466
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:46,512
Two weeks.

467
00:55:47,013 --> 00:55:48,764
This time.

468
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:53,519
She'd get better, and then she'd get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

469
00:55:55,521 --> 00:55:59,150
That symbol that was cut in the dead guy's hand...

470
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:01,611
...does it have something to do with this?

471
00:56:01,944 --> 00:56:04,197
I'm a cop, John, remember?

472
00:56:04,363 --> 00:56:09,327
You don't walk off the roof of a building without leaving something behind.

473
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:14,373
And I showed you everything she left behind in that box, but feel free.

474
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:19,879
Maybe she left something else. Not something a cop would find.

475
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,216
Something just for you.

476
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:28,930
You were her twin, Angela. Twins tend to think alike.

477
00:56:29,096 --> 00:56:32,433
I'm not like my sister. But you were once.

478
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,811
When you were kids.

479
00:56:35,144 --> 00:56:37,897
When you'd spend every second with each other.

480
00:56:38,064 --> 00:56:41,818
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

481
00:56:41,984 --> 00:56:43,444
That was a long time ago.

482
00:56:43,611 --> 00:56:45,571
That kind of bond doesn't just disappear.

483
00:56:45,738 --> 00:56:47,824
There is nothing here.

484
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:51,577
Hey. Come on. She planned her death in this room.

485
00:56:51,744 --> 00:56:55,164
She thought it up right here. Right where you're standing.

486
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:58,584
She knew you'd come. She counted on you to see what she saw...

487
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:01,796
...feel what she felt, know what she knew.

488
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:04,799
What did she do, Angela? How should I know?

489
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:07,385
What did she do, Angela? I don't know.

490
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:11,889
What would you do? I don't know.

491
00:57:12,056 --> 00:57:16,811
What did she do, Angela? You know what she did. What did she do, Angela?

492
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:20,273
You know what she did. What are you afraid of? What did she do?

493
00:57:20,439 --> 00:57:22,775
What did she do? I don't know!

494
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:42,670
When we were girls...

495
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:48,467
...we would leave each other messages.

496
00:57:51,137 --> 00:57:53,014
In light.

497
00:57:55,641 --> 00:57:57,435
In breath.

498
00:58:01,689 --> 00:58:03,316
On the windows.

499
00:58:06,944 --> 00:58:10,907
John, there is no 17th act in Corinthians.

500
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:16,829
Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the Bible in hell.

501
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:20,166
They have Bibles in hell.

502
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:23,211
Paints a different view of Revelations.

503
00:58:23,377 --> 00:58:25,505
Says the world will not end by God's hand...

504
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:28,674
...but be reborn in the embrace of the damned.

505
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,343
Though if you ask me...

506
00:58:31,052 --> 00:58:32,929
...fire's fire.

507
00:58:33,095 --> 00:58:37,350
16:29, 16:30.

508
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,562
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

509
00:58:41,729 --> 00:58:45,608
"The sins of the father would only be exceeded by the sins of the son."

510
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:49,737
Whose son? But he can't cross over, B.

511
00:58:49,904 --> 00:58:52,532
Impossible to cross over. Whose son? God's son?

512
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:56,160
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

513
00:58:56,452 --> 00:58:58,037
Here it is.

514
00:58:58,204 --> 00:59:00,248
This is the sign of Mammon...

515
00:59:00,414 --> 00:59:04,877
...the son of the devil. Well, hold on, it says here...

516
00:59:05,378 --> 00:59:07,547
Beeman? Yeah.

517
00:59:07,713 --> 00:59:10,716
Sorry, I'm... I'm sorry, no, I'm right here.

518
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:17,473
It says Mammon has no patience for his father's rule...

519
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:23,563
...and yearns to forge his own kingdom of fire and blood.

520
00:59:28,484 --> 00:59:30,903
Yeah. Mammon would be the last demon...

521
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:33,948
...we'd ever want crossing over to our plane.

522
00:59:34,115 --> 00:59:37,743
No, wait, wait, wait. I'm reading. Seems to be a loophole.

523
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:40,246
Always a catch.

524
00:59:40,663 --> 00:59:46,961
It says first Mammon would have to possess a very, very powerful psychic.

525
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:49,755
Isabel. But that wouldn't be enough.

526
00:59:50,506 --> 00:59:54,969
To cross over, Mammon would need divine assistance.

527
00:59:56,387 --> 01:00:00,558
To cross over, Mammon would need the help of God.

528
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:04,520
The help of God? It says...

529
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:14,780
Beeman? John, look...

530
01:00:14,947 --> 01:00:19,452
...I know you've never had much faith, you've never had much reason to...

531
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:23,372
...but that doesn't mean that we don't have faith...

532
01:00:24,248 --> 01:00:26,000
...in you.

533
01:00:29,128 --> 01:00:31,797
Beeman? Beeman?

534
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,842
Drive. Fast.

535
01:00:50,983 --> 01:00:52,944
Beeman!

536
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:55,071
Sulfur.

537
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:58,157
Beeman!

538
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:04,038
Beeman!

539
01:02:14,066 --> 01:02:16,319
Wasn't just Isabel.

540
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:19,155
I used to see things too.

541
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,909
But...

542
01:02:23,075 --> 01:02:26,954
...you already knew that, didn't you? Go home, Angela.

543
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:28,581
I need to understand.

544
01:02:28,748 --> 01:02:31,250
You don't wanna know what's out there, trust me.

545
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:33,503
I'm stronger than Isabel.

546
01:02:33,669 --> 01:02:37,632
Your sister embraced her gift, you denied yours. Denial is a better idea.

547
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:42,595
It's why you're still alive. Stick with me, that will change.

548
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:44,722
I don't need another ghost following me.

549
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:47,433
John, they killed my sister.

550
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:54,106
I'd trade places with her if I could.

551
01:02:57,318 --> 01:02:59,946
I used to pretend that I didn't.

552
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:03,032
That I didn't see things.

553
01:03:03,407 --> 01:03:04,992
And...

554
01:03:06,118 --> 01:03:10,456
...by the time we were 10, they started forcing her to take...

555
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:13,292
...antipsychotics...

556
01:03:14,293 --> 01:03:16,671
...and have treatments. They would come for her...

557
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:20,591
...and she'd look at me, and she'd say to me, "Tell them.

558
01:03:20,758 --> 01:03:24,595
Why don't you tell them, Angie, that you can see them too?"

559
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:27,098
But I lied.

560
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:29,976
I said:

561
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:33,813
"I don't see anything."

562
01:03:34,772 --> 01:03:36,983
Until one day...

563
01:03:37,942 --> 01:03:39,569
...I finally stopped seeing.

564
01:03:42,029 --> 01:03:44,490
I abandoned her, John.

565
01:03:45,324 --> 01:03:47,785
I left her all alone.

566
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:57,336
I need to see what she saw.

567
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:00,882
Please.

568
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:08,973
You do this, there's no turning back.

569
01:04:10,933 --> 01:04:12,852
You see them...

570
01:04:13,853 --> 01:04:15,688
...they see you.

571
01:04:16,564 --> 01:04:18,566
Understand?

572
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,027
Yeah.

573
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:29,035
Sure.

574
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:12,078
So do I have to take the rest of my clothes off, or can I leave them on?

575
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:20,169
John?

576
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:22,421
I'm thinking.

577
01:05:26,425 --> 01:05:28,052
John?

578
01:05:28,636 --> 01:05:30,721
On is fine.

579
01:05:43,401 --> 01:05:46,904
So why water? It's a universal conduit.

580
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:51,117
Lubricates the transition from one plane to another.

581
01:05:51,284 --> 01:05:55,580
Now ask me if there's water in hell. Is there water in hell?

582
01:05:57,373 --> 01:05:58,833
Sit.

583
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:04,463
Normally, only a portion of the body has to be suspended...

584
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:09,093
...but you wanted the crash course.

585
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,971
Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

586
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,223
So...

587
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,684
So, what's gonna happen?

588
01:06:16,851 --> 01:06:18,519
Lie down.

589
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:22,648
What do you mean lie down? You have to be fully submerged.

590
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:26,152
For how long?

591
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:28,613
As long as it takes.

592
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:40,833
Take a deep one.

593
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:25,396
Oh, God.

594
01:08:26,063 --> 01:08:29,192
Oh, God, all those people.

595
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:32,236
Oh, Isabel.

596
01:08:32,695 --> 01:08:34,030
I've always known.

597
01:08:34,697 --> 01:08:38,743
I've always known where they are. I've always known where to find them...

598
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:42,038
...where to aim and where to duck...

599
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:44,123
...and I've always known where they were.

600
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,334
I've always known that it wasn't luck.

601
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:49,128
Always known that it wasn't luck. I've always known...

602
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:52,465
I've always known that I could see.

603
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:57,970
I've always known that I could see.

604
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:04,602
Angela.

605
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:10,817
Someone was here.

606
01:09:37,176 --> 01:09:38,719
It was his.

607
01:09:40,012 --> 01:09:41,889
Rolling.

608
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:45,893
Not a ball.

609
01:09:47,687 --> 01:09:49,522
Something smaller.

610
01:09:52,316 --> 01:09:53,943
Shiny.

611
01:10:26,726 --> 01:10:29,020
Balthazar.

612
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,887
Sorry.

613
01:11:10,102 --> 01:11:12,271
Can you just kill him?

614
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:14,565
What about the balance?

615
01:11:14,732 --> 01:11:18,402
Half-breed tipped the scales when he started killing my friends.

616
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:21,030
I'm just adding some counterweight.

617
01:11:54,856 --> 01:11:56,983
John, I really want...

618
01:12:03,072 --> 01:12:06,159
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

619
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:15,877
I'm coming with you.

620
01:12:17,211 --> 01:12:19,672
You're staying in the car.

621
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:46,949
Fire? I was born of this.

622
01:12:47,325 --> 01:12:51,662
How's Mammon crossing over, you half-breed piece of shit?

623
01:12:55,666 --> 01:12:59,128
That's better. Au naturel.

624
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,471
"Stay in the car."

625
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:11,015
"Wait here."

626
01:13:11,724 --> 01:13:13,059
Men.

627
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:28,199
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

628
01:13:29,784 --> 01:13:31,786
Enjoy it.

629
01:14:05,236 --> 01:14:09,031
We'll see you very soon.

630
01:14:09,448 --> 01:14:11,284
Not really, no.

631
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:16,622
You can't cheat it this time. You're going back to hell.

632
01:14:16,789 --> 01:14:18,291
True.

633
01:14:18,457 --> 01:14:19,792
But you're not.

634
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:24,255
What are you doing? I'm reading you your last rites.

635
01:14:24,422 --> 01:14:28,092
Spare me your remedial incantations.

636
01:14:28,259 --> 01:14:30,595
You do know what it is to truly be forgiven?

637
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:33,306
To be welcomed into the Kingdom of God.

638
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,892
Demon in heaven.

639
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:39,520
I'd love to be a fly on that wall.

640
01:14:39,687 --> 01:14:43,941
You're not a priest. You have no power.

641
01:14:45,318 --> 01:14:47,320
Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over...

642
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:50,573
...and you can go back to your shithole.

643
01:14:53,326 --> 01:14:56,787
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

644
01:15:07,006 --> 01:15:11,886
"May God have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins.

645
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:16,891
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth, they are remitted unto them in heaven."

646
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,646
How? How's he doing it? No.

647
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:23,147
No, I can't.

648
01:15:25,024 --> 01:15:28,361
Grant your child entry into thy kingdom...

649
01:15:29,028 --> 01:15:33,991
...in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

650
01:15:34,492 --> 01:15:36,202
Amen!

651
01:15:39,121 --> 01:15:42,333
The blood of God.

652
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,835
He found it.

653
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:48,256
Whatever killed the son of God...

654
01:15:48,422 --> 01:15:53,970
...will give birth to the son of the devil.

655
01:15:56,097 --> 01:15:57,932
By the way...

656
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:03,855
...you have to ask for absolution to be forgiven...

657
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:06,023
...asshole.

658
01:16:09,944 --> 01:16:13,406
My work here is done.

659
01:16:14,782 --> 01:16:19,620
What are you laughing at? She was my only mission...

660
01:16:19,787 --> 01:16:24,000
...and you brought her right to us.

661
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:30,298
So does this walking fast mean you've found something?

662
01:16:30,464 --> 01:16:34,760
Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a cross. He was killed by a soldier's spear.

663
01:16:34,927 --> 01:16:37,096
The Spear of Destiny.

664
01:16:37,513 --> 01:16:40,224
I'm a Catholic, John. I know the Crucifixion story.

665
01:16:49,108 --> 01:16:53,946
I drew out the sister as you asked.

666
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:59,744
She's been made flush and ready.

667
01:16:59,911 --> 01:17:03,664
So much power.

668
01:17:03,956 --> 01:17:09,170
Now, if you grant me my resurrection, I shall serve.

669
01:17:11,756 --> 01:17:15,301
Wait. But I did as we agreed.

670
01:17:15,468 --> 01:17:19,096
No. Please. No!

671
01:17:21,891 --> 01:17:26,938
Beeman said Mammon needed divine assistance to cross over.

672
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:31,484
How's the blood of God's only son?

673
01:17:31,776 --> 01:17:34,153
The stains on the spear.

674
01:17:35,446 --> 01:17:38,324
Yeah. So he gets the spear.

675
01:17:38,491 --> 01:17:40,660
He still has to locate a powerful psychic.

676
01:17:41,828 --> 01:17:43,329
Not really.

677
01:17:46,415 --> 01:17:47,750
Twins.

678
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:51,337
Where's the amulet?

679
01:17:52,588 --> 01:17:55,675
I don't know, I must have left it in the...

680
01:17:57,343 --> 01:17:58,678
What's wrong?

681
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:00,930
I don't know, I just feel...

682
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:34,505
Bird on a ladder. Sorry.

683
01:18:40,094 --> 01:18:42,263
Wait here. Yeah.

684
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:48,394
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

685
01:19:02,366 --> 01:19:04,869
Have you lost what little mind you have?

686
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:06,704
Don't.

687
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:10,333
I need to use the chair.

688
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:14,545
I offer no aid to one side or the other.

689
01:19:15,546 --> 01:19:18,299
The balance. Screw the balance.

690
01:19:24,388 --> 01:19:26,891
You dare? In my house?

691
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:33,064
Is this neutral? Bullshit.

692
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:36,192
You're the only one still playing by the rules, Midnite.

693
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:40,112
And while you've been imitating Switzerland, people are dying.

694
01:19:40,613 --> 01:19:44,700
Hennessy, Beeman, they were your friends once too, remember?

695
01:19:45,785 --> 01:19:48,496
I need your help!

696
01:19:50,623 --> 01:19:53,167
Consider it a last request.

697
01:19:56,963 --> 01:19:59,799
You play a dangerous game.

698
01:20:06,973 --> 01:20:08,975
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

699
01:20:10,977 --> 01:20:15,648
That little shit has been trying to climb out of his father's shadow for eons.

700
01:20:15,815 --> 01:20:20,736
I'd hate to think what he would do to this world if he ever broke through.

701
01:20:23,823 --> 01:20:26,200
Forgot how big it was.

702
01:20:26,576 --> 01:20:30,997
Two hundred souls passed through this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

703
01:20:31,164 --> 01:20:32,832
Yeah.

704
01:20:36,043 --> 01:20:38,212
Which way's east?

705
01:20:56,022 --> 01:20:58,691
How many years since you've surfed?

706
01:20:59,942 --> 01:21:01,903
Like riding a bike.

707
01:21:02,069 --> 01:21:04,071
No, not really.

708
01:21:06,782 --> 01:21:09,577
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

709
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:15,124
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

710
01:21:21,506 --> 01:21:22,924
Cold.

711
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:25,218
Little flavor?

712
01:21:48,616 --> 01:21:50,618
Sure about this? No.

713
01:22:40,793 --> 01:22:42,461
Midnite!

714
01:22:48,176 --> 01:22:51,304
Any luck? That's a word for it.

715
01:22:51,637 --> 01:22:55,057
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite, aren't you?

716
01:23:02,815 --> 01:23:07,195
And how exactly do you intend on getting close enough to use these?

717
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,450
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

718
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:14,285
Half-breeds are most vulnerable...

719
01:23:14,452 --> 01:23:18,414
...when their outer skin is breached by holy water.

720
01:23:18,873 --> 01:23:22,210
Certain objects, most notably either of the two crosses of Isteria...

721
01:23:22,376 --> 01:23:24,879
...have been used by even the unordained to bless...

722
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:26,923
...commonly occurring waters...

723
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:28,841
...even rain.

724
01:23:29,383 --> 01:23:30,760
Maybe if...

725
01:23:35,389 --> 01:23:38,851
There's no use sitting on the bench if you're not ready to play, right?

726
01:23:39,018 --> 01:23:42,897
You wouldn't have one of those enchanted crosses here in a cabinet...

727
01:23:43,064 --> 01:23:45,149
...maybe we could take with us?

728
01:23:45,358 --> 01:23:49,862
Look, John, no offense, I just don't think that it's a great idea, you know...

729
01:23:50,029 --> 01:23:53,366
...you going on a solo mission to save the world. That's my vote.

730
01:23:53,533 --> 01:23:56,202
I don't know what pops thinks, but that's...

731
01:23:57,537 --> 01:24:00,581
Take him, John. Kill him after.

732
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:10,007
If you get back, see me about membership. Maybe.

733
01:24:10,174 --> 01:24:13,094
Okay. I will.

734
01:24:17,849 --> 01:24:20,143
What are you doing? Praying.

735
01:24:20,309 --> 01:24:23,271
Praying. Okay.

736
01:24:24,188 --> 01:24:25,857
Come on.

737
01:25:22,872 --> 01:25:24,415
Half-breeds, right?

738
01:25:27,293 --> 01:25:31,798
A birth like this, they're definitely gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

739
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:33,716
Yeah.

740
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:41,224
We can get through them. I mean, that cross has gotta work, right?

741
01:25:41,641 --> 01:25:43,059
Right?

742
01:25:43,392 --> 01:25:46,771
It's not always like it is in the books.

743
01:26:35,153 --> 01:26:36,904
What is that?

744
01:26:37,405 --> 01:26:39,407
Hellspeak.

745
01:26:42,034 --> 01:26:44,120
You know what to do.

746
01:26:47,373 --> 01:26:49,041
I'm okay.

747
01:26:50,877 --> 01:26:52,628
Sure.

748
01:27:04,432 --> 01:27:07,059
One last show.

749
01:27:40,968 --> 01:27:42,595
Hi.

750
01:27:43,179 --> 01:27:44,514
My name's John.

751
01:27:46,766 --> 01:27:50,269
You are in violation of the balance.

752
01:27:51,103 --> 01:27:53,481
Leave immediately...

753
01:27:53,773 --> 01:27:56,442
...or I will deport you.

754
01:27:58,402 --> 01:28:00,238
All of you.

755
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,539
Go to hell.

756
01:28:15,169 --> 01:28:16,629
Holy water?

757
01:29:34,332 --> 01:29:36,542
Angela.

758
01:30:08,866 --> 01:30:10,493
John?

759
01:30:12,787 --> 01:30:14,121
John.

760
01:30:19,877 --> 01:30:21,420
Shit.

761
01:30:46,779 --> 01:30:48,156
Pull!

762
01:31:29,071 --> 01:31:30,406
Angela.

763
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:56,057
Angela, what is it?

764
01:32:02,772 --> 01:32:05,066
Get it out.

765
01:32:18,538 --> 01:32:20,081
Get it out.

766
01:32:20,665 --> 01:32:22,708
Get it...

767
01:33:06,669 --> 01:33:08,004
Oh, my God.

768
01:33:15,261 --> 01:33:16,846
Not bad, kid.

769
01:33:19,849 --> 01:33:21,851
"Not bad." You hear that?

770
01:33:22,018 --> 01:33:26,439
You know why that is? It's because this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, ass...

771
01:33:34,322 --> 01:33:36,240
Chas.

772
01:33:44,248 --> 01:33:46,834
You're right, John.

773
01:33:48,085 --> 01:33:49,796
It's not like the books.

774
01:33:50,963 --> 01:33:52,632
No...

775
01:33:53,549 --> 01:33:55,384
...it isn't.

776
01:34:16,322 --> 01:34:19,116
Into the light, I command thee.

777
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:23,621
Into the light, I command thee.

778
01:34:24,747 --> 01:34:28,876
Into the light, I command thee.

779
01:34:33,422 --> 01:34:37,051
Into the light, I command thee.

780
01:34:40,263 --> 01:34:43,141
Your ego is astounding.

781
01:34:43,307 --> 01:34:45,101
Gabriel.

782
01:34:45,268 --> 01:34:46,602
Figures.

783
01:34:47,812 --> 01:34:51,232
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

784
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:53,818
You judging me now, John?

785
01:34:55,069 --> 01:34:59,073
Betrayal, murder, genocide, call me provincial.

786
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:03,202
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind to all that was intended.

787
01:35:03,619 --> 01:35:07,290
By handing Earth over to the son of the devil?

788
01:35:07,999 --> 01:35:09,333
Help me here.

789
01:35:13,379 --> 01:35:17,675
You're handed this precious gift, right?

790
01:35:18,885 --> 01:35:22,930
Each one of you granted redemption from the Creator.

791
01:35:23,931 --> 01:35:26,476
Murderers, rapists and molesters...

792
01:35:26,642 --> 01:35:28,978
...all of you, you just have to repent...

793
01:35:29,145 --> 01:35:31,981
...and God takes you into his bosom.

794
01:35:34,317 --> 01:35:36,569
In all the worlds in all the universe...

795
01:35:36,736 --> 01:35:39,655
...no other creature can make such a boast, save man.

796
01:35:42,116 --> 01:35:43,451
It's not fair.

797
01:35:47,622 --> 01:35:51,584
If sweet, sweet God loves you so...

798
01:35:51,751 --> 01:35:54,754
...then I'll make you worthy of his love.

799
01:35:56,422 --> 01:35:59,550
I've been watching you for a long time.

800
01:35:59,717 --> 01:36:04,388
It's only in the face of horror that you truly find your nobler selves.

801
01:36:04,555 --> 01:36:08,392
And you can be so noble.

802
01:36:11,103 --> 01:36:12,688
So...

803
01:36:13,356 --> 01:36:15,691
...I'll bring you pain.

804
01:36:16,359 --> 01:36:18,736
I'll bring you horror.

805
01:36:20,446 --> 01:36:23,533
So that you may rise above it.

806
01:36:26,994 --> 01:36:30,915
So that those of you who survive this reign of hell on Earth...

807
01:36:31,082 --> 01:36:34,043
...will be worthy of God's love.

808
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:36,003
Gabriel...

809
01:36:36,462 --> 01:36:38,714
...you're insane.

810
01:36:40,633 --> 01:36:43,845
The road to salvation begins tonight.

811
01:36:44,637 --> 01:36:46,347
Right now.

812
01:37:28,014 --> 01:37:31,017
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

813
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,313
I'm not even welcome in your house.

814
01:37:36,898 --> 01:37:39,734
But I could use a little attention.

815
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:44,739
Please.

816
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:33,496
Come forth.

817
01:38:53,266 --> 01:38:55,143
Hurry.

818
01:39:12,368 --> 01:39:14,245
Mammon...

819
01:39:14,412 --> 01:39:16,873
...son of Satan...

820
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:21,502
...I unleash you unto this world.

821
01:40:15,264 --> 01:40:16,599
Lu.

822
01:40:16,766 --> 01:40:18,851
What took you so long?

823
01:40:19,018 --> 01:40:21,312
Hello, John.

824
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:25,358
John, hello.

825
01:40:30,196 --> 01:40:33,157
You're the one soul...

826
01:40:33,533 --> 01:40:37,161
...I would come up here to collect myself.

827
01:40:40,498 --> 01:40:42,875
So I've heard.

828
01:40:43,626 --> 01:40:44,961
You mind?

829
01:40:46,003 --> 01:40:48,381
Oh, go... Go right ahead. I've got stock.

830
01:40:49,382 --> 01:40:50,800
Coffin nail.

831
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:53,177
Very fitting, John.

832
01:40:56,055 --> 01:40:59,600
You know, when you cut too deep, you cut the tendons...

833
01:40:59,767 --> 01:41:02,562
...finger movement goes out the window.

834
01:41:02,728 --> 01:41:04,814
Let me help you.

835
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:17,785
See?

836
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:21,038
Sonny...

837
01:41:21,205 --> 01:41:26,335
...I've got a whole theme park full of red delights for you.

838
01:41:27,086 --> 01:41:28,629
Well, aren't you a peach.

839
01:41:30,423 --> 01:41:34,260
I didn't think you would make the same mistake twice.

840
01:41:39,098 --> 01:41:41,058
And you didn't...

841
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:43,561
...did you?

842
01:41:43,853 --> 01:41:45,480
So how's the family?

843
01:41:45,646 --> 01:41:51,611
Family's doing just fine. Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

844
01:41:51,944 --> 01:41:55,448
Word is that kid of yours is a chip off the old block.

845
01:41:55,615 --> 01:41:58,659
Well, one does what one can.

846
01:41:58,826 --> 01:42:00,453
He's in the other room.

847
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:03,414
Boys will be boys.

848
01:42:04,624 --> 01:42:05,958
With Gabriel.

849
01:42:08,795 --> 01:42:11,589
No accounting for taste, really.

850
01:42:11,964 --> 01:42:14,383
They have the Spear of Destiny.

851
01:42:17,136 --> 01:42:20,848
"They have the Spear of Destiny."

852
01:42:29,148 --> 01:42:32,360
Or is it another one of your cons?

853
01:42:34,445 --> 01:42:36,739
Go look for yourself.

854
01:42:39,784 --> 01:42:43,412
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu...

855
01:42:43,788 --> 01:42:46,833
...what's another 20 seconds?

856
01:43:51,564 --> 01:43:56,777
Lucifer. This world is mine. In time.

857
01:43:56,944 --> 01:43:59,530
You, best of all of us, Gabriel...

858
01:43:59,697 --> 01:44:04,911
...should understand ambition.

859
01:44:05,077 --> 01:44:07,580
Son of perdition.

860
01:44:08,456 --> 01:44:09,791
Little horn.

861
01:44:11,918 --> 01:44:14,128
Most unclean.

862
01:44:14,295 --> 01:44:16,923
I do miss the old names.

863
01:44:17,799 --> 01:44:20,009
Time to go home, son.

864
01:44:20,176 --> 01:44:22,637
I will smite thee...

865
01:44:22,804 --> 01:44:25,723
...in his honor.

866
01:44:30,853 --> 01:44:35,983
Looks like somebody doesn't have your back anymore.

867
01:44:53,793 --> 01:44:55,628
Father?

868
01:45:19,026 --> 01:45:20,444
So.

869
01:45:27,451 --> 01:45:28,786
So.

870
01:45:29,162 --> 01:45:32,915
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

871
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:39,672
The sister...

872
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:41,924
...Isabel.

873
01:45:43,843 --> 01:45:45,761
What about her?

874
01:45:47,763 --> 01:45:50,183
Let her go home.

875
01:45:52,894 --> 01:45:57,482
You're willing to give up your life so she can go to heaven?

876
01:46:07,283 --> 01:46:10,328
Fine. It's done.

877
01:46:12,955 --> 01:46:16,417
Time to go, John.

878
01:46:16,751 --> 01:46:18,377
Yeah.

879
01:47:16,227 --> 01:47:18,229
The sacrifice.

880
01:47:29,824 --> 01:47:35,830
No. This one belongs to me.

881
01:47:45,798 --> 01:47:51,637
No. You will live, John Constantine.

882
01:47:54,724 --> 01:47:56,142
You will live.

883
01:47:58,728 --> 01:48:01,189
So you will have...

884
01:48:02,899 --> 01:48:05,526
...the chance to prove...

885
01:48:08,154 --> 01:48:13,534
...that your soul truly belongs in hell.

886
01:48:16,579 --> 01:48:19,665
Oh, you will live.

887
01:48:24,003 --> 01:48:27,882
You will live.

888
01:49:41,664 --> 01:49:43,666
Thank you.

889
01:49:46,085 --> 01:49:48,045
No problem.

890
01:50:04,103 --> 01:50:05,855
Human.

891
01:50:07,773 --> 01:50:10,318
You don't deserve to be human.

892
01:50:11,819 --> 01:50:16,532
Do you want revenge? Is that what you're thinking right now?

893
01:50:18,993 --> 01:50:20,578
Do it.

894
01:50:21,871 --> 01:50:23,414
Do it.

895
01:50:24,957 --> 01:50:27,126
Seek revenge.

896
01:50:27,293 --> 01:50:29,587
End my life.

897
01:50:30,296 --> 01:50:31,839
Go on.

898
01:50:33,966 --> 01:50:35,468
Be the hand of God.

899
01:50:35,635 --> 01:50:38,012
It's your choice.

900
01:50:38,179 --> 01:50:40,431
It's always been your choice.

901
01:50:45,728 --> 01:50:47,146
Yeah.

902
01:50:52,819 --> 01:50:55,196
That's called pain.

903
01:50:55,363 --> 01:50:56,739
Get used to it.

904
01:51:03,162 --> 01:51:05,331
You could've shot me, John!

905
01:51:07,458 --> 01:51:10,336
You chose a higher path!

906
01:51:11,754 --> 01:51:14,549
Look how well you're doing!

907
01:51:40,074 --> 01:51:42,118
Nice spot.

908
01:51:46,372 --> 01:51:47,874
I have something for you.

909
01:51:50,918 --> 01:51:53,671
Something tells me you're not a flowers kind of guy.

910
01:51:56,716 --> 01:51:59,260
Oh, how thoughtful.

911
01:52:04,557 --> 01:52:06,392
John...

912
01:52:07,852 --> 01:52:10,146
...why are you giving me this?

913
01:52:10,313 --> 01:52:11,772
Rules.

914
01:52:12,064 --> 01:52:13,566
Hide it.

915
01:52:13,733 --> 01:52:16,777
Somewhere no one will ever be able to find it.

916
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,489
Not even me.

917
01:52:23,659 --> 01:52:25,453
Always a catch.

918
01:52:26,913 --> 01:52:28,498
Yeah.

919
01:52:41,594 --> 01:52:43,429
So.

920
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:48,100
I've got some cleaning up to do.

921
01:52:51,938 --> 01:52:53,940
I'll...

922
01:52:54,106 --> 01:52:56,400
...see you around.

923
01:52:58,903 --> 01:53:00,822
I'd like that.

924
01:53:30,810 --> 01:53:33,688
I guess there's a plan for all of us.

925
01:53:33,855 --> 01:53:35,439
I had to die...

926
01:53:35,606 --> 01:53:36,941
...twice...

927
01:53:37,108 --> 01:53:39,318
...just to figure that out.

928
01:53:39,485 --> 01:53:44,490
Like the book says, he works his work in mysterious ways.

929
01:53:44,657 --> 01:53:46,826
Some people like it...

930
01:53:46,993 --> 01:53:49,537
...some people don't.

931
01:59:42,932 --> 01:59:45,059
You did good, kid.
