1
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,785
Let us tell an old story anew,

2
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,205
and we will see how well you know it.

3
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,415
Once upon a time,

4
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,794
there were two kingdoms
that were the worst of neighbors.

5
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,797
So vast was the discord between them

6
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,508
that it was said only a great hero

7
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,886
or a terrible villain
might bring them together.

8
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,265
In one kingdom
lived folk like you and me,

9
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,726
with a vain and greedy king
to rule over them.

10
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,312
They were forever discontent,

11
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,482
and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors.

12
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,027
For in the other kingdom, the Moors,

13
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,198
lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.

14
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,535
And they needed
neither king nor queen,

15
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,245
but trusted in one another.

16
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,501
In a great tree
on a great cliff in the Moors

17
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,962
lived one such spirit.

18
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,007
You might take her for a girl,

19
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,552
but she was not just any girl.

20
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,597
She was a fairy.

21
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,959
There you go.

22
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,586
And her name

23
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:10,214
was Maleficent.

24
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,059
Good morning, Mr. Chanterelle!

25
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,894
I love your cap!

26
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,401
No. No, don't do it!

27
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,824
You missed me!

28
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,411
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

29
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,712
Lovely work, girls!

30
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:08,939
What's all the fuss about?

31
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,107
The border guards have discov...

32
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,441
Why do you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!

33
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,484
I want to!

34
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,362
There are rules, Flittle.
I tell this time, you tell next time.

35
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,822
No, you told last time,

36
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,657
so I should tell this time,
and Thistlewit next time.

37
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,450
Tell me what?

38
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,785
Fine!

39
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,161
Thank you.

40
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,122
Maleficent, the border guard...

41
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,584
The border guards have found
a human thief at the pool of jewels.

42
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,004
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,094
She's always in a hurry,
with her big wings.

44
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,764
Humans, here.
I hope there's not another war.

45
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,653
I'm not afraid.

46
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,032
Besides,
I have never seen a human up close.

47
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,201
Come out!

48
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,495
No. They mean to kill me.

49
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,165
And besides, they're hideous to look at.

50
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,168
That's extremely rude.

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,255
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.
You're classically handsome.

52
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,426
It's not right to steal,

53
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,845
but we don't kill people for it.

54
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,971
Come out.

55
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,848
Come out this instant!

56
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,862
Are you fully grown?

57
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,781
No.

58
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,034
I believe he's just a boy.

59
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,203
And you're just a girl.

60
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,413
I think.

61
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,498
Who are you?

62
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,500
I'm called Stefan.

63
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,293
Who are you?

64
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,003
I'm Maleficent.

65
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,050
Yes, right.

66
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,636
You have to give it back.

67
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,680
Give what back?

68
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,496
If I knew you would throw it away,
I would have kept it.

69
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,831
I didn't throw it away.

70
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,293
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.

71
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,091
Someday, you know, I'll live there.

72
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,093
In the castle.

73
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,223
Where do you live now?

74
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:50,893
In a barn.

75
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,312
So your parents are farmers, then?

76
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,481
My parents are dead.

77
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,027
Mine, too.

78
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,116
We'll see each other again.

79
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,785
You really shouldn't
come back here, you know.

80
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,412
It's not safe.

81
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:14,917
And if I made that choice,

82
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,960
if I came back, would you be here?

83
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,047
Perhaps.

84
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,802
-What's wrong?
-Your ring.

85
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,138
Iron burns fairies.

86
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,732
I like your wings.

88
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:44,279
Maleficent thought of how
Stefan cast away his ring,

89
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,949
he who had so little in the world,

90
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,992
so that their hands might touch again,

91
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,829
and her heart was moved.

92
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,166
Thus did the young thief
who had hoped to steal a jewel...

93
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,209
Maleficent!

94
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,753
...steal something far more precious.

95
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,713
Maleficent?

96
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,801
Maleficent!

97
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,849
After all these weeks,

98
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,684
look who came back.

99
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,688
I thought it worth the risk.

100
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,649
So, what do you do for fun?

101
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:34,371
Stefan and Maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends.

102
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:38,584
And for a time it seemed as if,
in them at least,

103
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,046
the old hatred between men and fairies
had been forgotten.

104
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:48,093
As it will, friendship slowly
turned into something else.

105
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,561
And on her 16th birthday,

106
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:00,022
Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.

107
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,943
He told her it was true love's kiss.

108
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,073
But it was not to be.

109
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:16,955
As the years passed, Stefan's ambition
pulled him away from Maleficent,

110
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,834
and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.

111
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,463
While Maleficent,
the strongest of the fairies,

112
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,508
rose to become
the protector of the Moors.

113
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,307
Maleficent often wandered alone

114
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,352
and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be,

115
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,273
for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.

116
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,484
But she was to learn.

117
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,322
For the human king had heard
of a growing power in the Moors,

118
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,325
and he sought to strike it down.

119
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,182
Guard, halt!

120
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,851
Guard, halt!

121
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,405
There they are,

122
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,368
the mysterious Moors
where no one dares to venture

123
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,747
for fear of the magical creatures
that lurk within.

124
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,374
Well, I say crush them!

125
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,438
Go no further!

126
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,816
A king

127
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,529
does not take orders from a winged elf.

128
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,576
You are no king to me.

129
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,460
-Bring me her head.
-Battalion!

130
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,049
Advance!

131
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:21,682
Arise and stand with me!

132
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,022
Hold the line!

133
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,288
-It's the dark creatures!
-It's the dark creatures!

134
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,853
Charge!

135
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:06,411
You!

136
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,667
To the king!

137
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,509
You will not have the Moors!

138
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,553
Not now, nor ever!

139
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,137
You...

140
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,262
When I ascended to the throne,

141
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,433
I promised the people

142
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,728
one day we would take

143
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,190
the Moors and its treasures.

144
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,817
Each of you

145
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,531
swore allegiance to me
and to that cause.

146
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,122
Your Majesty.

147
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,961
Defeated in battle.

148
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,673
Is this to be my legacy?

149
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,844
I see you waiting for me to die.

150
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:49,806
It won't be long. But what then?

151
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,267
I will choose a successor

152
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:56,104
to take the throne
and care for my daughter.

153
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,815
Who among you

154
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,527
is worthy?

155
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:05,572
Kill the winged creature.

156
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,324
Avenge me,

157
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,537
and upon my death
you will take the crown.

158
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,732
Maleficent.

159
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,819
Maleficent!

160
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,454
So, how is life with the humans?

161
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,544
Maleficent, I've come to warn you.

162
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,462
They mean to kill you.

163
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,008
King Henry will stop at nothing.

164
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,763
Please, you have to trust me.

165
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,936
They spoke of many things,

166
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,730
and the years faded away.

167
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:25,569
And she forgave Stefan
his folly and his ambition,

168
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,406
and all was as it had been long ago.

169
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,577
You thirsty?

170
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,905
Maleficent?

171
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,750
What is this?

172
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,130
I have avenged you, sire.

173
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,009
She is vanquished?

174
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,889
You have done well, my son.

175
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,684
You have done
what others feared to do.

176
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,854
You will be rewarded.

177
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:53,569
I shall do my best
to be a worthy successor,

178
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,821
Your Majesty.

179
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,246
I've got you!

180
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,752
-You wicked bird!
-Into a man.

181
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,755
It's a...

182
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,101
It's a demon!

183
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,409
What have you done
to my beautiful self?

184
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,453
Would you
rather I let them beat you to death?

185
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,664
I'm not certain.

186
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,291
Stop complaining.

187
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,543
I saved your life.

188
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,964
Forgive me.

189
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:02,966
What do I call you?

190
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:04,968
Diaval.

191
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:08,805
And in return for saving my life,
I am your servant.

192
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,350
Whatever you need.

193
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:13,977
Wings.

194
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,564
I need you to be my wings.

195
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,920
I present to you the first of his line,

196
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,799
His Royal Highness King Stefan.

197
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,993
He did this to me so he would be king.

198
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,848
Now what, Mistress?

199
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,971
Her wings!

200
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:01,728
It's a girl!

201
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,147
It's a girl! It's a girl!

202
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:28,630
Well?

203
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,508
Well, I saw nothing.

204
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,844
But there's been a...

205
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,512
What?

206
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:39,183
Child.

207
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,937
King Stefan and the Queen
have had a child.

208
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,903
There will be a christening.

209
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,405
They say it's to be a grand celebration.

210
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:59,870
A grand celebration for a baby.

211
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:03,749
How wonderful.

212
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:23,060
All manner of folk
came to the christening,

213
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:27,397
even a trio of fairies who sought
to foster peace and goodwill.

214
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,441
Look, there's the baby!

215
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,776
I love babies!

216
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,987
Can you just concentrate, please?
I'm not telling you again.

217
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:44,248
Greetings, Your Majesty.

218
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,875
I am Knotgrass
of the Moorland Fair Folk.

219
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,836
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship.

220
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,588
And I'm Thistlewit, Your Royalnesses.

221
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,633
They bring gifts for our daughter.

222
00:27:55,926 --> 00:28:00,556
These are not just any old gifts,
for, you see, we're magic!

223
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:02,599
And very good with children.

224
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,146
Very well.

225
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:15,195
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you

226
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,282
the gift of beauty.

227
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:26,999
My wish is that you will never be blue,

228
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:31,044
only happy, all the days of your life.

229
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,302
Sweet baby,

230
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,805
my wish for you is that you find...

231
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,537
-Maleficent!
-Maleficent!

232
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,842
Well, well.

233
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:27,309
What a glittering assemblage,
King Stefan.

234
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:37,110
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and...

235
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:40,697
How quaint.

236
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:44,952
Even the rabble.

237
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,752
I must say

238
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:59,091
I really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation.

239
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,385
You're not welcome here.

240
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:11,895
Oh, dear.

241
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,815
What an awkward situation.

242
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:16,608
You're not offended?

243
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,404
Why, no.

244
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:26,618
And to show I bear no ill will,

245
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:30,998
I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child.

246
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:32,791
No! We don't want your gift!

247
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,338
Stay away from the princess!

248
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,424
Yes, stay away!

249
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,651
Listen well, all of you.

250
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:02,196
Listen well, all of you.

251
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:08,493
The princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty,

252
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,247
beloved by all who meet her.

253
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,291
That's a lovely gift.

254
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:19,713
Don't do this.

255
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,605
But

256
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:43,487
before the sun sets
on her 16th birthday,

257
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:47,908
she will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel

258
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,661
and fall into a sleep like death,

259
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:55,749
a sleep from which
she will never awaken.

260
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,336
Maleficent, please don't do this,
I'm begging you.

261
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,507
I like you begging.

262
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:07,219
Do it again.

263
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:26,697
I beg you.

264
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,367
All right.

265
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:39,543
The princess can be woken
from her death sleep,

266
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,880
but only by

267
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:46,091
true love's kiss.

268
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:51,138
This curse will last till the end of time!

269
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,308
No power on Earth can change it.

270
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:11,825
King Stefan ordered his men

271
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:14,578
to seize every spinning wheel
in the kingdom.

272
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:19,583
The wheels were broken and burned,
that they might never be used,

273
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:23,587
and thrown into the deepest dungeon
in the castle.

274
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,716
Secretly, he entrusted
the safety of the child

275
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:30,093
to the magic of the pixies,

276
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:35,474
who would take her to a remote
hideaway for 16 years and a day.

277
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:43,440
Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle

278
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:49,613
while his soldiers rode far and wide
to hunt Maleficent down.

279
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,242
But she made walls of her own,

280
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,954
that the Moors might
never again suffer the touch

281
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:59,039
of any human.

282
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:06,171
And she reveled in the sorrow
that her curse had brought.

283
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,886
The fairies began their charge

284
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:16,931
to raise Aurora in a snug little cottage
in the woods.

285
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:20,185
No! Is this it?

286
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,521
Looks dreadful.

287
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,398
Come on.

288
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,234
We need a smaller...

289
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:28,443
Baby.

290
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,237
Or bigger bodies.

291
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,907
No, what we need is a proper disguise.

292
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,324
What do you mean?

293
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,327
Well, we have to blend in, don't we?

294
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,329
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.

295
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,166
So, gather around, ladies.

296
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:47,212
Get ready. One, two, three, grow!

297
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,677
That's worked quite well.
That's very nice.

298
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,847
Now, there will be no questions asked.

299
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,890
We are no longer fairies.

300
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,684
We are three peasant women
raising our orphan child in the woods.

301
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,729
-Yes.
-So, no more flying.

302
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:07,649
-No flying?
-No, no, and no magic.

303
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,151
-No magic?
-Yes, you heard.

304
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:10,360
It's in the middle of nowhere.

305
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:12,905
At least no one will find us here.

306
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:23,373
There you are.
Why are you always hiding?

307
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:25,417
Come on. There you go.

308
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:47,564
It's so ugly, you could
almost feel sorry for it.

309
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,743
I hate you. Beasty.

310
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,961
The fairies were
perhaps unequal to their task.

311
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:12,381
Why is she crying?

312
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:13,757
I think she might be hungry.

313
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,468
Then feed her!

314
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:29,565
There you are.

315
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:31,108
There you go.

316
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:40,242
It's going to starve
with those three looking after it.

317
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,965
It tickles.

318
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,162
-What?
-You're cheating.

319
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:26,788
I saw that!

320
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,999
-We're starting again.
-Suit yourself.

321
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,169
Greedy, bloated goat!

322
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,173
"Bloated goat."

323
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:41,386
Stop doing that.

324
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:43,847
I'm not doing anything.

325
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,226
Well, someone is.

326
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:48,644
It's not me.

327
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:52,231
You two are having a go at me,
and I will not tolerate...

328
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:55,192
Stop it!

329
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,371
Why...

330
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,461
No!

331
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,213
This is all your fault!

332
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,309
Come on. That's funny.

333
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:34,898
As the days went on, Stefan darkened,

334
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:38,193
further consumed
by paranoia and vengeance.

335
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,029
-Burn it all down!
-Yes, sir!

336
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,698
Flame!

337
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,493
Release!

338
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,112
Run!

339
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,335
You failed me.

340
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,341
The wall cannot be burned.
It is indestructible.

341
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,765
Nothing is indestructible!

342
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:55,062
Not the wall! Not Maleficent!
Not even her curse!

343
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:15,499
Bring me the iron workers.

344
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:41,191
You!

345
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,912
Look.

346
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:57,875
The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.

347
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:24,943
What?

348
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:45,422
Hello.

349
00:41:57,392 --> 00:41:58,435
Go away.

350
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:00,354
Go.

351
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,105
Go away.

352
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,485
I don't like children.

353
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:10,906
Up, up.

354
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:31,134
Go along. Go, go, go.

355
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:45,315
As Maleficent had said,

356
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:49,570
Aurora did grow in grace and beauty.

357
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:54,157
Pretty bird.

358
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:59,496
Far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not.

359
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:07,045
And as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew,

360
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:09,339
so did she.

361
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:24,354
Hello.

362
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:26,356
That's it.

363
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:33,614
There you go.

364
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:36,325
She wondered at the world about her,

365
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:44,875
and at what lay beyond
the fearsome wall of thorns.

366
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:57,179
Curious little beasty.

367
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:01,350
But she was not the only one
who wished to get through.

368
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:05,896
Look.

369
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:12,236
-Is that her? Is that Maleficent?
-I don't know.

370
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:17,407
Bring them to me.

371
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,664
No, it's just a silly peasant girl.

372
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,439
Steady.

373
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,760
-It's her!
-It's her!

374
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:25,035
How could you do that to me?

375
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,287
You said anything I need.

376
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:28,539
Yeah, but not a dog.

377
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,791
It was a wolf, not a dog.

378
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:32,543
It's the same thing.

379
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:36,630
They're dirty, vicious,
and they hunt birds.

380
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:40,008
Fine. Next time I'll turn you
into a mealy worm.

381
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,637
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly.
Anything but a filthy, stinking...

382
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:55,023
I wonder.

383
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,168
I know you're there.

384
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,128
Don't be afraid.

385
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,092
I am not afraid.

386
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:47,928
Then come out.

387
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:50,681
Then you'll be afraid.

388
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:52,766
No, I won't.

389
00:49:09,867 --> 00:49:11,034
I know who you are.

390
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:13,829
Do you?

391
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:18,125
You're my Fairy Godmother.

392
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:22,004
What?

393
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:24,047
Fairy Godmother.

394
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,800
You've been watching over me
my whole life.

395
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:29,428
I've always known you were close by.

396
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,055
How?

397
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:36,185
Your shadow. It's been following me
ever since I was small.

398
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:39,271
Wherever I went,
your shadow was always with me.

399
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:43,775
I remember you.

400
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:46,153
Pretty bird.

401
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:49,156
This is Diaval.

402
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:55,412
Hello, Aurora.

403
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:00,209
I have known you
since you were a little one.

404
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:09,760
It's everything I imagined it would be.

405
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,347
It's just so beautiful!
I've always wanted to come...

406
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:03,188
Good night, beasty.

407
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:17,327
You mock me.

408
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,664
I know what you're doing.

409
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:24,543
I know exactly what you're doing.

410
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:25,627
Sire?

411
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,338
Your presence has been
requested by the Queen.

412
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:30,048
Leave me.

413
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:32,342
Sire, she is not well.

414
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:36,305
The nurses are fearful
that she won't make it through the night.

415
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:43,312
Can you not see
we're having a conversation?

416
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:54,865
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.

417
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:58,493
And on that day, I will be ready.

418
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,968
They're so beautiful.

419
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,462
I revoke the curse.

420
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:36,008
Let it be no more.

421
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:39,803
I revoke the curse.

422
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:42,848
Let it be no more.

423
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,810
I revoke my curse!

424
00:53:47,144 --> 00:53:49,813
Let it be no more!

425
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:52,274
I revoke my curse!

426
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,153
Let it be no more!

427
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:01,158
Let it be no more!

428
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:12,753
This curse will last till the end of time.

429
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:16,423
No power on Earth can change it.

430
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,822
Do all the Fair People have wings?

431
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:44,868
Most do.

432
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:47,162
Then why don't you?

433
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:50,207
All the other fairies fly.

434
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,878
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.

435
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:57,047
That's all I wish to say about it.

436
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:59,550
What color were they?

437
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:01,635
Were they big?

438
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:08,267
So big
they dragged behind me when I walked.

439
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:12,020
And they were strong.

440
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:15,065
They could carry me above the clouds
and into the headwinds.

441
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:20,404
And they never faltered, not even once.

442
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:22,406
I could trust them.

443
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:52,144
She's coming. She's coming.

444
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:58,233
Where are your workers?

445
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:01,612
In their beds, Majesty.

446
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:04,281
Get them back to work without delay.

447
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:06,158
They're exhausted, sire.

448
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:08,994
But I'll have them
back to work at first light.

449
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:12,998
I need them back to work now.

450
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:14,791
It's the wee hours.

451
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,296
Aye.

452
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,007
Aye.

453
00:56:23,342 --> 00:56:24,760
It is the wee hours.

454
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:28,931
So wake them up.

455
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:30,891
Sire?

456
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:35,062
So wake them up,
and get them back to work now!

457
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:38,315
We're running out of time! Go, now!

458
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:09,137
Aurora?

459
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,682
Come here.

460
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:22,526
Sit.

461
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:28,740
There's something I need to tell you.

462
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:30,701
What is it?

463
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:35,455
There is an evil in this world,

464
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:38,750
and I cannot keep you from it.

465
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:42,504
I'm almost 16, Godmother.

466
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:44,339
I can take care of myself.

467
00:57:44,882 --> 00:57:46,383
I understand.

468
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:51,346
-But that's not what I have to tell you.
-I have a plan.

469
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:53,849
When I'm older,

470
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:56,435
I'm going to live here
in the Moors with you.

471
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,188
Then we can look after each other.

472
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:07,946
You don't have to wait until you're older.

473
00:58:08,197 --> 00:58:09,406
You could live here now.

474
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:12,618
Then I will.

475
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:16,914
I'll sleep in a tree
and eat berries and black nuts

476
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:19,625
and all the Fair People
will be my friends.

477
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:23,962
I'll be happy here for the rest of my life.

478
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:27,549
I'm going to tell my aunties tomorrow.

479
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:31,929
Until tomorrow.

480
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:34,056
I'm so excited!

481
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:53,492
Aunties, I'm almost 16.

482
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:55,911
I need a life of my own.

483
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:59,122
No. I love you very much,

484
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:01,458
but it's time to say goodbye.

485
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:03,752
You've been very good to me,

486
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:06,755
except the time
you accidentally fed me spiders.

487
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:12,928
Hello.

488
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:17,558
I'm sorry to bother you,

489
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:19,226
but I'm on my way
to King Stefan's castle

490
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:22,145
and I've become hopelessly lost.

491
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:23,647
Can you help me?

492
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:27,150
I'm sorry. That was my fault.
I rushed in too...

493
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:35,284
Forgive me.

494
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:40,038
It's that way.

495
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:45,752
The castle.

496
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:52,885
What's your name?

497
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:54,678
It's Philip.

498
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:57,806
Hello, Philip.

499
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:00,517
What's yours?

500
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:03,145
Aurora.

501
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:06,481
Hello, Aurora.

502
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:13,322
Well, it was nice meeting you.

503
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:17,034
And once again, my apologies
for being such a clumsy fool.

504
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:20,245
You're forgiven.

505
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,039
That's good.

506
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,460
I'd best be off, then.

507
01:00:28,086 --> 01:00:29,505
Goodbye.

508
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:43,018
Will you be back this way?

509
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:46,146
Nothing could stop me.

510
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,441
Then I'll see you soon.

511
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:51,652
Very soon.

512
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:55,906
-Goodbye, Philip.
-Goodbye, for now.

513
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,584
Stop doing that.

514
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,466
Well?

515
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:16,468
That boy's the answer.

516
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:20,347
-No, Diaval.
-Yes!

517
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:23,183
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.

518
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:25,269
True love's kiss?

519
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:27,396
Have you not worked it out yet?

520
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:32,150
I cursed her that way
because there is no such thing.

521
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:35,612
Well, that might be how you feel,

522
01:01:36,697 --> 01:01:37,865
but what about Aurora?

523
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:41,952
That boy could be her only chance.

524
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:44,955
It's her fate, anyway.

525
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:48,375
Go ahead.

526
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,961
Turn me into whatever you want.

527
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:52,129
A bird, a worm.

528
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:54,423
I don't care anymore.

529
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:03,265
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow.

530
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:06,435
We are not leaving tomorrow.

531
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:08,645
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.

532
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:12,733
And Stefan told us to take her back
the day after her birthday.

533
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:16,069
No. He said on her birthday.

534
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,488
No. The day after her birthday.

535
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:20,157
-On.
-After.

536
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:22,492
-On.
-After.

537
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,995
-On, on, on!
-After, after, after!

538
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,248
Stop it!

539
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,254
What?

540
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:37,716
How could you?

541
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:43,889
I need to talk to you about something.

542
01:02:44,181 --> 01:02:46,433
Yes, sweetie, what is it?

543
01:02:52,731 --> 01:02:54,525
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

544
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,194
but I'll be 16 tomorrow.

545
01:02:58,195 --> 01:02:59,363
Yes.

546
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:09,206
I'm leaving home.

547
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:15,295
See here, young lady.

548
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:19,466
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel

549
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,717
with these two imbeciles...

550
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:24,054
So that you could ruin it on the last day.

551
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:26,557
We are taking you back
to your father with...

552
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:28,809
My father?

553
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:32,604
You told me my parents were dead.

554
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,402
I think you better come and sit down.

555
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:53,750
Fairy Godmother!

556
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:56,420
I'm here.

557
01:03:57,963 --> 01:04:00,674
When were you going to tell me
that I'm cursed?

558
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:06,972
Is it true?

559
01:04:10,058 --> 01:04:11,268
It is.

560
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:16,607
My aunts said it was an evil fairy.

561
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:19,484
I... I can't remember her name.

562
01:04:20,277 --> 01:04:21,778
They said

563
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:23,947
it was...

564
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:25,866
Maleficent.

565
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:38,837
Is that you?

566
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:44,927
Are you Maleficent?

567
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:49,473
No!

568
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,558
Don't touch me.

569
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:53,977
You're the evil that's in the world.

570
01:04:55,312 --> 01:04:56,647
It's you!

571
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:06,907
Find the boy!

572
01:05:24,591 --> 01:05:27,678
I need every available man
on the east wing now.

573
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:30,931
There should be no guards at the gate.
I want her to walk right in.

574
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:32,516
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.

575
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:36,812
We found this urchin at the gate.

576
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:39,481
She claims to be the princess.

577
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:46,488
Father.

578
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,657
It's me, Aurora!

579
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:01,879
You look just like your mother.

580
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:06,425
They brought you back a day too soon.

581
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:08,510
I told those three idiots!

582
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:10,762
Lock her up in her room.

583
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:12,389
Go.

584
01:06:13,098 --> 01:06:15,726
Prepare the men. Maleficent's coming.

585
01:06:16,602 --> 01:06:19,396
It's so good to be small again!

586
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,565
Look at my feet!

587
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:24,067
I love my tiny little feet!

588
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,070
Pay attention! We have to find Aurora,

589
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:29,948
or the king will have our heads!

590
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:01,146
Aurora.

591
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,408
Wait!

592
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:16,995
Princess?

593
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:26,255
I'm looking for a girl.

594
01:07:26,797 --> 01:07:28,465
Of course you are.

595
01:07:33,053 --> 01:07:34,680
I need a horse.

596
01:07:51,572 --> 01:07:55,909
...into a sleep like death.

597
01:08:00,873 --> 01:08:02,749
Aurora.

598
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:07,462
Come on, Diaval!

599
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:21,685
Aurora.

600
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:57,554
Faster, Diaval, faster!

601
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:05,270
She will prick her finger
on the spindle of a spinning wheel

602
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:07,898
and fall into a sleep like death.

603
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:12,277
No power on Earth...

604
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:16,740
A sleep like death.

605
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:36,551
It's done.

606
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:10,002
They pulled the guards.
He's waiting for you in there.

607
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:13,589
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.

608
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:19,386
Then don't come. It's not your fight.

609
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:25,517
Thank you very much.

610
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:30,147
"I need you, Diaval.
I can't do this without you, Diaval."

611
01:10:31,315 --> 01:10:32,816
I can hear you.

612
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:42,284
Look at her.

613
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:45,954
Look at what you've done.

614
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:49,625
She's only sleeping.

615
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:55,839
She's only sleeping, you say?

616
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:01,720
She's only sleeping.

617
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:05,849
She's only sleeping forever!

618
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:09,978
-What about the kiss?
-Yes! True love's kiss!

619
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:16,068
True love does not exist.

620
01:11:16,527 --> 01:11:18,987
But it's her only chance, Your Majesty.

621
01:11:32,793 --> 01:11:34,044
Mistress.

622
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:40,569
What are we going to do?

623
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:43,071
We can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls.

624
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,199
But we don't even know where to start.

625
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:47,951
True love doesn't just fall
from trees, you know.

626
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:02,007
Pardon me.

627
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:04,593
I'm embarrassed to say
I don't know where I am.

628
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:07,095
In King Stefan's castle.

629
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:12,059
This is where I'm meant to be.

630
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,811
Odd that I can't recall how I got here.

631
01:13:14,895 --> 01:13:15,896
Why have you come?

632
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,814
My father sent me to see the King.

633
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:18,899
Who is your father?

634
01:13:19,233 --> 01:13:20,442
King John of Ulstead.

635
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,903
A prince!

636
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:35,415
Aurora.

637
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,418
He knows her.

638
01:13:40,045 --> 01:13:41,463
Why is she sleeping?

639
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,882
She's trapped in an enchantment.

640
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:46,385
Isn't she beautiful?

641
01:13:47,553 --> 01:13:50,138
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

642
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:53,225
Do you want to kiss her?

643
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:56,186
Very much.

644
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:57,980
Go on, then.

645
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:01,358
I wouldn't feel right about it.

646
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,068
I barely know her. We've only met once.

647
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:05,487
Haven't you ever heard
of love at first sight?

648
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:07,155
Kiss her!

649
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:08,574
Go on.

650
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:13,787
An enchantment, you say?

651
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:16,999
Kiss her!

652
01:15:09,426 --> 01:15:10,886
You didn't do it properly!

653
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:13,680
It's supposed to be true love's kiss!

654
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:15,307
I was certain he was the one.

655
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:17,935
-What are you doing?
-We have to keep looking.

656
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:26,318
I told you.

657
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:53,595
I will not ask your forgiveness

658
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:58,183
because what I have done to you
is unforgivable.

659
01:16:00,644 --> 01:16:02,312
I was so lost

660
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:05,649
in hatred and revenge.

661
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:10,696
Sweet Aurora,

662
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:15,325
you stole what was left of my heart.

663
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:18,662
And now I have lost you forever.

664
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:35,762
I swear, no harm will come to you
as long as I live.

665
01:16:37,181 --> 01:16:42,019
And not a day shall pass
that I don't miss your smile.

666
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:13,091
Hello, Godmother.

667
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:20,432
Hello, beasty.

668
01:17:33,237 --> 01:17:34,821
No truer love.

669
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:49,920
She's here, sire.

670
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:06,186
Are we going back to the Moors now?

671
01:18:08,522 --> 01:18:10,274
If that is what you wish.

672
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:38,385
We've got her!

673
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:45,475
-Stop!
-Get back!

674
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:04,995
No!

675
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:14,254
Into a dragon.

676
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:41,782
To the other side.

677
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:52,709
Run, Aurora!

678
01:20:05,848 --> 01:20:08,725
Get back! Hold it steady!

679
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:10,811
Pull to the left! Pull!

680
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:15,566
Hold the line!

681
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:22,364
Look out. Hold your line.

682
01:21:30,641 --> 01:21:33,435
-Close in.
-Bring it down!

683
01:22:00,921 --> 01:22:02,130
Enough!

684
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:09,847
How does it feel?

685
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:13,851
To be a fairy creature without wings

686
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:19,523
in a world where you don't belong?

687
01:23:08,655 --> 01:23:09,740
Kill her!

688
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:11,533
Kill her!

689
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:17,956
Shoot!

690
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:47,444
Shoot her!

691
01:23:47,778 --> 01:23:48,820
Take aim!

692
01:24:51,675 --> 01:24:52,843
It's over.

693
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:15,592
Maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns

694
01:26:15,759 --> 01:26:18,053
and took off her crown.

695
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:23,016
And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once,

696
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,687
long ago, when Maleficent
was but a child

697
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:28,981
and her heart was bright.

698
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:32,317
For now, it was again.

699
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:37,906
But that was not all.

700
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:51,628
There she is. Hurry up. They're waiting.

701
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:53,463
Wait for me!

702
01:26:54,381 --> 01:26:56,550
We present this crown
to our little Aurora,

703
01:26:57,009 --> 01:27:00,053
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...

704
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:01,972
Never mind.

705
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:10,272
Our kingdoms have been unified.

706
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:13,984
You have your queen.

707
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:20,324
So you see,
the story is not quite as you were told,

708
01:27:20,908 --> 01:27:22,492
and I should know,

709
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:27,039
for I was the one
they called Sleeping Beauty.

710
01:28:00,405 --> 01:28:05,536
In the end, my kingdom was united
not by a hero or a villain,

711
01:28:05,577 --> 01:28:07,538
as legend had predicted,

712
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:11,625
but by one who was
both hero and villain.

713
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:16,213
And her name was Maleficent.
