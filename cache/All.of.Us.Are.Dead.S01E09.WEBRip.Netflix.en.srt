1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,806
-Cheong-san!
-What the hell?

2
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,479
Damn it.

3
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,482
On-jo.

4
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,331
Su-hyeok!

5
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,959
Su-hyeok, are you okay?

6
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,923
Shit.

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,893
Who the hell are you guys?

8
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,979
What about you?
Are you from the One Heart club?

9
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,441
ONE HEART

10
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,400
It's me.

11
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:09,861
Me.

12
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,322
Don't you know me?

13
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,617
How the fuck do you not know me?

14
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,618
I know you.

15
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,244
I said it again and again.

16
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,789
You were the bullies' gopher.

17
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,087
Call me that again, and you're dead.

18
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,547
You were never a thug or a good student.

19
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,467
And now you're not a zombie or a human.

20
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,929
Then and now…

21
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,182
you're nothing.

22
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,936
I'm not going to just kill you.

23
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,150
I'll gouge out both of your eyes
and throw you to the zombies.

24
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,693
Yes.

25
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,656
Everyone but Cheong-san, run away.

26
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,534
Unless you want to die with him.

27
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,375
You're all dead.

28
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:07,961
Cheong-san.

29
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,880
Get out of the way!

30
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,918
Let go.

31
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,711
Let go, fuck!

32
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,097
Let go, fuck!

33
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,278
You smell nice.

34
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,953
You and I are on the same side.

35
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,955
Smell me.

36
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,915
Go on.

37
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,874
Get lost.

38
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,486
Your shirt ripped.

39
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,445
It's okay.

40
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,491
Fuck.

41
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,875
What the hell is he?

42
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,460
He was so strong.

43
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,672
Are you hurt anywhere else?

44
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,590
Did your glasses break?

45
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,717
What the hell is he?

46
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,385
You're bleeding.

47
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,970
-So he's Gwi-nam?
-What? Damn it.

48
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,763
I guess so.

49
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,098
-What about me?
-Let me see.

50
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,641
My legs are shaking.

51
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,059
You're okay.

52
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,436
It hurts like hell.

53
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,091
Damn it.

54
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,094
We're on the same side.

55
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:06,407
EXAMINATION ROOM

56
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,416
Here you go.

57
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,793
Thank you.

58
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,562
The homology test on the virus
is not producing results.

59
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,231
What does that mean?

60
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,943
All living organisms come from somewhere,

61
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,488
and a homology test shows us the origin.

62
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,991
It's like a genealogy for viruses.

63
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,993
But we can't figure it out.

64
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,497
Are you saying
it's a completely new virus?

65
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,917
The KDCA is also analyzing it,
but they can't identify it either.

66
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,214
We need to identify it
before we can treat them.

67
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,761
You people are the experts.

68
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,390
How could you not have identified it yet?

69
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,476
The strange thing is,

70
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,813
the RNA structure changes
every time we test it.

71
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,943
The virus seems to be evolving on its own.

72
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,244
We rescued a detective
from Hyosan Police Station.

73
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,912
He seems to know about the virus.

74
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,377
There's a laptop
in Hyosan High School and--

75
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,378
Hey.

76
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,589
You need to start from the beginning.

77
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,466
But it's urgent.

78
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,383
Damn it.

79
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,597
The virus that's spreading in Hyosan
is called the Jonas Virus.

80
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,766
Lee Byeong-chan, a science teacher
at Hyosan High School, created it.

81
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,311
There's a laptop
in the science lab of the school.

82
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,565
He said it had everything necessary
to resolve this wretched situation.

83
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,691
Laptop?

84
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,861
-Is his story credible?
-Yes.

85
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,739
The initial reports of the outbreak

86
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,241
were from Hyosan Hospital's ER
and Hyosan High School.

87
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,786
The student that was taken to the ER
was a student from Hyosan High.

88
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,498
Thus, I'm certain
that Hyosan High is ground zero.

89
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,009
Continue to question that detective.

90
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,470
Send a Special Mission Unit
to Hyosan High.

91
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,639
Bring me the laptop.

92
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,432
Yes, sir.

93
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,814
Eun-ji.

94
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,483
Eun-ji!

95
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,109
WAITING STATION

96
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,829
Are you okay?

97
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,666
I thought you had died.

98
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,376
You let me go knowing I'd die.

99
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,087
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,838
I was--

101
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,923
It's fine.

102
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,009
That's who you are.

103
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:14,929
Hey.

104
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,306
Want to hear some good news?

105
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,183
I set fire to the school.

106
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,270
It's probably burned to the ground by now.

107
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,356
You set the school on fire?

108
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,984
Yes. You're happy too, right?

109
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,736
Are you all right?

110
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,239
I'm fine.

111
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,324
Why?

112
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,868
You seem strange.
You're not your usual self.

113
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,831
I'm hungry.

114
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,875
I get worked up when I'm hungry.

115
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,171
Do you want this, then?

116
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,466
They're giving these out,
but the line's really long.

117
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,010
You eat first.

118
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,637
I don't want that.

119
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,599
This is all they have.

120
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,269
Not that. I want to eat something else.

121
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,688
Like what?

122
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,319
You?

123
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,029
Me?

124
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,781
Yes.

125
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,658
I want to eat you.

126
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,296
Damn, it stings.

127
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,427
What the hell is with that Gwi-nam guy?

128
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,180
You said he was bitten.

129
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,183
I don't know.

130
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,061
It looks like he became a different being.

131
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,729
I don't think he can die.

132
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,439
What if he climbs up here again?

133
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,568
That asshole is bad,

134
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,405
but to be honest,
I'm scared of Nam-ra too.

135
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,699
You saw her fighting earlier.

136
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,576
I think

137
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,829
it's reasonable to assume
they're both hambies--

138
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,123
What?

139
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,919
You're really okay, right?

140
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,798
You won't do that to us, right?

141
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,344
Will you believe me if I say I won't?

142
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,680
Must you talk like that?

143
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,683
Can't you try to make us believe you?

144
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,728
We're going to be together anyway.

145
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,829
I… have never done anything but study.

146
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,126
Not because I was naive
but because I was a coward.

147
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,629
I was scared my grades would drop

148
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,132
and that my mom would get mad.
So I didn't do anything else.

149
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,510
I was too scared to make friends too.

150
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:05,516
My mom always asked
about how well they did at school,

151
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,269
what their father did for a living,
how big their house is…

152
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:20,656
I never thought I'd get to sit
by a fire with all of you like this.

153
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,037
It's really nice.

154
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,458
It's my first time.

155
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,462
If we get out of here,

156
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,006
let's gather around a fire

157
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,717
and hang out like this again.

158
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,765
I really hope we can.

159
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,768
Sure, let's do that.

160
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,105
If anyone lights a fire…

161
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,485
let's all gather together.

162
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,532
Sorry, Prez.

163
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,874
Did she just smile?
That looked so awkward.

164
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,127
God, come on.

165
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,463
What? What now?

166
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,507
Why don't you two just go out?

167
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,050
You're being so loud.

168
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,426
-Are you mad?
-Are you crazy?

169
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,553
Hold on.

170
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,641
Don't you hear that?

171
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,059
Hear what?

172
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,436
Why? Is someone coming again?

173
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,359
They're coming.

174
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,365
What's coming?

175
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,578
What is it?

176
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,041
I don't see anything.

177
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,129
Wait.

178
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,840
I hear a chopper.

179
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,774
ALO Viper.
We've entered Hyosan High's airspace.

180
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,860
TGT 1M, reporting.

181
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,278
Fire.

182
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,697
-Fire!
-It's coming.

183
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,198
-Hey!
-This way. It's this way.

184
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,324
Sir!

185
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,785
-Over here! We're here!
-Over here!

186
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,663
-Please help!
-Here!

187
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,415
-Over here!
-Hey! Over here!

188
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,125
-We're here!
-Here!

189
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,835
Look at us, will you?

190
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,169
Hey!

191
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,254
Can't you see us?

192
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,922
-We're here!
-Over here!

193
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,632
-Here!
-Here!

194
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,009
-Hey!
-Look at us!

195
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,969
Over here! Look this way!

196
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,848
ALO Viper. We've arrived at Hyosan High.

197
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,898
-Here!
-Here! Over here!

198
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,274
-Sir!
-Sir!

199
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,234
-Over here!
-We're over here!

200
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,111
-Hey!
-Here!

201
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,322
-Over here!
-Over here!

202
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,074
-Help us!
-We're going to live!

203
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,285
He saw us! Over here!

204
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,329
Over here!

205
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,246
We're saved!

206
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,791
We're going to live!

207
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,335
Over here!

208
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,837
Over here!

209
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,031
-Here--
-Oh my God.

210
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,711
Get down. All of you, down on the ground!

211
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,547
Sir.

212
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,257
Please save us.

213
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,843
-Get down on the ground!
-Get down!

214
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,599
Examining the area.

215
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,352
Hyosan High rooftop.

216
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,646
Nine survivors confirmed.

217
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,272
Their condition?

218
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,066
Checking temperatures now.

219
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,193
Clear.

220
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,903
I think they're checking if we're zombies.

221
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,863
-Clear.
-Don't worry.

222
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,823
Clear.

223
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,241
Clear.

224
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,121
Clear.

225
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,832
Clear.

226
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:45,963
Clear.

227
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,807
Temperature is 34.5 degrees.

228
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,810
Providing a warming blanket.

229
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,693
One has hypothermia. The rest are normal.

230
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,739
Rescue them after completing your mission.

231
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,782
We'll rescue them
after completing our mission.

232
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,700
Over.

233
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,619
It's okay. They said they'll rescue us.

234
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,663
It's over now.

235
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,791
You may get up now.

236
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,922
Are you the only survivors?

237
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,174
We don't know.

238
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,551
I'm sure there are more.

239
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,678
We'll go down for a few minutes.

240
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,971
Wait right here.

241
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,556
Aren't you going to rescue us?

242
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,599
We will.

243
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,559
So don't go anywhere.

244
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,561
Don't do anything. Just stay here.

245
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,104
-Understand?
-Yes.

246
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,022
Let's go.

247
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,372
Three soldiers, ready to go.
Chopper, report.

248
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,974
Viper, ready to go. Over.

249
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,309
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

250
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,560
Fuck, let's go.

251
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,354
The zombies went toward the chopper.

252
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,814
Let's get to the rooftop now.

253
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,283
Let's go.

254
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,413
What about him?

255
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,419
Tie him up.

256
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,840
-Be more gentle.
-Slowly.

257
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,883
More gentle.

258
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,634
-Is that okay?
-Yes, it's good.

259
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,012
Don't put any straps on my stomach.

260
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,513
Okay, I won't.

261
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,813
The infected are entering
from the field and front gate.

262
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:51,940
What's your status?

263
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,277
We're clear. Moving in.

264
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,538
Report on the situation.

265
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,337
Hey.

266
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,757
They plan to kill all the zombies
before they take us, right?

267
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,967
I doubt that. There are only four of them.

268
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,887
Isn't Special Mission the best?

269
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,932
Are they looking for something?

270
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,768
Isn't the science lab that way?

271
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,945
-We're in.
-Do you have the package?

272
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,571
Checking now.

273
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,916
The infected are rushing toward you.
Viper, get ready to move out.

274
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,753
Target not yet obtained.
Decrypting device.

275
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,296
We have to go. Hurry!

276
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,176
Decryption complete. Heading out.

277
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,650
Moving out!

278
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,700
Report your evacuation status
and situation inside the school.

279
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,954
The infected are passing F2
and moving quickly to the science lab.

280
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,748
Rescue the students
and return to the base.

281
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,125
Yes, sir.

282
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,671
Commander, we had an incident
in the quarantine camp.

283
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,089
What is it? What happened?

284
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,300
-Bring up monitor 34.
-Yes, sir.

285
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,556
Rewind ten minutes.

286
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,853
Where's the package?

287
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,569
Come to the pick-up position. Over.

288
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,367
-Master Sergeant. Go up first.
-Yes, sir.

289
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,372
We'll pull you up one at a time.
Stay still even if you're scared.

290
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,708
-Okay?
-Aren't you landing the chopper?

291
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,668
We can't for safety reasons.

292
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,504
He'll pull you in, so don't worry.

293
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,268
You can't go all at once,
so let's go one by one.

294
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,436
You can't take us all?

295
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,813
We're taking all of you,
but you have to go up one by one.

296
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,276
Ji-min. You go first.

297
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,278
You go first. Go.

298
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,366
Go first.

299
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,133
Grab her!

300
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,676
Calm down!

301
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,594
Stay still!

302
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,448
Stand back!

303
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,039
What the hell is that?

304
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,876
I think she's infected but asymptomatic.

305
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,010
She's infected but showed no symptoms?

306
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,041
You're saying normal people
and infected people

307
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,461
cannot be differentiated.

308
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,506
-Connect to the team at Hyosan High!
-Yes, sir.

309
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,178
Don't rescue anyone.

310
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,639
Please repeat. Do you mean everyone?

311
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,184
We just discovered
an asymptomatic infected person.

312
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,768
But their temperatures are fine.

313
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,854
The girl who was brought here
was also fine.

314
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,815
All our agents will be in danger
if one turns in the chopper.

315
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,151
Open fire if they resist.

316
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,652
But they're just students.

317
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,530
Soldiers here have died!

318
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,991
One girl attacked four soldiers!

319
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,078
Understood. Over.

320
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,584
Operation canceled!
We'll take only the package and pull out!

321
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,003
Sir!

322
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,630
I'm going back down.

323
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,381
-She's coming down.
-Hey.

324
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,591
She's coming down!

325
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,426
-Why? What's wrong?
-She's coming down!

326
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,552
Why is she coming down?

327
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,679
-What's going on?
-I don't know!

328
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,474
Why did you take that off? No.

329
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,104
-What do you mean it's canceled?
-What are you doing?

330
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,023
Please pull me back up.

331
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,526
Pull me back up! Fuck! I won't go back.

332
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,861
No!

333
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,779
Take me with you!

334
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,405
Sir. Please!

335
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,741
I want to go!

336
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,910
Take me with you!

337
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,205
-Why won't you take us with you?
-Sir!

338
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,498
Wait a second.

339
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,749
What's wrong?

340
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,042
We're not zombies.

341
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,879
What are you waiting for? Open fire.

342
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,339
Take me with you!

343
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,382
Step back.

344
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,176
Step back, or we'll shoot.

345
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,261
Stand back!

346
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,222
Get in the chopper.

347
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,390
Open fire.

348
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,645
Do you not hear me?
This is an order. Open fire!

349
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,815
Sir. Can't you just take a few of us?

350
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,067
Shoot, you bastard. Shoot them!

351
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,704
Be quiet.

352
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,753
-Quiet.
-Damn it.

353
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,173
To the rooftop, right?

354
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,092
Not that one, right?

355
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,469
We can't get up there.
I mean this building.

356
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,598
-Let's go.
-It's not that way.

357
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,602
-What? Okay. Let's go.
-Hey. Help me.

358
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,644
Shit.

359
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,440
I'm begging you.
Please take just a few of us.

360
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,415
Sir.

361
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,257
I'm sorry.

362
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,751
We have the package.

363
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,419
All agents pulling out.

364
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,462
Return to the base.

365
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,716
Hey. Why is it coming this way?

366
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,217
Did they see us?

367
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,485
Over here! Here! Look here!

368
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,487
Over here!

369
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,825
Damn it.

370
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,289
-We're fucked. Run!
-Shit.

371
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,262
They abandoned us, right?

372
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,722
Right?

373
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,184
No one will come to save us now, right?

374
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,687
Why did they do that?

375
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,647
Maybe

376
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,026
they fucking thought we were zombies.

377
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,820
Then they would've killed us.

378
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,031
They wouldn't have left

379
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,950
without killing us.

380
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,169
What are you doing?

381
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:58,963
It's useless.

382
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,759
No one's coming. No one is coming now.

383
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,872
A victim stated that you
and your aide were accomplices

384
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,793
in Kim U-sin and Nam So-ju's attack
on our soldiers during their escape.

385
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,047
He kept denying your involvement.

386
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,007
So we want to ask you some questions.

387
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,763
Are you recording this?

388
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,557
-Yes, we are.
-Wait a minute.

389
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,018
Aren't you supposed
to inform us if you're recording?

390
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,604
We will record this conversation.
Do you consent?

391
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,774
Would you please point the camera
straight at me?

392
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,157
Is it set?

393
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,075
Yes.

394
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,749
I'm Assembly Member Park Eun-hee.

395
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:22,088
I am being interrogated
because I have been accused

396
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,091
of aiding in the escape
of Nam So-ju and Kim U-sin,

397
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,926
the firefighters who saved my life.

398
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,138
I am not an accomplice.

399
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,474
I was the principal offender.

400
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,352
Ma'am! Seriously…

401
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,396
Stop recording.

402
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,856
Stay back.

403
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,193
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

404
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,369
Do as you please.

405
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,039
I won't get involved anymore.

406
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:05,131
Nam So-ju saved us,
notwithstanding the fact

407
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,716
that his daughter was nearby.

408
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,803
Although he tried to go save his daughter,

409
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,181
the Martial Law Control stopped him.

410
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,602
His daughter was everything to him.

411
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,563
I said I'd take full responsibility

412
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,734
and that he should escape using
all means necessary to save his daughter.

413
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,529
Even if it's dangerous
and we're under martial law,

414
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,533
no one can stop
a father's love for his child.

415
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,538
Regardless of the punishment
I may receive…

416
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,334
I will always stand

417
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,003
with the powerless people.

418
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,373
On-jo.

419
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,083
Dad.

420
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,975
Please help us.

421
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,689
My wife and baby--

422
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,928
I can't do it on my own.

423
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,514
We need equipment
to cut through the frame.

424
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,392
Please help us.

425
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,894
I'm sorry.

426
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,980
I need to get to my daughter.

427
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,774
I'm so sorry.

428
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,984
I'm begging you, sir.

429
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,071
Our baby…

430
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,451
Please, sir. Help us.

431
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,372
They will begin sending rescuers soon.

432
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,665
Hang on until then.

433
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,834
Those monsters will come first.

434
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,517
Here.

435
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,978
Here. Take this.

436
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,606
You have to hang on.

437
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,035
You have to help me.

438
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,247
Get back here now.

439
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,249
Move.

440
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,211
There is no more hope.

441
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,591
It's like every sin became concentrated
and entered the human body.

442
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,302
Even if we can conquer this virus,

443
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,265
a world in which humanity rules
will never return.

444
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,143
Can we believe people are beautiful

445
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,105
after seeing them
turn into the absolute worst beings?

446
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,606
If you shoot me,

447
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,692
they'll come running.

448
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,610
We'll die anyway.

449
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,114
This way or that…

450
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,784
My daughter is waiting for me.

451
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,915
Please…

452
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,795
Please don't go.

453
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,844
Don't go.

454
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,639
There was something we'd say

455
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,436
whenever we hit a wall when I worked
at the pharmaceutical company.

456
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,399
"Science begins with imagination
and ends as a mystery."

457
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,362
I went to see a shaman on my way home.

458
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,249
The shaman said
this will solve everything.

459
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,007
Please help me. Help me!

460
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,676
I'm human.

461
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,929
I'm not a zombie!

462
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,559
Crazy bastard!

463
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,611
She tests both positive and negative
depending on when we test her.

464
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,238
What does that mean?

465
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,658
We have to assume
it's a fusion or evolution.

466
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,202
Is it a mutation?

467
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,079
Yes, that's correct.

468
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,041
The virus is hiding
in the RNA of the cells.

469
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,503
It's detected only when it manifests.
It can't be when it's dormant.

470
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:41,384
That means tests can't tell us
whether or not they're infected.

471
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,010
That's right.

472
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,222
It's like the human
and the monster are fighting within.

473
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,434
Is there a possibility

474
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,104
that others from Hyosan are like her?

475
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,567
As per KDCA's recommendation,

476
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,861
it's best to presume

477
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,864
they're infected
even if they show no symptoms.

478
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,542
From this moment on,

479
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:19,213
categorize everyone from Hyosan
as being infected but asymptomatic.

480
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:24,093
Monitor those who were rescued later
separately and more closely.

481
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,972
I know.

482
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,725
You really are amazing.

483
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,854
Using us in that situation.

484
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,941
I would say she made good use of you.

485
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,278
When it rains, you use the rain.

486
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:46,073
When it's windy, you use the wind.
That's politics.

487
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,119
You'll use that video
for your campaign later, won't you?

488
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,623
Although you saved no one,
you'll get lots of votes

489
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,834
as if you did something huge.

490
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,295
She did do something huge.

491
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,841
She got you out in exchange
for her taking full responsibility.

492
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,472
She never told our captain to escape.

493
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,976
Look here, U-sin.

494
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,481
All disasters create heroes.

495
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,858
Whether or not he saves his daughter,

496
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,611
Mr. Nam So-ju will be a hero.

497
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,114
That is what we're building right now.

498
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,576
Don't you want your captain
to become a hero?

499
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,662
-That's not it. I--
-Then we're good.

500
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,040
Let's look at the big picture.

501
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,877
From this moment on, we are one team.

502
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,798
And we'll move forward together.

503
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,635
What the hell?

504
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,180
To prevent the spread of infection,
you'll be taken to a special quarantine.

505
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,183
For safety reasons,
you'll be handcuffed during transport--

506
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,309
Are we criminals?

507
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,020
Why are you suddenly imprisoning us?

508
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,315
How dare you try to put handcuffs
on the assembly member?

509
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,566
Please comply.

510
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,446
Don't test my patience.

511
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,073
It's martial law.

512
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,325
-Not a military dictatorship.
-Please comply.

513
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,203
We can't follow rules that lack principle.

514
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,416
Just kill me first
if you want to take her away.

515
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,627
-What are you doing? Make a shield.
-Yes, sir.

516
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,628
Hold on tight.

517
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,261
Get in here.

518
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,483
Attention, all citizens
in the quarantine camp.

519
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,902
In order to find those who are infected
but are asymptomatic,

520
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,239
we are separating Hyosan citizens
from those who came from elsewhere,

521
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,701
as per the KDCA's recommendation.

522
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,705
I'm fine.

523
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,251
Until a trusted testing method is found
and the situation is resolved,

524
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:07,631
stricter quarantine rules will be put
in place effective immediately.

525
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,301
We apologize for the inconvenience,
and we hope you comply.

526
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,889
You said we'd be treated like heroes.
What the hell is this?

527
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,265
Quiet, you bastard.

528
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,101
Did you find the laptop? What happened?

529
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,103
Let's move.

530
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,398
What about the laptop?

531
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,067
You should at least tell us that!

532
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,248
Are you okay?

533
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,626
My ears hurt so much.

534
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,474
Instead of earphones.

535
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,080
It's raining.

536
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,208
Hey, it's raining.

537
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,838
It's fucking raining!

538
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,340
Hey, it's raining!

539
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,038
It's so refreshing.

540
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,610
Fuck this. Seriously…

541
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,702
Joon-yeong.

542
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,122
You know how zombies follow us
if they hear us?

543
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,125
If we move every time there's thunder,
maybe they won't hear us.

544
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,265
No one is coming to rescue us.

545
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:32,521
Isn't it better to die trying to get out
than die waiting here?

546
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,691
Where can we go? And how?

547
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,902
If we take the back door
of the auditorium to the tennis courts

548
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,530
and go through the English center,

549
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,991
we can reach the mountain.

550
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,098
If we can reach the mountain,

551
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,225
we can make it to Yangdong.

552
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,437
I went hiking there
a few times with my dad.

553
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,108
Don't you think it's too crazy to try?

554
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,944
I'm not going. I'm scared.

555
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,615
What if the zombies catch us?

556
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,618
It's not like anyone will save us
if we stay here.

557
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,078
We're the only ones
who can save ourselves.

558
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,213
Let's go.

559
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,966
If anything happens,

560
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,886
I'll scream and lead the zombies away.

561
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,472
If anything, I'll die alone.

562
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,849
So let's go.

563
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,476
Don't say that.

564
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,773
We should all live.

565
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,193
If anyone has to die,

566
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:03,779
I'll die in their place.

567
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:08,659
Because of the rain,
all scents are mixed together.

568
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,496
The rain is really loud too.

569
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,668
I'm sure the zombies' senses are dulled.

570
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,754
If that's what a hambie says,
it should be reliable.

571
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,297
What's a hambie?

572
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,758
A half…

573
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,719
reliable person.

574
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,180
Should we go?

575
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,058
And Prez is strong.

576
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,643
Let's trust her and go.

577
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,854
I'm not strong right now.

578
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,771
Why not?

579
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,275
I don't know.

580
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,407
Some of us may not be able to keep up.

581
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,368
We can't have anyone fall,
so let's pair up and hold hands.

582
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,494
To protect each other.

583
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,248
Hey.

584
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,392
-Wu-jin. Let's go.
-Okay.

585
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,648
Hey.

586
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,902
Stay behind me.

587
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,115
Let's survive first.

588
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,534
We can talk about us later.

589
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,447
-Careful.
-Okay.

590
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,492
Don't let go of my hand.

591
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,045
I get it.

592
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,189
Damn it.

593
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,403
-Damn it.
-What are you doing?

594
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:50,988
My bad.

595
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,992
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

596
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,201
Move together with me.

597
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,748
Be careful.

598
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,586
Careful.

599
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,611
-What's wrong?
-Hold on.

600
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,575
Are they there?

601
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,214
Let's go.

602
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,902
Let's go.

603
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,539
Hey. They're acting strange.

604
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,249
Be quiet.

605
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,918
Come here and look.

606
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,753
They look like total morons.

607
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:30,962
Hey.

608
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,256
I'm freezing.

609
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,093
It's the rain.

610
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,886
Hey, let's go.

611
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,554
It's our best chance to escape.

612
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,307
Let's go behind that building
and go up the mountain.

613
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:32,065
I'll lure that zombie and go that way.

614
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,567
Use that time to get out.

615
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,527
No.

616
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,155
I'll lure that zombie and go…

617
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:46,121
Let's just go along the wall
and cross over there.

618
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,189
Duck down.

619
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,150
Stay low.

620
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,282
Go along the wall.

621
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,868
Go along the wall over there.

622
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,077
-Back there?
-What?

623
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,623
Hey, I'll go first.

624
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:14,834
This way.

625
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,847
Cheong-san.

626
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:45,824
Mom?

627
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,482
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

628
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,692
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.

629
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:54,781
