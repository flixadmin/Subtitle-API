1
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,360
Those are good worms right there.

2
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,240
Hey, Alex! How's the commute treating you?

3
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,610
Hey, I can't complain.

4
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,780
-That never stopped him before.
-Right?

5
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,870
Well, we made good time today.

6
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,330
Red was one of my students.

7
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,920
Not sure about the dabbing though.

8
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,300
Mom! Mom, did you get my picture?

9
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,130
Well, this is our stop.

10
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,270
<i>The birds in the sky go through the air</i>

11
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,020
<i>All the way there</i>

12
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,520
Today, we're gonna learn about how Red saved the eggs.

13
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,360
I love Red!

14
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,820
I gotta go to the bathroom!

15
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,610
Why didn't you go in the slingshot?

16
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,450
Bomb, anything from Piggy Island?

17
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,700
-No.
-Chuck. Anything to the north?

18
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,080
-Nope. Nothing.
-What's that?

19
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,170
Incoming pie!

20
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,000
-It's coming straight for us.
-What do we do?

21
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,710
Duck!

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,760
What?

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,340
-I got pie all over my face!
-Hey, sorry, buddy.

24
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,510
What, what? Yeah!

25
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,680
Those pigs...

26
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,850
Are gonna pay...

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,940
For our lunches!

28
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,820
Because of our hunger to give them...

29
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,190
A taste of their own...

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,530
Quesadillas!

31
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,280
What?

32
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,450
-It's Red.
-I'm sorry, guys.

33
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,910
We're taking over the Blue Line. Official business.

34
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,950
-Yeah!
-Anything for you, Red.

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,330
Hey, Red!

36
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,960
Isn't it funny how nobody liked you
until you saved Bird Island?

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,090
But now we all love you.

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,840
Thanks so much for bringing that up. Okay, ready?

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,510
-Three...
-Two...

40
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,720
Two!

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
-Bomb, you say "one."
-Oh, right.

42
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,850
One!

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,730
Hot sauce, please.

44
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,440
Yeah! Got him.

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,440
-Thank you very much.
<i>-Red! Red! Red!</i>

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,070
I really want the red one. The red one.

47
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,740
Balloonie!

48
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,780
That's it. A little bit higher.

49
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,170
But I was bouncing!

50
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,510
You mess with the hatchlings,

51
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,010
you get the cannonball.

52
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,720
Ready, big guy?

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,260
Oh, yeah. You ready, bigger guy?

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,190
Cannonball! Cannonball!

55
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,070
Why won't you just take a bath?

56
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,280
Why won't you just take a bath?

57
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,120
This might pinch a little.

58
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,050
I can't see!

59
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,260
Catch you later.

60
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,090
You stupid birds.

61
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,430
No! Please, don't!

62
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,600
Not on my watch.

63
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,980
Sorry, guys.

64
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,310
Excuse me, sir,

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,770
but I believe this belongs to you.

66
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,980
My hero.

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,530
Don't. Stop.

68
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,110
I said, "Don't stop."

69
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,490
-Leonard?
-Got him!

70
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,200
Hey, Leonard, you should probably--

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,750
That's not coming from Bird Island.

72
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,010
What the heck is that?

73
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,930
And where did it come from?

74
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,400
We're gonna need a bigger slingshot.

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,870
Another successful day of protecting the island.

76
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,120
-Great job, guys.
-Oh, yeah.

77
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,410
You saved us, Red.

78
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,630
-You're our hero.
-What can I say? That's what I do.

79
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,590
Now, why don't you run along

80
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,050
and keep your big, cute eyes peeled
for the next pig prank, all right?

81
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,340
Pigs.

82
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,970
-We're going to get you!
-Oink, oink, oink.

83
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,470
Adorable.

84
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,440
Let's finish cleaning up these crabs,
then we can move on to--

85
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,190
Done and done.

86
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,400
-Red, what is it?
-What the heck?

87
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,200
Is it a per--? Is it a head? What is that?

88
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,330
-It seems like it's some kind of note.
-What if it's a love note?

89
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,870
-A message in a bottle?
-Or a genie in a bottle.

90
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,000
Guys, there's no bottle, so just, you know, stop.

91
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,250
<i>Dear birds, we humbly request a truce.</i>

92
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,500
<i>Can we talk?</i>

93
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,460
<i>Love, Leonard. X-O-X-O.</i>

94
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,220
Nice try, piggies.

95
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,430
News flash: we're not idiots.

96
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,510
Hey.

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
<i>Dear birds,</i>

98
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,100
<i>you are idiots, but we are serious about the truce.</i>

99
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,940
I got it!

100
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,280
-Oh, no!
-Check it out, everybody.

101
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,660
Let me see that.

102
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,160
-A truce! A truce!
-A truce with the pigs!

103
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,370
-A truce?
-The prank war is over!

104
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,000
What?

105
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,080
No, this is just another one of their pranks.

106
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,580
What?

107
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,420
This is a huge relief, right?

108
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,380
Who else was getting tired
of the constant pranking and retaliation?

109
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,170
Me! This guy!

110
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,930
Tired? No, no, no. Guys, listen.

111
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,220
Imagine all the fun things we can do now.

112
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
I can think of one.

113
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,270
-You think he'll go?
-I think we've piqued his interest.

114
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,190
No, no, no. Guys, we are working tirelessly,
day and night, to save the world.

115
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,860
-The world doesn't need saving, Red.
-Of course they need us.

116
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,020
Red.

117
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,530
Come here, hon. What are you so afraid of?

118
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,360
Afraid of? I-- What do I have to be afraid of?

119
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,760
-I'm not afraid of anything.
-Okay, you know what?

120
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,630
I'll write you a prescription for one night of fun
with your cool friends.

121
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,010
-Especially Chuck.
-Come on.

122
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,050
Come with us.

123
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,390
-What are you talking--? Come with you to what?
-We can't tell you because you wouldn't be into it.

124
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,410
-Oink, oink, oink!
-Oink, oink, oink!

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,880
Now we have all your eggs.

126
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Yeah, and there's nothing you can do about it, Red.

127
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,710
-Oink, oink, oink.
-Oink, oink, oink.

128
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,800
Laugh it up, piggies,
because you're gonna be crying in a second

129
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,220
-when I kick your butts and take those rocks back.
-Eggs.

130
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,390
-What?
-You said "rocks" instead of "eggs" again.

131
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,350
Oh, sorry.

132
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,650
I don't know why I keep doing that.

133
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,940
Because they are rocks.

134
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,610
Don't cry, Sam-Sam.

135
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,950
I'll be right back.

136
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,450
Hey, Daddy.

137
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,920
Just borrowing my sisters for a minute.

138
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,930
Now we really have all your eggs.

139
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,890
Yeah, and there's nothing you can do about it, Red.

140
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,560
-Oink, oink, oink.
-Oink, oink, oink.

141
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,310
Laugh it up, piggies,

142
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,020
because you're gonna be crying in a second
when I kick your butts and take all your...

143
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,700
Oh, crap.

144
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,130
Okay, we'll just--

145
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,840
What is this thing that almost killed me? Frozen water?

146
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,430
Who's ever heard of frozen water?

147
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,050
Courtney? Courtney, bring me those images.

148
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,350
What, what, what? Oh, okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

149
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,480
Give me that.

150
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
Oh, that looks cold.

151
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,900
Three umbrellas in one drink?

152
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,360
What kind of extravagant lunatic are we dealing with?

153
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,090
There goes my toothpaste.

154
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,460
I am tired of this.

155
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,880
Yes! Hot shower.

156
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,930
There we go.

157
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,690
<i>Go, Zeta. You killing it.</i>

158
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,650
<i>Go, Zeta. You killing it.</i>

159
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,070
Zeta!

160
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,120
Come on, baby. Go get it.

161
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,330
Let's go get it.

162
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,660
Go get the stick.

163
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,340
Oh, my gosh!

164
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,810
I can't do this anymore.

165
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,230
-Okay, Debbie?
-Okay.

166
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,230
I'm done. I'm done living on this frozen,
seal-infested iceberg of an island.

167
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,440
Fire another ice ball!

168
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,360
-We can't do that, Zeta.
-Wait--

169
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,900
You're torturing the engineer.

170
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,660
Hello?!

171
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,870
My limbs are beginning to numb.

172
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,160
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
You better tell him to improve his aim.

173
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,090
-It's about time we start living that good life.
-Good life, here we come.

174
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,170
I deserve to feel the hot sand squishing
between my beautiful talons.

175
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,340
You deserve that and more.

176
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,340
Yes, I do!

177
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,890
Well, here we are.

178
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,230
Are you ready, Red? Love awaits!

179
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,690
Speed dating? No. No way.

180
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,860
It's mating season.

181
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,360
All right, lovebirds. You all know how this works.

182
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,450
When you hear this sound,

183
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,990
then it's time to move on to the next table,

184
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,790
where your soul mate just might be waiting.

185
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,370
-Yeah, I'm going home.
-Absolutely not. You have nothing else to do.

186
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,380
Also, I hid your keys on some part of my body
and I'm not telling you where unless you stay.

187
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,210
Yeah, let's party!

188
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,630
-Hey, yo! Chuck's the name. Speed's the game. Like games?
-Well...

189
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,140
You just entered the love lottery, and guess what. You won!
Because here I am.

190
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,060
-Hi.
-Hi.

191
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,230
I eat dirt.

192
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,610
Hey, y'all!

193
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,690
Who's ready to party?

194
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,320
Not me.

195
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,830
No, I'm actually not here
for the whole speed-dating horror-show thing going on.

196
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,200
This mating dance is for you.

197
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,590
I'd love to hear a little bit about you.
What's your favourite sign?

198
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,680
This one's mine.

199
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,010
The flavour can vary greatly,
depending on the minerals in the dirt.

200
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,100
I can tell which kind of worms have crawled through there.

201
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,100
Or what sort of roly-polies used it to raise their family in.

202
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,690
Are you mad?

203
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,110
No.

204
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,650
-I don't know. You look mad.
-Well, I'm not.

205
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,700
Yeah, you know what? Maybe it's your eyebrows.

206
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,950
My eyebrows are fine. That's just the way I look.

207
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,990
It's like you've got resting bird face.

208
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,290
Oh, yeah? Well, you know, that's not a thing.

209
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,210
-Yes! Amazing.
-With utensils. I'm not a total animal.

210
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,250
But I do enjoy eating dirt.

211
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,500
-Okay, worms, birdseed or just garbage from a dumpster?
-I'm sorry, what?

212
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,760
Favourite food, silly. Don't think.
Just answer from your gut. Go!

213
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,510
Toast?

214
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,550
Okay. Toast.

215
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,140
Favourite colour?

216
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,100
Stupid question. Red, duh.

217
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,020
If you could have one superpower, what would it be?

218
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,390
To disappear, like, right now.

219
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,480
Okay. What do you do in your free time?

220
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,400
Yeah, I mean, I don't really have any free time.

221
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,570
I protect Bird Island from being attacked,
and that's a full-time gig, so yeah.

222
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,570
I thought I heard something about a truce.

223
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,450
No. A truce, no. That's not gonna last.

224
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,250
You'll have a lot more free time
now that nobody needs you anymore, so...

225
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,170
Okay. We are done here.

226
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,170
Are you afraid to talk about your feelings?

227
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,050
Hey, you know, just because I don't want
to talk about them doesn't mean I'm afraid.

228
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,840
-Okay. So avoids personal questions. Unusually angry.
-Talks to herself.

229
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,220
-Self-esteem issues.
-Doesn't answer her own questions.

230
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,720
-Left-handed. Probably a witch.
-Looks like we're definitely incompatible.

231
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,140
Oh, and you needed a form to tell you that. Okay.

232
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,480
-I hope you have better luck annoying the next guy.
-I don't need luck. I have a formula.

233
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,020
Okay. Have a nice life.

234
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,400
-Have fun being alone.
-Oh, I will.

235
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,490
There he goes, like a ship in the night.

236
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,780
No rudder, no purpose, no crew.

237
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,580
Well, have a good night.

238
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,620
Loser!

239
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,080
Loser!

240
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,480
Hello!

241
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,690
Look, Red, I know we've had our differences.

242
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,900
Oh, like when you tried to eat our young?

243
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,070
I come in peace.

244
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,360
Ouch.

245
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,450
Look, I don't want to see your face
any more than you want to see mine.

246
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,080
We're all in danger!

247
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,410
-Yeah. From you.
-Ouch!

248
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,540
No, we have a truce.

249
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,040
Didn't you get my note? It was on a balloon.

250
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,380
Oh, yeah, that's right.

251
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,800
You wanted to talk.

252
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,840
This is not how a truce works.

253
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,800
Just say what you gotta say and then get out.

254
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,810
Red, we've discovered that there's a third island,

255
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,230
-and they're plotting to destroy us all.
-A third island?

256
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,780
Give me one good reason why I should believe you.

257
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,150
Haven't you noticed any strange objects falling from the sky?

258
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,860
Giant balls of ice?

259
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,860
<i>But you'll look sweet</i>

260
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,660
<i>Upon the seat</i>

261
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,910
<i>Of my...</i>

262
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,540
<i>Bicycle built for two</i>

263
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,210
Nope, nothing. Haven't seen anything.

264
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,960
Well, I have, and I'll show you the proof.

265
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,460
Squeal Team Six!

266
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,180
What the...?

267
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,430
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy. Stop.

268
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,810
Everybody stop.

269
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,740
That image in your hand is Eagle Island,

270
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,330
and those are eagles.

271
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,950
Eagles? How did you get these?

272
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,750
From a drone.

273
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,040
-And do you spy on us with that?
-Yes.

274
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,880
So have you seen me...?

275
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,340
Yes, and it's disgusting.

276
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,300
Red, this is bigger than pranks.

277
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,010
We need to put aside our differences and work together.

278
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,390
To save our whole world from being destroyed.

279
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,520
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

280
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,270
What we really need is a hero.

281
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,270
I'm in.

282
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,780
Wonderful!

283
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,200
We'll have to get a team together.

284
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,780
Yes, we will.

285
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,580
But, hey, I'm in charge.

286
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,290
Actually, that position's been filled.

287
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,460
Yeah. By me.

288
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,090
Oh, man, you're gonna love this guy.

289
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,630
Not the smartest bird in the tree,

290
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,260
but what he lacks in smarts, he makes up for in firepower.

291
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,810
Happy birthday!

292
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,850
<i>We've got a number two at the Porta Potty.</i>

293
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,020
All right, I'm going!

294
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,700
We're busting you out.

295
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,820
How?

296
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,580
Like that.

297
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,040
Oh, I love it.

298
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,170
Bomb, what was that noise?

299
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,630
-You're still grounded!
-I'm an adult, Mom!

300
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,090
-Run.
-Bomb, get back here!

301
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,970
This guy is so fast, he can beat time itself in a footrace.

302
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,390
Hey, Chuck, we're putting together a team.

303
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,600
And I think we're on it!

304
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,400
Come on, everybody. Let's work those booties!

305
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,080
I'm in.

306
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,870
-Great!
-But how did you...?

307
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,000
BT-dubs, you misspelled "heist."
It's "EI," not "IE." I corrected it.

308
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,300
-Don't worry. It's a common misperception.
-Well, thank you.

309
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,380
You're right. He's fast.

310
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,810
<i>Now, this guy is kind of a ding-dong,
but he's the only eagle we know.</i>

311
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,140
Well, you've come to the right eagle.

312
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,900
-Tell me more.
-It's a really exciting mission to a place called Eagle--

313
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,230
-Eagle Island?!
-Yes.

314
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,770
So you've heard...

315
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,650
Heard of it.

316
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,660
Nice to meet you!

317
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,450
Okay, so now we just need to figure out
how this volcanic superweapon works, huh?

318
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,420
We're gonna need some kind of engineering wizard, brainiac.

319
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,680
Yes, Chuck. You obviously have something
you want to say or sing.

320
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,550
I have got just the guy. It's a girl.

321
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,140
My sister Silver.

322
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,270
She goes to Avian Academy, top of her class.

323
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,140
-She would be perfect.
-Yeah, she totally would.

324
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,900
-See you guys back at the dorm!
-Yeah, see you, Ella.

325
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,320
Hey, good catch!

326
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,530
I mean, we all just thought she was weird, you know?

327
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,620
But she skipped four grades,
won a Junior Engineer of the Year Award,

328
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,790
-and then got a scholarship at Avian Academy.
-Perfect. That is exactly what we're looking for.

329
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,960
You are absolutely gonna love her.
But don't love her too much.

330
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,330
That's my sister, Red.

331
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,340
Or I'll crush every bone in your body!

332
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,800
Frisbee!

333
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,630
Hi, I'm Chuck. Know where the engineering department is?

334
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,970
With a combination of over 30 silk, wire
and cotton-based threads spun together,

335
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,980
I now present to you...

336
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,730
Super String!

337
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,650
I said, "It's Super String!"

338
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,980
More like "Stupid String."

339
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,860
I know what you're thinking, Mike.
You're like, "What's so super about it?"

340
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,320
Great question, Mike.

341
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,450
Well, how about that it's very easily able
to withstand the pull of 18,000 more kilos

342
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,450
than any other string known to--

343
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,880
-Snooze alert.
-Known to bird-kind!

344
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,840
Or pig-kind, for that matter.

345
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,800
What's up, sis?

346
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,970
Chuck?

347
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,800
-I'm so happy to-- It's really--
-I'm so happy to-- It's really--

348
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,100
-great to-- Jinx, jinx.
-great to-- Jinx, jinx.

349
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,930
-Jinx!
-Jinx. One, two, three. I win!

350
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,640
-You can't speak until someone says your name.
-Hello? You in here?

351
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,520
Hello?

352
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,820
-You?
-You?

353
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,530
You.

354
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,610
Wait. You know this guy?

355
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,910
I would answer, but you jinxed me.

356
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,700
Oh, okay, Chuck, I unjinx you.

357
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,580
This is one of my best buddies, Red. These are the guys.

358
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,790
-Hi.
-We're the guys.

359
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,120
Guys, this is Silver, the greatest kid sister in the world.

360
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,420
I'm not exactly a kid anymore, Chuck.

361
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,340
-Oh, you'll always be my kid sister!
-Okay. Hey, everyone.

362
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,090
You know, I don't think this is gonna work.

363
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,470
It's just that I'm not sure
you're gonna be compatible with the team.

364
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,640
Oh, wow, it is such a pleasure to meet not you, but you!

365
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,980
I've never met a pig before.
Your technological achievements are amazing.

366
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,650
-May I shake your hoof?
-Why, thank you.

367
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,150
I like her.

368
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,030
And this has to be Bomb.

369
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,740
-How'd you know that?
-Because you have a fuse coming out of your head.

370
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,450
Oh, so cool!

371
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,870
Backflip.

372
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,420
So I hear you're some kind of engineering wizard
or whatever.

373
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,790
I don't like to brag, but...

374
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,550
Wait. Who's that?
And why is she all over these achievement awards?

375
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,010
-The kid's amazing, right?
-Not a kid anymore, Chuck.

376
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,140
-Tickle Train arriving at Sister Station!
-Chuck, no.

377
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,480
I am a serious academic.

378
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,980
I am a serious...

379
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,150
Stop!

380
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,690
Look how cute this is.

381
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,450
<i>We're sailing in the ocean, we must</i>

382
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,370
<i>Row! Row!</i>

383
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,660
<i>The eggs are in our sights and we must</i>

384
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,450
<i>Go! Go!</i>

385
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,460
<i>We'll get them back before our parents</i>

386
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,080
<i>Know! Know!</i>

387
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,290
<i>And save the day like Red, the real</i>

388
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,300
<i>Hero! Row!</i>

389
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,880
-Gotcha!
-Gotcha!

390
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,880
We did it.

391
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,390
That was so easy!

392
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,850
Yeah!

393
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,640
A little too easy, actually.

394
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,270
What do you mean by that?

395
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,150
Well, normally, when things are this easy,

396
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,650
some dramatically unexpected setback occurs.

397
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,610
-I don't get it.
-Me neither.

398
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,910
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

399
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,660
But it's sort of like, you know how some...?

400
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,790
Oh, see? Like that.

401
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,790
Are you freaking kidding me?

402
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,260
Each of you has been selected
because you're the best in your field.

403
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,930
That we could find.

404
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,020
Your skills will be put to the test

405
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,270
facing this.

406
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,730
-As you can clearly see, this is a vol--
-Volcano.

407
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,190
"A volcano" is what my assistant was going to say.

408
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,360
-Assistant? You're the assistant!
-Let go. Let go.

409
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,030
-No, I'm the leader.
-I'll take that.

410
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,820
Actually, it's a composite volcano.

411
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,700
You can tell by the height
and the clearly apparent vent clusters.

412
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay, forget I said "volcano."

413
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,960
This is a-- It's a superweapon!

414
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,210
Weird because it looks just like a volcano.

415
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,050
Yep, and here's the scary part.

416
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,800
This is their psychotic leader!

417
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,430
How'd that get in there? Next.

418
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,100
-Oh, butt shot.
-Next.

419
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,470
-No, no. Next. Next!
-I don't even know what I'm looking at.

420
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,480
-Courtney!
-I mean, you took them.

421
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,230
This is their psychotic leader.

422
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,870
Hey. Buddy, do you know her?

423
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,870
What? Me? No.

424
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,000
No, definitely not, absolutely not.
Never seen her before in my life.

425
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,170
Who is that? I don't know!

426
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,380
-Not terribly convincing, but moving on.
-Great.

427
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,630
What's the plan?

428
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,050
All right, here's what we're looking at, folks.

429
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,550
Step one: Travel undetected to Eagle Island.

430
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,810
Step two:

431
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,350
We're gonna break into the superweapon.

432
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,900
-Got it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,270
And step three:

434
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,520
Deactivate the superweapon.

435
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,570
-Once we break in there.
-No plan...

436
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:02,450
Hopefully, before both our islands are destroyed
and we all die, so that's-- That's it.

437
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,750
-Right. I just have a few questions.
-Why? I explained everything.

438
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,790
-It's a foolproof plan.
-Yeah. How do we sneak onto the island?

439
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,130
What is the superweapon and how do we deactivate it?

440
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,840
And when you say "escape," how do you plan to do that?
I feel like this is a crucial thing to figure out.

441
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,800
I agree. Why isn't she in charge?

442
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,220
Told you she's super smart.

443
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,010
Hey, guys, hold on a second, please.

444
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,510
-Mighty Eagle?
-What? What? What are you looking at?

445
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Do you have an Eagle Island map?

446
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,690
What? No. No, there's no map.

447
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,770
-Oh, it's a map.
-Yeah, that's a map.

448
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,570
-Okay, I just wanna read it.
-Come on!

449
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,480
Wait a minute. Do you guys hear that?

450
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,700
-Do we hear what?
-Sounds like a whistle.

451
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,110
It almost sounds like a:

452
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,370
Hey, guys?

453
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,120
Run!

454
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,210
Emergency exit, all the way down!

455
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,550
Well, that's not safe.

456
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,510
Wait! Stop!

457
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,050
-Holy macaroni!
-Oh, boy.

458
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,220
Everyone hop on!

459
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,110
Rewind it. Rewind it. Play it again.

460
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,530
Play it again. Play it again.

461
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,040
-Yes, baby! We knocked the top right off of that!
-Blow them up!

462
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,910
Glenn, you didn't mess it up this time.

463
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,870
-Boom! Up top. Or not.
-Nailed it!

464
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,040
Jerry, up top.

465
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,880
-That should send him running.
-Wait. "Him"?

466
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,500
Who you sending running?

467
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,050
Yeah. Who's "him"?

468
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:44,590
"Them." I said "them." Stop asking me stupid questions.

469
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,100
I'm so sorry.

470
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,600
-That was crazy.
-We could have died.

471
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,230
-Thanks for saving our lives, Mighty Eagle!
-Well, you can always count on--

472
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,950
Everyone grab the map!

473
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,500
Hey, it's working.

474
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,580
Left! Left! Lean to the left!

475
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,050
Please tell me that was your pants ripping.

476
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,720
I don't wear pants!

477
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,550
None of us wear pants!

478
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,190
Eight point one seconds.

479
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,610
Silver! No!

480
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,100
Hey! What is this?

481
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,480
Oh, well, I mean, she was, you know,
just thanking me for saving everyone, so...

482
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,770
I'm sorry. Saving everyone?

483
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,190
-Yeah. I mean, you know, the map was my idea.
-It ripped.

484
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,780
-Maybe because there's one too many birds on the team.
-I...

485
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,490
My mountain!

486
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,660
We are in trouble.

487
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,830
-We gotta stop that superweapon.
-We gotta stop that superweapon. Jinx!

488
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,800
Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.

489
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,960
Eagle Mountain?

490
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,010
Are we gonna be okay?

491
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,550
Oh, my gah...

492
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,220
What happened to Eagle Mountain, Mom?

493
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,810
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Why isn't anybody leaving? Why they not scared?

494
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,320
Okay. Oh, okay, okay.

495
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,650
Here's what we gonna do.

496
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,610
I want y'all to take all of those ice balls

497
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,320
and fill them up with...

498
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,280
molten lava.

499
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,040
That's not possible.

500
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,370
What? You never heard of thermal emulsifiers?

501
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,210
Well, yes, yes.

502
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,550
You just got to get a polyacrylamide
to enhance the nanoparticle

503
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,170
and surfactant association between the two materials.

504
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,680
Okay.

505
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,220
So you do that, and I'm gonna go feed my baby.

506
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:38,430
Yes, I'm finally gonna feed my baby.
There you go. Who's my baby?

507
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,770
You're my baby.

508
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,770
What--? Don't...

509
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,740
You better not wink at me. Don't you wink at me.

510
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,870
Who could have done this?

511
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,700
-Gosh, I can't believe it's gone.
-Red, are we gonna be okay?

512
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,580
-What are we gonna do?
-All right, guys, do not worry.

513
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,080
We got this.

514
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,630
Red here has got your back.

515
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,340
And your front and your sides.

516
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,630
And my floof?

517
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,260
-Yeah, even your cute little floof.
-Looks like you're gonna be okay.

518
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,220
So are you 100 percent sure we shouldn't evacuate?

519
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,680
No, Red's gonna take care of us. Right, Red?

520
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,310
Yes! Everybody, please, just stay calm.

521
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,560
-Great news! Thank you!
-Hey, y'all, we're gonna be okay. Red's here.

522
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,820
-We love you, Red!
-We need you, Red!

523
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,860
Oh, thank you.

524
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,780
Your support means the world to me.

525
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,150
Okay, Leonard, so where's our ride?

526
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,160
It's so cute.

527
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,870
Okay. And how are we all supposed to fit in--?

528
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,370
Oh, I think we'll manage.

529
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,420
Whoa, okay.

530
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,560
Oh, my gah...

531
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,150
All aboard!

532
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,190
Anyone want to grab their own bag or anything?

533
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,120
Don't screw this up, Red!

534
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,990
If we die, it's kind of your fault.

535
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,460
I got this.

536
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

537
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,190
I'd like to introduce you to our master of gadgetry:

538
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,690
-Garry!
-Garry!

539
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,610
This is it?

540
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,110
This is the amazing team
I've been working around the clock for?

541
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,860
Working with what we got.

542
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,990
Well, that's disappointing.

543
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,490
Okay.

544
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:47,460
This is the part where you get up and follow me!

545
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,420
Welcome to my piggy gadget lab.

546
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,920
Oh, yeah.

547
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:59,760
Everywhere you look, you'll see inventions being tested
by my team of guinea pigs.

548
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,260
-This is so cool.
-I know. Right?

549
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,640
All of the gadgets have been designed specifically
with your current mission in mind.

550
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,400
The first being Invisa-Spray.

551
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,440
Need to go undetected in plain sight?

552
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,900
Invisa-Spray does exactly that.

553
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,740
Wow, I'm invisible!

554
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,360
"Whoa," indeed.

555
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,330
-That's amazing.
-How long does the invisibility last for?

556
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,450
Forever.

557
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,040
Wait. What?

558
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,170
Tina, we're not gonna be able to see each other tonight.

559
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,250
And what does the next gadget do? Bury us alive?

560
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,010
What? That would be ridiculous.

561
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,470
Ix-nay the shovel-ay.

562
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,050
And moving right along.

563
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
What? What are you guys doing?

564
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,260
This is so fun!

565
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,640
Oh, it's so squishy.

566
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,180
What is this stuff?

567
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,480
Well, that is a special type of flame retardant
we call pig snot.

568
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,820
Why do you call it...? You know what? Never mind.

569
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,740
Yeah! Lick it.

570
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:11,830
Now, everyone, prepare yourselves
because this next one is really something special.

571
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,500
So shiny.

572
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,920
Yes, my friend. Bold yet sleek. Simple while complex.

573
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:24,800
This device can detect an eagle anywhere
within a 100-foot radius.

574
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,270
-Well, how does it work?
-Simply push this button,

575
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,230
and it does the rest.

576
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,230
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

577
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,860
<i>There's an eagle nearby. There's an eagle nearby.</i>

578
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,740
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

579
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,030
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.
</i>-Why, yes. Clearly, there is.

580
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,500
-Okay, you got me, guys.
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.</i>

581
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,500
-This clever little thing will...
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.</i>

582
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,790
-no doubt prove to be a...
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.</i>

583
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,380
-crucial tool during your mission.
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.</i>

584
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,720
-Wonderful. That's amazing!
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.</i>

585
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,720
-Can you turn it off now?
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.</i>

586
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,010
-Actually, it'll turn itself off.
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.</i>

587
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,260
Oh, thank goodness.

588
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,560
One hour after it doesn't detect any more eagles.

589
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,230
-What?!
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.</i>

590
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,940
<i>-There's an eagle nearby.
</i>-Hey! Hey!

591
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,110
<i>There's an eagle near--</i>

592
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,610
-There.
-Oh, thank you.

593
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,280
Okay, guys, these gadgets are terri--

594
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,160
Hey, hey, Red, can we chat for a sec?

595
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,990
I can tell you're used to running the show.
That's great and all.

596
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,830
But maybe since we're all a team here,
a team you put together,

597
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,120
maybe you can try to be more supportive.

598
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,170
The results might surprise you, huh?

599
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,130
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

600
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,930
Garry. Unbelievable. Really, really good stuff.

601
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,640
You know what? I'm sure I can figure out a plan to...

602
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,720
You know, to use all this--
This awesomeness that you've-- Bomb!

603
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,810
Hi, Red.

604
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,950
How are we ever gonna get up there?

605
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,950
I want my unborn sisters back.

606
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,580
It's just, the eggs are up there, and we're down here.

607
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,920
Oh, how are we ever gonna get up there?

608
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,640
You're doing great, Zoe.

609
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,770
Now hold it tight, okay?

610
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,320
Quick, let some air out!

611
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,830
It won't untie!

612
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,210
Okay, let me try.

613
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,210
What's--? What's the prob--?

614
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,260
Problem?!

615
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,000
Don't worry, guys. I'll get us out of this.

616
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,970
The eggs!

617
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,680
We got you for reals now.

618
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,560
See? I told you I would get us out of this.

619
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,570
A boa constructor.

620
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,580
It is glorious! I'm a genius!

621
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,840
Yes, I love it! This was my idea.

622
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,630
-Wait. Wait.
-Look out!

623
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,630
-I'm burning!
-I told you to look out.

624
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,590
Glenn, I wanted lava balls, not lava puddles.

625
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,430
Glenn's messing up.

626
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:41,020
I mean, we-- We're very close.
We just need two more weeks.

627
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,230
Two weeks? Two weeks.

628
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,520
It's quite the undertaking.

629
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,990
Okay, okay, you know what? I'm doing that thing again.

630
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:55,120
That thing, you know, like, where I'm not quite sure
I heard what I think I heard.

631
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,040
Hey, skinny, sassy face!
Did you hear "two weeks," or did you hear "tomorrow"?

632
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,080
I heard "tomorrow"?

633
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,750
Fat dude, what did you hear?

634
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,380
Definitely what you said?

635
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,130
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?

636
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,920
I am gonna call my old engineer, Steve.

637
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,800
And you know what? You're a lot like him.

638
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,930
<i>Hey, it's Steve!</i>

639
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,600
<i>Sorry I can't come to the phone right now,
but you know what to do.</i>

640
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,810
Oh, yeah. I had to discipline Steve.

641
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,440
-So, what was that that you had said to me?
-Tomorrow.

642
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,110
That's what I thought you said. See, everybody happy now.

643
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,290
No. No, no, no.

644
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,920
Careful, buddy. That's not--

645
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,640
Okay, guys, let's do this.

646
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,390
-Here we go.
-We got an island to save, kids.

647
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,600
Two islands. We have two islands to save.

648
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,930
I can't do this.

649
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,810
-I've made a terrible mistake.
-What are you talking about?

650
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,150
Zeta.

651
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,610
-Who is Zeta?
-The leader of the eagles.

652
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,320
The one who's been trying to destroy our islands.

653
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,490
And my ex-fiancée.

654
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,740
-Wait. What?!
-Did you say "fiancée"?

655
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,290
-Beyoncé?
-And you're just telling us this now?

656
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,370
Better late than never.

657
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,380
<i>It was many years ago,</i>

658
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,170
<i>in the 1990s.</i>

659
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,130
<i>She was the smartest girl in school.</i>

660
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,130
<i>And I had an incredible sense of fashion.</i>

661
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,890
Hey.

662
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,260
<i>It was love at first sight.</i>

663
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,020
"I miss you"?

664
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,990
<i>She was the best thing that ever happened to me.</i>

665
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:54,130
<i>But since I wasn't quite ready to mate for life...</i>

666
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,300
An engagement ring?

667
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,300
<i>Naturally, I...</i>

668
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,140
<i>I...</i>

669
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,600
<i>I abandoned her.</i>

670
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,230
How could you leave her like that?

671
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,440
Because I am a coward.

672
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,030
-Many of you didn't know that about me.
-Well, actually...

673
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,070
I assume she's been heartbroken ever since.

674
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,660
It's all my fault.

675
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,080
So this is Beyoncé we're talking about?

676
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,540
You know what? I just remembered.
I have something to do back home!

677
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,870
Thanks for the help.

678
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,070
Well, that got dark.

679
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,660
Okay, gang, listen up.

680
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,120
This place is crawling with security,
but if you guys follow me...

681
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,210
-Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
-What do you think, guys? Should we show him?

682
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,340
Show me what?

683
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,050
Harvey!

684
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,760
Super lifelike disguise, right?

685
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,970
Disguise?

686
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,720
-We thought we'd let you drive.
-And I'm gonna help you pedal.

687
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,900
Wait. You guys came up with this idea without me?

688
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,310
Yeah.

689
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,040
Yeah, well, it's not gonna work.

690
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,290
We think it's our best chance of getting past
the guards to the superweapon.

691
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,460
-I'm with Silver.
-Me too.

692
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,710
-Yeah, she's smart.
-Everyone is counting on me to make sure that--

693
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,170
Us. Everyone's counting on us, Red.

694
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,970
Fine. Whatever. So your plan is to get
into the superweapon with that?

695
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,470
Harvey, don't take offence. He does not mean it.

696
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,850
Fine. Fine. You know what?

697
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,600
I'll just be up here saving the world.

698
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,020
-Just like I should have been doing this whole time.
-Guys?

699
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:21,150
I 100 percent believe in you and this Harvey idea,

700
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,950
but I think this one's gonna need me.

701
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,370
Well, they didn't see us.

702
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,670
This isn't an "us" thing, Silver.

703
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,880
I've got this covered. Go away.

704
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:46,470
-Is this a good time to talk about your feelings?
-No, it's not a good time!

705
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,270
No. No, I don't need your help, okay?

706
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,480
I meant to slip. Leave me alone!

707
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,110
Your hat fell off.

708
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,780
Yeah, I got rid of it because it was getting heavy.

709
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,710
All right, guys, beak action is a go.

710
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,380
-Arms, what say you?
-Armed and ready.

711
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,340
Two fully functional armies.

712
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,630
Right above our leggies.

713
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,930
Okay, leggies, show me what you got.

714
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,100
Oh, yeah.

715
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:39,440
We got this!

716
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,610
We must look amazing!

717
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,990
Okay, guys, we're going live.

718
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,280
Come on, Jerry.

719
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,700
You know there's no snacking while we're on duty.

720
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,870
But I had a really small breakfast.

721
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,250
All right, I'll do the talking.

722
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,460
Hello, fellow eagle guards.

723
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,420
Oh, no. He's doing a voice.

724
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,090
I'm running late to the old job.

725
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,090
Commute was rough today for some reason.

726
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,470
But the good news is I made it!

727
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,850
Ninety-degree turn. Quick!

728
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,140
But the good news is I made it.

729
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,060
ID, please.

730
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,730
ID?

731
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,610
Not sure I have it on me.

732
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,530
-Act like you're checking your pockets.
-It's stuck!

733
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:30,910
Stuck?

734
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,700
-What the heck are you doing?!
<i>-Guards, be on the alert for a possible intruder.</i>

735
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,040
Wait a minute.

736
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,450
-What's happening? Leonard?
-He's on to us.

737
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,880
We are so dead.

738
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,590
All right. I know what's going on here.
I'm picking up what you're putting down.

739
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,840
-Jerry, are you getting a load of this?
-Yeah, I think I am.

740
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,810
Yeah, Jerry, I know exactly what's going on.

741
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,890
This right here...

742
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,900
is obviously...

743
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,730
a new guy!

744
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:07,320
Yeah, impostors in a costume. Wait. What?

745
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,530
Yeah! You're the new guard for the east tower.

746
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,990
Yes.

747
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,450
Yes, I am.

748
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:21,540
I knew it.

749
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,460
-Jerry, swipe the new guy in.
-Okay.

750
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,800
Thank you so much.

751
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,340
Okay, guys, we're in.

752
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,680
Oh, yeah.

753
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,640
-We did it.
-Work it. Work it.

754
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,680
-Okay, okay.
-Wiggle the butt.

755
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,470
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

756
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,280
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go!

757
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,330
Get to the top of the superweapon. Check!

758
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:08,960
You did it.

759
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,390
-Okay, so how's it looking down there?
-Do you see that?

760
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,350
Oh, it's the superweapon.

761
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:22,480
No, the power supply to the superweapon.

762
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:26,650
All we gotta do is get down there and cut it.

763
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:31,820
Okay, assuming we don't get electrocuted,
there are guards there, there and there.

764
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,860
And we don't have enough rope to--

765
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,780
-Watch and learn.
-What? What are you doing?

766
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,030
He's not clipped in.

767
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,170
Red, are you crazy?

768
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,800
Trust me. I know what I'm do--

769
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:04,640
-So yeah. Rope wasn't long enough.
-I know that.

770
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,810
It wasn't supposed to be. That's part of my plan.

771
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,940
Except I wanted to be over on that side.

772
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,980
-Okay, but...
-Watch this!

773
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,910
Nope. No, no, no.

774
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,120
Hello.

775
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,370
Hi. Now my plan really starts.

776
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:36,880
Hi again.

777
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:39,550
I swung back over to tell you something,
but I forgot what it was. Okay, bye.

778
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,930
Got it. Got it. Okay, there we go.
There we go. Grip, grip, grip. Okay...

779
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,940
You hear something?

780
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,440
-So you want a push?
-Yes.

781
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:00,990
-Hi.
-Oh, no. Your feather!

782
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,660
The guards!

783
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:05,330
Watch out.

784
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,210
Silver, what are you doing?

785
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,180
Oh, no.

786
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,600
Where's Red?

787
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,230
Hey, Silver.

788
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:29,310
Check it out.

789
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,270
This is how a hero saves the world.

790
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,320
Oh, come on! Nothing works around here!

791
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,070
Now we escape.

792
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,290
You two are coming with me.

793
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,710
-I...
-Nice abs.

794
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:53,840
I know.

795
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,010
Okay, try zero-zero-zero-zero.

796
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,220
Okay, now try one-two-three-four.

797
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,350
Now try four-three-two-one.

798
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:06,970
Try 1-800-OPEN.

799
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,560
I don't know. Chuck, what's your birthday?

800
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,060
Nothing's working!

801
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,860
Oh, no. Someone's coming.

802
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,940
Quick. Hide.

803
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:18,570
Ouch.

804
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,650
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

805
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,030
<i>There's an eagle nearby. There's an eagle near--</i>

806
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,040
You get started on the lockdown sequence.

807
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,170
-I'm gonna hit the john.
-Yes, sir.

808
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,170
We gotta get that key card.

809
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,770
Okay, Courtney, get that card.

810
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,820
There's something in the way.

811
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:04,740
Chuck, what's going on down there?

812
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,040
There's a divider in the way.

813
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,870
Maybe it's on the other side.

814
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,630
Okay, hold on.

815
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,440
Pretend to pee-pee.

816
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,870
Oh, no. He's leaving.

817
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,290
Chuck, get that card.

818
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,340
I got it.

819
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,950
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

820
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,710
We're home!

821
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,460
We're home, everybody.

822
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:58,190
Oh, we missed you so much, Bird Island.

823
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,650
"Bird Island"?

824
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,650
This is Piggy Island, sillies.

825
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,570
Bird Island is way over there.

826
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,750
We're in!

827
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,920
Oh, my goodness gravy.

828
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,510
I want to see.

829
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,340
-No. Chuck, hold on!
-I just want to see.

830
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,300
-We don't have time for this.
-You're stepping on my face. Move over.

831
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,870
What? What's happening?

832
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,450
I think he's challenging us to a break-dance battle?

833
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,090
Oh, it's on!

834
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,760
-What's happening?
-Looks like a little popping and locking.

835
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,850
A little what?

836
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,890
Pop, pop, pop!

837
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,820
Hey, handsome.

838
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,320
-Hey.
-Take those two and put them on ice.

839
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:36,030
-They've got Red and my sister. We've gotta go.
-But the superweapon.

840
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,910
That's my sister, mister.

841
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,910
-And I'm gonna save her.
-Chuck, slow down.

842
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,460
Slow down. Stop!

843
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:03,600
Oh, yeah!

844
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,200
Hey.

845
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,950
Hey. You done?

846
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,450
-What happened?
-Oh, let's see.

847
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,580
You got us captured and trapped in ice
on top of giant pool toys.

848
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,670
Good job.

849
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,090
I just thought that maybe if I could...

850
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:31,010
Stop me?

851
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,930
Yeah, you two lovebirds just thought
y'all could sail over here and stop me.

852
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,470
-Lovebirds? No way.
-No, no, no.

853
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,930
-I mean, we're barely, like, friend birds.
-So typical.

854
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:43,520
Type-A male paired with a strong female,

855
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,980
and you just can't stand it, can you?

856
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,230
-Well, I...
-Let me guess. You prefer to fly solo.

857
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,110
I have to save everybody

858
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:54,110
all by myself!

859
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,570
Just like a man.

860
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,120
Ouch. That is kind of true though.

861
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,540
Maybe she was a little clingy at times.

862
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,500
Maybe she gave you that engagement ring
a little bit too early.

863
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,670
I don't think she's talking about us.

864
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,540
Maybe she's talking about Mighty Eagle.

865
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,710
-Debbie! Turn on the TV.
-Yes.

866
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,220
Okay...

867
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,220
-It's the one with the red button on top.
-Okay...

868
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,680
Red, Debbie.

869
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,770
What I'm planning to do is take
these little-bitty, undeveloped islands...

870
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,940
...and turn them into my own personal paradise.

871
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,900
You're insane!

872
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,360
I am putting myself first.

873
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,950
Because you know what?
I worked hard for it, and I deserve it.

874
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,700
All I gotta do is clear out all these inhabitants.

875
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:42,790
You're a monster!

876
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,290
Glenn, show them what I'm talking about.

877
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,250
Excuse me? Are you getting smart with me right now?

878
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,970
I can't believe we're soaring through the sky! Sky!

879
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,890
All thanks to our pig pals, they are cool guys!

880
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:06,850
-Guys!
-No!

881
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,190
What the heck was that?

882
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:10,940
Piggy Island?!

883
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:17,200
Attention, everyone!
It is imperative that you all run for your lives!

884
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,870
Bird Island?!

885
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,620
My mommy and daddy.

886
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,300
Terence? Where are the kids?

887
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,880
Where are the kids?!

888
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:44,930
I don't understand. I thought Red was supposed to save us!

889
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,400
Oh, my gah...

890
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,190
Oh, my gah.

891
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,530
It actually worked.

892
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,660
Yes, yes, yes!

893
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,080
Those islands are filled with innocent birds and pigs!

894
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,170
You all had the chance to evacuate.

895
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,790
But for some reason, you didn't.

896
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,760
So you are 100 percent sure we shouldn't evacuate?

897
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,970
I am sure. No one needs to evacuate.

898
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,930
Everybody just stay calm.

899
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:27,310
Sorry.

900
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,940
Not sorry. I'm truly not sorry.

901
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:44,030
Dodged that bullet.

902
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,740
This is all my fault.

903
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,700
Red, it's not your fault.

904
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,120
No. It-- It is my fault.

905
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,580
I put myself before everyone else.

906
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:35,420
I was afraid if I wasn't a hero anymore,

907
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,670
they'd all stop...

908
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,340
They'd all stop liking me.

909
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:45,380
Oh, Red. So you did all of this
because you were afraid of not being liked?

910
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,430
I...

911
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:48,720
Yes.

912
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,180
My fellow eagles,

913
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,640
who's tired of living in an icy wasteland?

914
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,310
We are!

915
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:56,690
What is she doing?

916
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:59,650
Who is tired of sipping hot chocolate

917
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,570
and getting brain freeze?

918
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,820
Me!

919
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,530
Who's tired of frozen dinners?

920
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,410
Whoa, frozen dinners?

921
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:13,040
Come on, Bomb, let's go.

922
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,920
Who's tired of playing only Vanilla Ice, Ice-T and Ice Cube?

923
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,710
I am.

924
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:24,670
Who wants to live worry-free under a beautiful tropical sun?

925
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,340
Me! I want to be hot!

926
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,220
I want it hot!

927
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,720
There's no turning back!

928
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,560
The future we deserve is about to be ours!

929
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,810
Glenn! Activate the weapon!

930
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,980
Start the countdown.

931
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,650
<i>Ten minutes to launch.</i>

932
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,200
All right, stand back.

933
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:54,870
-Wait, did you hear that too?
-Bomb?

934
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,920
What in the...?

935
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,590
-Really, guys?
-What? No. We weren't...

936
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,300
Yeah, they were.

937
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,840
Guys, why is that clock counting backwards?

938
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:10,470
-We've only got 10 minutes.
-It's now or never.

939
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,180
Pig-kind and bird-kind are depending on us.

940
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,180
What are we gonna do, Red?

941
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,770
Well, I...

942
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,020
I think...

943
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,190
in times like these, we need someone who can lead.

944
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:25,110
We need a hero.

945
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:27,780
You know what we need? We need Silver.

946
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,870
-Got any ideas?
-I've got a few, actually.

947
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:39,460
Okay.

948
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,210
That's the heart of the superweapon,

949
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:44,920
and if you look closely,
you can see that it's powered by air pressure.

950
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,840
Moisture around a composite volcano instantly vaporizes,

951
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,550
sending a plume of highly pressurised steam
to the surface.

952
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,470
That steam is contained by the pressure chamber.

953
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,720
And that's the part we need to destroy.

954
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,850
Only problem is, it's surrounded by armed guards.

955
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,940
Bomb. Do you think you can take out those guards?

956
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,570
Some of them look kind of tough.

957
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,360
-It won't be easy.
-Yeah, right. Of course. Got it.

958
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,070
Great. Chuck, I need you to disable the security cameras.

959
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,740
<i>-There's a bunch of them, so you'll have to work fast.
-Fast?</i>

960
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,950
Don't even worry about it, sis.

961
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,290
Red, you and I have to get inside one of those ice balls.

962
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:21,210
Inside an ice ball?

963
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:22,790
I-- Sure. Okay.

964
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,510
Leonard, Courtney, Garry, do you see
that giant lever near the orange lava tube?

965
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,220
-Copy that.
-I need you to pull it all the way down.

966
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,340
That will create a ramp so that
when Red and I roll down in the ice ball,

967
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:37,470
we'll be launched through the air
at the perfect trajectory to take out the superweapon.

968
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,430
<i>-Got it?
-Now you're talking.</i>

969
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,770
-Great plan, Silver.
-Great.

970
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:42,270
Mama would be so proud.

971
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:44,770
Okay, everyone put your wings and hooves in.

972
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,400
Go, team!

973
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:03,420
Chuck, let us know when you've disabled the cameras.

974
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,330
Okay. On it.

975
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,970
Easy, boys.

976
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:29,440
-Hey, Jerry.
-Yeah?

977
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:31,690
-Come here. Look at this.
-What's up?

978
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:36,820
It says everything's normal.

979
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:45,210
Jerry, are you seeing this?

980
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,290
I don't see anything.

981
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,920
No, not that one.

982
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,260
Not over here.

983
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,840
Oh, I think this one's it.

984
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,270
I'll be here when you get out.

985
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,280
Same.

986
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:21,790
We just need to get over to that track
and follow it up to the lever.

987
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:23,330
-Okay.
-Okay.

988
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,870
Don't touch the lava tube.

989
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,960
I don't know if I'm gonna fit.

990
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,050
Just suck in your butt.

991
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,010
Does anyone smell bacon?

992
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,940
No one can see me. Light on my toes.

993
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,700
<i>I'm sneaking
I'm sneaking up real quiet</i>

994
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,410
<i>Who took you out?
I don't know</i>

995
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:03,870
<i>Because I didn't hear them coming
Because they snuck up on me</i>

996
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,540
Captain, you seeing this?

997
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:08,830
No one sees me.

998
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,170
Take them out.

999
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:15,260
So why didn't you just team up with Chuck?
He's definitely faster than me.

1000
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:17,010
Nope, he's too light.

1001
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:19,930
Why not Bomb, then? You know, he's heavier than me.

1002
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:22,510
Too slow. You're perfect.

1003
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:26,100
Oh, that's funny. I thought we weren't compatible.

1004
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,100
Yeah. Well, you know...

1005
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:32,440
Some of the variables changed, so...

1006
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,820
Oh, variables, huh?

1007
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,360
So, what are we doing here?

1008
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:40,660
-We're on a mission.
-Oh, yeah, the mission. Of course.

1009
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,910
Okay, Bomb, we are in position.

1010
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:45,080
Time to take out those guards.

1011
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,370
Copy that.

1012
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,460
Come on, Bomb, hold it together.
Tighten up. You can do this.

1013
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,510
-We got a 10-91G in the control room.
-Roger that.

1014
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,100
You can do this, Bomb.

1015
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,980
Just take them out. Just take them out!

1016
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:12,440
Thanks for taking us out, man.

1017
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,110
Even Glenn's having a good time!

1018

<i>Baby shark, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

-All together!
-Silver, baby sharks have taken the bait.

1022
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,040
Roger that. Okay, Leonard. Time for Plan X.

1023
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,830
<i>Plan X? I thought you said spandex.</i>

1024
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,040
-Spandex?
-Spandex?

1025
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:41,840
Well, I'm working with what I got. Looking good, guys.

1026
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,850
Looking good.

1027
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,010
You gotta swing your arms.

1028
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,180
-I am swinging my arms.
-I'm swinging them like this.

1029
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:00,570
Yes!

1030
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,530
Three minutes to launch.

1031
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:05,700
Debbie, we are starting over, girl.

1032
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,370
This is like New Year's.

1033
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:10,790
Oh, my gosh, yes, okay.
I'm gonna get some glitter and decorations.

1034
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,870
This is gonna be so much fun!

1035
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,590
Zeta!

1036
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:22,550
We have a problem.

1037
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,930
Oh, my good--

1038
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,180
Go find them!

1039
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,230
Okay. That's where the ice balls are made.

1040
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,360
We've gotta jump in that hole
at the exact moment that the jaws open up.

1041
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,700
-Are you sure about this?
-Actually, no.

1042
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,160
-Going with my gut this time.
-Didn't expect that.

1043

-Go! Let's do this!
-Guys, guys, guys! Hold on!

1047
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,170
We're not done hanging out and having a good time.

1048
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:01,010
Silver, we've got a problem.

1049

<i>-Back to work, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

-We'll jump on the count of three.
-Got it.

1051

-Oh, no. What the...?
-Lava injectors!

1056

01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,710
Oh, whoa, Red!

1058
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,970
Well, it's all downhill from here.

1059
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:00,770
-Okay, now what?
-If my calculations are correct,

1060
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:04,280
we should be tall enough to reach that lever
if all three of us--

Garry?

1062

Okay, new plan.

1064

We need to get to 65 miles per hour.

1065
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,170
-Left, right, left, right.
-At least we're gonna get all our steps in today.

Yeah, yeah. Now is not the time, Courtney.

1110
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,850
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1111
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:43,770
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1112
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:54,530
No!

1113
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:03,920
That's my sister!

1114
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,550
-It didn't work?
-I-- I don't get it.

1115
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,680
Of course it didn't work.

1116
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:28,520
You must really love your little islands,
to risk your lives trying to save them!

1117
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,190
Well, guess what.

1118
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,440
I don't care.

1119
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:36,950
Because this right here is ice-cold, baby.

1120
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,200
No!

1121
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,620
-Zeta!
-What?

1122
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,370
Wait!

1123
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,920
-What? What...?
-Mighty Eagle!

1124
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,120
Yeah!

1125
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:56,220
I'm the cause of all this.

1126
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:59,720
I ran out on you on our wedding day.

1127
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,720
And ever since then, you've been tormented inside.

1128
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:05,890
Right now? This is when you choose to do this?

1129
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,810
So take me!

1130
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,560
Not these islands.

1131
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,440
You have got some flipping nerve!

1132
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:14,650
I know!

1133
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,360
I ripped your heartstrings right out.

1134
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:19,780
-That's it. Super String.
-What?

1135
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:23,040
--has been burning a hole in your sanity!

1136
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,500
-Set yourself free...
-Okay, I'm seeing it.

1137
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:27,290
Yeah.

1138
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:30,540
-Go ahead. Do your worst to me.
-Chuck.

1139
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,380
I deserve it.

1140
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,720
-You think this is about you, Ethan?
-Ethan?

1141
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,510
Oh, that is so hilarious slash embarrassing

1142
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,350
slash I hadn't thought about your fat butt in 20 years.

1143
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:46,430
Wait, what?

1144
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:51,060
You are a lazy, uncoordinated, fish-eyed fool.

1145
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:53,480
You ain't worth the salt in your bread.

1146
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:55,610
You are nothing to me! You are nothing!

1147
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,700
I don't think about you at all.
I don't think about your stinking feet.

1148
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,780
I don't think about your rusty hands.
I don't think about your rusty elbows--

1149
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:05,450
Wait, so you have or you haven't thought about me?

1150
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,950
News flash, bro:

1151
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,620
I am over you, I'm over this place,

1152
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:14,380
and I am ready to get that upgrade situation
going for me and my daughter.

1153
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,710
Hey.

1154
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:20,260
-Well, our daughter.
-What?

1155
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,890
-That's my dad?
-I have a daughter?

1156
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,730
Yes, you do!

1157
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:33,980
And I raised her all by myself in this icy wasteland.

1158
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:39,320
But now I'm gonna be sipping piña coladas
on those warm tropical islands

1159
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,820
like I deserve to!

1160
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,580
-Stop!
-Oh, no.

1161
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,090
-Hey, it's working!
-Yes!

1162
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,380
Oh, no.

1163
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,140
Gotcha!

1164
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,730
You can do it!

1165
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,730
Hold on to that string!

1166
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:13,650
The hatchlings.

1167
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,770
Oh, no! They're in trouble!

1168
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:28,490
Jump!

1169
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,130
-Everyone, run!
-Run!

1170
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:38,170
Let's go!

1171
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,090
No, no, wait. This is not happening.

1172
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,220
Gotcha!

1173
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:56,650
-I'm freaking out!
-Me too!

1174
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,640
-We did it.
-We did it.

1175
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,100
Debbie?

1176
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,220
Where is she? Where's Debbie?

1177
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:32,730
Debbie?

1178
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,400
Debbie, no.

1179
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,910
What have I done?

1180
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,290
Oh, Debbie.

1181
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,460
Are you okay?

1182
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:05,970
Sweetie?

1183
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,800
Honey pie?

1184
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,970
Love of the last one minute of my life?

1185
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,310
Dad?

1186
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:15,690
Yes.

1187
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,940
You are so strong!

1188
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,650
He saved my life!

1189
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:22,230
Oh, Debbie.

1190
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:27,240
Mom, can we keep him?

1191
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,450
Please?

1192
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:30,120
Oh, I...

1193
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,120
Wait. Wait.

1194
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,870
Before you answer, you should see something.

1195
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,420
Wait, wait, wait.

1196
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,420
And the one closest to my heart.

1197
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,550
<i>I don't want to wait</i>

1198
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:54,060
<i>For our lives to be over</i>

1199
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,980
<i>Will it be yes or will it be</i>

1200
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,060
<i>Sorry?</i>

1201
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:01,610
Oh, no.

1202
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,780
You are so pitiful.

1203
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,030
<i>Yeah</i>

1204
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:14,450
I've never been to a wedding before!

1205
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,580
Oh, okay, who's getting married again?

1206
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,920
Oh, Terence, this is like our wedding but expensive.

1207
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,960
Flowers for you, flowers for you.

1208
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:26,880
-Flowers for you.
-Ladies and gentlemen, birds and pigs,

1209
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,970
we are gathered here today
because of these two characters.

1210
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:34,390
Not only because they're being joined in holy matrimony,

1211
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:39,940
but also because one of them tried to destroy our islands
for her own selfish reasons.

1212
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,020
Guess who.

1213
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,400
Oh, it's such a beautiful wedding.

1214
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,770
It really is.

1215
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:47,780
But Mighty Eagle swooped in at the last second

1216
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:50,240
and got all the credit for stopping her.

1217
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,820
Yes, you did, baby.

1218
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:53,570
I love you.

1219
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,080
Wrap it up.

1220
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,250
I now pronounce you eagle and husband.

1221
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,000
-You may now kiss the...
-Come here, you.

1222
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,670
All right. Get it, Mighty Eagle. Oh, that is disgusting!

1223
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,960
Go, Zeta! Go, Dad!

1224
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:09,380
Attention!

1225
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:11,760
Attention, everybody. Eyes on me. Hi.

1226
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,090
Hi. Look up here.

1227
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,510
I would like to propose a toast

1228
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,770
to the bird who made all of this possible.

1229
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:22,270
Our hero, Red.

1230
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,270
-Give it up for Red!
-Yeah!

1231
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,110
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1232
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:28,780
You're our hero, Red!

1233
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,110
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1234
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:34,320
Easy, guys. Hollow bones. I've got hollow bones.

1235
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:36,120
-Who loves you, Red?
-Yeah, Red!

1236
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,250
I mean, thanks, guys. I-- Thank you.

1237
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,420
Speech, speech, speech!

1238
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,970
Looks like they still love you, Red.

1239
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,550
Okay, well, you know, I'm...

1240
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:58,760
I'm honoured, everybody. Really, I-- And I just...

1241
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:07,400
Two seconds. Give me two seconds. I'll be right back.

1242
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,030
Good speech! Yeah!

1243
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,990
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me. I'm just trying to squeeze through here.

1244
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,950
Hey, hey, hey! Silver!

1245
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:28,420
I... Thank you, guys.

1246
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,300
Thank you for this. And for all the support and love.

1247
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:34,630
You know, it means... Well, it means everything to me.

1248
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,390
But I don't deserve it.

1249
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,260
She does.

1250
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:40,560
What just happened?

1251
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,890
Is that the nerd from our physics class?

1252
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,690
This is the real hero right here.

1253
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:48,810
Silver is the one who came up
with the plan to stop the superweapon

1254
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,280
and ultimately saved all our lives.

1255
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,660
Red, I didn't do this all on my own.

1256
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,280
Right. Because we're a team.

1257
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:03,660
We couldn't have done anything without Chuck and Bomb,

1258
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:06,250
-or Courtney and Garry.
-Thank you.

1259
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,250
Or Leonard.

1260
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:10,800
Actually, we probably could've done it without Leonard.
Let's be honest, huh?

1261
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,880
Leonard's the man! I did everything! I got the sub!

1262
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:15,880
And even Mighty Eagle.

1263
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:17,010
-So handsome.
-Ethan!

1264
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:21,180
And last, but certainly not least, those adorable hatchlings.

1265
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:26,060
We are strongest when we all band together.

1266
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,600
Just like Super String.

1267
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:30,860
-Let's hear it for Silver!
-Yes!

1268
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:33,570
I want to be an engineer.

1269
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:36,320
-All right! Yeah, Silver!
-We love you, Silver!

1270
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,530
-Okay, Garry, now.
-On it.

1271
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:42,950
Oh, my gosh!

1272
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,700
-We're famous!
-Look at that.

1273
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:46,870
Oh, look! It's me!

1274
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,670
You see, these guys are the real heroes.

1275
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:53,050
They're the ones who deserve your love, not me.

1276
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,260
We love you even more now, Red!

1277
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:59,430
Yeah, Red! We love you!

1278
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:03,100
See? You're not in this alone.

1279
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:06,390
I'm married now. Let's party, y'all! I's married!

1280
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:19,410
Debbie, get away from the punch bowl, girl!
Come over here and dance with your mama!

1281
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,620
-Hey, y'all!
-Mom, watch this!

1282
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:30,370
Oh, yeah! Hey, where's Red and Silver?

1283
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,340
Okay, worms or birdseed?

1284
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:38,880
Kidding. I know it's toast.

1285
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:39,970
Toast.

1286
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:43,600
I was actually being sarcastic
when I said that was my favourite food,

1287
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,890
just for the record.

1288
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,640
What? You?

1289
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,100
Sarcastic?

1290
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:49,890
-No way.
-I see what you're doing.

1291
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,060
-Okay.
-Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1292
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,820
Maybe I will, when you're not too busy saving the world.

1293
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,740
You know, I actually just finished doing that,
so I'm pretty free.

1294
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:02,320
Oh, no way. Because I'm pretty free too.

1295
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:04,910
Well, I don't have anything to do either!

1296
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:07,040
Wait a minute. What's that sound?

1297
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,160
Tickle Train?

1298
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,870
-Coming to Third Wheel Station!
-Chuck, no!

1299
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,590
-Jinx, jinx, jinx!
-Jinx, jinx, jinx!

1300
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:32,730
Laugh it up, everybody.

1301
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:37,110
No one can stop me.

1302
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:39,740
I'll stop you, Zeta.

1303
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:43,160
Well, you can't stop me from...

1304
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:47,120
showing you how cute my little sisters are
when they're sleeping.

1305
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,510
They're so cute.

1306
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:06,350
I kind of thought they'd be hatched by now.

1307
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,640
They're hatching!

1308
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:12,350
Here they come!

1309
01:27:12,730 --> 01:27:14,650
Oh, my gosh! I see one!

1310
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:20,860
Mama!

1311
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:42,090
Can I help you?

1312
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:46,590
Sorry.

1313
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:58,150
Mama?

1314
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,280
Hi.

1315
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,160
My baby sisters!

1316
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,370
Bye.

1317
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,050
Mama!

1318
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:25,630
Oh, baby sisters.

1319
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:29,010
-We love you so much.
-We should take good care of them

1320
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,260
and never let them out of our sights.

1321
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:34,730
Yeah. We'll never let them out of our sights.

1322
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:40,360
Bye-bye.
