00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,731
Mom, I can't. It hurts.

5
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,316
- It's just a little tummy ache.
- It's not my tummy.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,319
- It's my side.
- What am I gonna say to you?

7
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,615
Pain is weakness

00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,339
- but not too body positive.
- Still fuckable.

160
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,840
So fuckable.

161
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,175
No one asked you, Ashley.

162
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,676
Sorry, Ashley.

163
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,095
Okay, that's also horrifying,

164
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,140
but I'm thinking Silver Kincaid.

165
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,809
But she's, uh...

166
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,728
She's from Afghan...

167
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,772
- She's from England.
- ...is tan?

168
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,315
And she has the highest
rescue stats

169
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,400
of any of the finalists,
and she's

170
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,527
a UNICEF ambassador.

171
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,196
She's the most qualified.

172
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,531
Well, we're gonna have to run
all of this past Homelander,

173
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,075
- of course.
- Of course.

174
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,661
Actually, according to
my contract with Mr. Edgar,

175
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,372
I get final say
over the two slots.

176
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,000
So, why don't you run that
past Homelander,

177
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,543
hmm?

178
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,516
Bonjour, Cherie.

179
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,685
Did you bring the passports?

180
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,655
Hey.

181
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,949
What is wrong?

182
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,285
Serge, I fucked up.

183
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,789
I went back to work
for Little Nina.

184
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,084
Merde, Cherie.

185
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,628
Some of us can't get
cushy jobs at the CIA.

186
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,589
I was moving weight for her,

187
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,050
and these fucking assholes
boosted it.

188
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,719
Can you find them?

189
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,804
They wore masks.
I don't know who they were.

190
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,640
And I was high.

191
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,730
Okay.

192
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,106
How much?

193
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,191
Eleven kilos.

194
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,321
We pay her back.

195
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,905
We pay her back. We beg...

196
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,158
No, you know it's the principle
of the thing with Nina.

197
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,535
You remember Olivier?

198
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,999
How many pieces did she cut off
him while he was still alive?

199
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,919
Come with me.

200
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,131
We can go someplace warm.

201
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,634
Just you and me.

202
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,428
Huh?

203
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,436
Sorry.

204
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,150
Oh, Marvin.
What are you doing here?

205
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,069
Poor judgment, ma'am.

206
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,533
Butcher!

207
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,660
Hi.

208
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,161
Oh!

209
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,704
Oh, easy does it, lad.

210
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,415
Bloody death grip you got there.

211
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,043
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,795
Right as rain.

213
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,296
Come on in.

214
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,591
The fuck was that?

215
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,135
Didn't know he had it in him.

216
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,847
So, why did you come back?

217
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,186
Soldier Boy killed my family.

218
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,151
Are you sure
this place is secure?

219
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,154
We'll have to keep moving,
but for now, yes.

220
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,406
The only thing that
might give us away

221
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,534
is this clown show of yours
shambling onto my driveway.

222
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,120
Well...

223
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,998
I wouldn't be here
if this was just a phone call.

224
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,592
- Hey, Alex, just, um, come here for a second.
- Hey.

225
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,221
Um, why are you playing
my shitty song?

226
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,474
So he can't hear us.

227
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:48,977
They want to pick you
as one of the winners tonight.

228
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,145
♪ <i>I first saw you...</i>

229
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,688
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,231
And you need to say no.

231
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,774
- What? Why?
- Okay, listen.

232
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,860
I really wish someone told me

233
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,821
what I'm about to tell you.

234
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,116
There's something wrong
with Homelander.

235
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,784
Something broken.

236
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,453
He's threatened to murder me
more than once.

237
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,206
He's murdered other people,
and it's only getting worse.

238
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,291
And you're just gonna be
putting yourself

239
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,709
and your family in danger.

240
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,377
And pretty much
the rest of them, too.

241
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,129
They're so fucking cruel.
Trust me,

242
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,173
you don't want this.
Just say that you can't do it.

243
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,008
Say that your family is
having an emergency.

244
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,885
- Don't do it.
- Annie, Annie, Annie, stop... Annie, Annie, stop.

245
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,513
You just told me that...

246
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,723
all the shit I swallowed
for years... I mean, the band,

247
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,683
Vought's racism, it's all for,
it's all for nothing, right?

248
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,393
- Look, I'm so...
- Look, I need a second.

249
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,437
I'm really sorry, but, please,

250
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,523
you need to promise me
that you will leave

251
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,067
and you'll never look back.
Please.

252
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,997
So they chauffeuring you
around now, huh?

253
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,208
Like you Rihanna.

254
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,335
Never needed a license,
always just ran.

255
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,130
- How'd you know I'd be here?
- I'm your brother.

256
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,299
And I still know a few people.

257
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,552
So...

258
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,011
how bad is it?

259
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,140
Doctors say it's like playing
Russian roulette.

260
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,810
If I ever run again,
maybe nothing,

261
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,728
but maybe my heart...

262
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,107
You still on that blue shit?

263
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,109
That shit'll probably
kill me even faster.

264
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,778
Good. Then we can skip to the
part where I accept your apology

265
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,406
and you can come back
to the crib with me.

266
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,325
Sure the boys would love
to see you, man.

267
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,465
Butcher said you have powers.

268
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,681
Me, too.

269
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,603
Do you like yours?

270
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,359
Do you ever get scared of them?

271
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,827
Me, too.

272
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,248
Aunt Grace wanted
to get me a dog, but...

273
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,958
I told her no.

274
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,044
I was afraid I'd hurt it.

275
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,599
I'm sure you didn't mean it.

276
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,862
Yeah.

277
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,240
Me, too.

278
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,329
Neuman's head of the bureau
because I said so.

279
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,664
I tried to save her from

280
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,707
the attack on Congress
that she fucking caused.

281
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,709
Well, at least you
didn't spend the last year

282
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,378
getting her oat milk lattes

283
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,672
and every piece of intel
she asked for.

284
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,175
I would very much like to know
the plan to eliminate her.

285
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,469
Well, that depends

286
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,012
on what you can tell us

287
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,766
about your little holiday
down in Nicaragua.

288
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,645
- I've never been to Nicaragua.
- Really?

289
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,689
'Cause a little birdie told me

290
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,607
you were Payback's
case officer down there,

291
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,567
on a classified job

292
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,737
that Soldier Boy
never come back from.

293
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,157
Colonel?

294
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,911
Whatever it is William
thinks he may have heard,

295
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,454
he's mistaken.

296
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,252
Is he?

297
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,587
You know that safe

298
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,715
you got in your home office?

299
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,592
The one behind the picture
of Bush number one?

300
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,886
Well, I borrowed
a ledger from it,

301
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,972
the one with all your assets
around the world.

302
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:58,768
How long do you think them
and their families will last

303
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,938
when I put every one of their
fucking names on Facebook?

304
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,190
You'd sign the death warrants
of dozens of innocent people

305
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,650
who had nothing to do with this?

306
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,653
I'm embarrassed for the both
of us that you're asking.

307
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,200
Nicaragua's ancient history.

308
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,162
Not to mention I could be killed
just for telling you.

309
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,165
And all your agents
will get killed if you don't.

310
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,292
Blimey.

311
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,463
What a pickle.

312
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,805
It was part of Operation Charly.

313
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,350
Operation...

314
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,602
Charly?

315
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,021
Reagan's pet project,
off the books.

316
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,566
Help the Contra rebels fight
the Russian-backed Sandinistas,

317
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,443
but we needed a way
to pay for it.

318
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:52,238
<i>Some of the cash
came from selling arms to Iran,</i>

319
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,741
<i>Oliver North's epic fuck up.</i>

<i>it was cocaine.</i>

323
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,665
<i>I was in charge of trafficking
the coke into the U.S.</i>

324
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:07,128
<i>and then using the profits

whatever it took.

327
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,259
That's some
self-justifying bullshit.

328
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,220
Were you part of that
other thing, too?

329
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,763

Tell him.

332
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,730
The unwritten policy

333
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,983
was to sell the cocaine strictly
to minority neighborhoods.

334

Destabilize, demoralize,
while staying out of white ones.

335

Late in '84, we were gearing up
for a major offensive,

00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,370
so the higher-ups,
in their infinite wisdom,

decided it was the perfect time

- Stanford Edgar.

- Oh.
- Payback will embed themselves

Superheroes in the military,
of course.

For the first time

is that the enemy might spot

So, listen,

00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,556
if I'm gonna take a more
central role on the team,

405
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,057
then I want to lose the mask.

406
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,517
Silent ninjas score

00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,063
Well, fuck mystique.

410
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,565
People don't even know
it's me under this thing.

411
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,066
I got to wear it
just to get a cab.

412
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,110
Payback is the country's

00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,990
Well, I could be
bigger than that.

416
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,575
I could be Eddie Murphy.

417
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,290
I'm not wearing the mask.

418
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,376
Your choice.

419
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,545
Though, once you're farmed out
to Minneapolis-St. Paul,

420
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,672
you'll want the mask

421
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,633
simply for... warmth.

422
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,557
You should smile more.

423
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,478

00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,776

- Just ask Loni Anderson.
- They don't,

428

429
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:46,407
The women are either humoring

430
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,202
but none of them like you.

431
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,872
You know, if you were
a little nicer,

432
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,833
maybe you'd find a man,

433
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,961

434

447
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,085
No, actually,
I choose the new members.

448
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,130
But I am pitching
the craziest twist.

449
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,924
The audience will never

450
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,634
Well, I've made my decision.

451
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,137
Oh, come on.
You haven't even heard it yet.

452
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,930
Seriously, you're-you're

00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,523
No, no, no, no, no, Starlight,

457
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,941
before you say anything,

458
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,986
doesn't Christ tell us
to turn the other cheek?

459
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,325

Mm.

461
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,662
I had something
made for you, Starlight.

462
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,539
It's a peace offering.

463
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,291
It's 24-karat gold

464

00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,298
and I realize that when you've
made an unforgivable mistake,

467
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,216
the first person
you have to forgive

468
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,719
is yourself.

469
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:37,310
What makes you think
that I want a daily reminder

470

of the guy who fucking
mouth-raped me?

471
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,983
I need a word.

472
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,694
Let's let these two chat,
shall we?

473
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,238
Okay. I'll just...

474
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,118
Absolutely not.

475
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,578
Do you really think
I'm gonna let

Captain Al ...?
We're Americans.

478
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,585
- I'm taking this to Mr. Edgar.
- My speech last night?

479
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,962
Thirty-eight-point-six rating
and a 59 share.

480
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,506
Oh, and they're saying
that the live-plus-threes

481
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,925
are gonna be even bigger.

482
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,093
Edgar said it himself,

483
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,346
popularity is power.

484
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,181
He won't die on this hill.

485
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:23,231
Do I need to remind you
of the Flight 37 video?

486
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,127
Go ahead.

487
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,587
Release it.

488
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,341
Let's light this candle, huh?

489
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:54,345
I mean, sure, I'll lose
everything, but then...

490
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,013
I'll have nothing to lose.

491
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,724
First,

492
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,477
I'll take out
the nerve centers...

493
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,146
White House, Pentagon...

494
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,691
Then any domestic
defense capabilities,

495
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,859
and then critical
infrastructure...

496
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:12,822
Like cellular, Internet,
that kind of thing...

497
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,491
And then,

498
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,119
well, I think then...

499
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:22,123
I'll just wipe New York
off the fucking map...

500
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,333
for fun.

501
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,127
I'll even throw in Des Moines

502
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,212
and that little
cousin-fucker hick town

503
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,381
that Maeve's from,
'cause why not?

504
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,384
See, Starlight,

505
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,721
I'd prefer to be loved.

506
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:40,641
I would, but if you
take that away from me,

507
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:43,352
well, being feared

508
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,522
is A-one okey doke by me.

509
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,191
So...

510
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,862
Go ahead, partner.

511
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,324
Do it.

512
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,413
No?

513
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,584
You don't want to do it?

514
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,545
Well, then I would have to say

515
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,173
that you have absolutely
no fucking leverage

516
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,135
because I am the Homelander.

517
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,514
And I really can do
whatever the fuck I want.

518
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,731
Okay.

519
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,651
- Okay, so tomorrow...
- Uh-huh.

520
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,153
...you have the
"Re-Contextualizing Feminism"

521
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,030
panel with Rose McGowan
and Alyssa Milano.

522
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,406
Ooh, I love <i>Charmed.</i>

523
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,116
- Hey, babe, I'm serious.
- Yeah?

524
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,951
We need to cover your ass...

525
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,496
...in case that bitch Starlight
comes after you again.

526
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,915
Thanks, babe. I couldn't have
done this without you.

527
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,958
You're telling me.

528
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:52,797
Yeah.

529
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,775
Oh, yeah?

530
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,902
- Yeah, you like that?
- Oh, fuck yeah.

531
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,487
Oh, yeah.

532
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,197
Oh, God.

533
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,865
- You're so fucking wet.
- Oh, it's all you, baby.

534
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,033
It's all you.

535
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:22,576
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

536
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,953
What are you gonna do?

537
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,704
Gonna jerk me off
with all your arms?

538
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:26,997
All my arms?

539
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,707
Yeah.

540
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,695
Butcher, are you okay?

541
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,155
Yeah, mate.

542
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,823
It's all good.
Just give us a minute, yeah?

543
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,491
Do you need any help?

544
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,369
Don't come in.

545
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,920
- Hey, Annie.
<i>- Homelander's had a breakdown.</i>

546
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,131
He's lost his fucking mind.

547
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,383
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Slow down, slow down. What?

548
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,261
<i>He's bringing the Deep
back into The Seven,</i>

549
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,222
so I brought up the video,
and he said to go ahead

550
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,016
<i>and release it. You were right.</i>

551
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,976
Cocaptain was a bad idea.

552
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,394
<i>I have to leave.</i>

553
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,229
Look, I-I know I should
tell you to run out of there

554
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,732
like a house on fire,
and I want to...

555
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,027
...but you got to stick it out.

556
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,864
- I'm sorry?
- <i>Listen,</i>

557
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,241
I'm-I'm-I'm back with Butcher.

558
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,619
Why?

559
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,662
We're onto something
that could kill Homelander.

560
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:51,707
What? What is it?

561
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,833
Some kind of weapon. Uh...

562
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,793
I'm not sure,
but you got to buy us some time.

563
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,253
<i>Keep your eyes on him.</i>

564
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,630
How much time?

565
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,216
Uh...

566
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,551
You don't know.

567
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,929
<i>So, for God knows how long,</i>

568
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,889
I have to paste on a smile,

569
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,642
<i>with Homelander
growing more unstable</i>

570
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,143
by the hour,

571
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,646
hoping that he doesn't
kill me or worse.

572
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,860
If that's what it takes,
then yeah.

573
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,576
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just...

574
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,745
Homelander and-and Vicky,
they-they're running laps

575
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,163
<i>around us because...</i>

576
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,665
<i>because we keep trying
to do it the right way.</i>

577
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,291
The high road just doesn't work.

578
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,962
W-We have to be as mean
and fucked-up as they are.

579
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,797
- Now you sound like...
- <i>Like Butcher, I know,</i>

580
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,299
but, Annie, he's... he's right.

581
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:44,218
<i>He's been right all along.
I'm just so...</i>

582
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,638
tired of losing.

583
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,850
Okay.

584
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,019
<i>You better pull this off,
Hughie, but...</i>

585
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:56,313
okay.

586
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,656
I used to destroy you
in slapsies.

587
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,324
You had super speed.

588
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:08,325
Ow!

589
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,952
Khamari.

590
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,287
Put another hand
on your brother,

591
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,539
- you see what happens.
- Hey, Uncle Reg,

592
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,749
- what's up with that suit?
- Oh, you like it, huh?

593
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,252
- That shit's corny.
- Hey, Khamari, that's not

594
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,421
- how you talk to your uncle.
- Nah, it's-it's all right.

595
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,964
Young men just don't understand
the history.

596
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,716
Oh, no, the suit's ridiculous.

597
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,926
But he shouldn't be using
that kind of language.

598
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,928
All right, inside. Both y'all.

599
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,680
All right? And wash your hands.

600
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,473
For real this time.

601
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,561
I didn't want to say nothing,
but...

602
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,271
Just trying to show
the community

603
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,064
I'm down for the cause.

604
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:42,109
Since when you been down
with any cause?

605
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,028
Come on, man.

606
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,572
I mean, I can't run,
I can't do shit.

607
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,073
So I got to rebrand.

608
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,825
- Stay in the game somehow.
- Or you don't.

609
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,160
You could just be

610
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,203
my pain-in-the-ass
little brother Reg.

611
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,123
- Yeah.
- Let me tell you, man,

612
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm happier coaching these kids

613
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,420
than I ever was
working at Vought.

614
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,422
You should come down
to the track.

615
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,090
They'd love to see you.

616
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,760
Yeah.

617
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,804
Okay.

618
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:15,559
Since you want to be down
with the cause so much...

619
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:17,603
- Hmm?
<i>- I was walking home,</i>

620
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,647
<i>and this mugger
came up behind me.</i>

621
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,940
<i>I was terrified.</i>

622
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,109
<i>And that's when
Dana Whitmyre says Blue Hawk</i>

623
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,402
<i>came to her rescue.</i>

624
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,488
<i>At
Approximately 7:15 p.m.,</i>

625
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,448
<i>I spotted a Black male
following the victim</i>

626
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,200
<i>southbound on Marin Boulevard.</i>

627
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,077
<i>I intercepted him,
at which point</i>

628
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,455
<i>the suspect became aggressive.</i>

629
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,960
Brother lived
a few houses up the street.

630
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,545
Three kids.

631
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,590
He was just walking home
from work.

632
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,967
Blue Hawk
curb-stomped him so hard,

633
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,928
it cracked the pavement.

634
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,430
- That's fucked-up.
- Yeah.

635
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,769
Maybe I can throw his family
some cash or something.

636
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,771
They don't need a handout.

637
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,439
They need you to speak up.

638
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,608
You're in
The motherfucking Seven.

639
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,819
Yeah, but, I mean...

640
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,489
I... Listen, I'm Michael Jordan.

641
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,324
I'm not Malcolm X.

642
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:17,538
Everybody loves
the A-Train, right?

643
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,299
Sergei.

644
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,721
- Nina wants to see you.
- Yevgenny.

645
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,223
How's your wife?

646
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,851
She still enjoy getting
her salad tossed by a Frenchman

647
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,103
while her husband
tosses nothing?

648
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,190
Another time.

649
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,452
Get in.

650
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,209
Come on. Fucking knock it off.

651
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,323
All right, mate?

652
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,576
Are you sick?

653
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,328
No, no.

654
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,121
I had a dodgy kebab, didn't I?

655
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:42,998
Went straight through me.

656
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,500
Try these.

657
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,085
Well, I'll be.

658
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,381
Your mum used to give me these
when I was under the weather.

659
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,300
Same.

660
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,346
- I hated them.
- I used to crush them up

661
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,765
and put them in the bird feeder
when she wasn't looking.

662
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,183
Well, I don't blame you.

663
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,685
They done off leave your mouth
drier than a nun's...

664
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,106
You were gonna say "vagina."

665
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,984
Yeah. Something like that.

666
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,035
It's not just your stomach,
though.

667
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,704
Your heart's racing.
I can hear it.

668
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,457
And your blood
smells funny, too.

669
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,963
Don't you worry, son.

670
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,799
Nothing a good night's kip
won't sort.

671
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,350
Sorry about that.

672
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,477
What the hell
did you drink last night?

673
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,856
Right.

674
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,692
Where were we?

675
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,485
To the surprise of no one,

676
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:56,196
that moron Swatto
went for another joy flight,

677
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,656
<i>giving away our position.</i>

678
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,116
<i>Even better, the Sandinistas</i>

679
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,535
<i>brought Russian special forces
with them.</i>

680
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,871
<i>Though that didn't matter much
to the Supes.</i>

681
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,667
Those are my men!

682
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:19,219
You, stay with me! Go!

683
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:26,393
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

684
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,547
Oh, yeah!

685
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,972
Gunpowder!
Will you please fucking stop?

686
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,025
Oh, God.

687
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,443
They killed Soldier Boy.

688
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,361
- What? Who?
- The Russians.

689
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:44,823
They had some kind of gun
or-or weapon or something.

690
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,491
- That's impossible.
- No!

691
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:49,536
We saw it. We saw it.

692
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,038
They took his body.

693
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,178
I lost 116 men.

694
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,181
And Vought got full immunity.

695
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,808
That was the day
I decided to make them pay.

696
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,103
Well, ain't that
a wonderful story.

697
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,689
Tell me, Grace,

698
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,692
where did the Ivans take this...

699
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,778
Supe Gun?

700
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,572
The trail went cold
behind the iron curtain.

701
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,115
It's the truth.

702
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,909
My reach only goes so far.

703
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:33,997
You knew what Soldier Boy did
to my family,

704
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,750
but you didn't think
I needed to know the truth?

705
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,252
It wasn't that simple.

706
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:48,512
Marvin, Hugh, give us the room.

707
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:16,331
You came to me
after Becca disappeared

708
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,375
and promised me
Homelander's head.

709
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:19,960
And all this time,

710
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,754
you knew there was something
that could do the job,

711
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,465
and you never said
a fucking word.

712
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:26,925
Whatever this weapon is,

713
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,301
it probably won't work
on Homelander.

714
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,679
- And what if it does?
- Even worse.

715
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,806
Because it wouldn't end
with him.

716
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,517
You'd go after another Supe,
then another, then all of them.

717
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,602
If you'd have told me
about this sooner,

718
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,522
Homelander
might already be dead.

719
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,441
Ryan wouldn't be running
from one safe house to the next,

720
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:46,987
wondering when his nutter dad's
gonna drop out of the sky.

721
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,614
And Becca...

722
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,578
Becca might still be alive.

723
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,166
And for that...

724
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:04,296
...I'll never
fucking forgive you.

725
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,716
This was never about Ryan
or Becca.

726
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,384
It was always selfish.

727
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,053
Always and only for you.

728
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,182
For the hate inside that you
want to let loose on the world.

729
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:19,227
I thought maybe you changed,
but I was wrong.

730
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,146
You are your father.

731
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,773
Always have been.

732
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,529
- What happened?
- We're off.

733
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,450
Butcher, wait up.
Where-where are you going?

734
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,869
- The city.
- When will I see you again?

735
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,746
You won't. Ain't safe for you.

736
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,080
Wait!

737
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:42,834
- What are you talking about?
- I got to go.

738
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:49,799
- Ryan, let go.
- No.

739
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,801
You said you'd always
watch out for me.

740
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:54,679
- You promised!
- Ryan, let go.

741
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:57,515
- I won't let you!
- Well, maybe I don't want to look at you.

742
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,727
After what you done to my Becca.
Did you ever think about that?

743
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,290
I hate you.

744
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,624
Sorry if Yevgenny
got a little rough.

745
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,502
He's still a bit bitter
you ate his wife's anus.

746
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:17,304
Why am I here, Nina?

747
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,308
Do you remember Mikhail Petrov?

748
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,852
You wait for him to come home.
He step out of his minivan.

749
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,438
You attack. He knocks
the blade from your hand,

750
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:30,066
so you slam this Honda Odyssey
minivan sliding doors

751
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,943
on his neck over and over

752
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:34,112
until he's...

753
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,031
...decapitated.

754
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,950
Art. Who can define it?

755
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,328
Then you discovered
his young bride

756
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,912
in the passenger seat,

757
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:46,708
and my Sergei
does not leave a witness behind.

758
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,629
Where is Cherie?

759
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,382
I don't know.

760
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,598
She had a place in Bayonne

761
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,767
last time I saw her.

762
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,352
Why?

763
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,567
'Cause nobody stole heroin
from her.

764
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,529
She stole it from me.

765
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,452
I will give her
a quick death, <i>pazhalsta,</i>

766
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,954
and I will make this
worth your while.

767
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,959
I don't do that shit anymore.

768
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:36,007
Nobody changes, hmm?

769
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,343
What was your safe word again?

770
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:42,097
When I used the dog collar
and the strap-on? What was it?

771
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,558
Vincent Cassel.

772
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:52,232
You are like rabid little doggy

773
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,609
but loyal to whoever
holds this chain.

774
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,363
Before William Butcher,
it was me.

775
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:01,282
Before me, it was your daddy.

776
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,829
But you always heel, Sergei.

777
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,375
Not Sergei.

778
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,001
Serge.

779
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,171
And that was a long time ago.

780
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:19,342
Who I am now is someone
who works for the CIA, Nina.

781
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:20,802
So unless you want

782
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,304
the full weight
of the government up your ass...

783
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,891
...I'm leaving.

784
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,895
We both have had bigger things
than the government

785
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,981
up our asses.

786
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:43,116
Just think about my offer.

787
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:47,871
Go on, scamper away,
little doggy.

788
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,756
<i>Deep,</i>

789
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,216
- welcome home, brother.
- Hear! Hear!

790
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,926
Oh, thanks, Homelander.

791
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,136
This literally means
everything to me.

792
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,597
- To us.
- To us.

793
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,140
Ah! Here we are.

794
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,142
- Ooh.
- Excellent. Okay,

795
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,936
so, I took the liberty
of ordering for all of us,

796
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,814
but I'm pretty sure you're
gonna love my selection. Okay?

797
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,566
Thank you, gentlemen.

798
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,692
Yes, sir.

799
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,406
Mmm.

800
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,117
- Could I just get some... some bread?
- Come on, now.

801
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,162
You're back
in the big leagues, buddy.

802
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,080
Nothing but the best for you.

803
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:41,090
I'm so hungry.

804
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,555
Know who
I've been reading up on lately?

805
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,726
Dr. Martin Luther King.

806
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:56,606
Well, my relationship with King
has deepened of late.

807
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,650
He was, uh, villainized.

808
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,945
Persecuted.
Spoke truth to power.

809
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,696
Just like me. It's crazy. But...

810
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,616
we've both been
to the mountaintop,

811
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,035
and we've seen
the promised land.

812
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:14,582
I showed people the real me,
and they loved me for it.

813
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,380
I mean, they fucking loved me.

814
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,425
If only I'd known that sooner.

815
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,888
There's always been
so, so many things

816
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:31,933
I want to do, and now
I can do them all, finally.

817
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,521
And no one can stop me.

818
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,231
Nobody.

819
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:43,945
Free at last.

820
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:46,698
Free at last.

821
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,075
Oh! Excellent.

822
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,868
Deep,

823
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:53,288
- that's for you, big guy.
- Me?

824
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:56,416
- Thank you, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

825
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:58,710
Wonderful.

826
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,004
Chef's specialty.

827
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:04,173
It is a South Korean delicacy.

828
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:06,801
Holy shit, it's Timothy.

829
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,469
Oh, my God.

830
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,221
That's Timoth... He's my friend.

831
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:13,141
I, uh, I can't eat him. I'm not
gonna eat him. I can't...

832
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,476
- Oh, yes, you can, Deep.
- No, I'm not gonna...

833
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,730
Timothy is fucking delicious.

834
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,360
He's-he's begging for his life.

835
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,571
He has kids.

836
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,407
He has kids.

837
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,209
Hey, Deep?

838
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:41,294
What?

839
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,171
Eat fucking Timothy.

840
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,237
I'm so sorry.

841
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,581
He's praying. He's praying.

842
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,876
Mmm.

843
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,520
Wasn't that delicious?

844
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:49,612
Come on.

845
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,217
You should have seen him today.

846
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,677
Monsieur Charcutier?

847
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,556
How do you work
for a man like that?

848
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:20,518
You work for him, too.

849
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,813
I'm only here because you are.

850
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:34,323
But let's just leave.

851
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,744
We can go to Marseille.

852
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,663
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

853
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,594
All right, let's have it.

854
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,846
Where the fuck you been all day?

855
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:02,351
I was, uh, detained
by Little Nina.

856
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,313
Who's that?

857
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,191
Little Nina?

858
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:14,405
And what does that Russian slag
want with you?

859
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:15,823
It's a long story.

860
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:17,158
Hang about.

861
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,078
This is a fucking
gold mine, Frenchie.

862
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:25,416
Set up a meeting
with you, me and Little Nina.

863
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,586
No, no, no. This is a very,
is a very bad idea.

864
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,755
No, Frenchie, it's
a very fucking good idea.

865
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,965
Go on. Get on the phone,

866
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:36,844
give her a call right now.

867
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:44,060
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

868
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,938
And what are we doing this for?

869
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,193
'Cause, my son,
we're going to Russia.

870
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,245
- Hey. Do you have a sec?
- Hey. Hey.

871
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:03,788
Yeah, yeah. Come in.

872
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,915
Thanks. Um...

873
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,959
So I went to talk
to the producers,

874
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,086
to tell them that I had
a family emergency

875
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:11,170
and I have to bow out.

876
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:15,341
Good. That's-that's really good.

877
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:19,679
But, uh, you know,
when I got there, I...

878
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:22,306
I told them I was
thrilled to join the team.

879
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:25,518
No. Alex, Alex,
that's-that's a mistake.

880
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:28,479
I was in rehab, would've
killed my mother for some oxy.

881
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:31,899
Manager bailed on me,
Vought, everyone.

882
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:33,693
But you didn't leave.

883
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:38,197
So do you really think
I'm gonna bail on you now?

884
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,408
I'm an asshole,

885
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,618
but I'm not
that much of an asshole.

886
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,039
Are you sure?

887
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:51,711
Someone's got to have your back.

888
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,730
Come on, then.

889
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:14,358
Let's hear it.

890
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:20,615
I'm a fucking monster
for what I done to the kid.

891
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:27,955
No.

892
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:31,083
