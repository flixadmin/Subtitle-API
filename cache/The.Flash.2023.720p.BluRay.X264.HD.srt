1
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:30,052
- Have a brilliant day.
- Yeah, thank you.

2
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:31,383
You too.

3
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:33,932
Morning. What can I get you?

4
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:36,235
- Where's curly-hair lady?
- Sara?

5
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:37,782
She's out sick. Or at least,

6
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,200
- that's what she says.
- Oh.

7
00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:40,835
She's
got a new boyfriend.

8
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,337
What can I get you?

9
00:00:42,362 --> 00:00:45,089
Usually it's my usual and she usually
has it ready because I'm usually late.

10
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,941
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

11
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:49,465
Um, it's a PB and
BRHC on a roll.

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,563
Okay, so...

13
00:00:50,588 --> 00:00:52,985
- "PB" would be peanut butter, I'm assuming?
- Yes.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,534
"BR," bananas, raisins. "H,"
honey. "C," cheese on a roll.

15
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:57,821
Aren't you blessed
with a fast metabolism.

16
00:00:57,865 --> 00:00:59,797
Are you running a
marathon or something?

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,037
You know, my sister ran a
marathon once, God rest her soul.

18
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:05,226
She's not dead.
She's just exhausted.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,781
We get it, Sharon. You ran.

20
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:09,529
But everyone has to
work in the morning.

21
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:11,251
Yeah, I have to go to
work, three minutes ago.

22
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:13,452
And, sorry, I'm in sort of
a rush for the sandwich.

23
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:16,813
You can't rush a
good sandwich, dude.

24
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:22,146
Alfred,
really can't talk.

25
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:23,543
Good morning, Mr. Allen.

26
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:24,844
No, I'm late.

27
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,594
And I'm starving, and
curly-haired girl isn't here

28
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:27,837
and her name is Sara,
and she has a boyfriend.

29
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:30,002
We have a situation
at Gotham General.

30
00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:31,681
A robbery gone wrong.

31
00:01:31,706 --> 00:01:33,621
This is the middle
of the morning.

32
00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:36,127
Why is our bat-friend
even awake?

33
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:37,747
Call Superman.

34
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,559
That was my first thought.

35
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:41,604
Sadly, he's otherwise engaged.

36
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:43,365
- active volcano in Central America.
- Classic.

37
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:44,346
What about Diana?

38
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,704
My other first thought.

39
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,704
Rather annoyingly,
she's not picking up.

40
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,807
How many first thoughts, exactly, did
you have before you first thought of me?

41
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,441
...never about her.

42
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:53,723
- This is about you.
- Hi, sorry. Is my sandwich...

43
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:54,965
I learned my lesson

44
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,243
on the boat last year.

45
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:58,297
Stuff my sister comes out
with when she's drunk.

46
00:01:58,322 --> 00:02:00,493
Personal comments about
my mom's friends as well,

47
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,346
which I think is what
I say about her...

48
00:02:13,157 --> 00:02:14,396
Oh, my God!

49
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,335
Flash!

50
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:18,249
- Hi. Thank you.
- I love you.

51
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:20,251
- You seem very nice also.
- Oh, my God!

52
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:22,210
- No way!
- I think I'm gonna die!

53
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:23,864
Patching you into Mr. Wayne.

54
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,141
No, please don't.

55
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:25,808
Oh, my God.

56
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,227
Sorry if this sounds weird, but are
you actively eating that candy bar?

57
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:31,393
Maybe you could throw it to me?

58
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,308
- In the name of justice.
- Yes, yes.

59
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,310
I need you
here now, Barry.

60
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:37,290
Hi, Bruce. Yes, I'm...

61
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:38,273
coming.

62
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:42,377
No!

63
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,422
No, no!

64
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,475
Bruce, this is a huge mess.

65
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,650
Why aren't you here?

66
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:16,629
Bruce, why does
it sound like you're fleeing the scene?

67
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:20,241
Falcone's idiot kid decided to
try to play in the big leagues.

68
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:23,052
He put a crew together and broke
into the lab at Gotham General.

69
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:25,297
Stole a highly deadly virus.

70
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:28,499
I intercepted them, but
they blasted their way out.

71
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,336
You can handle the
hospital, Barry.

72
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,470
Somebody has to save the rest of
the world, so I was gonna do that.

73
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:33,757
If you don't mind.

74
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,231
Sounds about right, Bruce.

75
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,713
"Thanks for saving me
from the sinkhole, Flash."

76
00:04:57,757 --> 00:04:59,933
Barry, gas and water
pipes ruptured.

77
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:01,500
In the basement.

78
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:02,501
Right.

79
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:04,902
On it.

80
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:18,691
Can you open it?

81
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,388
- I think it's locked.
- It's jammed.

82
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,108
God, it's not working!

83
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,487
Oh, please!

84
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,518
Look, Alfred.
I've come to accept

85
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,459
that I'm essentially the
janitor of the Justice League.

86
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:39,833
Which sucks.

87
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,931
But I've come to accept it.

88
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:43,044
But...

89
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:44,941
I can't help but notice...

90
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,795
that it always seems
to be a bat-mess...

91
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,143
that I'm cleaning up.

92
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:54,030
- Right this way. Eyes forward.
- Yes.

93
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:56,424
- Stay together, now.
- Yeah, I know, right?

94
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:05,694
Look out!

95
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,881
- Wow. Whoa.
- What?

96
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:03,099
If my calculations are correct,

97
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:05,362
and history will prove
they usually are,

98
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:09,932
the foundational damage is about to
cause the collapse of the east wing.

99
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:13,196
- East wing's fine.
- All right, I got you.

100
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,024
Which is good because
my speed is lagging.

101
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,436
Running on empty, Alfred.

102
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,680
Do you hear that?

103
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:19,681
That's my stomach.

104
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:26,601
No, no.

105
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:27,845
It's the collapsing east wing.

106
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,100
Barry, 30th floor.

107
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:48,623
There's a baby...

108
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,626
Shower.

109
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:20,819
Oh!

110
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:22,777
Oh!

111
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:36,573
Mr. Allen,

112
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:39,054
you've made me very proud.

113
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:40,751
And a lot of mothers very happy.

114
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:41,796
Oh!

115
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:48,934
Yeah.

116
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:51,762
Okay.

117
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:55,114
I understand that these events
can be psychologically scarring.

118
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:58,291
You should seek the services of
a mental health professional.

119
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:01,337
The Justice League is not
very good at that part yet.

120
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:02,686
Trust me.

121
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,557
God.

122
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:45,555
Shake him off!

123
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,736
If that briefcase
falls into the water,

124
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,434
it could wipe out half
of Gotham by lunchtime.

125
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:43,265
- Damn it.
- Please don't drop me.

126
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:46,573
Oh, God, no. Please,
please don't.

127
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:47,617
No!

128
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,451
Sorry I'm late.

129
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:02,284
Watch your step.

130
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:04,808
- Hi.
- Hey.

131
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:08,638
Nice suit.

132
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:09,900
Looking good, Flash.

133
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:11,946
Oh, uh... Thank... Uh...

134
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,383
And you...

135
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:15,981
are welcome.

136
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:18,241
My ego's far too big to say
"thank you" to someone else.

137
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,267
Hmm.

138
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,192
I developed this...

139
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:25,903
all-powerful persona to compensate
for my childhood trauma...

140
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:27,538
I, too, have childhood trauma.

141
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:29,333
Batman seems crazy.

142
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:30,933
-The Lasso of Truth...
-Billion dollar. She's the mother...

143
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,896
never gets old.

144
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:36,251
I'd do a lot better just giving all my money away. Yes,
if I really wanted to end crime, I should end poverty.

145
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,130
I know sex exists.

146
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:40,287
I've just never experienced it.

147
00:13:41,494 --> 00:13:42,538
Damn it.

148
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:43,775
Well...

149
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,324
I have to run.

150
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:46,785
Yeah.

151
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,239
Always a pleasure.

152
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:53,064
The sex thing was a metaphor...

153
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:54,927
for gothic literature.

154
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,836
There was just no way
to recover from that.

155
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,599
Just let it go.

156
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:02,057
Well, I'd really love to stay
and clean up more mess...

157
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:04,302
but this little superhero
needs his breakfast.

158
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,155
Goodbye, Flash.

159
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:07,654
Yeah. Bye, Batman.

160
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:10,435
Well done, Mr. Wayne.

161
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,294
Will you be home
for breakfast, sir?

162
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,467
Yes, I think so.

163
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:20,806
The road to destruction.

164
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,964
This was never about her.

165
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:24,508
This is about you.

166
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:27,341
You have to stop
living in the past.

167
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,560
Now, was that fast
enough for you?

168
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:34,951
Morning, professor...

169
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:42,812
Ah, look who's here.

170
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:44,103
Shut up, Albert.

171
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,572
Every day. I don't know
how you do it, Barry.

172
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,260
What'd you, like,
crawl here, bro?

173
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:49,989
- Is he mad?
- Well, you're getting fired.

174
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,861
- You're getting murdered.
- Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:53,235
Let me guess.

176
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,070
Your alarm clock didn't go off.

177
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,011
- No...
- Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock.

178
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,047
Your alarm clock ate your keys.

179
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:03,031
Your keys' grandmother died,
and they need a personal day.

180
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:05,382
- It was none of those things.
- What was it this time, Barry?

181
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,235
It was, um, something else

182
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,001
that was far less outlandish.

183
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:11,264
And I know I missed
the meeting...

184
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,223
but I'd still really like to present
these case files for potential review.

185
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:14,684
I think we rushed these cases.

186
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,624
- We need to reopen them.
- Oh! Rushed?

187
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,726
We got a backlog six months deep,
and you want us to move slower?

188
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,825
You need to focus your motion.

189
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,331
Do the work, close
the case, move on.

190
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,514
You have a lot of
potential, Barry.

191
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:31,368
You shouldn't still be getting
me coffee after all these years.

192
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:34,091
You're right.
That's... That's true.

193
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,169
Go get me a coffee.

194
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:40,964
- Two sugars? Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

195
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:56,200
You're gonna love this.

196
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:58,044
I'm very satisfied with the
ruling in the Johnson case.

197
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:00,646
The evidence our lab analyzed...

198
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:04,114
was more than sufficient
to be conclusive.

199
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,837
- I'm still working that evidence.
- Because of the diligence

200
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:08,951
and hard work and focus...

201
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:11,500
Barry was still working
on that evidence.

202
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,106
Think if it were up to you

203
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,365
that we'd still be scraping
Ted Bundy's molars.

204
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,760
You know what? I'm so happy
you find this all so hilarious,

205
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:22,505
but we are dealing with real
people's lives, people's families.

206
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,706
And I don't think you can
grasp the gravity of that.

207
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:26,429
So, why don't you
leave me alone?

208
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,693
- Barry Allen?
- Iris West.

209
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:30,450
You...

210
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:32,756
know my full name also.

211
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:34,552
Yes, from school.

212
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,729
Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us
you had a friend from school.

213
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,602
- We actually didn't know that Barry had a friend.
- Wow.

214
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,425
Yeah, what
does that make it now?

215
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:41,493
- One?
- One.

216
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,933
You guys are so...

217
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,960
Um, bye, you guys.

218
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,509
Okay. Oh, my God.
That was just...

219
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,106
Um...

220
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,394
They're not really my friends.
They're my work friends.

221
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,688
Do you work here?

222
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,215
Yes, I do.

223
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,067
God, it's been a long time, huh?

224
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,876
Hmm.

225
00:16:57,901 --> 00:17:00,295
I feel like we saw each other...

226
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:02,307
like a few years ago, right?

227
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,830
No, because...

228
00:17:03,873 --> 00:17:06,224
we haven't seen
each other since...

229
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:07,268
college.

230
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:08,574
Ah.

231
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:12,012
Maybe I was just
thinking about you.

232
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:14,232
Well, I'm really
glad I ran into you.

233
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:15,798
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

234
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:18,018
Your father's appeal
is tomorrow, right?

235
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:20,673
Yeah. How...

236
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,327
Sorry, how do you
know about that?

237
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,329
I'm covering it for the paper.

238
00:17:24,372 --> 00:17:25,286
Oh.

239
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,940
How is he holding up?

240
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,153
Um...

241
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:30,877
Are you asking for the paper?

242
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:33,269
- No, I'm asking as a friend.
- Oh.

243
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:36,123
Although I'm sure the public
would want to know as well.

244
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:39,982
Well...

245
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,887
my only official comment
is that my dad is innocent.

246
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:43,870
Right.

247
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,700
I mean, no one...

248
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:48,374
would want to believe that their
father killed their mother.

249
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:51,554
What do you mean, "believe"?
My dad shouldn't be in jail.

250
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:54,060
My mom should be alive. It's
not about what I believe.

251
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:57,250
- It's about what the truth is.
- Right. No, yes, that's...

252
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:58,754
Oh, my God. That's
what I meant.

253
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,700
Right.

254
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:03,310
Sorry, I have no official
comment at this time.

255
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,646
You
have a collect call

256
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:30,411
from the Iron
Heights Penitentiary.

257
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:33,700
- Do you wish to accept?
- Yes.

258
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,567
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Barry.

259
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,551
- How ya doing?
- I'm fine.

260
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,708
- You getting out much?
- Yeah.

261
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,122
Well, no. Uh, no.

262
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:45,472
But I, um, I ran into
an old college friend...

263
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:47,281
Iris West, today.

264
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,351
Didn't you have a
monster crush on her?

265
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:50,942
Well, she have a boyfriend?

266
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:54,623
- Why don't you ask her out?
- Dad, I, um...

267
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:58,652
I had a friend run the old security
camera footage from the store...

268
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:01,245
through this new
program he's developed.

269
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,664
And it's crystal clear now.

270
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:04,820
It's just...

271
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,255
you never look up, Dad.

272
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,286
You can't see your face.

273
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:15,010
So, without new evidence
to support your alibi...

274
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:17,364
we're just gonna need to start
thinking about the next appeal.

275
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,505
No, uh-uh. You need to stop
worrying about your old man.

276
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,983
Do that, you might actually
have time for a girlfriend.

277
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:27,200
But Dad, I don't want...

278
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:28,618
We've done this before.

279
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:30,122
This was a last-ditch effort...

280
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:32,889
and we'll go through
the motions tomorrow.

281
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:35,075
I'm okay, really.

282
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,700
You know, sometimes I even think it's
probably easier for me to be in here

283
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:39,986
than out there...

284
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:42,661
without her.

285
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:46,239
'Cause this way, I can
imagine she's alive...

286
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:48,026
out there living her life.

287
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:52,246
Barry?

288
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:54,522
Barry?

289
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:57,158
You there?

290
00:19:57,183 --> 00:19:58,793
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

291
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:02,343
Hey, remember that sauce
she'd make on Sundays?

292
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,241
The whole house would
smell like basil, tomatoes.

293
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:08,903
And she'd put on my
sweats and start singing.

294
00:20:11,264 --> 00:20:12,918
Yeah, what was that song?

295
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:14,697
I loved that song.

296
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:16,192
Remember that part.

297
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:22,970
It's not fair.

298
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:24,605
What's not fair, Monkey?

299
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:27,034
This question is stupid.

300
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,193
How many calculations can you
think of with an answer of 24?

301
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:31,805
There are a bajillion answers.

302
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,419
How am I supposed
to fit them all?

303
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:36,931
You are right. There are a
bajillion answers to this question.

304
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:39,393
Not every problem
has a solution.

305
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,090
Sometimes you just
have to let go.

306
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:45,567
Give your brain a rest and help
me make the pasta. Come on.

307
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:49,271
No.

308
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:50,297
Henry?

309
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:53,432
I need you to do me a favor.

310
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:55,556
- I don't do favors.
- Okay.

311
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:57,409
Barry needs you
to do him a favor.

312
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:59,708
Oh, Barry! Yeah, anything.

313
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,985
I need another can of tomatoes.

314
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:04,307
You have a can of tomatoes.

315
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:05,716
I need another one.

316
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:07,558
I thought you guys went
to the store this morning.

317
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,642
But I forgot the tomatoes.

318
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:12,575
This looks way more fun.

319
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,602
Let's just let Barry
go to the store.

320
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:16,138
You drive, right, Squirm?

321
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:17,512
- What? No.
- Getting so big.

322
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,626
You can do anything.
Look at ya.

323
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:21,281
You're getting gray, actually.

324
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:23,656
- Green can, not the blue one, okay?
- Got it.

325
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,544
Blue can, not the
green one, right?

326
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:27,745
- No! Green can, not the blue one.
- What?

327
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,750
Oh, God.

328
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,950
She's gonna start singing. Run!

329
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,175
Run, Barry!

330
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:56,565
I love you, Monkey.

331
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,409
I love you more.

332
00:21:58,434 --> 00:21:59,783
I loved you first.

333
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,187
Nora?

334
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:21,994
Barry!

335
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:31,258
Barry! Barry!

336
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:33,219
Call 911 now!

337
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:45,432
Barry?

338
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,546
Barry?

339
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:49,529
Don't worry about tomorrow.

340
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:51,120
We always knew it
was a long shot...

341
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:54,013
Dad?

342
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:58,358
Your call with Iron
Heights Penitentiary has been terminated.

343
00:24:44,564 --> 00:24:46,391
Barry Allen?

344
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:51,510
...evidence our lab...

345
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:53,146
You need to focus your motion.

346
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:54,259
Do the work...

347
00:24:57,137 --> 00:24:58,747
She promised...

348
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:05,659
Now, was that
fast enough for you?

349
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:47,354
So, you're saying
you went back in time?

350
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,802
- Mm-hmm.
- Like in Pozharnov?

351
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:51,349
Yeah, like in
Pozharnov, except, but Pozharnov was a second.

352
00:25:51,374 --> 00:25:52,854
This time I went
back a whole day.

353
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:54,239
So, let's imagine...

354
00:25:54,264 --> 00:25:57,184
that it is, in fact,
possible for you to run...

355
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:58,733
faster than the
speed of light...

356
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,978
and in so doing,
travel back in time.

357
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:03,464
It still would be...

358
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:05,753
wildly irresponsible.

359
00:26:05,778 --> 00:26:07,067
I knew you were gonna say this.

360
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:09,614
Yes, because, Barry, if you
were to go into the past,

361
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:12,467
any interaction you have with
your parents or yourself,

362
00:26:12,492 --> 00:26:14,091
you step on the
wrong blade of grass,

363
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,907
you have no idea what the
consequences to that could be.

364
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:18,934
No, I know. The
butterfly effect, right?

365
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,005
- Yes.
- I get it. But Bruce...

366
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,553
I could fix things.

367
00:26:22,578 --> 00:26:25,685
You could also
destroy everything.

368
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:28,060
I could save her.

369
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:30,771
I could save both of them. I...

370
00:26:32,688 --> 00:26:33,863
I could save your parents.

371
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,859
Barry, these scars we have...

372
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:40,103
make us who we are.

373
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:43,827
We're not meant to
go back and fix them.

374
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,899
And there's nothing broken with
you that needs to be fixed.

375
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:51,666
Take it from an old guy
who's made a lot of mistakes.

376
00:26:52,592 --> 00:26:53,811
Don't live your past.

377
00:26:55,203 --> 00:26:56,739
Live your life.

378
00:26:56,842 --> 00:26:59,364
Don't let your
tragedy define you.

379
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:01,356
What if it's supposed
to define me?

380
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:04,755
Your tragedy made you a hero.

381
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:07,358
And also made me alone.

382
00:27:10,022 --> 00:27:12,111
We could hang out.

383
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:13,615
I mean, do you wanna get a bite?

384
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,555
Like, I'm still hungry.

385
00:27:17,443 --> 00:27:18,444
Not this time.

386
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,447
Maybe some other time.

387
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:24,972
Yeah.

388
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:37,028
Nice ride.

389
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:39,677
You have fancy friends.

390
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:41,597
Yeah, it was an Uber.

391
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,466
Exec.

392
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:45,950
Look, Iris, I really can't
talk about the case at all.

393
00:27:45,975 --> 00:27:48,452
I'm not here as a reporter.

394
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:51,457
Can we talk?

395
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:58,397
Come on in.

396
00:28:03,671 --> 00:28:06,848
I'm not gonna lie. It's a lot
tidier in here than I expected.

397
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:09,005
- Yeah? Yeah, well, um...
- Yeah.

398
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,966
I'm a pretty tidy person.

399
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:17,990
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Sure.

400
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:19,113
I'll take a beer.

401
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:22,013
Hmm.

402
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,762
Beers, beers, beers.

403
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,468
I keep 'em in my fridge.

404
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:38,364
Thanks.

405
00:28:39,003 --> 00:28:40,004
Sure.

406
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:43,894
Look, I feel really bad

407
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,181
about earlier.

408
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:52,778
I should've been more sensitive.

409
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:56,851
And, um, I probably could've
been less sensitive.

410
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:59,685
I mean, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

411
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:02,722
It's like you lost both
parents in one day.

412
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:04,619
I did.

413
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:06,349
I lost my mom to a tragedy,

414
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:09,420
and I lost my dad to the
failures of the justice system.

415
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:12,590
Is that why you got
into criminal forensics?

416
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,130
To try and fix the system?

417
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:18,692
Yeah.

418
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:20,239
Yeah, to fix it.

419
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,746
There's gotta be a
way to fix it, right?

420
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:26,469
I mean, that's kinda why I
got into journalism, too.

421
00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:28,677
I could make it right if I
could just go back somehow

422
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:31,861
and warn them without them
knowing that I'd warned them.

423
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:34,149
I... thinking like that's
gonna...

424
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:35,871
drive you crazy.

425
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,647
"If I could just
go back in time...

426
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:38,888
and stop the guy
who did it." It's...

427
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:41,329
No, I can't do that, 'cause
that's way too much interaction.

428
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:45,595
My dad wasn't even at home.

429
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,057
My mom sent him to go
get a can of tomatoes.

430
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:50,415
I think whoever broke into the
house thought it was empty.

431
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:52,618
And then my mom was in there
with the knife in her hand

432
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:55,133
and things went bad,
just this absurd

433
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:56,442
chain of events.

434
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:59,841
And it's like, this footage should've
finally supported my dad's alibi.

435
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,200
But instead...

436
00:30:01,225 --> 00:30:04,239
three lives ruined
for a can of tomatoes.

437
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:11,807
Oh, my God.

438
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:13,283
What?

439
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,396
Well, that could be it.

440
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:18,138
If my mom doesn't forget the
tomatoes in the first place,

441
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:20,426
then he never leaves
and she never dies.

442
00:30:20,564 --> 00:30:23,262
No one would even
have to see me.

443
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,873
Bruce said no interaction.
This is no interaction.

444
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:26,294
This is just quick
in, quick out,

445
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,961
back to the present, like
I was never even there.

446
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,770
That's how I fix it.
Oh, my God, Iris.

447
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:31,333
- Hmm?
- Thank you, so much.

448
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:32,707
- This has been great.
- Oh.

449
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:34,586
Um... I'm sorry.

450
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:37,255
I... I have to leave.

451
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,495
Okay. Right.

452
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,896
Uh...

453
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:43,575
I had a really great time, by
the way. We should do this again.

454
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:01,320
Kal-El,
son of Krypton.

455
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:03,103
This is a bad idea.

456
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:10,893
So, you're fast.

457
00:31:14,636 --> 00:31:17,030
Your dad's a murderer.
Your dad's a murderer.

458
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:23,080
Call 911 now!

459
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:25,110
Now!

460
00:31:26,158 --> 00:31:27,768
Now!

461
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:29,055
Now!

462
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:22,269
Hi, Mom.

463
00:32:35,282 --> 00:32:36,718
Don't forget the tomatoes.

464
00:32:39,286 --> 00:32:40,287
See you soon.

465
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,997
Please work.

466
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:02,788
Happy Birthday, Barry.

467
00:33:08,992 --> 00:33:11,516
- Go, Barry, hurry up.
- Go!

468
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:14,848
Congratulations
to the class of 2013!

469
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:21,233
I love you so much.

470
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,221
Monkey!

471
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:29,286
What are you wearing?

472
00:34:29,353 --> 00:34:32,312
Is that
Barry? And he's early?

473
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:34,099
What universe is this?

474
00:34:34,124 --> 00:34:36,039
You've cut your hair.

475
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,719
Now you can see your eyes.

476
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,481
- You look terrible.
- Henry!

477
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:42,167
- You look old.
- You look beautiful, baby.

478
00:34:42,191 --> 00:34:43,976
What are they doing
to you over there?

479
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,308
Leave him alone. He's perfect.

480
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:49,053
Come here.

481
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:52,827
I love you so much.

482
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:54,854
I love you, too.

483
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,006
I love you more.

484
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:58,044
I loved you first.

485
00:34:58,303 --> 00:34:59,956
Go take a shower and change.

486
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,560
You smell like a
boot. Go, go, go.

487
00:35:05,214 --> 00:35:06,872
"Old," seriously?

488
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,551
Well, no, I mean like mature.

489
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,534
He's at that age, he
wants to look old.

490
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:12,927
He, you know, gets
into bars that way.

491
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:14,685
How can I help?

492
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:22,971
Mm. Hey, Mom,
how was your day?

493
00:35:23,015 --> 00:35:25,017
How was your month,
or your last 18 years?

494
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,453
Or that's a weird question...

495
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:28,020
'cause I was here.

496
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,762
But obviously, we share
those memories together.

497
00:35:30,805 --> 00:35:32,609
Or I don't know, maybe we
could make some new memories.

498
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,473
Like we could go to the
aquarium, or the circus,

499
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:36,376
or to the park and you
could push me on a swing.

500
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,335
That's also weird
because I'm an adult now,

501
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:40,511
so I'd probably motivate
my own motion on a swing.

502
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,497
So, how was it this
week? How's school?

503
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:47,256
At school was... is good.

504
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,867
- Mm.
- School's been great.

505
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,652
I've just been working
really hard there on my...

506
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:52,880
studies.

507
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,534
Did you ask out
that girl from econ?

508
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:57,223
I know freshman year is about

509
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:59,804
going out, meeting people, okay?

510
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:00,917
Exploring things.

511
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:03,154
Experimenting.

512
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:07,254
But you have
to be very careful.

513
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:08,408
Oh, shit.

514
00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:11,607
I... have to shit.

515
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:14,327
Outside.

516
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,244
Help!

517
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:23,836
Shh! Why are you here?

518
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:24,785
What year is it?

519
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:28,080
- No, no, no.
- Help!

520
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:35,435
That's my face.

521
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:37,427
You stole my face.

522
00:36:37,452 --> 00:36:39,396
Think I'm having a
mushroom flashback?

523
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:41,310
- Is that a thing?
- How old are you?

524
00:36:42,427 --> 00:36:43,748
Eighteen.

525
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:54,234
Whoa.

526
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:56,674
This is mad trippy.

527
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,240
So, we're, like, in the future.

528
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:00,765
No, wait. This is
not trippy, dude.

529
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:04,943
This is catastrophic. And no, we're not in the
future. I was supposed to be back in the present,

530
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:06,107
but I'm still in the past.

531
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,146
And there's not supposed
to be two of me.

532
00:37:08,202 --> 00:37:10,397
You and I are not supposed to be
occupying the same reality at all,

533
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:12,115
let alone interacting.

534
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,536
I just can't believe I'm a
superhero who time travels...

535
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:17,583
No, no, no. You
are not anything.

536
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:20,438
Which is good. You don't want
to be a superhero. It's scary.

537
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:23,902
And I get bug splatter
in my teeth all the time.

538
00:37:24,353 --> 00:37:25,703
Awesome.

539
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,487
Hey, do the thing again.

540
00:37:27,531 --> 00:37:28,724
No, we don't have time.

541
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:32,753
- Mom!
- Shh!

542
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:34,517
What are you doing?
You're gonna tattle now?

543
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:37,138
- Do the thing.
- Fine.

544
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,112
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Happy?

545
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:45,157
Now undo it.

546
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:02,688
I can't, I can't.

547
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:04,737
Ow.

548
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:07,286
Barry, are
you okay up there?

549
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,914
We're fine! I'm fine!

550
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:10,550
Okay, Monkey.

551
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:13,230
So, do you have like a
plane that goes underwater?

552
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:15,867
Or like a boat that can fly?

553
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:17,067
How old are you, like 40?

554
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:19,137
Okay, you don't stop talking.

555
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:22,252
It's not charming. It's
abrasive and exhausting.

556
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:25,193
And, oh, my God. I am starting
to realize what people mean.

557
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:26,599
Just...

558
00:38:26,624 --> 00:38:28,068
do me a favor

559
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:31,701
and promise me that meeting me
isn't gonna screw up space-time.

560
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,292
Broski...

561
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:35,130
I got you.

562
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,505
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

563
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:37,699
What do you mean?

564
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:40,038
What do I do?

565
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,740
I could drug you.

566
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:44,071
Yeah, I could drug you,

567
00:38:44,096 --> 00:38:45,509
and then you'd pass
out, you'd wake up

568
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:47,021
and you'd forget that
anything ever happened.

569
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:48,668
And it wouldn't be wrong,
right? Because you're me.

570
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,388
No! I mean, we shouldn't.

571
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,765
- Please don't... drug me.
- No.

572
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,594
No. Because here's the thing,
and I thought about it before.

573
00:38:54,618 --> 00:38:56,141
I don't want to be drugged.

574
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:59,231
But I'm sure we can
think of another way.

575
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:00,711
Let's put on our
Barry thinking caps

576
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:02,713
and think of a
different solution

577
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,192
for memory loss.

578
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:06,151
Also, I'm a green belt...

579
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,631
in the capoeira,

580
00:39:07,674 --> 00:39:09,720
and I have extensively
studied wrestler,

581
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:12,461
and I could just go
frickin' lunatic on you.

582
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:13,700
Besides, I have
a date tonight...

583
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:18,729
Okay.

584
00:39:18,772 --> 00:39:20,837
How hard do you have to hit
someone to make them forget stuff?

585
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,560
If I hit you in the past,
will it hurt me in the future?

586
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:25,387
Wait. You say you
have a date tonight?

587
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,085
Yeah. Wait, what
were you doing?

588
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:29,043
Uh, nothing. Who's
your date with?

589
00:39:29,087 --> 00:39:32,090
This super babe
in my econ class.

590
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,328
- Iris West?
- Oh, my God!

591
00:39:34,353 --> 00:39:35,659
Do we marry her?

592
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:37,381
You're going on a
date with her tonight?

593
00:39:37,406 --> 00:39:39,004
That's why I need
Mom to do my laundry.

594
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:40,901
You don't even do
your own laundry?

595
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:41,839
Do you?

596
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,076
Okay.

597
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,191
- I'm actually gonna go.
- What do you mean?

598
00:39:46,234 --> 00:39:48,019
Enjoy your life. Do you.

599
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:50,195
Change literally nothing.

600
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:52,565
- Um, I'll see you again never.
- I have a few more questions, though.

601
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:54,503
We have so much to
learn from each other.

602
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:56,897
Oh, great.

603
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:58,377
Well, you're leaving me.

604
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,335
And now the storm's
gonna ruin my date.

605
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:02,511
What day is it today?

606
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:06,254
Uh... Uh...

607
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:08,300
Sunday?

608
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:09,301
No, the date.

609
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,037
It's September 29th.

610
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:14,828
Shit.

611
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:18,571
This storm, this is the day.

612
00:40:18,615 --> 00:40:21,008
- What day?
- The day I got my powers.

613
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,228
The day you get your powers.

614
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:25,970
- Powers?
- Listen...

615
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:27,773
I can't tell you why I
traveled back in time,

616
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:30,409
and I can't tell
you what I changed.

617
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:33,020
But, essentially, in
my version of reality,

618
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,153
I ended up interning at
the Central City Crime Lab

619
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:37,851
in my freshman year, and
that's where it happened.

620
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,380
Well, happens.

621
00:40:39,405 --> 00:40:42,421
Tonight, September 29, the
accident that gives me my powers.

622
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:44,075
And if you're not there...

623
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,077
in 30 minutes...

624
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:49,210
then you won't get the powers.

625
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:52,039
Which means I don't
get the powers, maybe?

626
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,086
And then, that would
mean that I lose my way

627
00:40:55,129 --> 00:40:57,088
of getting back in time
in the first place,

628
00:40:57,131 --> 00:40:59,177
and then I literally have
no idea what happens.

629
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,179
Powers?

630
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:06,706
Wait, but what about
our date tonight?

631
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,578
She might be our future wife.

632
00:41:09,622 --> 00:41:12,451
There might not be a future...

633
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:14,279
if you don't come with me...

634
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:15,410
right now.

635
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:23,720
Eight minutes.

636
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:25,680
How are we gonna to get
inside? What are you doing?

637
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:27,031
Would you stop whining?

638
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:29,555
This is gonna feel kinda weird.

639
00:41:53,274 --> 00:41:54,711
We walk through the door.

640
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:57,950
Yes, it's okay.
It's called phasing.

641
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:59,063
Come on.

642
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,197
I love phasing.

643
00:42:06,244 --> 00:42:07,071
Uh-huh.

644
00:42:08,463 --> 00:42:10,465
Everybody moves.

645
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:36,317
Well... this is it.

646
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:38,406
This is where I was sitting.

647
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,713
And actually, let me
take this for you.

648
00:42:40,757 --> 00:42:42,062
Thank you.

649
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:44,521
Okay, I had just
opened those windows...

650
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:48,068
to clear out the fumes.

651
00:42:49,115 --> 00:42:50,331
Right around now.

652
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,290
And I was sitting in that chair,

653
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,133
and I was right under
this shelf of chemicals.

654
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:56,163
And that's when
the lightning hits.

655
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:57,469
Wait.

656
00:42:57,512 --> 00:42:59,012
- I get hit by lightning?
- No, no, no.

657
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:00,559
You don't get hit by lightning.

658
00:43:00,602 --> 00:43:01,928
Okay, 'cause for a second
I thought you said...

659
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:03,312
The lightning hits
the chemicals...

660
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:04,955
which then you get bathed in,

661
00:43:04,998 --> 00:43:06,913
- and that's what electrocutes you.
- Okay,

662
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,761
- but I don't want to be electrocuted, though.
- Sit down.

663
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:10,917
- No, you sit down.
- I already have the powers!

664
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,067
You already have the powers!

665
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,021
Exactly!

666
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:15,341
I am not getting
struck by lightning!

667
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:55,919
It worked.

668
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,059
It looks like you lost a tooth.

669
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:11,456
Oh.

670
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,285
- No?
- You lost a tooth.

671
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,820
All right. We gotta go.

672
00:44:31,563 --> 00:44:33,173
What have we got?

673
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:34,914
The alarms
in the sterile lab.

674
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,310
Go check it.

675
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:42,232
Securing the entrance.

676
00:44:45,762 --> 00:44:47,068
We've gotta phase.

677
00:44:47,093 --> 00:44:48,529
Phase, phasing.

678
00:45:11,385 --> 00:45:13,257
Oh...

679
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,279
Shit!

680
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:41,111
I'm slow.

681
00:45:42,503 --> 00:45:44,418
Oh. Oh.

682
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,990
Why is your
place so much nicer

683
00:45:51,034 --> 00:45:53,055
- than I expected it to be?
- You like it?

684
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,081
Mom had to help decorate.

685
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:56,300
You know Mom.

686
00:45:56,343 --> 00:45:58,824
Right, yeah. Classic Mom.

687
00:45:58,867 --> 00:45:59,896
Classic Mom.

688
00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:03,742
Hmm.

689
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,965
- What a day.
- Barry,

690
00:46:09,008 --> 00:46:10,357
the accident gave you powers,

691
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,011
but took mine away.

692
00:46:12,055 --> 00:46:14,144
So, I don't know how I get back.

693
00:46:14,187 --> 00:46:15,580
Without access to
the Speed Force,

694
00:46:15,623 --> 00:46:18,235
I don't know how I ever leave.

695
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,411
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

696
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:22,543
- I might be stuck.
- Wait.

697
00:46:23,936 --> 00:46:25,232
I have powers now?

698
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:27,331
Yeah, but...

699
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:28,927
you... No, no, no.

700
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:44,478
Holy speedballs.

701
00:46:44,522 --> 00:46:46,741
Okay, I know this is
incredibly exciting,

702
00:46:46,785 --> 00:46:48,047
because I went through it.

703
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:49,353
Speedy Gonzales!

704
00:46:49,396 --> 00:46:51,529
Yes, I've done it
many times myself.

705
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:53,487
You can't just start...

706
00:46:54,532 --> 00:46:56,055
Shit.

707
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:33,484
Oh, my...

708
00:47:45,148 --> 00:47:46,105
Ahh!

709
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:09,563
Okay, I'm leaving!

710
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,401
Put your hands up.

711
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:38,592
What did you do?

712
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:40,507
Nothing. Why?

713
00:48:46,644 --> 00:48:47,669
Barry...

714
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:50,026
I could've told you about
the clothes. It's friction.

715
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:52,203
You run too fast, and regular
fabrics are gonna burn up.

716
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:55,316
It's the same reason why you can't
move people very far at hyperspeed.

717
00:48:55,341 --> 00:48:57,151
That broccoli looks rotten.

718
00:48:57,176 --> 00:48:58,656
Look, some things you can move.

719
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:00,310
Like, you can move,

720
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:02,852
for instance, a microwave.

721
00:49:02,877 --> 00:49:05,141
But you can't move
something like, say...

722
00:49:05,184 --> 00:49:06,437
- a baby.
- Barry,

723
00:49:06,462 --> 00:49:08,249
it's like I've never
eaten anything before.

724
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:11,973
Everything has this vivid
flavor. Try a little.

725
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:13,845
Just take a little bite.

726
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:14,924
That's bad, isn't it?

727
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:16,862
Yeah, this is not
good. No, I was kidding.

728
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,825
I'm amazing. We're amazing.

729
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,112
I'm so hungry.

730
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,594
Hey, wait.

731
00:49:23,637 --> 00:49:25,683
I wanna try that phasing
thing. How do I do that?

732
00:49:25,726 --> 00:49:27,772
You don't. Not yet.

733
00:49:27,815 --> 00:49:29,581
Okay? It's very complicated.

734
00:49:29,691 --> 00:49:32,172
Takes a long time to train your
body to be able to speed up

735
00:49:32,197 --> 00:49:34,175
whilst your molecules slow
down enough to pass through

736
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,158
the molecular structure
of solid objects...

737
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:40,611
Get out of here!

738
00:49:47,357 --> 00:49:49,794
You've gotta start letting
me finish my sentences.

739
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:52,797
Are we always this sleepy?

740
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,234
And hungry and naked?

741
00:49:55,278 --> 00:49:57,073
Well, the first two, yes.

742
00:49:57,098 --> 00:49:59,630
The third one, no. I've
figured that part out.

743
00:49:59,673 --> 00:50:01,327
And honestly, if
we're gonna do this

744
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:03,329
there's a lot I'm gonna
have to explain to you.

745
00:50:03,373 --> 00:50:05,810
So, a good place
to start, I guess,

746
00:50:05,853 --> 00:50:08,595
is that, yeah, the original suit

747
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,799
was actually made out of this polysynth...

748
00:50:11,729 --> 00:50:13,121
Or we'll

749
00:50:13,165 --> 00:50:15,036
pick this up tomorrow.

750
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,710
So, the
suit is inside the ring?

751
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:18,779
- Yeah.
- What?

752
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:21,073
And I can have this?

753
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:23,262
No, you can't have
it. You can borrow it

754
00:50:23,306 --> 00:50:25,090
so you don't kill yourself
using your powers.

755
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:28,448
You're gonna push this button

756
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:30,202
and the silk molecules are gonna
uncoil, absorbing atmospheric gases

757
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:31,966
and expanding the
suit to full size.

758
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:33,185
Ready?

759
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,745
It was so tiny...

760
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,835
You're supposed to put it
on before it hits the floor.

761
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:56,904
What, like change...

762
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:58,558
right here in front of you?

763
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:00,406
There's no one even here
anyway, Barry. Come on...

764
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,651
- Whoo, man.
- Tight.

765
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:05,870
It hurts.

766
00:51:05,913 --> 00:51:07,393
You know where it hurts?

767
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:09,743
- In my dick.
- Okay. I know, I know,

768
00:51:09,787 --> 00:51:11,441
but I don't need to know.

769
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:13,573
- Sorry, can we move on?
- Mm-hmm.

770
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,271
Here's what I'm thinking.

771
00:51:15,314 --> 00:51:17,273
If I can train you
to move like I do,

772
00:51:17,316 --> 00:51:18,685
then we can re-create
the Chronobowl.

773
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:19,710
Chronobowl?

774
00:51:19,753 --> 00:51:20,711
In the Speed Force.

775
00:51:20,754 --> 00:51:22,088
Speed Force?

776
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:26,170
-And then maybe we can find some way to get me back to the future.
-Back to the Future. Yes!

777
00:51:26,194 --> 00:51:27,631
Eric Stoltz

778
00:51:27,674 --> 00:51:30,042
is chur boy in that movie.

779
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:32,132
What an embodied performance.

780
00:51:32,157 --> 00:51:33,985
You mean Michael J. Fox?

781
00:51:34,028 --> 00:51:35,338
Back to the Future?

782
00:51:35,363 --> 00:51:38,403
- Yeah, in the movie Back to the Future?
- Oh, my God!

783
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:42,831
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

784
00:51:50,044 --> 00:51:51,364
You need to take
the suit off now.

785
00:51:51,394 --> 00:51:52,914
Thank God.

786
00:51:58,444 --> 00:52:00,379
...reported
seeing a mysterious object

787
00:52:00,403 --> 00:52:02,970
hovering above the
Australian seaboard.

788
00:52:03,014 --> 00:52:05,190
- We've obtained footage from the sighting...
- Zod.

789
00:52:05,233 --> 00:52:07,342
- and as you can see, the object...
- "Zod"?

790
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:10,456
- appears to be a flying ship of some sort.
- What's a zod?

791
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,763
According to US
government officials,

792
00:52:12,806 --> 00:52:13,885
satellite data

793
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,413
has confirmed the
presence of a spacecraft.

794
00:52:16,438 --> 00:52:18,310
We'll be sure...

795
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:23,469
My name is General Zod.

796
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,951
I come from a world

797
00:52:26,994 --> 00:52:28,822
far from yours.

798
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:31,390
For some time, your world

799
00:52:31,434 --> 00:52:35,133
- has sheltered one of my citizens.
- No, no, no.

800
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:37,582
- This can't be happening.
- I request that you return this individual...

801
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:39,391
- Not now.
- To my custody.

802
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,635
What's happening?

803
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,139
For reasons unknown...

804
00:52:43,164 --> 00:52:44,838
Zod's looking for Superman.

805
00:52:44,882 --> 00:52:46,318
What's a superman?

806
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:50,429
Superman is an
alien who lives on Earth.

807
00:52:50,453 --> 00:52:52,455
I'm assuming still incognito.

808
00:52:52,498 --> 00:52:55,545
But, yeah, he's an alien,
and he's very powerful,

809
00:52:55,588 --> 00:52:57,329
and he's just the best.

810
00:52:57,373 --> 00:53:00,593
And then Zod is an alien
from the same planet,

811
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:02,035
also very powerful,

812
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,553
but he's just the worst.

813
00:53:03,596 --> 00:53:06,425
And Zod came here to find Clark.

814
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:09,385
- Wait, who's Clark?
- Clark is Superman.

815
00:53:09,428 --> 00:53:11,474
- Oh. Okay.
- But then

816
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:14,912
Zod also tried to terraform the
planet with this World Engine thing,

817
00:53:14,955 --> 00:53:16,522
and Superman stopped
him eventually,

818
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:19,569
but not before Zod killed
thousands of people.

819
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:20,808
- Yeesh.
- And at the time,

820
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,676
there was nothing
I could do, I've...

821
00:53:27,228 --> 00:53:28,752
Wait, you...

822
00:53:28,795 --> 00:53:30,152
You were there?

823
00:53:31,232 --> 00:53:33,583
Yeah, I had just
gotten my powers.

824
00:53:36,237 --> 00:53:38,588
And I was still putting some
finishing touches on my suit.

825
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,121
This thing, Zod's World Engine,

826
00:53:44,146 --> 00:53:46,944
it started destroying
Metropolis, so I just went there

827
00:53:46,987 --> 00:53:49,599
and I started trying
to save people.

828
00:53:50,556 --> 00:53:51,427
Daddy?

829
00:53:52,906 --> 00:53:53,951
Listen to me!

830
00:53:53,994 --> 00:53:55,605
Run away!

831
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:56,519
Run away!

832
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,092
There was
this kid, and I...

833
00:54:05,136 --> 00:54:06,957
I got him, but then...

834
00:54:06,982 --> 00:54:08,705
I couldn't get his dad.

835
00:54:09,532 --> 00:54:11,447
Daddy!

836
00:54:28,551 --> 00:54:29,639
It was all I could do,

837
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:30,901
save that one kid.

838
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,774
Only Superman could stop Zod.

839
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:38,822
But not in time to
save those people.

840
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:40,519
And now it's about
to happen again.

841
00:54:41,085 --> 00:54:42,521
But...

842
00:54:42,565 --> 00:54:44,784
if I can find the
entire Justice League,

843
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:46,917
Superman and the
rest of the band...

844
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,277
Right.

845
00:54:48,302 --> 00:54:50,157
Then maybe I can
prevent the whole thing

846
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:51,922
from ever even happening at all.

847
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:57,536
- Um, give me your laptop.
- Okay.

848
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,842
What is that smell?

849
00:54:58,885 --> 00:55:00,644
Ugh. Could be anything.

850
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:02,613
Honestly.

851
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:04,902
Who's that?

852
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,365
Oh. That's Gary. That's
the smell. It's...

853
00:55:07,453 --> 00:55:09,472
Don't worry. He's breezy.

854
00:55:11,285 --> 00:55:12,543
We can do this.

855
00:55:12,568 --> 00:55:15,324
Uh, let's see, Victor Stone,
Gotham City University.

856
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:20,061
Oh, this is my roommate, Patty.

857
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,022
Patty...

858
00:55:21,047 --> 00:55:22,353
is your roommate?

859
00:55:22,378 --> 00:55:24,990
And that's her
boyfriend, Albert.

860
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:26,478
What's up?

861
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:28,306
Good morning.

862
00:55:29,525 --> 00:55:32,279
Oh, sorry. And, uh, guys...

863
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:34,427
This is my cousin.

864
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:36,096
Barry.

865
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:39,273
Whoa.

866
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:42,924
I'm starving.

867
00:55:46,803 --> 00:55:48,130
Okay.

868
00:55:48,155 --> 00:55:49,781
Victor Stone, Gotham
City University.

869
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:51,634
Yes. Here he is.

870
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:53,748
Victor Stone, star
quarterback for the Knight...

871
00:55:53,773 --> 00:55:55,122
Shit, okay.

872
00:55:55,202 --> 00:55:56,595
He's not Cyborg yet.

873
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:59,119
Wonder Woman.

874
00:55:59,163 --> 00:56:00,468
Wonder Woman!

875
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:03,036
Las Vegas residency.

876
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,604
Illusions, juggling, and zebras.

877
00:56:05,648 --> 00:56:08,041
No. That is not Diana.

878
00:56:08,085 --> 00:56:09,956
- Aquaman.
- Aquaman?

879
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,610
Is that like a super mermaid?

880
00:56:11,654 --> 00:56:12,959
No, Albert,

881
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,570
he's not a super mermaid.

882
00:56:14,613 --> 00:56:16,833
Okay? He's half
Atlantean, half human

883
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:19,749
with superhuman strength who can
control marine life with his mind.

884
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:20,987
So, like a super
mermaid?

885
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,161
No, Albert!

886
00:56:22,186 --> 00:56:24,101
That is
what you described.

887
00:56:24,144 --> 00:56:25,972
We'll just
try Arthur Curry...

888
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:27,321
Maine...

889
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:30,150
lighthouse.

890
00:56:31,674 --> 00:56:33,850
Here we are. Thomas
Curry. That's his dad.

891
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:34,786
Uh, phone.

892
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,810
Hello.

893
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:39,856
- Hello, Thomas Curry?
- Yes.

894
00:56:39,899 --> 00:56:41,466
Could I speak to Arthur?

895
00:56:41,509 --> 00:56:42,859
Is Arthur around?

896
00:56:42,902 --> 00:56:44,904
You wanna speak to my dog?

897
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:48,168
What? No, no. Um, sorry. Uh...

898
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:50,257
- Is this Thomas Curry?
- Yes.

899
00:56:50,301 --> 00:56:53,043
- And you work at a lighthouse?
- Yes.

900
00:56:53,086 --> 00:56:55,262
Okay, and your wife is
the queen of Atlantis?

901
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:57,587
- Will you accept this rose?
- Yes.

902
00:56:58,614 --> 00:57:00,137
Uh, no.

903
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,921
Uh, right, but maybe, maybe...

904
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:04,489
um, a fishlike woman

905
00:57:04,532 --> 00:57:06,779
washed into your life

906
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:08,972
- at some point or another?
- Very funny, asshole.

907
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:14,194
Arthur Curry was never born.

908
00:57:14,238 --> 00:57:16,022
- What?
- This is a disaster.

909
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:17,720
I-I-I completely
destroyed history.

910
00:57:17,763 --> 00:57:19,286
Like Eric Stoltz.

911
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:20,873
Okay, why do you keep
saying, "Eric Stoltz"?

912
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:22,333
Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

913
00:57:22,376 --> 00:57:23,726
- What?
- Time travel?

914
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:26,076
Oh. We talking "BTTF"?

915
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:27,251
Come on, who is this guy?

916
00:57:27,294 --> 00:57:28,731
Okay, yeah, no, I know.

917
00:57:28,774 --> 00:57:30,558
I've seen all of them

918
00:57:30,602 --> 00:57:33,126
and Eric Stoltz is
not Marty McFly.

919
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:33,997
Really?

920
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:37,696
Then explain Marty McThigh here.

921
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,219
I can't explain
that to you, Gary.

922
00:57:39,263 --> 00:57:41,004
That's not your thigh.

923
00:57:41,047 --> 00:57:43,560
It's the wrong actor,
and it's upside down.

924
00:57:44,877 --> 00:57:46,444
Is it?

925
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:50,448
The point is that

926
00:57:50,491 --> 00:57:52,102
in Back to the Future

927
00:57:52,145 --> 00:57:55,583
Marty McFly is very famously
played by Michael J. Fox.

928
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:56,889
The guy from Footloose?

929
00:57:56,933 --> 00:57:58,630
No, that's Kevin Bacon!

930
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:00,458
- Bacon.
- Kevin Bacon's Maverick

931
00:58:00,501 --> 00:58:02,131
with the volleyball, the
gay guys, and the planes?

932
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:04,070
-Top Gun.

933
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,072
- Top Gun, right?
- No, no, no.

934
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:08,161
I completely broke the universe.

935
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:12,383
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

936
00:58:12,426 --> 00:58:14,472
- Yes.
- Thank you.

937
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:17,954
I created a world
with no metahumans.

938
00:58:17,997 --> 00:58:20,304
And now there's no one to
defend us from Zod. Albert!

939
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:24,395
There's no Cyborg.

940
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:26,310
There's no Aquaman.
There's no Wonder Woman.

941
00:58:26,353 --> 00:58:28,181
There's no Superman.

942
00:58:28,225 --> 00:58:29,443
There's no Batman.

943
00:58:29,487 --> 00:58:30,575
I'm Batman.

944
00:58:32,795 --> 00:58:35,667
What, you... What
did you just say?

945
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:37,756
I'm Batman.

946
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,412
Batman exists?

947
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:42,650
- Hundo p.
- Yeah, dude.

948
00:58:42,674 --> 00:58:44,415
Nobody knows who he really is,

949
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:46,983
- but he exists.
- Right.

950
00:58:47,026 --> 00:58:48,680
Well, uh, we...

951
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:50,377
my cousin Barry and I,

952
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:53,076
have to go to that
cousin's dinner.

953
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,817
Now.

954
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,775
But it was a pleasure to meet

955
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:58,646
you all.

956
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,127
- And Gary.
- Barry.

957
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:02,476
- Barry.
- Gary.

958
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,521
Barry!

959
00:59:23,323 --> 00:59:25,543
What, are you frickin'
kidding me with this place?

960
00:59:29,547 --> 00:59:31,375
What is this, hell?

961
00:59:40,471 --> 00:59:41,733
It's open.

962
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:56,669
- Look at all this cool shit!
- Okay, Barry, don't touch anything in here.

963
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:02,667
Hello?

964
01:00:03,842 --> 01:00:05,365
Bruce?

965
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:08,357
Bruce, are you there?

966
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:11,545
Oh, boy.

967
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:16,752
Hey, I didn't
know you painted.

968
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:17,943
They're good.

969
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,294
Bruce Wayne?

970
01:00:34,307 --> 01:00:35,221
Bruce?

971
01:00:44,883 --> 01:00:46,426
Hey, check
this out. There's, like,

972
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,278
bells connected to every
room in this house.

973
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:49,975
Hey, maybe we can
find this Bruce guy...

974
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:52,282
if we just ring all
these bells, right?

975
01:00:52,307 --> 01:00:55,183
You don't understand how servant
bells work? Those are all the bells.

976
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:57,645
- You ring them from all the other places.
- What?

977
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,759
You don't have, like, Downton
Abbeyin your universe?

978
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:01,465
Downtown Abbey's?

979
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:03,510
The chain of, like,
family-style restaurants?

980
01:01:03,554 --> 01:01:05,904
They're like, it's like
cheaper Bananabee's.

981
01:01:05,948 --> 01:01:08,602
Oh, you know what I'd
really go for right now?

982
01:01:08,646 --> 01:01:11,083
Abbey's sizzlin'
zucchini squares.

983
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,134
Okay.

984
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:42,767
You know what, man?
I've had it with you.

985
01:02:18,672 --> 01:02:20,196
Who the hell are you?

986
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:21,849
I'm the guy who lives here.

987
01:02:22,981 --> 01:02:25,462
We're looking for Bruce Wayne.

988
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,565
You hungry?

989
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:31,748
Following the broadcast
earlier from General Zod.

990
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:33,141
The individual
they're searching for

991
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:35,515
- is still at large.
- So...

992
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:37,406
The president has yet to respond
to the broadcast from earlier,

993
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,302
and other foreign
leaders are said to be...

994
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:41,173
you're the same person as him...

995
01:02:41,217 --> 01:02:43,959
- but from an alternate timeline.
- Yes.

996
01:02:44,002 --> 01:02:44,960
In which...

997
01:02:46,613 --> 01:02:48,006
you and I are friends?

998
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:51,096
Yeah, you're like
probably my best friend.

999
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,185
- Okay.
- Well, but you're a bit...

1000
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:55,187
you're, uh...

1001
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,452
- chronologically different.
- Older.

1002
01:02:57,477 --> 01:02:59,887
That's what I can't understand.

1003
01:02:59,931 --> 01:03:02,890
I traveled back in
time from here to here.

1004
01:03:02,934 --> 01:03:05,806
Yet somehow,
everything's all changed

1005
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,350
back here.

1006
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:09,741
- Or like when you were born, so...
- Well...

1007
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,765
time isn't linear.

1008
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:13,075
Right?

1009
01:03:13,118 --> 01:03:14,076
Right.

1010
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,064
At some point

1011
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:21,353
you probably saw a
movie that told you

1012
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:23,563
that if you went back
and changed the past,

1013
01:03:23,607 --> 01:03:26,958
you'd create a kind of a
branched timeline, right?

1014
01:03:27,002 --> 01:03:28,133
Like, look.

1015
01:03:31,484 --> 01:03:33,486
New present

1016
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:36,098
- and new future.
- Yeah.

1017
01:03:36,141 --> 01:03:37,969
Well, time doesn't
work like that.

1018
01:03:38,013 --> 01:03:39,275
That's not how time works.

1019
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:41,320
When you go back
and change the past

1020
01:03:41,364 --> 01:03:43,409
you create a fulcrum.

1021
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:46,369
You put yourself on a whole
nother strand of spaghetti.

1022
01:03:47,631 --> 01:03:50,068
New future. New past.

1023
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:53,028
It's retrocausal.

1024
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:54,333
It goes both ways.

1025
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:56,857
Actually, it goes many ways.

1026
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:58,816
Maybe some other time.

1027
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:02,254
Okay, but in an ontological
paradox model, there's not...

1028
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:05,083
What you did was you
changed the future

1029
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:06,452
and you changed the past.

1030
01:04:07,129 --> 01:04:08,130
If a person

1031
01:04:08,173 --> 01:04:10,393
is stupid enough

1032
01:04:10,436 --> 01:04:11,959
to mess with time...

1033
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:14,266
what you eventually
end up with is this.

1034
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:18,314
The multiverse.

1035
01:04:18,357 --> 01:04:20,098
Some strands run

1036
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:21,578
almost parallel.

1037
01:04:21,621 --> 01:04:24,276
There will be inevitable
intersections,

1038
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,235
and others that are just...

1039
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:28,106
wildly divergent.

1040
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,108
What it is...

1041
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:31,561
is a hot mess.

1042
01:04:33,242 --> 01:04:34,939
It's a crapshoot.

1043
01:04:34,982 --> 01:04:36,375
It's all just a crapshoot.

1044
01:04:36,419 --> 01:04:37,717
What does the parmesan mean?

1045
01:04:37,742 --> 01:04:39,614
The metaphor's over.
It's just a garnish.

1046
01:04:39,664 --> 01:04:41,579
And I'll tell ya something.

1047
01:04:41,772 --> 01:04:43,639
A person would have to be

1048
01:04:43,948 --> 01:04:45,254
an idiot

1049
01:04:45,297 --> 01:04:47,038
to play craps

1050
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:48,953
with the space-time continuum.

1051
01:04:48,996 --> 01:04:50,520
Yeah, an idiot.

1052
01:04:52,174 --> 01:04:53,044
Here.

1053
01:04:55,174 --> 01:04:57,220
Mm.

1054
01:04:57,245 --> 01:04:59,790
Are you joking with the
chewing noises right now?

1055
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:01,959
So, uh, you're the reason

1056
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,412
this Zod character

1057
01:05:04,437 --> 01:05:06,787
is about to destroy the Earth?

1058
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:07,932
Maybe.

1059
01:05:07,957 --> 01:05:09,818
There's a guy called Superman

1060
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:11,062
who can stop Zod?

1061
01:05:11,106 --> 01:05:13,586
- Yeah, yeah.
- And flies?

1062
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,124
Shoots lasers out of his eyes?

1063
01:05:15,149 --> 01:05:17,565
Yes, he flies, and he shoots
lasers out of his eyes. Yes.

1064
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,852
No one said "Superman"...

1065
01:05:20,376 --> 01:05:22,987
that might be a
little on the nose?

1066
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:25,163
- You call yourself Batman.
- Yeah.

1067
01:05:25,207 --> 01:05:27,034
I don't call myself
Super Batman.

1068
01:05:28,949 --> 01:05:31,430
Wait, he's Batman?

1069
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:33,432
What did you think
we were doing here?

1070
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:35,652
I thought this was
the cousin's dinner.

1071
01:05:35,695 --> 01:05:38,263
He's... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

1072
01:05:38,307 --> 01:05:40,004
Not really. Not
so much anymore.

1073
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,919
You know...

1074
01:05:41,962 --> 01:05:43,268
they don't really need me.

1075
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:47,465
Things have changed.
Gotham's now

1076
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:49,622
one of the safest
cities in the world.

1077
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,755
Well, I... I need
you. We need you.

1078
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:53,060
In my timeline,

1079
01:05:53,104 --> 01:05:55,280
Batman's our
strategist, our leader.

1080
01:05:55,324 --> 01:05:57,978
The world needs Superman. You're
the best detective in the world.

1081
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:00,218
You're probably the only person
who can help me find him.

1082
01:06:00,242 --> 01:06:01,721
So, will you help us?

1083
01:06:03,245 --> 01:06:04,115
Pass.

1084
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:10,858
Like pass the salt?

1085
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:12,776
Bruce?

1086
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:16,693
He doesn't
want to help us...

1087
01:06:16,736 --> 01:06:18,347
we're gonna use his bat shit.

1088
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,435
Bat shit?

1089
01:06:20,871 --> 01:06:23,221
Yeah, his bat stuff,
his bat things.

1090
01:06:23,265 --> 01:06:24,222
Stand on that thing.

1091
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:29,401
Okay, remember when you
phased through the floor?

1092
01:06:29,445 --> 01:06:30,924
- Yeah.
- So,

1093
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:32,926
I need you to do that again.

1094
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,624
Ow.

1095
01:06:40,282 --> 01:06:41,805
What is this place?

1096
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:51,309
Dude!

1097
01:07:51,353 --> 01:07:54,965
This place straight beeves!

1098
01:07:55,008 --> 01:07:56,445
"Beeves"?

1099
01:08:07,499 --> 01:08:08,500
Barry!

1100
01:08:09,414 --> 01:08:10,850
I almost died

1101
01:08:10,894 --> 01:08:11,982
in an abyss!

1102
01:08:12,025 --> 01:08:15,507
12,805 Clark Kents in the US.

1103
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:17,702
Is this what I think it is?

1104
01:08:27,302 --> 01:08:29,216
Holy shit!

1105
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:32,481
I used to see this thing on
the news when I was a kid!

1106
01:08:32,524 --> 01:08:33,873
Okay, well...

1107
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:35,614
refine search.

1108
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:37,442
Date of birth.

1109
01:08:37,486 --> 01:08:39,879
- Wasn't born. He arrived.
- Oh!

1110
01:08:39,923 --> 01:08:42,099
Oh, Barry, look!

1111
01:08:42,142 --> 01:08:43,100
I'm busy.

1112
01:08:43,143 --> 01:08:44,725
With what?

1113
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,626
Looking for unidentified objects
entering Earth's atmosphere

1114
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:50,107
anywhere near Kansas
in the last 50 years.

1115
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,370
He has a back door into NASA.

1116
01:08:52,414 --> 01:08:53,415
'Course he does.

1117
01:08:55,045 --> 01:08:57,723
Yeah, but Barry, check this out.

1118
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,421
This bag laughs.

1119
01:09:01,031 --> 01:09:03,468
Okay, can't you take
anything seriously?

1120
01:09:03,512 --> 01:09:04,817
Stop messing around.

1121
01:09:04,861 --> 01:09:06,471
Dude, come on.

1122
01:09:06,515 --> 01:09:08,386
Have you seen this place?

1123
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:10,083
It's amazing!

1124
01:09:10,127 --> 01:09:11,737
Hello!

1125
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:14,523
Has the gravity of this
not sunk in for you?

1126
01:09:14,566 --> 01:09:15,738
Stop messing around, Barry.

1127
01:09:15,763 --> 01:09:17,163
I won't say it again.

1128
01:09:17,874 --> 01:09:19,963
Yeesh. Sorry, Mom.

1129
01:09:20,006 --> 01:09:22,400
Shut up. Shut up.

1130
01:09:22,444 --> 01:09:23,923
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

1131
01:09:24,446 --> 01:09:25,928
No idea!

1132
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:28,972
You take everything for granted.
You don't even appreciate...

1133
01:09:29,015 --> 01:09:31,583
You just walk around
thinking that you're so funny

1134
01:09:31,627 --> 01:09:32,976
and so cool.

1135
01:09:33,019 --> 01:09:34,412
And it's embarrassing,

1136
01:09:34,456 --> 01:09:37,502
because you're not
any of those things!

1137
01:09:37,546 --> 01:09:39,852
Hey, screw you, man!

1138
01:09:39,896 --> 01:09:42,202
I've done nothing but
everything you've asked.

1139
01:09:42,246 --> 01:09:44,335
You made me get
struck by lightning!

1140
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:46,946
I phased naked through the floor.
And I terrified Mrs. Johannson.

1141
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:48,644
Now I'm probably
gonna have to move.

1142
01:09:48,687 --> 01:09:51,168
You won't even tell
me why you're here.

1143
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:53,953
But will you at least tell me
why you're being so mean to me...

1144
01:09:53,997 --> 01:09:55,172
for no reason?

1145
01:09:55,215 --> 01:09:58,030
You used Monkey as a dartboard!

1146
01:09:58,697 --> 01:09:59,829
Wait, what?

1147
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:01,570
Forget it.

1148
01:10:03,963 --> 01:10:05,725
The monkey? Wait...

1149
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,093
So, you're mad at me
for playing with a toy?

1150
01:10:09,118 --> 01:10:11,163
It's not a toy.

1151
01:10:11,188 --> 01:10:12,755
Mom bought us that monkey.

1152
01:10:12,798 --> 01:10:14,757
'Cause she calls us Monkey.

1153
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,586
She gives us monkey
stuff all the time.

1154
01:10:18,543 --> 01:10:19,457
Right.

1155
01:10:20,502 --> 01:10:21,372
Look...

1156
01:10:22,242 --> 01:10:23,461
I'm sorry.

1157
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,813
I'm not very good with people.

1158
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:29,119
Even myself.

1159
01:10:29,162 --> 01:10:29,989
Oh.

1160
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:31,904
Come on, dude.

1161
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:33,602
You're... You're not that bad.

1162
01:10:33,645 --> 01:10:36,022
You can just be kind
of a dick sometimes.

1163
01:10:37,954 --> 01:10:40,478
But let's face it. I
am pretty obnoxious.

1164
01:10:40,522 --> 01:10:42,437
But I just get excited.

1165
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,048
Come on. This place
is pretty cool, right?

1166
01:10:45,962 --> 01:10:46,789
Yeah.

1167
01:10:49,487 --> 01:10:50,923
All right, well, um...

1168
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:54,013
I'll let you work.

1169
01:11:14,033 --> 01:11:15,153
I know you're there.

1170
01:11:18,473 --> 01:11:20,170
You know what I'm stuck on?

1171
01:11:20,213 --> 01:11:22,647
That thing you said,
with the spaghetti.

1172
01:11:22,672 --> 01:11:25,584
You said there were certain intersections
that would always be inevitable.

1173
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:28,787
You had an Alfred.

1174
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:30,963
My Bruce has an Alfred.

1175
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:33,139
Different worlds,
different times...

1176
01:11:33,183 --> 01:11:35,402
yet there it is.

1177
01:11:35,446 --> 01:11:37,579
Certain people,

1178
01:11:37,622 --> 01:11:41,321
certain events, certain
strands of spaghetti,

1179
01:11:41,365 --> 01:11:43,846
drawn to each other
like... like magnets.

1180
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,457
I've read all about

1181
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:49,504
temporal paradoxes
and causal loops.

1182
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:52,724
But this is more than that.

1183
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:55,074
Inevitable intersections

1184
01:11:55,118 --> 01:11:56,791
are something none of the theories
could have anticipated 'cause,

1185
01:11:56,815 --> 01:11:59,426
well, how do you explain
that except for...

1186
01:12:00,993 --> 01:12:02,647
fate?

1187
01:12:02,691 --> 01:12:04,649
If you are listening,

1188
01:12:04,693 --> 01:12:06,782
sorry about your parents.

1189
01:12:06,825 --> 01:12:08,261
I'm just trying to save mine.

1190
01:12:10,394 --> 01:12:12,265
There has to be a way.

1191
01:12:12,309 --> 01:12:13,963
There is a way, Barry.

1192
01:12:14,006 --> 01:12:15,268
Just keep trying.

1193
01:12:15,312 --> 01:12:16,487
Keep trying, Barry.

1194
01:13:00,618 --> 01:13:02,011
Found him.

1195
01:13:02,054 --> 01:13:03,952
Barry, wake up.

1196
01:13:03,977 --> 01:13:07,720
Clark's being held by a mercenary
group in a Siberian black site.

1197
01:13:07,886 --> 01:13:08,887
Get up, Barry.

1198
01:13:08,931 --> 01:13:10,846
The goat's on fire.

1199
01:13:10,889 --> 01:13:12,412
We're going to Russia.

1200
01:13:13,718 --> 01:13:15,372
Sweet.

1201
01:13:16,373 --> 01:13:19,637
Mm. Coffee.

1202
01:13:19,681 --> 01:13:20,943
How are we gonna get to Russia?

1203
01:13:58,545 --> 01:14:00,809
I'll help
you get this Superman.

1204
01:14:00,852 --> 01:14:03,333
Then, you're on your own.

1205
01:14:05,683 --> 01:14:07,293
Oh!

1206
01:14:08,686 --> 01:14:09,644
You're...

1207
01:14:10,601 --> 01:14:11,820
You are, you're...

1208
01:14:16,215 --> 01:14:17,216
Yeah.

1209
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:20,132
I'm Batman.

1210
01:15:07,919 --> 01:15:09,878
So, what's the plan?
We're just gonna, what,

1211
01:15:09,921 --> 01:15:12,663
grab Superman and dip set
before the block is hot?

1212
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:13,925
I don't know.

1213
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:15,163
Hey,
you should ask him.

1214
01:15:16,798 --> 01:15:18,123
- You ask him.
- You should ask him.

1215
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:19,844
Yeah, I'm not gonna ask him.

1216
01:15:19,888 --> 01:15:21,474
Why not? I thought Batman was
supposed to be your friend.

1217
01:15:21,498 --> 01:15:23,674
Not this one. Not this Batman.

1218
01:15:23,718 --> 01:15:26,398
- We're here.
- Activating hover mode.

1219
01:15:31,116 --> 01:15:32,988
- Ejector seat on.
- Ejector seat.

1220
01:15:33,031 --> 01:15:35,468
Ejector seat.

1221
01:15:39,037 --> 01:15:40,647
Okay, there are stages.

1222
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:43,781
You're strapped to
your parachutes.

1223
01:15:46,653 --> 01:15:47,698
Hey, where's yours?

1224
01:15:58,535 --> 01:16:00,537
Whoo! This rips dicks!

1225
01:16:20,339 --> 01:16:22,080
All
clear. Let's move.

1226
01:16:37,879 --> 01:16:39,445
Okay!

1227
01:16:47,889 --> 01:16:50,630
Good. Everybody's
fast now but me.

1228
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:53,198
- Why is it so cold?
- It's the Arctic, Barry.

1229
01:16:55,853 --> 01:16:58,813
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know. Just follow the footprints.

1230
01:17:03,992 --> 01:17:05,950
Superman would be
down there for sure.

1231
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:49,776
Yeah. Okay.

1232
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,023
What did you do?

1233
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:21,025
I had to move you. But
I just did it a little.

1234
01:18:29,991 --> 01:18:31,209
This might hurt.

1235
01:18:39,565 --> 01:18:41,165
Just let it out.

1236
01:19:17,995 --> 01:19:19,257
Let's go.

1237
01:19:27,004 --> 01:19:29,093
That's where
you keep Superman.

1238
01:19:29,137 --> 01:19:30,181
Like a big scrotum.

1239
01:19:42,237 --> 01:19:45,457
He's gonna hack the Soviet security
cyberscrotum with a flip phone?

1240
01:19:50,723 --> 01:19:52,247
I tried all the combinations.

1241
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,294
Yes!

1242
01:20:38,554 --> 01:20:39,555
Shit.

1243
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:41,731
Kal-El?

1244
01:20:44,734 --> 01:20:46,866
It's not him. We've gotta go.

1245
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:48,651
Wait.

1246
01:20:48,694 --> 01:20:50,740
We can't just leave
her here. Look at her.

1247
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:54,396
I'll grab her. Just go!

1248
01:21:01,751 --> 01:21:02,969
I got you.

1249
01:21:21,771 --> 01:21:22,772
I'll handle this jabroni.

1250
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,562
What the...

1251
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:40,094
Barry! Somebody shot me!

1252
01:21:45,011 --> 01:21:46,578
Time to dip set!

1253
01:21:55,805 --> 01:21:57,165
You,
you lead the way!

1254
01:21:57,198 --> 01:21:59,939
- Go!
- Not that way! Not that way!

1255
01:22:11,255 --> 01:22:12,517
Oh, God!

1256
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:14,215
Cover!

1257
01:22:21,874 --> 01:22:23,049
No!

1258
01:22:30,927 --> 01:22:32,252
It's coming
around. Hurry, hurry.

1259
01:22:40,676 --> 01:22:43,287
No, no, no! This is bullshit!

1260
01:22:52,644 --> 01:22:54,298
No!

1261
01:22:54,342 --> 01:22:55,560
Come on.

1262
01:22:56,126 --> 01:22:57,345
Let's go.

1263
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:00,478
You didn't tell me
we could get shot!

1264
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:01,802
Why would you
assume we couldn't?

1265
01:23:13,448 --> 01:23:16,886
Oh, great! To die at
the feet of a Sputnik.

1266
01:23:21,717 --> 01:23:23,849
Oh, man! I need this knee!

1267
01:23:23,893 --> 01:23:25,982
- Stay calm. It'll heal.
- Come on.

1268
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:40,233
- How much do you weigh?
- 180.

1269
01:23:40,257 --> 01:23:41,867
Each. Plus her, 440.

1270
01:23:48,744 --> 01:23:49,832
Hold on.

1271
01:24:19,296 --> 01:24:20,534
Oh, great.
They're here.

1272
01:24:20,558 --> 01:24:21,603
They're over here, too.

1273
01:24:21,646 --> 01:24:22,952
Smirnoff Ice.

1274
01:24:22,995 --> 01:24:24,475
- Yes. Smirnoff Ice.
- Hi.

1275
01:24:24,519 --> 01:24:26,608
Stop them!

1276
01:24:26,651 --> 01:24:28,436
-Yep.
-Okay, they're serious. Barry, shut up.

1277
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:29,611
Yeah, okay.

1278
01:24:29,654 --> 01:24:30,829
What's the play?

1279
01:24:30,873 --> 01:24:32,178
Batman, what do
we do? What now?

1280
01:24:36,705 --> 01:24:37,706
Now...

1281
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:39,838
we try not to die.

1282
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:42,336
Oh, you guys
should've seen that in slo-mo.

1283
01:26:19,285 --> 01:26:22,419
Yeah, I'm just realizing that
I didn't really think this through.

1284
01:26:22,463 --> 01:26:24,073
There are good Kryptonians...

1285
01:26:24,116 --> 01:26:26,467
and then there are very,
very bad Kryptonians.

1286
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,033
And I
was very confident

1287
01:26:28,077 --> 01:26:29,557
that we were just
gonna find Superman,

1288
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,559
and if we found Superman,

1289
01:26:31,602 --> 01:26:33,387
then this would all
be super simple.

1290
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:35,345
- Who are you?
- Holy Funyuns.

1291
01:26:37,129 --> 01:26:38,261
Hi.

1292
01:26:38,304 --> 01:26:40,481
- I... I'm Barry.
- We're Barry.

1293
01:26:40,524 --> 01:26:43,179
We were trying to find Kal-El.

1294
01:26:43,222 --> 01:26:45,311
But we found you instead.

1295
01:26:45,355 --> 01:26:46,835
What do you want with Kal-El?

1296
01:26:46,878 --> 01:26:48,445
We were trying to rescue him.

1297
01:26:48,489 --> 01:26:50,273
Why?

1298
01:26:50,316 --> 01:26:53,102
Because he's my friend.

1299
01:26:53,145 --> 01:26:54,495
Do you... Do you know him?

1300
01:26:54,538 --> 01:26:56,671
She
looks mad. Get ready.

1301
01:26:56,714 --> 01:26:59,084
She might do laser vision, or she
might do, like, a freezy breath...

1302
01:26:59,108 --> 01:27:01,632
- or she'll just start throwing crazy...
- My name is Kara.

1303
01:27:02,677 --> 01:27:03,895
Daughter of Zor-El.

1304
01:27:04,809 --> 01:27:06,420
Kal-El was my cousin.

1305
01:27:06,463 --> 01:27:08,770
- Right, and who's Kal-El again?
- It's Superman.

1306
01:27:08,813 --> 01:27:11,468
- No, 'cause you said that was Clark.
- Who's Clark?

1307
01:27:11,512 --> 01:27:14,689
Clark is his human name.

1308
01:27:14,732 --> 01:27:15,864
Clark.

1309
01:27:18,954 --> 01:27:20,825
He was an infant when we left.

1310
01:27:22,218 --> 01:27:23,828
The last son of Krypton... I...

1311
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:27,310
I was sent to protect him.

1312
01:27:27,353 --> 01:27:29,312
It looks like he
never made it to Earth

1313
01:27:29,355 --> 01:27:31,314
in this universe.

1314
01:27:31,357 --> 01:27:33,708
Our pods, they must
have separated.

1315
01:27:33,751 --> 01:27:35,449
Wait, so you thought a baby

1316
01:27:35,492 --> 01:27:37,929
was gonna protect us
from this Zod guy?

1317
01:27:37,973 --> 01:27:39,496
General Zod is here.

1318
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,716
He must have tracked
my pod's signal.

1319
01:27:41,759 --> 01:27:44,066
- I have to go.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

1320
01:27:44,109 --> 01:27:47,722
Well, you need to recover your
strength. Actually, Barry...

1321
01:27:47,765 --> 01:27:49,288
take her to the roof

1322
01:27:49,332 --> 01:27:51,334
and put her in the sun.

1323
01:27:51,377 --> 01:27:52,640
Yeah.

1324
01:27:52,683 --> 01:27:54,642
- Yeah.
- Whatever, like if, I mean,

1325
01:27:54,685 --> 01:27:56,252
you're solar powered.

1326
01:27:56,295 --> 01:27:57,819
Good for you. I've
been trying to...

1327
01:27:57,862 --> 01:27:59,298
Oh, uh...

1328
01:28:00,474 --> 01:28:02,737
We'll take that with us.

1329
01:28:11,702 --> 01:28:14,488
Um, am I cool to...

1330
01:28:14,531 --> 01:28:15,401
turn around?

1331
01:28:16,533 --> 01:28:17,839
Are you dressed

1332
01:28:17,882 --> 01:28:20,015
in a red cape?

1333
01:28:26,587 --> 01:28:28,719
You're levitating?

1334
01:28:36,205 --> 01:28:37,511
Is it always this loud?

1335
01:28:40,557 --> 01:28:42,428
Is it loud?

1336
01:28:42,472 --> 01:28:45,736
Are you, uh, good?
Do you feel, um...

1337
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:46,998
strong yet, or...

1338
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:54,397
Yep, that seems, uh,

1339
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,181
seems strong. You know...

1340
01:28:56,225 --> 01:28:58,836
old man Barry, down there,

1341
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,143
says if we don't
stop Captain Zode,

1342
01:29:01,186 --> 01:29:03,537
he'll kill thousands of people.

1343
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,060
Billions of people.

1344
01:29:05,103 --> 01:29:06,191
Billions?

1345
01:29:07,802 --> 01:29:09,151
Of your people.

1346
01:29:09,194 --> 01:29:10,892
- They're good people.
- Good people?

1347
01:29:12,067 --> 01:29:13,721
We came to this planet

1348
01:29:13,764 --> 01:29:15,766
looking for a safe
place to live,

1349
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,029
and they put me in a cage.

1350
01:29:18,073 --> 01:29:20,728
Yeah. A lot of
humans are dicks.

1351
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:23,121
But then

1352
01:29:23,165 --> 01:29:25,515
there's babies and ballerinas.

1353
01:29:25,559 --> 01:29:27,343
And entertainment wrestlers.

1354
01:29:27,386 --> 01:29:28,823
A lot of humans
are worth saving.

1355
01:29:29,954 --> 01:29:31,173
Maybe to you.

1356
01:29:32,566 --> 01:29:33,871
But I'm not a human.

1357
01:29:35,351 --> 01:29:36,613
I'm a Kryptonian.

1358
01:29:40,356 --> 01:29:42,097
She's gone.

1359
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:43,838
I have to get my powers back.

1360
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:47,972
If I can re-create the accident

1361
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:49,539
that gave me my powers...

1362
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:51,038
maybe I can reconnect
to the Speed Force...

1363
01:29:51,062 --> 01:29:53,848
and maybe we'd stand
a chance against Zod.

1364
01:29:53,891 --> 01:29:56,328
Or kill yourself in the process.

1365
01:29:59,331 --> 01:30:00,158
Tell me something.

1366
01:30:02,073 --> 01:30:04,206
If you get your powers back,

1367
01:30:04,249 --> 01:30:05,555
you can go anywhere.

1368
01:30:05,599 --> 01:30:07,122
You can go to another timeline,

1369
01:30:07,165 --> 01:30:08,602
another universe.

1370
01:30:08,645 --> 01:30:10,778
Why do you wanna stay...

1371
01:30:10,821 --> 01:30:13,128
and fight to save this one?

1372
01:30:13,171 --> 01:30:15,521
Because this is the
world where my mom lives.

1373
01:30:18,742 --> 01:30:21,484
I went back in time to save her.

1374
01:30:21,527 --> 01:30:23,660
I'm not gonna lose her again.

1375
01:30:23,704 --> 01:30:25,575
The kid doesn't know, does he?

1376
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:28,317
How do you tell someone
something like that?

1377
01:30:31,842 --> 01:30:33,844
I lost my parents...

1378
01:30:36,804 --> 01:30:38,457
but that pain...

1379
01:30:42,113 --> 01:30:43,724
made me who I am.

1380
01:30:43,767 --> 01:30:46,248
I'm not sure I know who I
am without it, actually.

1381
01:30:50,556 --> 01:30:53,298
I spent a lifetime...

1382
01:30:53,342 --> 01:30:56,171
trying to right the
wrongs of the past.

1383
01:30:57,563 --> 01:30:58,782
As if

1384
01:30:58,826 --> 01:31:01,698
putting on a cape
and fighting crime

1385
01:31:01,742 --> 01:31:03,569
would bring my parents back.

1386
01:31:09,488 --> 01:31:10,794
You actually did it.

1387
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,754
So...

1388
01:31:13,797 --> 01:31:15,190
I guess the plan is

1389
01:31:15,233 --> 01:31:17,583
to douse yourself in
industrial chemicals

1390
01:31:17,627 --> 01:31:19,455
while electrocuting yourself?

1391
01:31:19,498 --> 01:31:20,325
Yep.

1392
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:25,809
Want some help?

1393
01:31:27,724 --> 01:31:30,074
Hell yeah. That
would be incredibly useful.

1394
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:31,748
I've actually already
borrowed some chemicals

1395
01:31:31,772 --> 01:31:32,990
and your soldering iron,

1396
01:31:33,034 --> 01:31:35,210
and I'm sitting
in your bat-seat.

1397
01:31:35,253 --> 01:31:36,690
Is that like a faux pas?

1398
01:31:48,658 --> 01:31:51,966
Wilco,
Lima, Zebra, be advised...

1399
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:57,928
Air
Command to Bravo 601.

1400
01:31:57,972 --> 01:32:00,409
Primary teams,
please confirm your AORs.

1401
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:21,810
- Green teams ready to move.
- Standing by!

1402
01:32:23,127 --> 01:32:27,001
You bring me nothing? Hmm.

1403
01:32:27,044 --> 01:32:29,481
I gave you a warning.

1404
01:32:29,525 --> 01:32:32,180
Your failure to deliver
the Kryptonian traitor

1405
01:32:32,223 --> 01:32:34,399
is being taken as an act of war.

1406
01:32:37,968 --> 01:32:39,424
- Fire, fire, fire!
- We have contact, contact!

1407
01:32:39,448 --> 01:32:40,120
Weapons hot! Weapons
hot! Open fire!

1408
01:32:40,144 --> 01:32:42,538
No.

1409
01:32:42,581 --> 01:32:45,280
Air support
now! I repeat, air support!

1410
01:33:12,698 --> 01:33:14,875
Okay, when I throw the switch,

1411
01:33:14,918 --> 01:33:16,485
the current should
run up the wire

1412
01:33:16,528 --> 01:33:19,053
and draw the lightning
right to the kite.

1413
01:33:19,096 --> 01:33:20,445
Here, put that on.

1414
01:33:20,489 --> 01:33:21,925
It's heat and impact resistant.

1415
01:33:21,969 --> 01:33:23,666
Should protect you a little.

1416
01:33:23,709 --> 01:33:25,709
Right, but the point is
for me to not be protected.

1417
01:33:27,148 --> 01:33:27,975
Okay.

1418
01:33:30,891 --> 01:33:32,631
You're gonna need to
be out of the way.

1419
01:33:32,675 --> 01:33:33,676
I will.

1420
01:33:38,072 --> 01:33:39,073
Let's get electrocuted.

1421
01:33:45,035 --> 01:33:46,558
This is going to work, right?

1422
01:33:46,602 --> 01:33:48,343
Of course it's gonna work.

1423
01:33:48,386 --> 01:33:50,084
Nothing we haven't done before.

1424
01:33:50,127 --> 01:33:51,868
Besides, this time
we have Batman.

1425
01:33:51,912 --> 01:33:53,435
What could go wrong?

1426
01:33:53,478 --> 01:33:55,567
Uh, for the record, I
think this is insane.

1427
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:58,048
Get back.

1428
01:34:04,141 --> 01:34:05,142
It's fine. It's fine.

1429
01:34:15,109 --> 01:34:17,198
Just you and me
again, Mr. Lightning.

1430
01:34:24,074 --> 01:34:24,945
Do it!

1431
01:34:47,532 --> 01:34:48,794
Wait, what? No!

1432
01:34:48,838 --> 01:34:50,709
No, wait! Stop! Stop!

1433
01:34:57,847 --> 01:34:59,457
Oh, God.

1434
01:34:59,501 --> 01:35:00,719
Oh, God.

1435
01:35:00,763 --> 01:35:01,677
Barry, no.

1436
01:35:05,376 --> 01:35:06,203
Go again.

1437
01:35:07,509 --> 01:35:08,814
But...

1438
01:35:08,858 --> 01:35:09,815
Please.

1439
01:35:18,085 --> 01:35:19,521
The circuit is fried.

1440
01:36:17,883 --> 01:36:18,884
I've got you.

1441
01:36:51,004 --> 01:36:53,006
Hey. Barry.

1442
01:36:54,442 --> 01:36:56,748
You're okay. It's
like last time, right?

1443
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:58,011
So, you gotta heal now.

1444
01:37:16,072 --> 01:37:17,160
Look, look, look!

1445
01:37:17,204 --> 01:37:18,596
It's working. It's working.

1446
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,598
Yeah, it's working. Yeah.

1447
01:37:20,642 --> 01:37:22,513
Yeah, he's
healing. He's healing.

1448
01:37:22,557 --> 01:37:24,341
Oh, my God. He's okay.

1449
01:37:24,385 --> 01:37:26,648
Dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

1450
01:38:10,387 --> 01:38:11,997
You're awake.

1451
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:13,129
How you feeling?

1452
01:38:13,912 --> 01:38:14,783
Slow.

1453
01:38:15,697 --> 01:38:17,438
Maybe this will help.

1454
01:38:27,448 --> 01:38:29,450
Ooh... Ooh!

1455
01:38:30,059 --> 01:38:31,060
Yes!

1456
01:38:31,104 --> 01:38:33,584
Dude, come on! Irresistible!

1457
01:38:33,628 --> 01:38:35,282
Man, feels good to be back.

1458
01:38:35,325 --> 01:38:36,718
Yeah!

1459
01:38:36,761 --> 01:38:38,372
And what are we wearing tonight?

1460
01:38:38,415 --> 01:38:39,808
You like it?

1461
01:38:39,851 --> 01:38:41,636
I-I made it myself out
of that old Batsuit.

1462
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,855
But you know, I made it
our colors and everything.

1463
01:38:43,899 --> 01:38:46,075
Well, check this out!

1464
01:38:46,119 --> 01:38:47,946
It's a bit more loose.

1465
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:51,428
It beeves.

1466
01:38:52,603 --> 01:38:54,127
Dude...

1467
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:55,519
you really mean that?

1468
01:38:55,563 --> 01:38:57,130
I mean, I don't...

1469
01:38:57,173 --> 01:39:00,568
I don't know what it
means, exactly, to beeve.

1470
01:39:00,611 --> 01:39:03,310
But it seems like it's positive.

1471
01:39:03,353 --> 01:39:04,267
What are you doing?

1472
01:39:07,314 --> 01:39:08,576
You came back.

1473
01:39:08,619 --> 01:39:10,621
I'm glad you're okay.

1474
01:39:10,665 --> 01:39:13,363
I have to ask you something.

1475
01:39:13,407 --> 01:39:16,018
When you found me in that
hole that they put me in...

1476
01:39:17,367 --> 01:39:19,021
and I wasn't Kal-El...

1477
01:39:21,632 --> 01:39:23,460
why did you help me?

1478
01:39:23,504 --> 01:39:24,983
Because you needed help.

1479
01:39:27,769 --> 01:39:30,815
Do you know what this
symbol stands for?

1480
01:39:30,859 --> 01:39:32,991
- Supergirl?
- It means hope, right?

1481
01:39:33,035 --> 01:39:35,168
Hope, yeah. Does it mean hope?

1482
01:39:35,211 --> 01:39:37,822
Krypton was a beautiful place.

1483
01:39:39,955 --> 01:39:41,435
We are a people of hope,

1484
01:39:42,349 --> 01:39:43,872
not war.

1485
01:39:45,395 --> 01:39:47,092
I'm coming to you
live from Metropolis,

1486
01:39:47,136 --> 01:39:48,679
where minutes ago, the
mysterious flying...

1487
01:39:48,703 --> 01:39:50,661
Zod may be from Krypton,

1488
01:39:50,705 --> 01:39:53,490
but he is not my people.

1489
01:39:53,534 --> 01:39:55,927
So, you're saying...

1490
01:39:55,971 --> 01:39:57,625
Yes.

1491
01:39:57,668 --> 01:39:59,192
I will help you fight Zod.

1492
01:40:02,107 --> 01:40:03,979
Yes!

1493
01:40:04,022 --> 01:40:05,850
Interesting group.

1494
01:40:05,894 --> 01:40:08,723
What did you say, uh...

1495
01:40:08,766 --> 01:40:10,028
we were called again?

1496
01:40:10,072 --> 01:40:12,074
We're the Justice League.

1497
01:40:12,117 --> 01:40:13,249
No.

1498
01:40:13,293 --> 01:40:16,209
- No?
- Well, I mean, kinda.

1499
01:40:17,297 --> 01:40:18,254
We are short

1500
01:40:18,298 --> 01:40:19,690
one literal goddess...

1501
01:40:19,734 --> 01:40:21,301
one friendly Terminator

1502
01:40:21,344 --> 01:40:24,086
and super mermaid.

1503
01:40:24,129 --> 01:40:26,219
And we could definitely
use a Batman.

1504
01:40:29,309 --> 01:40:30,571
Are you in?

1505
01:40:35,793 --> 01:40:36,925
You wanna get nuts?

1506
01:40:39,449 --> 01:40:40,885
Let's get nuts.

1507
01:40:54,247 --> 01:40:56,945
In my world, Superman showed up
right away when Zod called him out.

1508
01:40:56,988 --> 01:40:59,426
So, as of now, we're
in uncharted territory.

1509
01:40:59,469 --> 01:41:02,646
What I do know is that Zod somehow
controls the World Engines,

1510
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:04,300
which will be
destroying much more

1511
01:41:04,344 --> 01:41:05,910
than just Metropolis now

1512
01:41:05,954 --> 01:41:07,714
with every passing second
that we don't stop him.

1513
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:08,826
Barry, what are you doing?

1514
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:09,740
What?

1515
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:12,700
Our kids are gonna
wanna see this.

1516
01:41:12,743 --> 01:41:13,701
Your kids?

1517
01:41:16,007 --> 01:41:18,967
Well, you know, like everybody's kids.
I mean, the children of the world.

1518
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:20,229
They're gonna wanna see this.

1519
01:41:22,753 --> 01:41:24,451
We're getting close.

1520
01:41:24,494 --> 01:41:26,516
I'm gonna stay airborne and
take out their sky power.

1521
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,019
And Barry, just so we're clear

1522
01:41:28,063 --> 01:41:29,301
what that essentially
equates to is you and me

1523
01:41:29,325 --> 01:41:31,240
versus the entire
Kryptonian army.

1524
01:41:31,284 --> 01:41:32,763
Chill.

1525
01:41:32,807 --> 01:41:35,331
We need to buy Kara enough
time to take out Zod.

1526
01:41:35,375 --> 01:41:37,657
Oh, and remember that your suit
doesn't dissipate energy like mine

1527
01:41:37,681 --> 01:41:39,204
so you need to take breaks,

1528
01:41:39,248 --> 01:41:40,965
otherwise you're gonna
build up too much charge.

1529
01:41:40,989 --> 01:41:42,469
Wait, what?

1530
01:41:59,616 --> 01:42:01,139
Dang it!

1531
01:42:02,924 --> 01:42:04,491
Hold on!

1532
01:42:06,406 --> 01:42:07,926
- Okay!
- Hold on.

1533
01:42:09,974 --> 01:42:11,367
The humans we came to protect?

1534
01:42:11,411 --> 01:42:12,977
They don't know
we're on their side.

1535
01:42:48,404 --> 01:42:49,231
Zod.

1536
01:42:58,632 --> 01:42:59,850
Kara Zor-El.

1537
01:42:59,894 --> 01:43:01,417
We've been waiting for you.

1538
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:05,769
Go, go!

1539
01:43:06,988 --> 01:43:07,989
Cover!

1540
01:43:11,993 --> 01:43:14,082
- Drag him out, drag him!
- You go! I'll cover!

1541
01:43:31,316 --> 01:43:33,841
Okay, and the space giant...

1542
01:43:33,884 --> 01:43:35,625
and Mistress Murder...

1543
01:43:35,669 --> 01:43:37,758
- are our responsibility, too?
- Hey, hey, hey.

1544
01:43:37,801 --> 01:43:39,455
Don't think about
them, okay? Calm down.

1545
01:43:39,499 --> 01:43:41,544
We're just gonna start
with those guys over there.

1546
01:43:41,588 --> 01:43:43,217
And yeah, they're Kryptonian, and
we won't be able to kill them,

1547
01:43:43,241 --> 01:43:45,113
but we can slow
them down for her.

1548
01:43:45,156 --> 01:43:47,681
One at a time.

1549
01:43:47,724 --> 01:43:50,379
Okay? I'm gonna disarm them,
and then you'll engage.

1550
01:43:52,512 --> 01:43:53,513
Punch 'em.

1551
01:43:55,079 --> 01:43:56,820
Come on, Barbie.

1552
01:43:56,864 --> 01:43:58,822
Let's go party?

1553
01:44:05,655 --> 01:44:07,091
Okay, ow!

1554
01:44:09,442 --> 01:44:10,443
Oh.

1555
01:44:15,448 --> 01:44:16,405
Okay. It's okay.

1556
01:44:16,449 --> 01:44:18,015
You're okay. Come on.

1557
01:44:18,059 --> 01:44:19,452
Jesus, they're fast.

1558
01:44:19,495 --> 01:44:21,236
Yes, but not as fast as us.

1559
01:44:24,979 --> 01:44:27,024
Terraforming has begun.

1560
01:44:27,068 --> 01:44:28,765
This world must die

1561
01:44:28,809 --> 01:44:30,854
so that ours may live again.

1562
01:44:38,645 --> 01:44:40,516
Oh, my God. We gotta
go. We gotta go.

1563
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,996
Dan, Danny, go, go!

1564
01:44:43,432 --> 01:44:45,652
Krypton is gone, Zod.

1565
01:44:45,695 --> 01:44:47,175
Your uncle...

1566
01:44:47,218 --> 01:44:48,219
Jor-El...

1567
01:44:49,656 --> 01:44:50,874
hid the key

1568
01:44:50,918 --> 01:44:53,660
to Krypton's rebirth

1569
01:44:53,703 --> 01:44:56,140
inside a Kryptonian child.

1570
01:44:56,184 --> 01:44:58,534
All the genetic material needed

1571
01:44:58,578 --> 01:45:00,362
to start again

1572
01:45:00,405 --> 01:45:02,277
coded inside the DNA,

1573
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,932
then sent to Earth
in an escape pod.

1574
01:45:04,975 --> 01:45:06,847
He's not here. You have failed.

1575
01:45:08,152 --> 01:45:09,153
We found him.

1576
01:45:11,242 --> 01:45:13,070
We intercepted his pod.

1577
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:17,901
But your cousin was
not the one we needed.

1578
01:45:19,729 --> 01:45:21,731
You are the one.

1579
01:45:21,775 --> 01:45:23,472
Kara Zor-El.

1580
01:45:23,516 --> 01:45:25,518
It is your blood...

1581
01:45:25,561 --> 01:45:26,649
we must harvest.

1582
01:45:26,693 --> 01:45:27,998
What did you do to Kal-El?

1583
01:45:28,042 --> 01:45:30,740
Your sacrifice that will allow

1584
01:45:30,784 --> 01:45:32,786
Krypton to live again.

1585
01:45:32,829 --> 01:45:35,658
What did you do?

1586
01:45:38,008 --> 01:45:40,663
The infant did not survive.

1587
01:46:14,218 --> 01:46:15,568
Look, new plan.

1588
01:46:15,611 --> 01:46:17,178
I'm gonna create a
cyclonic diversion.

1589
01:46:17,221 --> 01:46:18,962
And you're gonna
just come in, hard.

1590
01:46:19,006 --> 01:46:20,050
Feet first this time.

1591
01:46:35,849 --> 01:46:37,459
Yes!

1592
01:46:37,502 --> 01:46:38,982
Barry, did you see that?

1593
01:46:39,026 --> 01:46:40,906
Be careful. You're
accumulating too much charge.

1594
01:46:42,507 --> 01:46:44,379
What if I just Emperor this guy?

1595
01:46:45,728 --> 01:46:47,730
No, no, no!

1596
01:47:14,714 --> 01:47:17,368
Barry, that was actually
only half stupid!

1597
01:47:17,412 --> 01:47:19,414
But if you're gonna
do that and not die,

1598
01:47:19,457 --> 01:47:21,329
you need to complete
the circuit somehow.

1599
01:47:21,372 --> 01:47:23,505
Try putting your hands
together, like this.

1600
01:47:26,377 --> 01:47:27,335
Oh, shit.

1601
01:47:29,293 --> 01:47:31,905
- You're ready.
- Let's go!

1602
01:48:48,677 --> 01:48:50,157
I'm going after the big one.

1603
01:49:01,603 --> 01:49:02,473
I've been hit.

1604
01:49:05,259 --> 01:49:07,174
Bruce, do you copy?

1605
01:49:07,217 --> 01:49:08,828
- Where's Kara?
- You go find her.

1606
01:49:13,833 --> 01:49:14,703
Bruce!

1607
01:49:16,052 --> 01:49:18,098
Ejection mode failure.

1608
01:49:18,141 --> 01:49:20,013
Ejection mode failure.

1609
01:49:59,661 --> 01:50:01,271
Rest, Kara Zor-El.

1610
01:50:06,886 --> 01:50:08,148
Going down.

1611
01:50:13,196 --> 01:50:14,850
But I'm not going alone.

1612
01:50:14,894 --> 01:50:17,026
No, no, no, Bruce!

1613
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:19,986
Bruce, eject!
Bruce, just eject...

1614
01:50:27,297 --> 01:50:28,298
No!

1615
01:50:40,136 --> 01:50:40,963
Kara.

1616
01:50:47,752 --> 01:50:49,537
Isn't supposed...

1617
01:50:51,626 --> 01:50:52,845
Not supposed to happen...

1618
01:50:59,286 --> 01:51:00,853
Kara's dead.

1619
01:51:00,896 --> 01:51:02,289
They're both dead.

1620
01:51:02,332 --> 01:51:04,291
But they don't
have to be, right?

1621
01:51:04,334 --> 01:51:06,771
'Cause we can go back.

1622
01:51:06,815 --> 01:51:08,948
- Like you did.
- You're not fast enough yet.

1623
01:51:08,991 --> 01:51:09,905
You sure?

1624
01:51:12,038 --> 01:51:13,866
Barry!

1625
01:51:15,215 --> 01:51:16,259
Barry, wait!

1626
01:51:30,143 --> 01:51:31,884
Is this back enough?

1627
01:51:31,927 --> 01:51:33,102
Yeah, I guess so.

1628
01:51:39,761 --> 01:51:41,284
Listen, Barry, I...

1629
01:51:42,764 --> 01:51:46,463
What? It's okay.
We can fix this.

1630
01:51:46,507 --> 01:51:47,788
You know what
you're gonna change?

1631
01:51:47,812 --> 01:51:49,205
I know what I'm gonna change.

1632
01:51:54,123 --> 01:51:55,646
I'm going after the big one.

1633
01:51:58,127 --> 01:52:00,521
Bruce, pull off. That
gunship is shield-protected.

1634
01:52:00,564 --> 01:52:01,478
Roger that.

1635
01:52:05,178 --> 01:52:06,266
Bet he's not.

1636
01:52:07,484 --> 01:52:09,269
Who? Space giant?

1637
01:52:09,312 --> 01:52:10,923
Yes, yes, please take him out.

1638
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:53,313
Yes.

1639
01:54:53,128 --> 01:54:54,129
No.

1640
01:54:54,825 --> 01:54:55,652
Hey.

1641
01:54:56,740 --> 01:54:58,307
It'll be okay.

1642
01:54:58,351 --> 01:54:59,569
Not this time, kid.

1643
01:55:02,137 --> 01:55:03,921
Maybe some other time.

1644
01:55:09,971 --> 01:55:11,494
We can't bring you back, can we?

1645
01:55:13,192 --> 01:55:14,367
You already did.

1646
01:55:16,543 --> 01:55:17,979
You already did.

1647
01:55:28,511 --> 01:55:29,631
Come on, Barry.

1648
01:55:31,079 --> 01:55:32,602
Gotta get up. Come on.

1649
01:55:32,646 --> 01:55:33,908
- Barry.
- We go again.

1650
01:55:36,606 --> 01:55:38,304
Barry.

1651
01:55:40,132 --> 01:55:41,829
Let's just go.

1652
01:55:41,872 --> 01:55:43,483
Barry, come on. Let's just go.

1653
01:55:43,526 --> 01:55:45,006
Barry, there's no point.

1654
01:55:47,617 --> 01:55:49,010
Barry!

1655
01:56:09,161 --> 01:56:12,599
Phase!

1656
01:56:15,254 --> 01:56:17,821
Okay, I have to pull it out.

1657
01:56:17,865 --> 01:56:19,277
- I have to pull it out.
- No, I'm okay.

1658
01:56:19,301 --> 01:56:20,626
You have to phase again.
Barry, phase again.

1659
01:56:20,650 --> 01:56:21,714
I'm okay. I just
should've stopped sooner.

1660
01:56:21,738 --> 01:56:22,739
Ow!

1661
01:56:39,147 --> 01:56:40,322
Again.

1662
01:56:41,932 --> 01:56:42,759
Barry.

1663
01:56:51,507 --> 01:56:53,814
Okay, can we please
just take a minute?

1664
01:56:53,857 --> 01:56:56,425
Sorry, dude. Yeah,
bro, of course.

1665
01:56:56,469 --> 01:56:58,166
That's the whole thing.

1666
01:56:58,210 --> 01:57:00,168
We can take as much
time as it takes.

1667
01:57:00,212 --> 01:57:02,301
No, that's not
what I mean. Hey!

1668
01:57:23,713 --> 01:57:26,194
Okay, you good? Come on.

1669
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:28,022
I need you in there. Let's go.

1670
01:57:28,065 --> 01:57:29,806
Barry, please,
just listen to me!

1671
01:57:47,911 --> 01:57:49,304
Where were you?

1672
01:57:49,348 --> 01:57:50,890
What, you just stand
here the whole time?

1673
01:57:50,914 --> 01:57:53,787
Barry, this is an
inevitable intersection.

1674
01:57:53,830 --> 01:57:55,615
You have to stop. Barry!

1675
01:58:10,978 --> 01:58:12,240
No, Barry, wait!

1676
01:58:18,290 --> 01:58:20,596
Barry, listen.

1677
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,040
There's something
I should tell you.

1678
01:58:24,644 --> 01:58:27,124
I went back in time initially

1679
01:58:27,168 --> 01:58:29,649
- because...
- Yeah, because Mom died.

1680
01:58:29,692 --> 01:58:31,390
How do you know?

1681
01:58:31,433 --> 01:58:34,001
It doesn't matter. Does it?

1682
01:58:34,044 --> 01:58:35,655
You know that I have
to undo what I did.

1683
01:58:36,743 --> 01:58:37,613
No.

1684
01:58:37,657 --> 01:58:39,049
It's not a mistake.

1685
01:58:39,093 --> 01:58:40,137
We can save her.

1686
01:58:40,181 --> 01:58:41,400
And we can save them.

1687
01:58:41,443 --> 01:58:43,140
No, we can't.

1688
01:58:43,184 --> 01:58:45,882
This is what Bruce
was talking about.

1689
01:58:45,926 --> 01:58:48,102
Barry, this is inevitable.

1690
01:58:48,145 --> 01:58:50,785
We can try a million times, and
we're not gonna be able to fix this.

1691
01:58:51,453 --> 01:58:52,889
No matter what we do...

1692
01:58:53,542 --> 01:58:55,414
this world dies.

1693
01:58:56,415 --> 01:58:58,373
Today.

1694
01:58:58,417 --> 01:58:59,374
Look around.

1695
01:59:03,552 --> 01:59:05,598
Look at the damage
we're causing.

1696
01:59:11,734 --> 01:59:12,996
Now we have to stop.

1697
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,389
Okay?

1698
01:59:14,433 --> 01:59:16,217
Look, I was just
doing my laundry.

1699
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,394
You're the one who came and
told me that I'm a superhero.

1700
01:59:19,438 --> 01:59:21,265
And now you're saying what?

1701
01:59:21,309 --> 01:59:23,180
You
don't want me to be?

1702
01:59:23,224 --> 01:59:25,705
Well, guess what!
It's too late!

1703
01:59:25,748 --> 01:59:28,403
I am...

1704
01:59:28,447 --> 01:59:29,883
the Flash.

1705
01:59:29,926 --> 01:59:31,798
And I can save everyone.

1706
01:59:31,841 --> 01:59:33,582
Nobody dies!

1707
01:59:33,626 --> 01:59:34,627
Barry...

1708
01:59:36,498 --> 01:59:38,326
not every problem
has a solution.

1709
01:59:47,422 --> 01:59:49,293
Not every problem
has a solution.

1710
01:59:53,472 --> 01:59:54,864
Sometimes we just
have to let go.

1711
01:59:54,908 --> 01:59:57,214
Sometimes you
just have to let go.

1712
01:59:57,258 --> 01:59:59,869
Let go of Mom?

1713
01:59:59,913 --> 02:00:03,220
She'll always be alive,
somewhere in time.

1714
02:00:04,439 --> 02:00:05,397
Always.

1715
02:00:06,136 --> 02:00:07,268
Just not for us.

1716
02:00:08,487 --> 02:00:10,576
You're full of shit, dude.

1717
02:00:10,619 --> 02:00:12,012
I'm going back.

1718
02:00:12,055 --> 02:00:13,883
You're going
back to kill Mom?

1719
02:00:13,927 --> 02:00:15,102
No!

1720
02:00:15,145 --> 02:00:16,886
You're staying!

1721
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:18,932
You stay, right here.

1722
02:00:20,455 --> 02:00:21,935
Just give me one more time.

1723
02:00:21,978 --> 02:00:23,719
Barry, stop!

1724
02:00:23,763 --> 02:00:26,243
You, stop!

1725
02:00:57,623 --> 02:00:59,668
Feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

1726
02:00:59,712 --> 02:01:02,454
Let's start again.
I'm the Flash.

1727
02:01:02,497 --> 02:01:03,498
What's your name?

1728
02:01:03,542 --> 02:01:06,109
I've lived...

1729
02:01:06,153 --> 02:01:08,068
more than you can dream.

1730
02:01:08,111 --> 02:01:10,679
Not an answer.

1731
02:01:10,723 --> 02:01:12,551
Do you, like, rehearse that?

1732
02:01:17,947 --> 02:01:19,471
Whoa.

1733
02:01:19,514 --> 02:01:20,820
Get out of here, Barry!

1734
02:01:35,617 --> 02:01:37,314
That scar, you...

1735
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:39,316
Oh, my God.

1736
02:01:40,317 --> 02:01:42,842
So, you're... You are...

1737
02:01:42,885 --> 02:01:44,496
Yes, I am...

1738
02:01:45,061 --> 02:01:46,062
you.

1739
02:01:49,022 --> 02:01:50,980
We are so close.

1740
02:01:51,024 --> 02:01:52,982
I've got it almost figured out.

1741
02:01:53,026 --> 02:01:55,985
How long have you
been doing this?

1742
02:01:56,029 --> 02:01:58,553
Time is inconsequential.

1743
02:01:58,597 --> 02:01:59,554
Come on, Barry.

1744
02:02:09,172 --> 02:02:11,784
Up in the
sky! It's a bird!

1745
02:02:11,827 --> 02:02:13,220
It's a plane!

1746
02:02:13,263 --> 02:02:14,700
It's Superman!

1747
02:02:56,959 --> 02:02:58,700
Purrfectly foolproof.

1748
02:03:00,659 --> 02:03:01,940
Only the
Joker would think of that.

1749
02:03:40,394 --> 02:03:42,570
Please just look at
what's happening.

1750
02:03:43,919 --> 02:03:44,920
These worlds...

1751
02:03:54,016 --> 02:03:56,149
they're colliding
and collapsing.

1752
02:03:58,542 --> 02:03:59,674
We did this.

1753
02:04:01,676 --> 02:04:03,939
W-We're destroying the
fabric of everything.

1754
02:04:06,333 --> 02:04:07,551
You have to stop.

1755
02:04:07,595 --> 02:04:10,424
It stops once I've fixed it!

1756
02:04:12,078 --> 02:04:15,124
It's not entirely
your fault, Barry.

1757
02:04:15,168 --> 02:04:18,780
I pushed you out of the
Chronobowl on that September 29

1758
02:04:18,824 --> 02:04:22,001
so you could start
me on this path. Hmm?

1759
02:04:22,044 --> 02:04:24,699
How do you like our
endless paradox?

1760
02:04:24,743 --> 02:04:26,875
I made you create me...

1761
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:29,748
and now you're the one...

1762
02:04:30,618 --> 02:04:32,489
in my way.

1763
02:04:32,533 --> 02:04:35,492
No matter how close I get
to winning this fight...

1764
02:04:35,536 --> 02:04:37,538
you go back

1765
02:04:37,581 --> 02:04:39,322
and let Mom die.

1766
02:04:39,366 --> 02:04:41,542
You're the inevitable
intersection.

1767
02:04:42,543 --> 02:04:44,806
And you do have to let go.

1768
02:04:44,850 --> 02:04:46,808
What's he talking about?

1769
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:49,332
You're my hero.

1770
02:05:02,606 --> 02:05:04,913
What did you do?

1771
02:05:04,957 --> 02:05:07,699
Hey, hey. Don't worry.
It's gonna heal.

1772
02:05:07,742 --> 02:05:08,743
It's gonna heal.

1773
02:05:08,787 --> 02:05:10,440
I just wanted to...

1774
02:05:28,197 --> 02:05:29,721
You tell Mom I love her.

1775
02:06:41,357 --> 02:06:42,794
Don't forget the tomatoes.

1776
02:06:55,850 --> 02:06:58,331
I used to love that
cereal when I was a kid.

1777
02:06:58,897 --> 02:07:00,376
Yeah.

1778
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:02,030
My son goes nuts for it.

1779
02:07:06,513 --> 02:07:08,558
They stop making it.

1780
02:07:08,602 --> 02:07:11,257
Well, I know they were
talking about discontinuing it.

1781
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:13,868
- Do I know you?
- No, I'm not from around here.

1782
02:07:13,912 --> 02:07:15,914
I was just visiting my mom.

1783
02:07:15,957 --> 02:07:17,306
Maybe I know her.

1784
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:18,568
What's her name?

1785
02:07:19,482 --> 02:07:21,615
She's the best...

1786
02:07:21,658 --> 02:07:23,617
and kindest person in the world.

1787
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:25,140
You okay?

1788
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:27,142
Yeah, I'm just...

1789
02:07:27,186 --> 02:07:28,226
I'm really gonna miss her.

1790
02:07:49,686 --> 02:07:51,253
I know I'm just...

1791
02:07:51,297 --> 02:07:53,386
a random lady in a store.

1792
02:07:53,429 --> 02:07:54,561
But do you want a hug?

1793
02:07:55,518 --> 02:07:56,519
Mm-hmm. Sure.

1794
02:08:02,656 --> 02:08:05,180
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't say that.

1795
02:08:07,095 --> 02:08:10,229
Your mom must be grateful
you came to visit her.

1796
02:08:10,272 --> 02:08:12,100
She's very lucky to have you.

1797
02:08:19,891 --> 02:08:21,893
I'm very lucky to have her.

1798
02:08:21,936 --> 02:08:25,461
Ah! You have to tell her that.

1799
02:08:25,505 --> 02:08:27,246
Moms like to hear
these kind of things.

1800
02:08:28,421 --> 02:08:29,422
Believe me.

1801
02:09:08,635 --> 02:09:09,897
Love you, Mom.

1802
02:09:17,731 --> 02:09:18,950
I love you more.

1803
02:09:21,039 --> 02:09:22,692
I loved you first.

1804
02:09:28,002 --> 02:09:29,090
Bye.

1805
02:09:29,134 --> 02:09:30,222
Bye.

1806
02:10:03,385 --> 02:10:04,604
I'm back.

1807
02:10:15,093 --> 02:10:16,050
Shit!

1808
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:18,444
Court!

1809
02:10:27,496 --> 02:10:29,672
original trial was initially...

1810
02:10:32,893 --> 02:10:33,981
I'm so sorry.

1811
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:40,857
As I was saying...

1812
02:10:40,901 --> 02:10:43,208
the same security
camera footage,

1813
02:10:43,251 --> 02:10:45,210
Exhibit F in the original trial,

1814
02:10:45,253 --> 02:10:47,081
was initially
considered useless,

1815
02:10:47,125 --> 02:10:48,865
but has now

1816
02:10:48,909 --> 02:10:50,650
been enhanced,

1817
02:10:50,693 --> 02:10:52,913
using the latest tech

1818
02:10:52,956 --> 02:10:54,262
from Wayne Enterprises.

1819
02:10:55,350 --> 02:10:56,221
It confirms

1820
02:10:56,830 --> 02:10:58,223
the alibi

1821
02:10:58,266 --> 02:11:00,399
Mr. Allen has argued,

1822
02:11:00,442 --> 02:11:01,878
and his son, Barry,

1823
02:11:03,054 --> 02:11:05,882
has corroborated, since day one.

1824
02:11:11,801 --> 02:11:12,802
Here.

1825
02:11:16,371 --> 02:11:20,114
Right here, you can clearly
see my client, Mr. Allen,

1826
02:11:20,158 --> 02:11:23,204
reaching for a can of tomatoes

1827
02:11:23,248 --> 02:11:25,032
on the top shelf.

1828
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:45,072
Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, can you tell us
a bit more about what happened, please?

1829
02:11:45,096 --> 02:11:47,141
Well, um...

1830
02:11:47,185 --> 02:11:49,883
the tomatoes moved from the
bottom shelf to the top shelf,

1831
02:11:49,926 --> 02:11:51,406
and subsequently,

1832
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:53,582
uncooked the spaghetti.

1833
02:11:54,714 --> 02:11:55,541
Unquote.

1834
02:11:58,109 --> 02:12:01,029
I'm sorry, that makes absolutely no
sense. What are you talking about, sir?

1835
02:12:01,068 --> 02:12:03,853
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- The allegations, the trial...

1836
02:12:03,897 --> 02:12:05,899
We're good here. Thank you.

1837
02:12:05,942 --> 02:12:08,162
statement
in the court.

1838
02:12:08,206 --> 02:12:10,295
- Did I give a good quote?
- Yeah.

1839
02:12:10,338 --> 02:12:12,384
Spaghetti.

1840
02:12:12,427 --> 02:12:14,864
Hey, speaking of food,
I was thinking, um...

1841
02:12:16,866 --> 02:12:18,129
you should ask me to dinner.

1842
02:12:19,217 --> 02:12:20,522
D-Dinner with me?

1843
02:12:20,566 --> 02:12:23,221
Yes, a date, Barry.

1844
02:12:23,264 --> 02:12:26,137
Iris West, do you
wanna dinner-date me?

1845
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:27,442
- I'd love to.
- Thank you.

1846
02:12:28,269 --> 02:12:29,401
I'd love to also.

1847
02:12:30,271 --> 02:12:31,272
Call me.

1848
02:12:52,902 --> 02:12:54,948
- Bruce!
- Congratulations.

1849
02:12:54,991 --> 02:12:57,820
Thank you. You have no idea how
good it is to hear your voice.

1850
02:12:57,864 --> 02:13:01,346
I... I have so much to tell you the next
time I see you, Bruce. You were right.

1851
02:13:01,389 --> 02:13:02,651
Okay? And I didn't listen.

1852
02:13:02,695 --> 02:13:04,610
And things did get
very, very weird,

1853
02:13:04,653 --> 02:13:06,829
but I put everything
back, I promise.

1854
02:13:06,873 --> 02:13:08,091
I'm pulling up now.

1855
02:13:09,310 --> 02:13:11,007
Oh, great.

1856
02:13:11,051 --> 02:13:12,681
- Get the shot.
- Sir, sir!

1857
02:13:12,705 --> 02:13:15,055
- Back up, please.
- Shot!

1858
02:13:15,098 --> 02:13:16,511
Sir, I'd like to ask
you for a video for the Daily Planet.

1859
02:13:16,535 --> 02:13:18,175
- Wayne! Wayne!
- Step aside.

1860
02:13:20,365 --> 02:13:22,018
Was it backed by
your own allegation?

1861
02:13:25,065 --> 02:13:26,501
Who the fuck is this?

1862
02:13:26,545 --> 02:13:28,305
He's not
answering any questions.

1863
02:13:29,287 --> 02:13:30,288
Hey, Barry.

1864
02:13:31,419 --> 02:13:32,855
No, wh-where's...

1865
02:13:33,682 --> 02:13:35,423
You're, you... No.

1866
02:13:35,467 --> 02:13:36,946
You can't...

1867
02:13:36,990 --> 02:13:39,122
You... You're not Batman.

1868
02:13:41,734 --> 02:13:42,735
What's wrong with you?

1869
02:13:44,693 --> 02:13:46,129
Huh.

1870
02:13:50,308 --> 02:13:51,352
Well...

1871
02:22:36,137 --> 02:22:37,878
I've told you it's
my metabolism, right?

1872
02:22:37,922 --> 02:22:39,793
I can't get drunk.

1873
02:22:39,837 --> 02:22:41,752
I can't get drink either.

1874
02:22:41,795 --> 02:22:44,058
Listen. Listen, I'm, 'cause
I'm trying to... No, no, no.

1875
02:22:44,102 --> 02:22:46,689
'Cause what I'm trying to explain as
simply as I possibly can, I promise...

1876
02:22:46,713 --> 02:22:49,281
They were all Batman.
They were all Bruce Wayne.

1877
02:22:49,324 --> 02:22:51,172
But each of them was a
completely different person.

1878
02:22:51,196 --> 02:22:54,634
- So, on the other line-time...
- Timeline.

1879
02:22:54,677 --> 02:22:55,678
I'm the same guy?

1880
02:22:55,722 --> 02:22:57,289
Yeah. Actually, pretty much.

1881
02:22:57,332 --> 02:22:59,073
You're lovable, furry...

1882
02:22:59,117 --> 02:23:01,467
loyal, motivated by bacon.

1883
02:23:01,510 --> 02:23:03,425
All right, listen.

1884
02:23:03,469 --> 02:23:06,167
Thank you for making it more
simpler for me, Mr. Simple More.

1885
02:23:06,211 --> 02:23:08,039
Yeah, I'm doing my
best.- -

1886
02:23:08,082 --> 02:23:10,128
Look, you're missing
the larger premise here.

1887
02:23:10,171 --> 02:23:13,087
In my timeline, when I...

1888
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:16,438
All right, come on.

1889
02:23:16,482 --> 02:23:18,005
Up, up, Broseidon.

1890
02:23:18,049 --> 02:23:19,702
All right, come on.

1891
02:23:19,746 --> 02:23:21,906
I thought you were gonna
sleep on the couch.

1892
02:23:22,531 --> 02:23:23,750
Arthur, I live right here.

1893
02:23:23,794 --> 02:23:24,795
Harry?

1894
02:23:26,013 --> 02:23:27,841
I live right here. It's okay.

1895
02:23:32,498 --> 02:23:33,629
Okay.

1896
02:23:33,673 --> 02:23:35,283
Oh, hey.

1897
02:23:35,327 --> 02:23:37,068
More beer.

1898
02:23:37,895 --> 02:23:40,506
Go fast. Oh, here! Here.

1899
02:23:40,549 --> 02:23:44,118
Here. Pay with this.

1900
02:23:44,162 --> 02:23:45,816
Arthur, this is
Atlantean treasure.

1901
02:23:45,859 --> 02:23:48,166
You... You tell them that.

1902
02:23:51,169 --> 02:23:52,561
-Yep.

1903
02:23:52,605 --> 02:23:53,519
You're a sailor.

1904
02:23:54,389 --> 02:23:56,391
He's fine.
