1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,420
Should I go find a friend?

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,580
Could you maybe find Chris?

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,200
Here's Chris.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,560
This is Chris.
-I am Chris.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,140
You have to get new friends.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,640
Hi! Thanks for last time.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,320
Hi.

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,160
We were wondering if you
were already on a Russ bus.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,800
Sana wants to join the bus meeting.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,720
We have an advantage, because
we bought a lot of toilet paper.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,360
Toilet paper rolls are a waste of time.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,600
What should we do, then?

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,660
Do we know any 97' guys?

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,780
You guys have to hook up with them.

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,220
What are you doing?

16
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,920
Good morning.

17
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,400
Did you sleep well?

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,780
No.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,440
I had a nightmare.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,840
About what?

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:36,660
I dreamed that you wore red clothes. You were completely
drunk and sang: "Tonight it's allowed to be a whore."

22
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,240
Really funny.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,680
It's you who said I should get a friend.

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,860
Yeah.
-Yeah.

25
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,240
So what's the problem?

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,240
The problem is that you don't
understand Russ time is a capitalistic..

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,640
You know Sana said I should dump you.

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,360
She said that.

29
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,260
Yes.

30
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,440
You couldn't manage
without me for one minute.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
You couldn't, could you?

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,640
You couldn't..

33
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,200
Eva?

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,720
Hi!
-Hi!

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,280
So good to see you!

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,380
It's certainly good to see you, too.

37
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,660
Did you get here now?
-Yes. I got an earlier flight.

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,200
Were you sleeping?
-No, no!

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,220
Should we get breakfast?

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,380
Yes, we can. Are you hungry?
-Yes, I'm really hungry.

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,540
[Hey friend. I saw a history test lying 
on the table here with a 3 minus. Is it recent?]

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,040
I have to talk to you.

43
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,280
I don't know what you think,
but do you feel like Sana fits in our bus group?

44
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,020
Maybe she's a bit strict.

45
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,800
She asked you to break
up with your boyfriend!

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,740
But do you agree that she can't 
join our bus? I talked to Chris..

47
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,380
Hey! Sana was wondering something.

48
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,200
How many rolls of toilet paper do you have?

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,200
Do you want to
get rid of them or not?

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,800
Eight pallets.
-Hello!

51
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,120
You said you didn't 
know anyone from '97?

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,000
I didn't.

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
He's in a bus with William.
-Is he?!

54
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,580
Who's William?
-You don't know who William is?

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,140
No.

56
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,360
He's the most handsome and
coolest guy in all of third year.

57
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
That is William.

58
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,940
Do you follow Chris on Instagram?

59
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,620
No.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,960
Do it.
-Why should I?

61
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,760
So you can get to know him.

62
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,080
I have a boyfriend.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,440
It's becoming a problem.

64
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,720
You don't have to hook up with him. Just get
to know him so we can party on the bus with William.

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,080
You can say that
that is why you're doing it.

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,880
Yeah, because he will respect and accept that..

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,740
Yes! So follow him.
-Give me your phone.

68
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,020
Do you know what he's called on Insta?

69
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,760
That's enough.

70
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,720
When he sends you
a message, reply flirtatiously.

71
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,400
Why would he send a message?

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,920
Just reply flirtatiously to his message, okay?

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,220
I have to go. Bye!
-Bye!

74
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,140
She resembles the lady from "Ã¥ndenes makt".
-I know. She's completely raw.

75
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,820
Who is Julian Dahl on Insta?

76
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,140
Don't know.

77
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,440
He stalks me.

78
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,900
Should we go to yours?
-No, we'll go to yours.

79
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,520
Eva doesn't want to tell her mom we're together.
-Why?

80
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,600
She's embarrassed of me.

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,680
I don't want her to meet 
you when you're lying in my bed.

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Okay..

83
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,220
Then invite me home for
dinner together with your mom.

84
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,220
[Thanks for the likes. Never had a stalker before.]

85
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,200
Huh?
-Huh?

86
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,480
Invite me to 
have dinner with your mom.

87
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,640
Yeah, I'll invite you to dinner.

88
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,260
When?

89
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,840
[Haha! Terrible stalker, be careful,
I'm standing outside your house.]

90
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,840
Now?

91
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,100
Yeah.. Today, tomorrow, 
on Friday, or next month?

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,820
[Haha! Freaky. Now I'm actually a little scared.
And turned on.]

93
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,820
Hello?

94
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,440
Friday.
Yeah.. Friday.

95
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,760
Who are you texting with?

96
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,320
Vilde.

97
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,280
The Russ bus boss.

98
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,620
Russ bus boss?
You're not on a bus.

99
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,900
She is, and it's really messed up.

100
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,040
Stop saying that.

101
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,240
You said that yourself last week.

102
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,360
Yeah, maybe I changed my mind.

103
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,240
Yeah, maybe you did.

104
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,640
Okay.

105
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,760
Guess who's invited to
party with the Penetrators guys?

106
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,900
Are you for real, Eva?

107
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,460
Check it out.
-William will come..

108
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,340
That's so great, Eva!
Oh my god, you arranged this for us.

109
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,220
"Penetrator party at Borkis' on Friday."

110
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,620
"Can you bring some friends?
Are they hot?"

111
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,980
Yes!

112
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,220
Relax.

113
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,260
Try to be cool.

114
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,000
We have to get alcohol!
-Yeah, I'll ring the beer man.

115
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,820
Someone else?

116
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,840
What's wrong with the beer man?

117
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,740
Are you looking at me?
Do I look like I drink?

118
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,400
I don't drink either.

119
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,420
What an awesome gang.

120
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,600
I can take some wine from my mom.
-Can you?

121
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,080
Can we share? I can pay
if you want.

122
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,300
I can't take any from my mom.
Her wine is so expensive. So she puts it..

123
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,440
Stop talking.

124
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,880
You talk too much.

125
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,420
Excuse me?

126
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,000
Seriously?

127
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,040
She can't be in our bus group.
She's completely psycho.

128
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,760
Beer man.

129
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,200
Yes please.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,140
We'd like some
beer for four girls.

131
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,440
And hundred boys!

132
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,560
Do we have to pay? We have a friend
here who's called Vilde, if she maybe can flash?

133
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,740
So we don't need to pay in cash.

134
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,540
Or maybe we can
get Noora to do it.

135
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,100
No, we don't do that.

136
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
Are you in prison?

137
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,900
Fuck.

138
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,800
What are they doing here?

139
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,860
Hi!

140
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,100
Wasn't it them who threw
her out of the bus group?

141
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,920
Wasn't it them 
who called you a slut?

142
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,520
Don't go. I'll either get
assaulted by Chris, or killed by those girls.

143
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,520
Okay. I won't leave you.

144
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:27,360
His goal was to get a girl pregnant,
but then he found another solution.

145
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,520
You're kidding! Is 
that why you're called the Penetrators?

146
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,060
William asked me if 
I wanted to go outside with him.

147
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,480
I think we'll hook up.
-Fucking hell! Go for it, you little slut!

148
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,160
Little slut?

149
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,300
Yeah, she's really slutty!

150
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,440
No, no! I'm slutty too.

151
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,300
Hello!

152
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,200
Just talk about politics with him or something!

153
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,160
Hello.

154
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Hi.

155
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,200
Are they like your crew?

156
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,040
My crew?

157
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,940
Are you on a Russ bus with them?

158
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,140
No, I'm not on a Russ bus.

159
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,360
I'm not going to be a Russ.
-Okay?

160
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,580
I just think Russ time is really lame.

161
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,200
Great, why?

162
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,120
Because Russ time capitalistic
and governed by market forces.

163
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,020
Great.

164
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,000
You're a bit brainy.

165
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,420
I like it.

166
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,920
I think it's a little hot.

167
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,520
You think it's hot?

168
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Drama!

169
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,100
I have to go.

170
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,440
What's up?
