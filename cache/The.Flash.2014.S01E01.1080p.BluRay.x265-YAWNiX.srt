1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,717
To understand what I'm about to
tell you, you need to do something first.

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:17,762
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

3
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,765
Good. You see that red blur? That's me.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,059
That too.

5
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,602
There I am again.

6
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,524
My name is Barry Allen.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,817
I am the fastest man alive.

8
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:33,992
My story is pretty simple.
My whole life, I've been running.

9
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,285
Usually from bullies.

10
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,828
Sometimes I escaped.

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,957
Sometimes I did not.

12
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,375
Tell me what happened.

13
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,502
Those guys were picking on kids...

14
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,838
just because they thought
they weren't cool. It wasn't right.

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,633
- I know.
- I guess I wasn't fast enough.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,053
No. You have such a good heart, Barry.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,806
And it's better to have a good heart
than fast legs.

18
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,684
Hello? I'm home.

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,103
- Barry got into a fight.
- Oh, yeah?

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,230
And he won.

21
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,940
Way to go, slugger.

22
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,235
Oh, and no more fighting.

23
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,506
But after that night, I was running
from something much scarier.

24
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,301
- Henry! Henry!
- Something I could never explain.

25
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,261
Something impossible.

26
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,016
- Mom! Mom!
- Barry, don't!

27
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,435
- Get back!
- Mom!

28
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,563
- Mom!
- Ah!

29
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,481
Mom!

30
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,275
- Noral!
- Stay back!

31
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,985
Nora, hold on!

32
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,404
Run, Barry. Run!

33
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,491
Mom?

34
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,076
Dad?

35
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,214
Sorry.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,385
Second robbery this week.

37
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,971
The teller ID'd Clyde
Mardon as the shooter.

38
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,058
What? Oh, jeez,
the Mardon brothers are back?

39
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,476
What do we got?

40
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,020
Perps took the bank,
shot out the cameras...

41
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,064
and killed the security guard there.

42
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,900
I got unis kicking in doors
of their known associates.

43
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,028
- CSl been over it?
- No.

44
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,571
Where's Allen?

45
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,492
Unh! Sorry, sorry.

46
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,996
- You can't keep covering for him.
- Coming through.

47
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,375
- I have to carry on without him.
- Sorry I'm late, Captain Singh.

48
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,378
What was it this time?
Forget to set your alarm clock?

49
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,506
Before you answer, the excuse you gave
last time was car trouble.

50
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,758
Wanna know why that one was memorable?

51
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,886
- I do not own a car.
- He was running an errand for me.

52
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,930
Barry, did you get me what I asked for?

53
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,975
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

54
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,145
I have it right...

55
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,605
here.

56
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,067
I had a few bites of it.

57
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,088
Getaway car is a Mustang Shelby GT500.

58
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,550
Shelbys have a rear super-wide tire
specific to that model.

59
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,635
Twelve inches with an asymmetrical tread.

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,763
And there's something else.

61
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,474
Thanks.

62
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,566
Fecal excrement. Animal, I'd guess.

63
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,901
My dad gave me that pen...

64
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,903
before he died.

65
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,322
Sorry.

66
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,504
Okay, I am ready to see this
atom smasher... Smashing.

67
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,339
There was a shooting today.

68
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,550
Your dad needs me
to process some evidence.

69
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,678
I don't know if we're gonna make it
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

70
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,055
Seeing this thing turn on is, like,
your dream.

71
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,559
Your sad little, nerdy dream.
Besides, I canceled a date for this.

72
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,644
Hands off my fries.

73
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,188
Unbelievable.

74
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,274
I'm stress eating over my dissertation.

75
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,110
We started selling cronuts at Jitters.
I ate two today.

76
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,447
If I don't graduate soon,
I'm gonna be more muffin top than woman.

77
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,948
You look amazing.

78
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,289
What is so important
about this particle accelerator, anyway?

79
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:53,794
Harrison Wells' work in Quantum Theory
is light-years ahead of anything at CERN.

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,421
You're not speaking English.

81
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,672
Okay.

82
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,593
Just imagine...

83
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,265
that that dot is everything the human
race has ever learned until this moment.

84
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,558
That include twerking?

85
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,853
That is everything we could learn
from the particle accelerator.

86
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,772
It's a new way of looking at physics.

87
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,609
It will literally change the way
that we think about everything.

88
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,569
You've gotta get a girlfriend.

89
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,239
- Hey, leave him alone. He's working.
- Hi, Dad.

90
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,492
Your test thingy is done.

91
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,621
The Mardon brothers are hiding on a farm.

92
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,457
The fecal matter I found on the street
was cow manure...

93
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,961
which contained traces of
Oxytetracycline. It's an antibiotic.

94
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,840
There are only four farms in the area
that still use it in their feed.

95
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,260
Bet you find a really sweet Shelby
parked at one of them.

96
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,804
Dad, seeing as how Barry solved
your poop problem...

97
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,223
how about letting him
go to S.T.A.R. Labs?

98
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,059
- Fine, go.
- Yes.

99
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,812
Thank you, Joe.

100
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:06,449
So, Barry, how was your trip? Did you find
proof of the impossible in Starling City?

101
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,870
Or did you just make my dad mad
for no reason?

102
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:15,667
Actually, while I was away,
I had a chance to think about...

103
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,253
you know, relationships.

104
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,255
How I'm not in one...

105
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,717
and you're not in one, either.

106
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,554
- And you're my best friend, Iris.
- You're mine too.

107
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,014
Why else would I be here?

108
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,183
- That's not what I meant. What...
- I know what you're gonna say.

109
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm not sure you do.

110
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,938
Even though we pretty much grew up
in the same house together...

111
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,482
and we're kind of
like brother and sister...

112
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,652
because we're not brother and sister,
it can get really...

113
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,613
weird to talk to me about girls.

114
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,532
But I just want you to know
that it shouldn't be awkward.

115
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,869
There is nothing I want more
than for you to meet the right person...

116
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:55,373
that totally loves and adores you
for the amazing guy that you are.

117
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,503
Took the words right out of my mouth.

118
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,464
Aren't you glad I know you so well?

119
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,016
Thank you.

120
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,560
My name is Harrison Wells.

121
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,980
Tonight, the future begins.

122
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,691
The work my team and I will do here...

123
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,944
will change our understanding
of physics...

124
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,279
will bring about
advancements in power...

125
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,365
advancements in medicine.

126
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,577
And trust me, that future
will be here faster than you think.

127
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,832
No! Hey, my laptop.
It's got my dissertation.

128
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,466
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,064
All right, kid,
you don't have to do this, all right?

130
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,442
Just give me back my friend's bag,
and we'll call it even.

131
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,778
Okay?

132
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,156
Barry.

133
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,075
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

134
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,329
Freeze! Police!

135
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,208
Or do you want to find out the hard way
you're not faster than a bullet?

136
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,798
Who is that guy,
and what is he so proud of?

137
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,926
- So he caught a mugger.
- He's a transfer from Keystone.

138
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,303
Started a few weeks ago. Eddie Thawne.

139
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,807
Oh, that's Detective Pretty Boy.

140
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,601
That's what my dad calls him.

141
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,938
Says he actually keeps score
when it comes to arrests.

142
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,482
He is pretty, though.

143
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,823
This is the last farm on Barry's list.

144
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,909
Look, I know the kid's smart,
but you said it yourself...

145
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,996
sometimes he's chasing flying pigs.

146
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,415
Well, let's check it out anyway.

147
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,261
I'm Linda Park,
and we're live outside S.T.A.R. Labs...

148
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,972
despite the weather,
which will only get worse.

149
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,559
The torrential downpour has in no way
affected the particle accelerator...

150
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:24,105
which is running smoothly according to
S.T.A.R. Lab CEQ Harrison Wells.

151
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,306
- Whoa.
- Mardon.

152
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,983
I've got a plane to catch.

153
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,906
What the hell?

154
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,333
- Unh.
- Chyre, hang in there.

155
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,844
Wait, we are now being told
to evacuate the facility.

156
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,847
The storm caused a malfunction
to the primary cooling system.

157
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,267
Officials are now trying to shut down
the particle accelerator...

158
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,145
but so far have been unable
to regain control of the...

00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,740
- What happened to him?
- Hit by lightning.

161
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,241
How's he still alive?

162
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,619
Go.

163
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,954
No heartbeat.
CBC Chem 24, type and cross four.

164
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,165
- Bag him.
- You can't be in here.

165
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,958
- I'm family.
- Charge paddles.

166
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,293
- Barry!
- Clear.

167
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,643
What are you doing?

168
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,771
- He likes this song.
- How could you possibly know that?

169
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,732
I checked his Facebook page.
I mean, he can hear everything, right?

170
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,111
Auditory functions are
the last sensory faculties to degenerate.

171
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,865
Can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face.

172
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,785
- Oh, my God.
- Where am I?

173
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,788
- He's up.
- Dr. Wells, get down to the Cortex now.

174
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,083
BP 170 over 110, pulse 120.
Pupils equally reactive to light.

175
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,461
-Look at me. Look at me
CISCO: Whoa, whoa. Relax.

176
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,673
Everything's okay, man.
You're at S.T.A.R. Labs.

177
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,424
S.T.A.R. Labs? Who are you?

178
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,636
I'm Cisco Ramon. She's Caitlin... Dr. Snow.

179
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,555
- I need you to urinate in this.
- Not this second.

180
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,351
- What is happening? What is going on?
- You were struck by lightning, dude.

181
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:49,978
What?

182
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,067
- Lightning gave me abs?
- Your muscles should be atrophied...

183
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,821
but instead they're in a chronic state
of cellular regeneration.

184
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,614
Come here. Have a seat.

185
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,825
You were in a coma.

186
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,494
- For how long?
- Nine months.

187
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,164
Welcome back, Mr. Allen.

188
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,625
We have a lot to discuss.

189
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,923
It's hard to believe I'm here. I've
always wanted to meet you face-to-face.

190
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,051
Yeah? Well, you certainly went
to great lengths to do it.

191
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,470
S.T.A.R. Labs has not been operational...

192
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,475
since FEMA categorized us
as a Class 4 hazardous location.

193
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,271
Seventeen people died that night,
many more injured...

194
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,231
myself amongst them.

195
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,525
Jesus.

196
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,485
What happened?

197
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,199
Nine months ago, the particle accelerator
went online exactly as planned.

198
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,454
For 45 minutes, I had achieved
my life's dream. And then...

199
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,248
Then there was an anomaly.

200
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,918
The electron volts became unmeasurable,
the ring under us popped.

201
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,588
Energy from that detonation
was thrown into the sky...

202
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,923
and that, in turn,
seeded a storm cloud...

203
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,052
That created a lightning
bolt that struck me.

204
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,262
That's right.

205
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,893
I was recovering myself...

206
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,519
when I heard about you.

207
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,399
The hospital was undergoing
unexplainable power outages...

208
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,902
every time you were going
into cardiac arrest...

209
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,904
which was actually a misdiagnosis...

210
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,199
because, you see,
you weren't flatlining, Barry.

211
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:31,162
Your heartbeat was moving too fast
for the EKG to register it.

212
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,415
Now, I'm not the most popular person
in town these days...

213
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,419
but Detective West and his daughter
gave me permission to bring you here...

214
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,922
where we were able to stabilize you.

215
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,465
- Iris?
- Iris, yes.

216
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,342
She came to see you quite often.

217
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,178
- She talks a lot.
- Also, she's hot.

218
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,222
- L1 need to go.
- No. You can't.

219
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,266
Caitlin's right. Now that you're awake,
we need to do tests.

220
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,645
You're still going through changes.
There's so much we don't know.

221
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,565
I'm fine, really. I feel normal.
Thank you for saving my life.

222
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,234
Really?

223
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,736
Can I keep the sweatshirt?

224
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,072
- Yeah, keep the sweatshirt.
- Okay.

225
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,579
- Right?
- Sure.

226
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,875
- Fill her up?
- Thanks.

227
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,472
Oh, my God.

228
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,728
You're awake.
Why didn't S.T.A.R. Labs call us?

229
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,230
I just woke up.

230
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,357
- Should you even be on your feet?
- Iris...

231
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,443
I'm okay.

232
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,571
I watched you die, Barry.

233
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,866
You kept dying. Your heart kept stopping.

234
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,079
It's still beating.

235
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,330
It feels really fast.

236
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,416
Oops.

237
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,716
- Are you okay, Tracy?
- Yeah, I got it.

238
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,305
My dad is gonna be so happy to see you.

239
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,765
Let me get my stuff, okay?
I'll be right back.

240
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,319
Thank you. Thank you so much.
How can I help you today?

241
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,406
"This is a robbery."

242
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,036
- Is this supposed to be a joke?
- You tell me.

243
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,176
Oh, you scared the hell out of us, kid.

244
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,595
That was quite the nap you took there,
baby face.

245
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,139
- And you still look 12.
- Heh-heh-heh.

246
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,892
You look okay. Are you really?

247
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,436
- Yeah.
- Detective West...

248
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,813
we got a 550 in progress
at Gold City Bank.

249
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,608
Two dead.
Storm's picking up on the south side.

250
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,610
- I'd grab rain gear.
- Sorry, I gotta run.

251
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,154
- Do you need my help...?
- No, you take it easy.

252
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,199
There'll be plenty for you to do
once you settle in. Let's go.

253
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,953
Hey, Allen...

254
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,371
glad to see you.

255
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,289
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Hey, Iris.

256
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,584
Detective, you should go.
My dad doesn't like to be kept waiting.

257
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,046
Glad you're back.

258
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,472
The night of the explosion,
Clyde Mardon shot Chyre.

259
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,475
Mardon and his brother died escaping.
Their plane crashed.

260
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,437
- Iris. Got a minute?
- Hey, Barry. Good to see you.

261
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,653
Screw youl!

262
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,364
You okay?

263
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,409
I'm fine. I just need some air.

264
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,661
But I'll call you tonight, all right?

265
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,588
What's happening to me?

266
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,627
Awesome.

267
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,049
You don't believe
he can run that fast, do you?

268
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:58,304
Well, I believe anything is possible,
and in a few minutes maybe you will too.

269
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,014
How does it fit?

270
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,312
It's a little snug.

271
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,816
At least you'll be moving so fast,
no one will see you.

272
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,279
See, you thought
the world was slowing down. It wasn't.

273
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:19,492
You were moving so fast, it only looked
like everyone else was standing still.

274
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,038
Dr. Wells will be monitoring
your energy output and Caitlin your vitals.

275
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,623
What do you do?

276
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,042
I make the toys, man.

277
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,796
Check it. This is a two-way headset
with a camera I modified...

278
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,923
designed to combat
battlefield impulse noise.

279
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,258
Or in your case, potential sonic booms.

280
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,968
Which would be awesome.

281
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,851
What?

282
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,312
Nothing.

283
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,690
I just notice you don't smile too much.

284
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,027
My once promising career
in bioengineering is over.

285
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,363
My boss is in a wheelchair for life.

286
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,741
The explosion that put you in a coma
also killed my fiancé.

287
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:04,704
So this blank expression
kind of feels like the way to go.

288
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:11,377
Mr. Allen, while I am extremely eager to
determine your full range of abilities...

289
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,879
I do caution restraint.

290
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,631
Yeah.

291
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,373
Whoo-hoo!

292
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,333
He passed 200 knots per hour.

293
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,045
It's not possible.

294
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,681
Mom!

295
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,641
- No, Barry!
- Mom!

296
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,478
Don't! Don't let him touch you!

297
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,690
Ah!

298
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,913
What is all this?

299
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,123
Witnesses from the robbery
at Gold City Bank.

300
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,042
Perp made off with 200 grand.

301
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,503
- Catch these guys.
- The windows blew in.

302
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,130
It was like a hurricane.

303
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,216
Everyone ran for cover.

304
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,803
We're gonna have a sketch artist work
with you, if you feel up to it.

305
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,516
Third robbery in a month
where a freak storm proceeds it.

306
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,685
Sounds like one of those Wide World
of Weird cases Barry's obsessed with.

307
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,063
- He's not obsessed.
- Guess you haven't read his blog.

308
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,107
- Security cameras at the bank?
- Apparently all shorted out.

309
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,443
Well, we got a bunch of witnesses here.

310
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,737
They all have cell phones.

311
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:06,242
The sky went black and then, boom,
outside was inside.

312
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,869
It was like there was
a thunderstorm in the bank.

313
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,914
Vukuvich, suspect is driving
a black Mustang...

314
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,708
partial plate six-kilo-Charlie-three.

315
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,710
- Put out an APB.
- Copy that.

316
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,675
It looks like you had
a distal radius fracture.

317
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,884
Had?

318
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,179
It's healed. In three hours.

319
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,597
How is that even possible?

320
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,892
We don't know. Yet.

321
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,228
You really need to learn how to stop.

322
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,730
What happened out there today?

323
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,359
You were moving pretty well and then
something caused you to lose focus.

324
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,405
I started remembering something.

325
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,661
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

326
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,418
It was late.

327
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,421
The sound woke me up.

328
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:04,258
I came downstairs...

329
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,928
and I saw what looked
like a ball of lightning.

330
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,431
Inside the lightning...

331
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,100
there was a man.

332
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,229
He killed my mom.

333
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,691
They arrested my dad.

334
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,611
He's still sitting in Iron Heights
for her murder.

335
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:29,950
Everyone, the cops, the shrinks,
they all told me what I saw was impossible.

336
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,916
But what if the man who killed my mom
was like me?

337
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:41,462
Well, I think I can say unequivocally,
you are one of a kind.

338
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,887
Can I help you, detective?

339
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,474
You can stop acting like you can't stand me
when your dad's around.

340
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:58,062
Aw. I like having a boyfriend
who isn't shot to death.

341
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,790
You can't tell my dad.
He doesn't know about me and Eddie.

342
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,042
Doesn't seem like
anyone's in on the secret.

343
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,543
I was gonna tell you.

344
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,837
When you were in the hospital...

345
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,007
Eddie covered my father's shifts
so we could both be with you.

346
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:32,388
I thanked him with a cup of coffee,
and things just kind of happened.

347
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,056
And it's good.

348
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,687
Dating your partner's daughter.
Isn't that against department regulations?

349
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:44,024
- Why are you so upset?
- I just don't like having to lie to your dad.

350
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,746
Barry?

351
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,189
Hey! Mardon!

352
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,986
That poor man.

353
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,031
The way that fog came in,
I have never seen anything like it.

354
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,783
Barry! Iris.

355
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,577
I'm all right, Dad.

356
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,788
What were you thinking,
having her out here?

357
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,499
I told you, when you see danger,
you run the other way.

358
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,542
- You're not a cop.
- You wouldn't let me.

359
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,336
- Damn right!
- We need to talk.

360
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,505
- It can wait.
- No, now.

361
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,509
I know who did this.

362
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:37,429
It's Clyde Mardon.
I know, everybody thinks he died...

363
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,891
in a plane crash after the S.T.A.R.
Labs explosion, but he's alive.

364
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,354
Something happened to him that night. I...

365
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,148
I think he can control the weather.

366
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,237
The recent robberies, they all happened
during freak meteorological events.

367
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:57,741
And when I just confronted Mardon,
the street was instantly enveloped in fog.

368
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,537
Of course you don't believe me.

369
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,415
- You never believe me.
- Okay.

370
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:10,295
You want to do this now? Out here?
Fine. Mardon is dead.

371
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,381
There is no controlling the weather.

372
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,509
Just like there was no lightning storm
in your house that night.

373
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:19,304
It was your brain helping a
scared little boy accept what he saw.

374
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,014
- My dad did not...
- Yes, he did!

375
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,892
Your dad killed your mother, Barry.
I am sorry, son.

376
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,728
I knew it, the jury knew it.
He's paying for what he did.

377
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,397
- Dad, enough.
- Iris.

378
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,816
I've done my best to take care of you
since that night.

379
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,485
I've never asked for anything in return.
Not even a thank-you.

380
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:39,491
But what I do ask now is that you for
once in your life see things as they are.

381
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,794
You're not gonna believe this.

382
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,006
We got the eyewitness sketch of the robber
from the bank job.

383
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,594
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that's Clyde Mardon.

384
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,431
But that's impossible. He's dead, right?

385
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,977
I wasn't the only one affected by the
particle accelerator explosion, was I?

386
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,064
We don't know for sure.

387
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,318
You said the city was safe,
that there was no residual danger.

388
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,945
But that's not true.
What really happened that night?

389
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,159
Well, the accelerator went active.

390
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,205
We all felt like heroes, and then...

391
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,124
it all went wrong.
The dimensional barrier ruptured...

392
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,335
unleashing unknown energies
into our world.

393
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,670
Antimatter, dark energy, X-elements...

394
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,090
- Those are all theoretical.
- And how theoretical are you?

395
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,929
We mapped the dispersion throughout
and around Central City...

396
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,599
though we have no way of knowing
exactly what or who was exposed.

397
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:49,770
We've been searching
for other meta-humans like yourself.

398
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,105
- "Meta-humans"?
- That's what we're calling them.

399
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,025
I saw one today. He's a bank robber.

400
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,568
He can control the weather.

401
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,072
- This just keeps getting cooler.
- This is not cool.

402
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,281
All right? A man died.

403
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,619
Mardon must have gotten his powers
the same way I did...

404
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,830
from the storm cloud.
He's still out there.

405
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,333
We have to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

406
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,461
Barry. That's a job for the police.

407
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,089
- I work for the police.
- As a forensic assistant.

408
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,676
You're responsible for this. For him.

409
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,636
What's important is you.

410
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,639
Not me. I lost everything.

411
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:31,019
I lost my company. I lost my reputation.
I lost my freedom.

412
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:35,357
And then you broke your arm,
and it healed in three hours.

413
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:39,945
Inside your body could be a map
to a whole new world.

414
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:45,325
Genetic therapies, vaccines, medicines,
treasures buried deep within your cells.

415
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,997
And we cannot risk losing everything
because you want to go out and play hero.

416
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,667
You're not a hero.

417
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,004
You're just a young man
who was struck by lightning.

418
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,401
I didn't do it.
I swear to God, I didn't do this.

419
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,404
- Dad, why are they taking you?
- Don't go in the house.

420
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,489
- Where's Mom?
- What will happen to my son?

421
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,907
- Dad!
- Barry!

422
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,784
- Dad!
- Stay out of the house.

423
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,870
Barry.

424
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,666
Joe, you know these people?

425
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:39,338
- My daughter's best friends with their kid.
- I'm sorry.

426
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,389
Mom.

427
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,059
- Barry.
- Mom!

428
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:10,869
So that's my story. I've spent my
whole life searching for the impossible.

429
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:17,542
Never imagining that I would
become the impossible.

430
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,591
So why come to me?

431
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:29,096
Something tells me you didn't just run
600 miles to say hi to a friend.

432
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,390
All my life I've wanted...

433
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,892
to just do more.

434
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,644
Be more.

435
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,062
And now I am.

436
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,690
And the first chance I get to help someone,
I screw up.

437
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,821
What if Wells is right?
What if I'm not a hero?

438
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,698
What if I'm just some guy
who was struck by lightning?

439
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,160
I don't think that bolt of lightning
struck you, Barry.

440
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,204
I think it chose you.

441
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,709
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.

442
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,463
I don't know if I can be some vigilante.

443
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,007
You can be better.

444
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,262
Because you can inspire people...

445
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,306
in a way that I never could.

446
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,018
Watching over your city
like a guardian angel.

447
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,812
Making a difference...

448
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,774
saving people...

449
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,193
in a flash.

450
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,825
Take your own advice.

451
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,035
Wear a mask.

452
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:42,961
Cool.

453
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,717
Cool.

454
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,973
I've been going over unsolved cases
from the past nine months.

455
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,935
And there's been a sharp increase
in unexplained deaths and missing people.

456
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,854
Your meta-humans have been busy.

457
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,357
I'm not blaming you. I know you didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

458
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,901
I know you all lost something.

459
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:10,447
But I need your help to catch Mardon
and anyone else out there like him.

460
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,865
I can't do it without you.

461
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,331
If we're gonna do this...

462
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,500
I have something that might help.

463
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,002
Something I've been playing with.

464
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,631
It's designed to replace the turnouts
firefighters traditionally wear.

465
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,133
I thought if S.T.A.R. Labs
did something nice...

466
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,594
maybe people wouldn't be so angry
at Dr. Wells.

467
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,304
How is it going to help me?

468
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,681
It's made of a reinforced tri-polymer.

469
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:41,102
It's heat and abrasive resistant to withstand
your moving at high-velocity speeds.

470
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,855
The aerodynamic design
should help you maintain control.

471
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,816
Plus, it has built-in sensors
SO we can track your vitals...

472
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,528
- and stay in contact with you from here.
- Thanks.

473
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,862
How do we find Mardon?

474
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,492
I retasked S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite
to track meteorological abnormalities.

475
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,160
We just got a ping.

476
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,830
Atmospheric pressure dropped 20 millibars
in a matter of seconds.

477
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,251
I've tracked it to a
farm just west of the city.

478
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,547
I'm not saying Mardon is alive...

479
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:13,051
but if he was, this is the last place
him and his brother hid out. Let's go.

480
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,022
Mardon.

481
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:29,109
On your feet, hands on your head.

482
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,944
You got me. Heh.

483
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:36,825
The night of the storm,
after S.T.A.R. Labs blew...

484
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,996
after our plane went down,
and I woke up on the ground alive...

485
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,873
when I saw what I
could do, I understood.

486
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,503
- I am God.
- Shut the hell up.

487
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,215
Turn around.

488
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,762
Unh!

489
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,226
Do you think your guns can stop God?

490
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,854
Why in the hell
would God need to rob banks?

491
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:11,026
You're right. I've been thinking too small.

492
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,515
Whoa!

493
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,649
Barry. Barry, this thing's getting closer.

494
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,234
Wind speeds are 200 miles per hour
and increasing.

495
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,488
- Barry, can you hear me?
- Yeah. Loud and clear.

496
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,658
If it keeps up,
this could become an F-5 tornado.

497
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,161
And it's headed towards the city.
How do I stop it?

498
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,871
Guys?

499
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,211
- What if I unravel it?
- How are you gonna do that?

500
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,297
I'll run around it in the opposite
direction. Cut off its legs.

501
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,716
He'd have to clock 700 miles per hour
to do that.

502
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,552
You may not be able
to handle those speeds. You'll die.

503
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,514
I have to try.

504
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,778
- Ha, ha. Suit's holding up.
- But he's not.

505
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,738
He can do it. I know he can do it.

506
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,088
It's too strong.

507
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,635
It's time to think big.

508
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,393
You can do this, Barry.

509
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,730
You were right.
I am responsible for all of this.

510
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,691
So many people have been hurt
because of me.

511
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:18,820
When I looked at you, all I saw
was another potential victim of my hubris.

512
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:23,700
And yes, I created this madness.
But you, Barry, you can stop it.

513
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,952
You can do this.

514
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,622
Now run, Barry. Run!

515
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,920
Barry?

516
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,757
Hey.

517
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,889
I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

518
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,935
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

519
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,734
- Barry?
- It's over.

520
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:40,985
I'm okay.

521
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,602
What you can do...

522
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,480
it was the lightning bolt?

523
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,441
More or less.

524
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,487
I'm sorry, Barry.

525
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,490
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

526
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,328
And I called you crazy
for chasing the impossible.

527
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,957
But you really did see something
that night your mom died.

528
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,587
And your dad is innocent.

529
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,800
I need you to promise me something.

530
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,637
I don't want you telling Iris
about anything you can do.

531
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,931
Any of it. I want her safe.

532
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,601
Promise me.

533
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,186
Yeah.

534
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,458
Hey, slugger.

535
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,836
You've been calling me that since I was 11.

536
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,007
Funny thing is
I finally got into a fight today.

537
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:30,970
You just got out of a coma,
I'm not sure you should be picking fights.

538
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,182
Hey.

539
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,726
Did you win?

540
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,938
Yeah, I did.

541
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,530
You didn't kill Mom.

542
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,533
You know I know that, right?

543
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:58,373
You believing me is all I need.

544
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,212
You won't be in here much longer.

545
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,381
Whoever killed Mom...

546
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,259
whatever killed her...

547
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,472
I think I finally have a way
to find them, to stop them.

548
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,809
Barry, we've talked about this.

549
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:23,398
It's time to let it go.
You've got to stop worrying about me...

550
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,817
and live your life.

551
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:33,241
For the first time, I
feel like I finally can.

552
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,246
The truth is, since the night Mom died,
I've been stuck in one place...

553
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,083
missed out on a lot of things.

554
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,585
But I'm different now.

555
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,587
I made some new friends.

556
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,548
They're helping me find my way.

557
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:52,593
- Why is it shaped like a lightning bolt?
- So it's not boring.

558
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,929
To finally move forward.

559
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,598
You remember when you wanted me
to change my name...

560
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,894
So I wouldn't have to deal
with people knowing you're my dad?

561
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,440
I'm glad they know.

562
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:13,281
I'm so proud to be your son.

563
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,580
I love you, son.

564
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,876
I love you too, Dad.

565
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,643
My name is Barry Allen...

566
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,896
and I am the fastest man alive.

567
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,236
A friend recently gave me the idea
for a new name.

568
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,578
And something tells me it's gonna catch on.
