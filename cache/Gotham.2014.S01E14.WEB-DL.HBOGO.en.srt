1
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,720
(Foreign language)

2
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,040
You're sure, now?

3
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,720
Fish Mooney is done.

4
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,480
She tried to bring down Falcone.

5
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,080
She failed.

6
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,080
Last time I saw her, Victor Zsasz
had her cornered.

7
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,000
We can assume she's either dead
or extremely unwell.

8
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,200
Well, then. Salud.

9
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,640
You know, this creates some
intriguing opportunities.

10
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,800
Falcone will struggle
to hold on to her territories.

11
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,400
- If we move quickly...
- My thinking exactly.

12
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,320
In fact,

13
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I took the liberty
of claiming her nightclub.

14
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,120
In your name, of course.

15
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,640
You did, huh?

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,800
Good thinking.

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,040
A bird in the hand is nine-tenths
of the law, right?

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,760
Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,120
Phone for you, boss.

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,640
- Speak.
-<i>Hello, Sal.</i>

21
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,880
<i>Hey.</i>

22
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,560
You sound surprised.

23
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Let me guess...

24
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,600
Your little friend Penguin told you
I was dead.

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,360
As good as.

26
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,760
I'm just on a vacation for a while.

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,560
- Huh.
<i>- I'm not going to lie,</i>

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,200
<i>I thought I was gonna end up on top.</i>

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,600
<i>Instead, I got played.</i>

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,080
<i>Turns out, Penguin has been
Falcone's man the whole time.</i>

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,560
They played us both for suckers.

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,960
Is that right?

33
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,640
Oh, indeed.

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,720
He told me himself, right
before I was about to gut him.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,000
You understand why I might be
skeptical,

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,800
considering it's you telling me this.

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,480
<i>Oh, wake up, dummy.</i>

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,760
<i>You mean to tell me this whole time
you haven't suspected anything?</i>

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,400
That he hasn't made one slip
that he's had to explain away?

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,880
<i>Or maybe even you wanted
to believe his lies.</i>

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,160
<i>But it still gnaws at you,
doesn't it?</i>

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,760
<i>The doubt.</i>

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,400
It's right there. A smudge.

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,640
Don't let it happen again.

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,240
Maybe a couple of times.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,720
<i>It's time to get your house
in order, Salvatore.</i>

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
And remember who put you wise.

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
Not bad news, I hope.

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,760
Nah. I got to go upstate.

50
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,960
See a guy about a thing.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,240
Come with me.

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,000
We can talk about opportunities.

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,080
Sure.

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,920
- Just, let me run home and...
- Bup, bup.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
We got to go now. Right now.

56
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,800
Super.

57
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,080
I love a road trip.

58
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,360
Harvey?

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,280
- Captain.
- What have we got?

60
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,040
Sometime last night, Mr. Lucky
there got tied to that chair

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,280
noose was dropped over his neck

62
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,720
and he's heaved over the side.

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,880
Some suits coming up
for a smoke this morning found him.

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,400
How'd he get back up to the roof?

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,560
See that pulley there?

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,440
My guess, it was the killer.

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,600
Guy went to a lot of trouble
to get him back up.

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
Why not just leave him hanging?

69
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,320
- Morning, Captain.
- Morning, Ed.

70
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,680
The more you cut me the bigger
I grow. What am I?

71
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
We're on a rooftop, Nygma.

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,120
- Don't tempt me.
- A hole. I'm a hole.

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,840
Okay. Relevance?

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,320
There's a hole, a surgical incision
in our victim's abdomen.

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Certainly postmortem.

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,680
My guess killer was looking
for something.

77
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,600
I'll have to examine the body
more fully back at the lab.

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,120
You mean the medical examiner will.

79
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,680
- Well, but...
- You handle forensics, Ed.

80
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,520
The bodies belong to Dr. Guerra.

81
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,160
And he's made formal complaints.
I can't cover for you anymore.

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,640
I read you, ma'am.

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,520
Loud and clear.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
- So where's Gordon?
- Personal stuff. He'll be in soon.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,440
Hey, don't stand so near the edge.

86
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,760
You worried about me, Captain?

87
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
You know I don't start drinking
till noon.

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,720
I got to spell it out for you?

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Detective Flass had a lot of friends

90
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,120
and your partner arrested him
for murder.

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,640
Accidents happen.

92
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
You put the cuffs on him.

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,480
So we should all be careful.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,680
To hell with them.

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,520
Barbara?

96
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,720
- Hi.
- Let go of me.

97
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,840
- How long you been here?
- Just last night.

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,600
And a couple times before.

99
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,360
I knew your girlfriend was gone

100
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
and I heard you got sent
to guard that loony bin

101
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,120
so I figured better here
than sleeping on the street.

102
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,000
- Have you seen Barbara?
- No.

103
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,480
Oh, so things are over
between you two, huh?

104
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,600
Sure you should be here then?
Maybe you're the one breaking in.

105
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,760
Came by to drop off keys.
Go get your stuff.

106
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
- Why? Where are you taking me?
- Well, you're not staying here,

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,160
and you're not gonna
stay on the street.

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,680
I'll find you someplace safe.

109
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,480
Safe.

110
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,800
Safe like Wayne Manor?

111
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,880
That was your last great idea.

112
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,000
So someplace else.

113
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,760
You're still my only
witness to the Wayne murders.

114
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,040
You haven't talked to Bruce
since he got back?

115
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,760
- No. Why?
- Because I told him already.

116
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,880
I didn't see anything. I lied.

117
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,240
Sucks about your girlfriend.

118
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,960
She's got some really nice stuff.

119
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,520
Hey, wait!

120
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Stop!

121
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
{\an5}Detective James Gordon
to see you, Master Bruce.

122
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,000
{\an5}- Detective.
- Bruce, how are you?

123
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,320
I'm fine, thank you.

124
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,760
{\an5}I would've come by earlier,
but things were a little crazy.

125
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,560
You were gone for a while.

126
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,240
{\an5}Switzerland.

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,440
{\an5}Probably wise.

128
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,320
I saw Selina Kyle.

129
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,960
She told me she lied.

130
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,080
{\an5}- She saw nothing.
- Yes.

131
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,600
{\an5}That's what she told me.

132
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,840
{\an5}She made up the story
to get out of juvie.

133
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,560
{\an5}She could be saying
this now because she's scared.

134
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,600
{\an5}It would be understandable
after what happened.

135
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,640
{\an5}No.

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,200
{\an5}She doesn't scare easily.

137
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,400
{\an5}I believe her.
She didn't see the killer.

138
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,000
{\an5}Look, this is unfortunate,

139
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
{\an5}but it doesn't mean
we're back to square one.

140
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,320
{\an5}Someone sent assassins after her.

141
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,240
Only a guilty person would do that.

142
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,560
{\an5}Yes, and led her bloody
assassins to the manor.

143
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,200
Thank you very much.

144
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,680
{\an5}Anyway, you need no longer
concern yourself with the case.

145
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
{\an5}Bruce, this isn't the time
to give up.

146
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,800
I'm not giving up.

147
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,960
{\an5}I don't understand.

148
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,440
{\an5}Months ago, you promised you'd find

149
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,400
{\an5}who killed my parents,
and in all that time,

150
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,880
{\an5}you've managed to find one witness,
who turned out to be a liar.

151
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
{\an5}An investigation
like this takes time.

152
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,960
{\an5}I understand,
but I don't want you to feel bound

153
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,360
{\an5}by an oath you can't fulfill.

154
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,320
{\an5}I'm releasing you from your promise.

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,200
{\an5}I'll pursue the matter on my own.

156
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,640
{\an5}- Bruce.
- Yeah, no, I really wouldn't

157
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
{\an5}bother, actually, mate.

158
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,600
{\an5}Once Master Bruce makes up his mind,
there's no arguing with him.

159
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,800
{\an5}He can't pursue this case on his own.

160
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,200
- It's too dangerous.
- Then I'll have to look after him.

161
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,280
Can I show you the door?

162
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,200
Hey, sleepy head. We're here.

163
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,880
You smell that air?

164
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,840
That's country air.

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,320
Let's get some chow.

166
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,760
Chow.

167
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,480
Excellent.

168
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,680
- So where's the guy?
- Which guy?

169
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,680
The guy with the thing.

170
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,080
Oh, he'll be along.

171
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,600
- You don't like the coffee?
- I like the coffee.

172
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,280
How about the oatmeal?

173
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,400
Also delicious.

174
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,840
It's good to get
out of the city, huh?

175
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,840
Away from the fumes, the noise.

176
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,640
I can finally hear myself think.

177
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
It's all so simple
and clean and honest out here.

178
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,000
Fresh air, oatmeal,

179
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,280
good friends.

180
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,400
How true.

181
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,360
In Gotham, we never have
any time to connect, to reflect.

182
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,320
- You feel that?
- Absolutely.

183
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,280
This guy with the thing...

184
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,640
- What is the thing?
- Stop worrying about that guy.

185
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,440
You know what I was thinking about?

186
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,280
This is crazy.

187
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,400
Indian Hill.

188
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,520
You know, that dump in Arkham
that I traded to Falcone

189
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,840
for your neck.

190
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,440
How could I forget?

191
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,640
I'm eternally grateful.

192
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,640
You suggested it,
whispered it in my ear.

193
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,240
It's worthless land.

194
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,120
But was it so worthless?

195
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
I mean, Falcone snapped it up
pretty quick.

196
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,760
It was a token.

197
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,760
He simply needed to save face.
After Nikolai died...

198
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,880
Oh, see, you wouldn't believe it.

199
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,080
That's the other thing
I was thinking about.

200
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,640
The fight with Nikolai
when Frankie was killed.

201
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,240
What was he stabbed, like, ten times?

202
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
I don't recall the exact number.

203
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,240
Only, it was a gunfight.

204
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,040
How'd Frankie get killed
with a knife?

205
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
That always kind of bugged me.

206
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,680
Honestly, I'm not much use
when things get physical.

207
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm sorry I couldn't save him.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,960
I was just reminiscing.

209
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,240
Don't beat yourself up about it.

210
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,760
We all got our talents, right?

211
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,160
Yes, we do.

212
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,560
Me...

213
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,840
I'm deceptively quick for a big guy.

214
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,440
Yes, you are.

215
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm gonna go get some air.

216
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,960
Wait for the guy with the thing, hmm?

217
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,200
The guy. Right.

218
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,240
How about getting it right
the first time

219
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,840
so we don't have to keep doing this?

220
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,920
- Detective Bullock?
- It's my name. Don't wear it out.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,680
I'm Scottie Mullens.
You called me about Adam Jodowsky.

222
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,240
Oh... oh, Miss Mullens, yes.

223
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,840
Thank you for stopping by.

224
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,280
- Oh, Miss? Mrs.?
- Miss.

225
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Good. Good. Please.

226
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,160
So...

227
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,920
how did you know Mr. Jodowsky?

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,960
I was his sponsor, sort of.

229
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,960
We're... we're in a support group
together.

230
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,880
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Why would you say that?

231
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,440
This is a homicide division.
You're a homicide detective.

232
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,600
We found his body this morning.

233
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,600
Your number was in his pocket.

234
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,320
I'd just given it to him.

235
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,520
I recently started being his sponsor.

236
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,840
So, oh, what kind of group is this?

237
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,520
Oh, for booze, pills?

238
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,480
It's for people suffering
from phobias.

239
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,200
- You're joking.
- Fear can be debilitating.

240
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,400
It helps to talk to someone about it.

241
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,360
- Don't be an ass.
- Excuse me?

242
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,800
You were about to make fun.
Don't be an ass.

243
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,920
You're right. I'm sorry. I was.
No fun-making. Please.

244
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,320
What was Mr. Jodowsky's phobia?

245
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,160
Heights.

246
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,760
So if he was found dangling
from the top of a tall building...

247
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, my God. Is that how he?

248
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm gonna need the names of all
the people in the support group.

249
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,800
It's completely anonymous.

250
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,720
Adam was the only one I knew
personally.

251
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,960
You don't think someone
from the group did this?

252
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Could be.

253
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,800
Killer certainly seemed
to know of his phobia.

254
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Are you Irish?

255
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,080
You seem like you could be Irish.

256
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
- What's it to you?
- I'm just curious.

257
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,280
- When's the next meeting?
- Tonight, 6 o'clock.

258
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,320
And these things...
They usually run, what, an hour?

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,800
So, you could maybe go to dinner
afterwards.

260
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,320
Hypothetically.

261
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,560
Hypothetically.

262
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,440
Okay, well, I'm gonna
keep working the case,

263
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,680
and I'm gonna call you if I feel
the need to go to this meeting.

264
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,920
We're gonna find who did this.

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,160
I promise, Miss Mullens.

266
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,760
Okay.

267
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,920
So I went through
the materials from the scene.

268
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,560
Ropes and pulleys can be bought
anywhere.

269
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,120
For what it's worth, I traced
the chair the victim was tied to.

270
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,960
Yeah. I'm listening.

271
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,480
Banker's chair, wooden, made
by some company in the Narrows

272
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,800
that's been closed down for years.

273
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,640
Great. Let's go.

274
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,920
You sure?
That's a pretty thin lead, Harv.

275
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,640
Since when have you been
scared of a little work, huh?

276
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,080
What was he after?

277
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,480
Well, now.

278
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,920
There! See? I told you!

279
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,080
Oh. Oh, dear.

280
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,560
Get your hand out of that corpse.

281
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,760
- Now.
- I was just passing by, and I

282
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,760
I was... I was just curious.

283
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,520
What was I thinking?

284
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,840
I... Sorry.
Won't happen again. Promise.

285
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,360
Do something about this
or I'm going over your head.

286
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,760
I'm the medical examiner!
Not this gibbering loon!

287
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,520
I'm sorry, Ed.

288
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,160
Till further notice,
you're suspended.

289
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,400
Finally.

290
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,760
But I found something.

291
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,400
So, word around the house is that
you and Doc Caliente have a thing.

292
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,680
Thompkins?

293
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,120
Yeah, kind of. I guess.

294
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,160
So you and Barbara
are finally finito?

295
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,840
Yeah.

296
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,560
Dropped the keys off
at her apartment today.

297
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,720
Get any of that righteous
breakup sex?

298
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,320
She wasn't there.

299
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,480
You notice I don't ask
you about your love life?

300
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,120
My love life is an open book
and a short and nasty one.

301
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
But I'm working on the Vic's friend

302
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,040
in the phobia support group,
and unless she's the killer,

303
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,120
- I think I'm in there.
- You see why I don't ask?

304
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,080
Don't screw it up with the doctor.

305
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
I'll try not to.

306
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,320
Seriously, been willing
to forgive you on account

307
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,960
of you're not getting laid,
but you mean to tell me

308
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,600
this whole time you've
been making speeches,

309
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,640
raising hell, you've had a woman?

310
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,760
The thought of what you would do
if alone is truly terrifying.

311
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,400
GCPD!

312
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,560
Drop the knife!

313
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,240
What the hell?

314
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,120
Thin lead, huh?

315
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,320
Come in.

316
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,160
I hope everything is to
your satisfaction, ma'am.

317
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,720
It is. Thank you, Captain.

318
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,960
You can see Gotham on the horizon
if you want to say good-bye.

319
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,040
No need. I'll be back soon enough.

320
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,560
Well if you need anything,
just let me know.

321
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,080
I will.

322
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,800
This lucky fellow and the previous
victim

323
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,040
are both part of the same
phobia support group.

324
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,880
Pigs. Go figure.

325
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,000
How is he?

326
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,040
He's at Gotham General,
scared half to death.

327
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,200
The medics had to sedate him.

328
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,160
The man you shot
was he in this group, too?

329
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,800
Nope. No ID as yet.
We're running his prints.

330
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,800
So is he our man or are we
still looking for someone else?

331
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,600
- Hard to say.
- He's our man.

332
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,800
These sort of wackos work alone.

333
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,240
I'm gonna run by the support group,
tell them it's been settled.

334
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,440
Hey, we don't know that yet.

335
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,640
You need to be more optimistic.

336
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,960
You do.
You need to be more optimistic.

337
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,240
We have a perp.

338
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,000
The postmortem incision on
the first victim is weird.

339
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,280
The killer was after something.
I want to know what.

340
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
I'm gonna ask Nygma to take a look.

341
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,520
No. He's been suspended.

342
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,800
You got the report from the M.E.

343
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,080
The same M.E. who said
my last witness stabbed himself

344
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,760
to death in the back with
an ice pick?

345
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,600
No. No, thanks. Nygma...

346
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,120
Is not the medical examiner.

347
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,880
I like him, too.

348
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,240
But there's nothing I can do,
not with the way things are.

349
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,720
- What do you mean?
- Look, I'm glad we took down Flass,

350
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,360
but there are people you go
after and people you don't.

351
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,760
So now everything we do
is being watched.

352
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,160
You got the bad guy. Let it go.

353
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,120
- I'm sorry you got dragged into it.
- Don't be.

354
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Felt good.

355
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,000
Did, didn't it?

356
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,640
Miss Kringle,
I came to tell you that I...

357
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,560
- Have you been crying?
- No, no. I'm, I'm fine.

358
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,400
But I can see tears on your face.

359
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,960
Is it because your friend
Detective Flass was arrested?

360
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,120
- What do you need, Mr. Nygma?
- Yes.

361
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I've been suspended
and won't be seeing you anymore.

362
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,560
So I wanted to return this pencil.

363
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,160
I took it from your office
some time ago.

364
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,400
I kept meaning to return it.

365
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,800
Used to be longer.

366
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,040
You're an odd man, Mr. Nygma.

367
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,040
But I'm sorry that you've been
suspended.

368
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,080
I wish something could be done.

369
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,040
Have a seat. We got to talk.

370
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
I feel that the time
has come in our relationship

371
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,720
when we should have trust
with each other.

372
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,520
Real trust.

373
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,880
Total honesty between us.

374
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,040
No secrets.

375
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,680
I 100 percent agree.

376
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,280
So here's a secret to start off.

377
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,800
There is no guy with a thing. I lied.

378
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,280
I was beginning to wonder about him.

379
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,800
Now you.

380
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,680
- Me?
- We're being honest.

381
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,400
You have to tell me a secret
in return.

382
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,040
Secrets from you, Don Maroni?

383
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,160
I have none.

384
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,040
Please.

385
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,880
Honestly...
I don't really like oatmeal.

386
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,240
Good to know.

387
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,400
See, I like this game.

388
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,600
I'll tell you another secret.

389
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,360
Fish Mooney's alive.

390
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,840
I spoke to her.

391
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,280
Good secret, huh?

392
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,440
- What did Fish say?
- Oh, no.

393
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,320
You have to tell me a secret first.

394
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,840
That's how it works.

395
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,120
I don't much like coffee either.

396
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,240
Fair enough.

397
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,520
What did Fish say?

398
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,160
Said you and Falcone have been
working together all this time.

399
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,640
She said you've been playing me

400
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,960
for a chump since the first day
I met you.

401
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,800
She would say that, wouldn't she?

402
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,920
The bitch.

403
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
You don't believe her, do you?

404
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,640
Well, she did put some incidents

405
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,880
in a different and troubling light,
I must say.

406
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,760
Well, that's too bad.

407
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,000
Your turn. Tell me another secret.

408
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,760
A good one this time.

409
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,480
I took your gun.

410
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,680
I have it right here.

411
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
That's a good secret.

412
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,320
I took it because I figured
Mooney had called you somehow.

413
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,960
I knew you might believe her.

414
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,600
Doesn't mean she's telling the truth.

415
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,720
Is she?

416
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,560
Have you been playing
me for a chump, Penguin?

417
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,960
I think it's your turn
to tell a secret.

418
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,560
You little dirtbag.

419
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,360
I treated you like a friend.

420
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Like a monkey friend.

421
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,320
You're the zookeeper, remember?

422
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,680
Tell me a secret now.

423
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,640
Just one more then.

424
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,240
I'm tired of this game.

425
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,320
That gun is loaded with blanks.

426
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,360
Liar.

427
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,120
- You...
- Yeah.

428
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,920
Good secret, huh?

429
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,760
Hi.

430
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,280
Hi.

431
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,120
- Thank you for coming.
- I was glad to get your call.

432
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,760
How are things at Arkham?

433
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,120
Little less interesting since
you've left.

434
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
How are things at the precinct?

435
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Oh, well, actually,
that was what I was hoping

436
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,160
you could help me with.

437
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,040
Oh, we've got this case,

438
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,160
and I can't understand
what exactly our perp was doing.

439
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,160
And our medical examiner
is kind of a clown.

440
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,080
Oh, something wrong?

441
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,320
No, not at all.

442
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,720
Only, last time we met,
you were very passionate.

443
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,640
So when you called me, I thought...

444
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,920
Well, whatever.

445
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,080
I put on lipstick.

446
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,720
And you want forensic advice.

447
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,440
You're very confusing.

448
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,360
I don't mean to be.

449
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,760
Case is a pretext.

450
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,680
- I wanted to see you.
- Why didn't you just say that?

451
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,120
I should have.
I haven't done this in a while.

452
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,640
I'm a little rusty.

453
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,280
Sorry.

454
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,640
All right.

455
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,080
Well, good.

456
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,640
I don't like to put on lipstick
by mistake.

457
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
So, what's the issue?

458
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,560
Oh, no, no, no, forget the case.

459
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,160
- Don't worry.
- Please.

460
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,920
I'm interested.

461
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,160
Excuse me.

462
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,480
Gordon.

463
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,160
When?

464
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,840
Oh, yeah, okay. Take his statement.
I'll be right there.

465
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,920
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- I'm fine.

466
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,360
- You sure?
- Yes. I'll bring this back to you.

467
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
<i>It's Harvey.</i>

468
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Harvey, second victim woke up.

469
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,440
Says he was abducted by two men.

470
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,840
There's someone still out there.

471
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,760
It's kind of you to come here
and tell us what happened.

472
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,400
No problem. I just didn't want
you worrying, so...

473
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,640
To be honest, you don't strike
me as the fraidy cat type.

474
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,280
Phobics are not fraidy cats.

475
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,440
I know. It's just, you seem
like a strong lady is all.

476
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,880
I am strong.

477
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,760
I just happen to be
terrified of swimming pools.

478
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,360
You're kidding.

479
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,680
Well, I can see how that might be
a thing.

480
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,400
Nearly everyone has a thing.

481
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,360
I'm sure that you,
if you dig deep enough,

482
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,360
would have issues
that you need to confront.

483
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,240
I'm a cop, the only thing
I'm scared of is decaf coffee.

484
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,680
Really? I've always found

485
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,560
that the best and bravest
people are the ones

486
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,960
that willingly acknowledge
their fears.

487
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,280
Maybe you've just been hanging out
with too many timid and whiny people.

488
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,720
You are so bad.

489
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,160
I'm scared all the time.

490
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,440
And it's something I'd be
willing to share with the group

491
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
if you think it might be helpful.

492
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,240
Yes.

493
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,800
Yes, thank you. I think it would.

494
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,800
First time?

495
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,200
Yeah. You?

496
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,360
No, I'm a regular.

497
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,080
So here's the deal.
You go in the car,

498
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,000
the car's already in the crusher,
you get squeezed to death,

499
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,600
it takes a couple of minutes to die.

500
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,720
Whatever comes out,
I send to Falcone.

501
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,640
Maybe he uses it as a coffee table.

502
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,520
Don Maroni, please listen to me.

503
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,960
Oh, this is the begging part?

504
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,880
Oh, good,
'cause this is my favorite part.

505
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,800
Go ahead and beg
for your miserable life.

506
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,480
Just allow me to suggest some
options here.

507
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
Dead, I'm worthless.

508
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,360
If you factor in Falcone's
inevitable retaliation,

509
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,600
killing me will be a net loss
for you.

510
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,520
This is not a business issue.

511
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,480
Me and Frankie Carbone go back
20 years.

512
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,840
You hurt me, Penguin.

513
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,040
You were right about Indian Hill.

514
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,560
There's more to it.
Falcone knows something.

515
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,160
I don't know what,
but I can find out...

516
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,360
Stop it. You're making me sad.

517
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,200
How did I ever fall for your crap?

518
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,640
No. No. No. No.

519
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,120
Please. Please. No. No.

520
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,600
Hey.

521
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,720
Say hi to Frankie for me.

522
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,240
I'm afraid every day.

523
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,120
I'm afraid I'm gonna die in an alley.

524
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,400
Bleeding out while some
scumbag goes through my pockets

525
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,960
and laughs at me.

526
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,280
And I try to speak,
but nothing comes out.

527
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,360
And I just lie there,

528
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,680
staring at a small space
of sky between the buildings.

529
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,800
And then I die.

530
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,400
Alone.

531
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,680
I don't want to die alone
in some gutter.

532
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,560
I want to die in a warm cozy bed

533
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,440
in the arms of a beautiful woman.

534
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,200
Thank you for sharing, Harvey.

535
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,360
Would anyone else like to share?

536
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,440
Tod, go ahead.

537
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,720
My name is Tod, and...

538
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,600
I've never spoken here before, but...

539
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,240
I have a horrible terror of failure.

540
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,040
I torment myself and those around me.

541
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,360
I'd crawl on broken glass
to avoid failing.

542
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,040
About anything.

543
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,240
I inherited this illness
from my father,

544
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,440
but I'm afraid I'm passing it on
to my son.

545
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,200
We're here for you, Tod.

546
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,680
When I came home from work yesterday,
my precious son was crying,

547
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,400
and he said to me that he...

548
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm sorry. I can't speak.

549
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,440
- I'm so sorry.
- Tod?

550
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,960
Tod.

551
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,560
Tod?

552
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,960
Oh, you got to be kidding me. What?

553
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,640
Don Maroni, you have to listen to me.

554
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,640
Oh, see, no. This is how this
all began, me listening to you.

555
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,680
I was telling the truth.

556
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
About Indian Hill. And Arkham.

557
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,360
Whoever controls Arkham
will control Gotham! I can...

558
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,800
Would you shut up and take it
like a man?

559
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,200
- Yeah!
<i>- Hello, is this Mr. Duffy?</i>

560
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,400
- Yeah.
<i>- Listen to me very carefully.</i>

561
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,040
I'm the man in the car
in this ferocious machine of yours.

562
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,960
<i>My name is Oswald Cobblepot.</i>

563
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,920
<i>And I work for Don Carmine Falcone
of Gotham City.</i>

564
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,720
<i>- Do you know who Don Falcone is?</i>
- Yeah.

565
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,840
Good. I just called Don Falcone,
and I told him

566
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,240
<i>exactly where I am
and what's happening.</i>

567
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,640
So, Duffy, you better stop
this machine right now,

568
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,400
<i>because if I die,</i>

569
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,440
<i>Don Falcone is gonna send
a team up here</i>

570
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,800
to skin you alive
and slaughter your family.

571
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,320
- But Don Maroni said...
- Don Falcone runs Gotham,

572
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,720
<i>and you're about to murder
his right-hand man.</i>

573
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,120
What the hell?

574
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,440
Hey! Get back here!

575
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,840
Son of a bitch.

576
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,720
Is it just me, or have those
two been gone a while?

577
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,760
This has been real
and fun, but I got to go.

578
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,360
Oh, my God.

579
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,120
This isn't what it looks like.

580
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,720
Other members say our abductor's
been coming the last month.

581
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,000
Said his name was Tod,
but group protocol

582
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,920
requires they remain anonymous.

583
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,320
So no real ID.

584
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,760
And the guy you shot,
the one with the pigs?

585
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,200
Prints came back career criminal.

586
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,480
Probably just the muscle.
The other guy was in charge.

587
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,000
He knew there was a cop
there at the meeting.

588
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,440
He still took her.

589
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,160
That's cold or crazy.

590
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,720
Either way, he's almost
sure to follow the same M.O.

591
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,960
He'll confront Miss Mullens
with her greatest fear.

592
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,320
- Which is drowning.
- Specifically in a pool.

593
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,960
There's hundreds of pools in Gotham.

594
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,320
- We can't possibly get to every...
- That was her mother.

595
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,000
When she was seven,
Scottie almost drowned

596
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,800
in Lemmars Park pool uptown.

597
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,040
It's a start, I guess.

598
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,360
That's where he took her,
I can feel it.

599
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,760
- Boss?
- Oh, not now, Joe. Wait.

600
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,640
Tell me that's not
what it looks like.

601
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,040
You're brave.

602
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,720
I'd say you're an eight
on the Crane Scale.

603
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,720
Profound fear.

604
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,160
Twelve is top.
Abject heart-stopping terror.

605
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,840
I'm surprised you're only an eight.

606
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,760
You do understand
that this is really happening?

607
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,360
I'm going to drown you.

608
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,400
Right now.

609
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,120
There! That's a ten.

610
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,840
Dad.

611
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,000
Jonathan, I said to wait in the van.

612
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,280
The parking meter ran out.

613
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,280
Look, son, I know this hard,
but we talked about it.

614
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,960
It's for the common good,
for humanity.

615
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,000
I know. I just... I think...

616
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,000
This will be over soon. Here.

617
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,520
Go and feed the meter.

618
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,360
Go on, go.

619
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,360
Now, my dear,
don't think badly of me.

620
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,440
GCPD!

621
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,240
Don't move!

622
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,520
I'm on him! You get her!

623
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,640
He's alive. I told you he was alive.

624
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,200
Praise the Lord.

625
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,800
Glory be.

626
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,640
What happened to you, boy?

627
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,240
Like the prodigal son, ma'am,
I have fallen.

628
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,760
Like Job,
I've been tested in the deepest pits

629
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,560
of the devil's perfidy and survived.

630
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,840
Lord have mercy.

631
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,440
Are you headed to Gotham City,
by any chance?

632
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,720
Sure.

633
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,200
Come on.

634
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,560
<i>- Trouble in my way
- Trouble in my way</i>

635
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,400
<i>- I got to cry sometimes
- I got to cry sometimes</i>

636
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,720
<i>- I lay awake at night
- I lay awake at night</i>

637
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,680
<i>But that's all right, it's all right</i>

638
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,560
<i>That's all right</i>

639
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,240
<i>'Cause Jesus will fix it</i>

640
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,400
<i>Jesus will fix it</i>

641
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,280
<i>- After a while
- After</i>

642
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,800
Case files you gave me about that man
who was thrown from the roof.

643
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,320
Did you catch his killer yet?

644
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,960
Oh, no. He's still out there.

645
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,400
- Hi.
- I followed up,

646
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,000
and I had a quick look at his corpse.

647
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,240
A quick look at his corpse?

648
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,360
Yeah, its' just downstairs
at the morgue. No trouble.

649
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,160
So the killer removed
his adrenal glands.

650
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,720
Adrenal glands? That's strange.

651
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,240
They have no value on
the black market, do they?

652
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,600
No. Kidneys and livers, yes.
Adrenal glands, no.

653
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,440
It produces cortisol,
the hormone that gives us

654
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,520
that adrenalized
fight-or-flight reaction.

655
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Essentially, it's the fear gland.

656
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,680
And our man
wants to take it from the victim

657
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,800
when he's most fearful. Why do that?

658
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,360
All I can think
of is that at the moment of death,

659
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,880
the victim's adrenals
would produce a massive,

660
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,600
highly-elevated form of cortisol.

661
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,280
Fascinating, huh?

662
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,040
This is one weird dude.

663
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,720
A doctor or a nurse, most likely.

664
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,560
Takes some skill to remove
adrenals as cleanly as they did.

665
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,480
You really like this kind of work,
huh?

666
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,760
I do.

667
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,920
Good.

668
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,080
Maybe there'll be more for you.

669
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,600
A full-time job, even.

670
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,480
Our M.E. has been fired
for stealing body parts.

671
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,920
- Can you believe that?
- Only in Gotham.

672
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,200
So, what do you say
we discuss this potential job

673
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,520
over dinner?

674
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,120
Nice segue, Mr. Smooth.

675
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,160
Thank you.

676
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,120
Dinner sounds good.

677
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,000
Are you gonna bring your case files?

678
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,160
Go ahead, mock my crude
dating skills.

679
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,720
I'm doing my best.

680
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,840
You're doing fine.

681
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,920
I have a powerful urge
to kiss you right now.

682
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,080
Why don't you?

683
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,120
Because I'm on duty, and...

684
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,880
there's about 50 people
watching us.

685
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,320
Scaredy-cat.

686
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,240
Damn straight.
I have an image to keep up.

687
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,720
The heartless, by-the-book, hard man.

688
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,960
Kind of.

689
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,560
On the count of three,
I'm gonna lean in,

690
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,600
so that it's subtle.
Then you're gonna kiss me

691
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,240
on the cheek or no dinner.

692
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,320
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

693
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
One...

694
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
two...

695
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,640
three.

696
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,640
I'm not leaving after all.

697
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,480
- What?
- It turns out that

698
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,720
the medical examiner is leaving,

699
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,600
so Captain Essen decided
to reinstate me.

700
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,400
Okay, good.

701
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,840
Mr. Nygma?

702
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,480
You owe me a new pencil.

703
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,960
- What's going on? What's happening?
- I can hide you.

704
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,240
Quickly.
