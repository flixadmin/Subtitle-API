1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,180
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,350
Shall we begin?

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,170
I am not Bruce,

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,659
and I won't let you tell Alfred.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,030
How you gonna stop...

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,540
I'd like to introduce our newest member,

7
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,600
James Gordon.

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,050
Welcome to the Court of Owls.

9
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,010
- Are you okay?
- I just remembered.

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,040
There's someone I need to kill.

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,800
This virus isn't a disease.

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,450
It's the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

13
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,950
I don't need a cure.

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,989
I will purge Gotham,

15
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,290
and the innocents will thank me!

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,550
Their savior!

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,700
Their executioner.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,370
Guilty. Guilty.

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,240
What's this I see?

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,160
Captain Barnes being escorted
away by the orderlies.

21
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,840
Who is this new player
that enters the fray?

22
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,909
And with that, it was over.

23
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,069
Leaving me to wonder

24
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,020
what mysterious forces are at
play in the middle of the night.

25
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,770
Captain Barnes.

26
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,680
At last we meet.

27
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,190
Who are you?

28
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,520
Let's just say I'm a fan.

29
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,589
What do you want?

30
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,340
The same thing you do,

31
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,259
for Gotham to be judged

32
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,230
and the guilty punished.

33
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,059
Well, then release me

34
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,580
and I'll do just that.

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,220
Unfortunately...

36
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,510
we're looking to pass sentence
on a much larger scale.

37
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,810
And to do that we need
what's inside of you.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,590
The virus.

39
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,870
Precisely. But don't worry.

40
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,320
I'll make sure he doesn't drain you...

41
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,890
completely.

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,130
Hello, Captain.

43
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,420
Strange.

44
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,750
I'm sorry, Captain.

45
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,870
This might sting.

46
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,290
Hey, Lee.

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,340
What's this?

48
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,230
My final report on Frank Gordon.

49
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,140
Cause of death...

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
homicide.

51
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,900
I thought Jim's uncle killed himself.

52
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,590
Did you?

53
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,570
Look, I know you're upset.

54
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,430
After everything you've been through...

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,709
D-Don't. Don't you dare do that.

56
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,849
This is not about Mario.

57
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,959
Then what's it about?

58
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,989
Why are, why are you here?

59
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,199
What do you want me to do?

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,480
Harvey, you are acting captain.

61
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,430
I want you to open an investigation

62
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,129
into the murder of Frank Gordon,

63
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,950
and I think Jim should be questioned.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,630
You're accusing Jim of
killing his own uncle?

65
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,689
Why would he do that?

66
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,930
I don't know,

67
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,380
but I know that he is involved somehow,

68
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,070
maybe not in his death, but
maybe in covering it up,

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,830
making it look like a suicide.

70
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,890
And I want to know who else is involved.

71
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,260
Are you implying I'm involved as well?

72
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,480
Tell me I'm wrong, Harvey.

73
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,510
Tell me there's nothing else going on.

74
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,900
Look me in the eyes and tell me I'm crazy.

75
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,980
You're not crazy, Lee.

76
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,220
You're hurt.

77
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,910
And there's nothing going on.

78
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,220
We used to be friends, Harvey.

79
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,150
I know you're covering for him.

80
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,049
I don't know what he's involved in,

81
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,270
but I'm gonna find out.

82
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,559
The ruling council has decided
to suspend all Court activity

83
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,970
in order to focus our attention
on the preparations at hand.

84
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,250
Gotham's judgment is imminent.

85
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,649
To that end,

86
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,779
any members who have not

87
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,429
submitted their list for
review and approval

88
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,160
should do so today.

89
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,850
We are adjourned.

90
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,880
Excuse me?

91
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,430
Yeah?

92
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,140
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

93
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,580
Knock yourself out.

94
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,550
Her name's Selina.

95
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,860
Selina Kyle.

96
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,620
She knew Barbara Kean.

97
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,060
She used to hang out here.

98
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,770
I think.

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,930
You think?

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,289
You don't sound real close.

101
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,629
Oh, no, we were... kind of,

102
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,039
but she was always really bossy, you know?

103
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,489
And then we got into this fight.

104
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,749
I was gone for awhile and...

105
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,830
Yeah, I don't care.

106
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,520
Try Gotham General.

107
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,900
Did something happen to her?

108
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,140
I heard she fell out of a window
and is in pretty bad shape.

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,070
What are you doing in here?

110
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,840
I was supposed to put down
my list of names, but...

111
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,670
nobody told me what for.

112
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,210
Loved ones are to be spared
from the coming judgment.

113
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
Thank you.

114
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
No.

115
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,240
It can't be.

116
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:06,050
I'm sorry, this ward is restricted.

117
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,720
What happened to her?

118
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,610
No idea.

119
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,920
Police found her on the street.
Looks like she fell.

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,060
Fell?

121
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,480
That's impossible.

122
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,960
Is she gonna be all right?

123
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,670
No.

124
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,210
What do you mean, "No"?

125
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,800
Tell me she's gonna be all right.

126
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,299
- She's gonna be all right.
- No.

127
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,980
You're just saying that because I...

128
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
...just...

129
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,360
...tell me the truth.

130
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,640
We've tried everything.

131
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,330
All we can do now is make her comfortable.

132
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,940
Leave us and don't come back.

133
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,850
Don't listen to them, Selina.

134
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,180
They don't know what I know.

135
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,690
They can't do what I can do.

136
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,060
I will heal you.

137
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,350
I promise.

138
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,060
Isn't it enough, you holding
me against my will?

139
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,600
Must you also hover while I work?

140
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,339
I'd think you would prefer this

141
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,020
to playing nursemaid to Fish Mooney.

142
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,879
I was able to save Fish Mooney

143
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,409
despite the fact that she
had one foot in the grave.

144
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,600
I took it as a personal challenge.

145
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,960
Grandstanding doesn't suit you.

146
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,670
Were you able to accomplish what we asked?

147
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,750
See for yourself.

148
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,380
Hello?

149
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,510
What do you want from me?

150
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,180
Someone tell me what's going on.

151
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,399
Previously, the Alice Tetch
virus could only be transmitted

152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,310
through direct contact with her blood.

153
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
What is that?

154
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,490
Someone please help!

155
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,200
We've done it.

156
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,530
You've weaponized the virus.

157
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,680
Pick it up.

158
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,770
No.

159
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,670
You win,

160
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,420
and you go free.

161
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,429
Pick up the stick,

162
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,110
and defeat this man.

163
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,240
You're lying.

164
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:52,929
This is just another way
of manipulating me.

165
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,930
Pick it up.

166
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,550
Prove me wrong.

167
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,480
All that pain and anger...

168
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,120
you think it's strength.

169
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,650
It's not.

170
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,230
You think can harness it... you can't.

171
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,550
You think it's part of you,

172
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,870
but it doesn't have to be.

173
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,930
Do you know why you were
so easily defeated?

174
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
No.

175
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,509
Your rage, Bruce.

176
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,290
It blinds you.

177
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,299
You seek to control it,

178
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,669
and yet it controls you

179
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,250
and has ever since that night.

180
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,520
Rage and pain are two
sides of the same coin.

181
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,930
I can release you from
the pain of that night.

182
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,480
And when I do,

183
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,860
nothing will be able to stop you.

184
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,479
Listen, Jim,

185
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,659
we got a hit on the prints
you lifted off the mask.

186
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,160
Kathryn's last name is Monroe.

187
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,259
She's from one of
Gotham's oldest families.

188
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,669
Her address is 450 clinton Ave...

189
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,130
Nice work, Harvey.

190
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,860
Kathryn seems to be the only one
who knows what the weapon is.

191
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,010
So what's the plan?

192
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,640
Break in, see what I can find out.

193
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,670
What do you think,

194
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:21,669
she's keeping it on her fireplace mantel?

195
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,189
I searched the Court chambers.

196
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,389
She isn't taking any chances
with the rank and file

197
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,819
knowing what the weapon is.

198
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,500
If there is something to find,

199
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,650
it'll be at her house.

200
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:30,699
That's a big risk.

201
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,989
You get caught, ball game over.

202
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,200
I don't have a choice.

203
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,550
Listen, Jim, about your uncle...

204
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,179
Lee came into my office wanting to

205
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,359
open an investigation into his death.

206
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,390
She asked me point blank
what you were doing.

207
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,450
What'd you say?

208
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
Nothing.

209
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,090
I lied.

210
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Jim,

211
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,560
she seemed like she was
in a pretty dark place.

212
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,120
Anything else?

213
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,120
Yeah. Not to add on,

214
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,870
but I got a call from a buddy
of mine at Arkham last night.

215
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,530
Barnes was transferred.

216
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,079
Transferred? To where?

217
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,870
We don't know.

218
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:07,909
I got Alvarez looking into it.

219
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,420
But don't worry, we will find him.

220
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,630
Thanks, Harvey.

221
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:13,480
Jim, be careful.

222
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,530
Oswald.

223
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,610
Hello, Jim.

224
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,439
Guess I shouldn't be surprised

225
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,600
you're still alive.

226
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,430
Yes, I am quite hard to kill.

227
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,559
I take it this isn't a social call.

228
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,860
I'm looking for Ed.

229
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,519
We have some unfinished business.

230
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,579
And it turns out

231
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,470
you are the last one who saw him.

232
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,740
Yeah, before he escaped police custody.

233
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,580
"Escaped"?

234
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,450
From the great Detective Gordon?

235
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,810
I think not.

236
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,569
Ed went on television
demanding information

237
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,580
about a group that runs Gotham.

238
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,929
A group called the "Court."

239
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,629
And you called him and said
you had that information.

240
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,560
A ruse to get him to the GCPD.

241
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,590
Perhaps.

242
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,350
But then you arrest him,

243
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,950
and, voilà, he disappears.

244
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,890
Sorry, "escapes custody."

245
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,560
Can you see how I might think

246
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,559
you may have handed Ed off to this

247
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,830
all-powerful group for some reason?

248
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,050
For your own sake, Oswald,

249
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
drop it.

250
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
I knew it.

251
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,900
You don't know anything.

252
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,820
Trust me, let it go.

253
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,970
Sorry, no can do.

254
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,009
I assume the Court doesn't like publicity,

255
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,720
hence Ed's sudden disappearance
after his television debut.

256
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,129
But that is exactly what
they're going to get.

257
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,100
Unless they deal with me in a
civilized and professional manner.

258
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,210
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
facilitating something on my behalf.

259
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,970
My number is the only one in here.

260
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,180
I will expect a call
by the end of the day.

261
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,390
Why do I get the sense
I'm being threatened?

262
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,780
This is a favor, Jim.

263
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,370
After all, we're old friends.

264
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,420
Right?

265
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,150
Thomas?

266
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,460
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
Kathryn.

268
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,999
Detective Gordon, what
is the meaning of this?

269
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,140
Who let you in here?

270
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,500
Oswald Cobblepot is alive

271
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,950
and back in Gotham.

272
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,170
He paid me a visit this morning.

273
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,459
He knows Nygma's disappearance

274
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,290
has something to do with the Court.

275
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,760
Is that all?

276
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,130
I'm tired of being kept in the dark.

277
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,040
I want a seat at the table.

278
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,680
How ambitious.

279
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,680
You asked me to be on the Court.

280
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,169
Now, I have done everything you've asked.

281
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,050
I think I've proved my commitment.

282
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,400
I want to know what's going on.

283
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,110
I want to know what the judgment entails.

284
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,170
And if you don't like what you hear?

285
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,020
Try me.

286
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,180
Gotham is sick.

287
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,749
Crime and violence are so common

288
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,930
the people have become numb to it.

289
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,220
To heal the city,

290
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,810
we have to force them to take notice.

291
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,370
Force them how?

292
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,340
By showing the people of
Gotham their darkest selves.

293
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,390
I'll consider your request.

294
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,060
Now leave my house at once.

295
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,289
It's Harvey. Leave a message.

296
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,940
Harvey, I know what the weapon is.

297
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,630
I know how they're gonna
pass judgment on Gotham.

298
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,979
The weapon is the Alice Tetch virus?

299
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,730
Kathryn said the weapon would
"show Gotham its darkest self."

300
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,099
Alice Tetch was in Indian Hill for years.

301
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,480
They would have known about her.

302
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,799
It's the virus. I'm sure of it.

303
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,120
Is that even possible?

304
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,759
Well, that's why you're here, Lucius.

305
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,300
I'm sorry to throw you into the
deep end of the pool like this,

306
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,059
but I need to know what we're up against.

307
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,470
You mean beyond a secret society
that controls all of Gotham.

308
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,279
Well, if they could isolate the virus

309
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,680
they could transform it into
any number of compounds

310
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,249
that could be released on a
large scale into the city.

311
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,899
All they'd need is a sample of her blood.

312
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,260
Well, they ain't getting
it from the source.

313
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,299
After Mario broke into the hematology lab,

314
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,440
they destroyed the rest of Alice's blood.

315
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,390
I mean, where do they get a sample?

316
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,689
They don't need a sample of Alice's blood,

317
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,250
just a sample of the virus.

318
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,030
The virus that she passed along
to the people she infected.

319
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,230
Barnes.

320
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:29,290
Exactly.

321
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,650
Barnes wasn't transferred out of Arkham,

322
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,600
Kathryn kidnapped him.

323
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,590
So... if we can find out
where he was taken,

324
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
we can stop this.

325
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:39,350
And how do we go about doing that?

326
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,010
I found this in Kathryn's study.

327
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,050
- Any idea what lab it belongs to?
- No.

328
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,389
But when I was running the Wayne
Enterprises R&D division,

329
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,730
we only had a half dozen off-site labs.

330
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,960
Barnes isn't exactly the kind
of guy who's gonna blend in.

331
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,749
It'd have to be somewhere isolated,

332
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,890
and small enough for them to control.

333
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,220
I think I know where they took him.

334
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,739
Just put them down wherever there's space,

335
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,069
and then go back to where I found you.

336
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,070
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,180
Selina,

338
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,009
I would like to introduce
you to nepeta Cataria.

339
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,749
Or, rather, a very specialized
strain of a plant

340
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,140
that I've been cultivating.

341
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,990
This guy is a "break in case
of emergency" type of deal.

342
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,700
You've always been there for me.

343
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,210
Even when I screwed things up.

344
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,600
Which was most of the time.

345
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,630
Just breathe deep,

346
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,530
and I'll be here when you wake up.

347
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,060
Just wake up, okay?

348
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,100
Are we going back to the alley
where my parents were murdered?

349
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,320
No.

350
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,280
There's another memory
I want to start with.

351
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,149
The first time you felt the rage
after your parents' death...

352
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,390
Do you remember?

353
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,500
Yes.

354
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,529
The rage from that day continues
to burn inside of you,

355
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,909
feeding on your pain,

356
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,940
blinding you from everything else,

357
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,239
and, if left unchecked,
will one day consume you.

358
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,979
We need to remove it before that happens.

359
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,300
You want me to give up
my memory of that day?

360
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,789
No. The events themselves will remain.

361
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,029
I'm only talking about releasing you

362
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,800
from the destructive emotions
connected with them.

363
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,839
And if I don't want to be released?

364
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,779
You have chosen your prison, Bruce.

365
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,950
I'm offering you a way out.

366
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,270
Why?

367
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,140
You said I was to become
the protector of Gotham.

368
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,020
Why me?

369
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,449
Because you need each other.

370
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,790
Gotham needs a protector,

371
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,550
and you need a purpose.

372
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm only trying to show you the way.

373
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,310
But it has to be...

374
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,090
...your choice.

375
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,670
Do you know where you are?

376
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,360
My parents' wake.

377
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,649
Yes.

378
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,119
You were surrounded by friends and family,

379
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,150
and yet...

380
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,860
I felt alone.

381
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,149
This was the first time I truly processed

382
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,680
that my parents were gone.

383
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,170
The first time I thought
of myself as an orphan.

384
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,100
Is that why you left?

385
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,020
No.

386
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:54,420
Then why did you?

387
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,540
I heard what they were saying.

388
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,889
He witnessed the whole thing.

389
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,620
He must have been terrified.

390
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,680
Devastated.

391
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:05,970
Traumatized.

392
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,950
My parents were dead, but all
anybody was talking about was me.

393
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,490
How concerned they were about me.

394
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,420
My parents had been murdered.

395
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,149
Gunned down and left for
dead and nobody seemed...

396
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,200
Angry.

397
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,880
Yes.

398
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:23,460
And so you left.

399
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,829
I hid in my parents' room.

400
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,530
My father was supposed to be
buried in a pair of cufflinks

401
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,760
that I'd bought him for his
birthday the year before.

402
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,650
He always said they were his favorite.

403
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,000
But when it came time to give them up...

404
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,920
...I couldn't let them go.

405
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,150
It's time to let them go.

406
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,180
There.

407
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,700
You can lock it away, and once you do,

408
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,540
you'll be free of the
power it holds over you.

409
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,170
I've been waiting a long
time for this, Bruce.

410
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,750
Together,

411
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,630
we will make Gotham pay.

412
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,330
No guards.

413
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,800
No security.

414
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,040
I don't like it, either.

415
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,870
I guess we know where the guards went.

416
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,450
Hello?

417
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,239
GCPD.

418
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,050
Freeze.

419
00:25:01,051 --> 00:25:02,330
The police, thank God.

420
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,119
Keep your hands where we can see them!

421
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,380
I didn't want to kill these people, I-I...

422
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,799
I just lost control.

423
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,120
On the ground, now.

424
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,270
Now!

425
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,060
I'm the good guy here.

426
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,520
Oh, you're just like them.

427
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,830
You're out to get me.

428
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,140
What have you done with the virus?

429
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,850
Who has it?

430
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,079
A woman, named Kathryn.

431
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,649
Where is she? Where's she taken it?

432
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,560
I don't know.

433
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,049
As I told you, I was brought
here against my will.

434
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,479
I know nothing of their other plans.

435
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,429
Hugo Strange, you're under arrest

436
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,500
for attempts to weaponize a viral...

437
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,509
hell, you know why.

438
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,080
Oh, you don't want to do that.

439
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,469
The delivery mechanism
that they plan to use

440
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,050
to release the virus

441
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,830
just recently arrived.

442
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,439
The shipment that came into dock 9C.

443
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,050
Yes.

444
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:13,619
It still needs to be tested,

445
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,599
which means that you
still have enough time

446
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,450
to keep them from unleashing it citywide.

447
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,550
But, of course,

448
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:22,990
if they discover that their
lab has been compromised...

449
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,400
He's right, they might
unleash it right away.

450
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,520
We can't take him in

451
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,509
or the Court will know we're onto them.

452
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,719
Are you crazy? What if
he's yanking our chain?

453
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,609
What stops him from picking up the phone

454
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,209
and calling the owl brigade the
second we walk out that door?

455
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,390
My research.

456
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,279
And a vial of my virus compound

457
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,519
which I secreted away,

458
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,630
unbeknownst to my captors.

459
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,399
A token of goodwill,

460
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,130
which I hope will be remembered

461
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,930
when the time comes.

462
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,210
Goodwill?

463
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,720
You're playing both sides.

464
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,289
You help us take down the Court and what?

465
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,540
We cut you a deal?

466
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,510
But we fail,

467
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,160
and you appear to be loyal
to the Court, is that it?

468
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,000
You logical bastard.

469
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,690
Don't worry about the mess.

470
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,470
We have our poor test
subject to blame for that.

471
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,340
Good luck, detectives.

472
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,089
Get Lucius the virus
compound and the research.

473
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,679
See if he can find anyone we can trust

474
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,170
to start working on the cure.

475
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,570
Where you going?

476
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,350
I gotta find out where
Kathryn's testing the bomb.

477
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,670
Kathryn?

478
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:47,340
I've thought about what you said.

479
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,749
You have done what we've asked.

480
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,900
Maybe it is time to take the next step.

481
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,309
Meet me at 331 Smith Place.

482
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,889
Can't give me any more than that?

483
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,380
You said you didn't want
to be kept in the dark.

484
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,600
Let's see if you're worthy of the light.

485
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,340
Is that all you have?

486
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,820
I thought you wanted to leave this place.

487
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,580
That's it!

488
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,010
That's it.

489
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,030
Yes.

490
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,039
See what you can accomplish

491
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,959
once you remove destructive emotions?

492
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,130
Tell me,

493
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,980
how did you feel when you
were fighting this time?

494
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,520
I felt...

495
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,510
...nothing.

496
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,580
I beat him.

497
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,200
Does that mean I can leave?

498
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,460
Is that what you want?

499
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,729
The pain to go away?

500
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,979
I can take it away, Bruce.

501
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,979
I can take it away and
you can return to Gotham

502
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,710
with a power you never thought possible.

503
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,550
It's your choice.

504
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,920
Get up.

505
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,170
We're not done.

506
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,160
James.

507
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,310
Glad you could make it.

508
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,280
Not sure I had a choice.

509
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,040
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask
you for your gun and your phone.

510
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,070
Nice party.

511
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,830
The daughters of Gotham.

512
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,699
Socialites who believe they
hold the power in this city,

513
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,260
when really what they really
are is window dressing.

514
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,400
My family was one of the first in Gotham.

515
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,129
We've been on the Court
since its founding,

516
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,350
making the difficult decisions

517
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,920
to ensure its long-term survival.

518
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,160
Which is why I've brought you here.

519
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,480
Interesting centerpiece.

520
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,660
It's an aerosol dispersal bomb.

521
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,870
Dispersal bomb for what?

522
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,310
For the Alice Tetch virus.

523
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,029
So that's what you meant by
showing Gotham its darkest self.

524
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,189
Precisely.

525
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,550
Infecting 200 people won't change anything.
- True.

526
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,289
But the virus compound
only lives in aerated form

527
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,099
for a matter of minutes,

528
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,559
so, in a closed space like the room below,

529
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,650
it will be contained to our guests.

530
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,940
But in an open space,

531
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,110
the radius of infection is a half mile.

532
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,450
This is merely a test.

533
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,080
Place it in the middle of the room.

534
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,260
Don't worry, you'll be safe up here.

535
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,829
I need to trust

536
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,759
that you're ready to make
the difficult decisions

537
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,400
when the time comes.

538
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,740
That's why I'm here.

539
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,200
Good.

540
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,909
Because if it's not,

541
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,470
if you try to stop the bomb

542
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,450
or interfere in any way,

543
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,110
Talon has instructions to
execute you on the spot.

544
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,690
Talon, right?

545
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,460
I'm assuming that's a nickname.

546
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,410
Right.

547
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,779
Wouldn't want to miss out
on the sounds of 200 people

548
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,520
tearing each other's throats out.

549
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,870
The device is in place.

550
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,060
Hello, Jim.

551
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,439
I was beginning to think I
wasn't going to hear from you.

552
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,370
I met you the other night, didn't I?

553
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,070
When you took Nygma?

554
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,729
- Jim?
- I keep wondering...

555
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,169
...what it is the Court is
planning to do with him.

556
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,500
Stop talking.

557
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,210
This used to be a bank, right?

558
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,160
First Bank of Gotham?

559
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,749
I just hope it can withstand

560
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,690
whatever the bomb's going to do to it.

561
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,189
It sounds like we don't have much time.

562
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,610
Shut up.

563
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,660
Sure.

564
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,829
Where's Jim?

565
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,549
He's not responding to my calls.

566
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,799
I'm heading into the bullpen

567
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,240
to see if anyone's heard from him.

568
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,210
What's going on?

569
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,410
Hey, Lee.

570
00:33:46,411 --> 00:33:47,830
Are you helping Jim?

571
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,559
Bullock, I get.

572
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,789
But has Jim also pulled
you into his madness?

573
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,000
- It's not madness, Lee.
- Then what is it?

574
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,159
How many people does he have to kill

575
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,949
before you all see what I see?

576
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,959
You got it wrong.

577
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,139
Jim's trying to make sure

578
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,469
that what happened to Mario

579
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,939
never happens to anyone again.

580
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,570
What are you talking about?

581
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,650
Lucius.

582
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:12,730
Please, just tell me what's going on.

583
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,720
I can't.

584
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,640
I'm sorry, Lee.

585
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,690
You're just like everybody else here.

586
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,510
Screw it.

587
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,440
Duck.

588
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,169
Everyone out!

589
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,240
Now!

590
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,810
Took you long enough.

591
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,660
I need to get these people out of here.

592
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:39,109
And I need to talk to the Court.

593
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,909
Have them turn over Ed. Remember?

594
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,369
There is a bomb down there

595
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,549
with a weaponized version
of the Alice Tetch virus.

596
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,410
If you want to be here when
it goes off, be my guest.

597
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,760
What about our deal?

598
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,369
You just torched their assassin.

599
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,080
My guess is, they'll be in touch.

600
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,260
Mommy! Mom!

601
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,330
Mommy!

602
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,690
Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter?!

603
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,640
Yes, sir.

604
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:47,060
Hello, Kathryn.

605
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,140
My apologies for the time.

606
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,140
Not at all.

607
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:53,179
How are things progressing
with Bruce Wayne?

608
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,209
Excellent.

609
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,749
He believes in the
destiny I have promised,

610
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,719
in a life free from the pain of his past.

611
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,259
The boy and I will be leaving tonight.

612
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,399
I trust everything will be in
place by the time we arrive.

613
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,540
Of course.

614
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,820
Why haven't they made contact?

615
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,350
And where the hell is Ivy
and the human popsicle?

616
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,100
Hello?

617
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,950
Are you listening to me?

618
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,050
You're awake.

619
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:36,190
Selina!

620
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,580
Are you okay?

621
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,340
Say something so that I know you're okay.

622
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,910
Why does my room smell like
a giant bag of potpourri?

623
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,590
You're back.

624
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,330
Oh, I can't believe it.

625
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,440
Oh, wait.

626
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,110
What are you doing?

627
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,569
You just got out of a coma.

628
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,040
You need to rest.

629
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,520
This can't wait.

630
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,919
What are you talking about?

631
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,170
Where are you going?

632
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,860
To Wayne Manor.

633
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,570
To kill someone.

634
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,050
What are you doing?

635
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:29,380
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm leaving.

636
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,930
Well, actually, I'm resigning,
and then I'm leaving.

637
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,729
Don't. You belong here.

638
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,060
I thought I did.

639
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,549
Then you infected this place

640
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,730
and everyone around you.

641
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,530
I'm done.

642
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,430
I am done with you, with the GCPD...

643
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,960
With Gotham.

644
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,890
What are you talking about?

645
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
You've taken everything away from me.

646
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,550
Everything.

647
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,050
There's nothing left.

648
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,190
And for what?

649
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,700
I would ask you for the truth,

650
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,160
but I honestly don't even think
you know what that is anymore.

651
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,940
You want the truth?

652
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,020
Fine.

653
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,190
I killed Mario.

654
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,820
I'm done apologizing for it.

655
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,299
He was gonna kill you.

656
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,240
- No.
- I saw the knife.

657
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,869
I saw the knife and I pulled the trigger.

658
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,400
And I would do it again.

659
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,819
- He was infected.
- Yes.

660
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,129
Because Jervis Tetch
wanted to punish you. You!

661
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,479
Not Mario. Mario didn't
deserve what happened to him.

662
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,449
You want to blame me for
Mario's death, fine!

663
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,930
You want to walk out that door and
never come back, I can't stop you.

664
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,540
But it will not help.

665
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,040
Believe me.

666
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,289
The other day, you asked
me at Mario's grave

667
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,730
how I could walk away.

668
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,080
Move on.

669
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,860
I guess you know how.

670
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,469
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

671
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,969
You cannot do this to me.

672
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,750
I demand to speak to the person in charge!

673
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,350
Oswald.

674
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,310
You're alive?

675
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,650
I want to apologize for
my curt behavior earlier.

676
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,530
We both want the same thing for Gotham.

677
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,990
Judgment.

678
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,459
But I have just discovered
someone I thought was loyal

679
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,550
has been deceiving me from the start.

680
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,349
Detective James Gordon

681
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,500
now threatens to undo what we both seek.

682
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,980
I need you to kill him
before he can do that.

683
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,910
Jim Gordon is guilty.

684
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:37,910
And I will be his executioner.
