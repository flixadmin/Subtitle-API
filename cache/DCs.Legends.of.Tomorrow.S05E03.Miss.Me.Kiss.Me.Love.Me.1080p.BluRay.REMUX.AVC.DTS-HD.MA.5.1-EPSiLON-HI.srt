we altered my future at Heyworld.</i>

- [Masher] John, wait!
- Masher?

6
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:14,141
Has Astra released
the worst souls from hell onto Earth?

7
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:16,393
- I'm unkillable! [laughs]
- [grunts]

8
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:20,373
[Constantine] I'm putting
an end to this.

9
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:21,749
Are you trying to go back to hell?

10
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,734
I'll return when the sigil is complete.

11
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:26,527
[sighs]

12
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:29,531
[alternative music playing]

13
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:44,046
Ma'am, we caught him lurking outside.

14
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:50,677
It seems you're having a hard time
staying away from hell these days, John.

15
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:54,014
Well, what can I say?
I'm a creature of habit.

16
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,515
You might as well get used to it.

17
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:57,493
You'll be living down here soon enough.

18
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:00,062
What do you want?

19
00:01:00,063 --> 00:01:02,439
Oh, whiskey neat and a steak well done.

20
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,650
Oh, yeah, and all those souls
you released...

21
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:06,192
Call them back.

22
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:08,237
Look, there is enough evil on Earth

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,280
without you giving the damned
a second chance.

24
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:15,202
Those damned souls
are making me rich, John.

25
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:19,623
Any humans corrupted or killed by them
all belong to me.

26
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:22,251
And after years of being
under the boot of the triumvirate,

27
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:27,047
it sure feels good
to grind my heel on someone else.

28
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:29,299
[Masher groans]

29
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:30,299
Masher?

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,468
[stuttering] John...

31
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:34,471
Help me.

32
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,849
John's better at getting his friends
into trouble than out of it.

33
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:41,228
Something you should have known
when you squealed on me.

34
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:42,311
- [squelches]
- [yells]

35
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:43,581
You don't have to do this, Astra.

36
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,649
I like doing this.

37
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:49,069
[groans] No more. Please.

38
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:50,529
[screams]

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,032
Astra, look, I came down here
for a friendly chat, all right?

40
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:57,035
Now, we don't have to be enemies.

41
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,913
[chuckles] You're not my enemy, John.

42
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:02,457
You're an important step
in my evolution.

43
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:05,502
I crawled my way up from the bottom,

44
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,714
and I finally have
some real power around here.

45
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,633
So, if you want to stop me...

46
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,094
you'll have to kill me.

47
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:16,430
But really, what's the point?

48
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:20,475
My soul would just end up
back down here anyway.

49
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,810
- [Constantine gasps]
- John.

50
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,819
- [coughs]
- What happened down there?

51
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,946
[panting]

52
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:35,240
I need a drink.

53
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:41,330
- No post-mission debrief?
- [sighs] It's part of his process.

54
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:45,083
Come on, Gideon,
play the damn message again.

55
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,327
[Gideon] You can mistreat me
all you like, Mr. Heywood,

56
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:51,340
but I assure you there are no secret
messages hiding in my memory banks.

57
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:53,549
Everything okay, bro?

58
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:56,887
Oh, um, yeah, I was just, uh,
double-checking something.

59
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:58,138
Little help?

60
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,106
I think I'm starting to see things.

61
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:10,525
I know what's going on.

62
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:11,860
You do?

63
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:13,653
You get into my stash again?

64
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,323
[both chuckle]

65
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:18,492
Dude, no worries.
Sara's gathering the team.

66
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:20,118
- Come on.
- Thanks.

67
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:23,121
And that is the truth of it, mateys.

68
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:27,334
Astra and this whole bloody mess
is on me.

69
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:29,628
And she can't be reasoned with.

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,089
So, we need a more permanent solution
to stop her,

71
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,758
or she could continue
releasing souls indefinitely.

72
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,719
Surely Astra can change.
She's still human, right?

73
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,471
I mean, even a Master of the Dark Arts

74
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:41,558
must believe there's still
some good left in her.

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,960
[Constantine] Forget it, big man.

76
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:46,561
Astra's lust for power,
it zapped the humanity out of her.

77
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,522
[Sara] Well, on the bright side,

78
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:51,358
at least the Encores
aren't our fault this time.

79
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,526
Hey, up top.

80
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,695
Is there any point in sending
these Encores to hell?

81
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,965
It sounds like Astra would
just send them straight back.

82
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:58,989
Correct.

83
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,827
Well, then, until we find
a more permanent solution,

84
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:03,912
we'll house the Encores on the ship.

85
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:06,873
We're gonna need a bigger pantry.

86
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:28,979
Hey, Cap, normally I'd be all for
rolling up my sleeves and pitching in,

87
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,898
but I gotta take shore leave
for my pop's birthday.

88
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,150
And Nate's coming with me.

89
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,651
- I am?
- [Sara] You are?

90
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:37,612
My parents are always
asking questions about my life.

91
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:39,856
He could pretend to be
one of my biz school professors.

92
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,283
[both mouthing]

93
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,428
I still can't believe that
you haven't told your parents

94
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,578
the truth about what you do.

95
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,621
You mean that
I'm a time-traveling superhero

96
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:47,905
who stole the family heirloom?

97
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:50,876
Hmm, okay.
Yeah, stick to business school.

98
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,270
We'll be back before
you can say Timequake.

99
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:53,294
Don't jinx it.

100
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:57,299
[Gideon] Too late, Captain.
A new Timequake has been detected.

101
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,925
You are needed on the bridge.

102
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,009
[sighs]

103
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:01,927
[groans]

104
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:04,639
What are we looking at?

105
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,893
Ah. The epicenter of the Timequake
is in Los Angeles, 1947.

106
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:09,686
It's the Golden Age of Hollywood

107
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:12,022
and the height
of organized crime in the city.

108
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,482
The real golden age.

109
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:16,276
All right, people, we're gonna
need two teams for the...

110
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:19,531
Sorry, honey. I think I'm in your spot,
aren't I?

111
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:21,781
Hey, don't sweat it, babe.

112
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,326
As Ava was saying, two teams.

113
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:25,660
Ray, John, with me.

114
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:28,872
Mick, Ava, QB from the ship.
Now let's do it.

115
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,168
Mmm. You hear that?

116
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:35,396
It's only my second official mission
with the Legends,

117
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,422
and I'm already being trusted
with the football.

118
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:38,506
Really?

119
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:42,052
QB means staying on the ship
and doing nothing.

120
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:46,348
Or it could mean providing the team
with vital information.

121
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:50,143
Gideon, pull up a topographical survey
of the city, please.

122
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,524
How you feeling?

123
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:58,127
[sighs] Great. I just needed to get
off the ship, clear my head...

124
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,151
[speaking Farsi]

125
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:12,624
[in English] Guys,
this is Nathaniel Heywood.

126
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,000
He's one of my professors.

127
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:15,102
- [in English] Welcome.
- Thank you.

128
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,146
[in English] Oh, we've never
had a professor over for dinner.

129
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,170
What do you teach?

130
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,007
Advanced Macroeconomics.
Behavioral Economics...

131
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:22,801
- [Zari] Hey, guys.
- Brace yourself.

132
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,930
Z here. So I'm at my parents' house
celebrating my dad's birthday.

133
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:29,516
After all, family is everything.

134
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:35,647
Speaking of which, it looks like
we have a surprise guest this year.

135
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,066
My brother, Behrad.

136
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:40,235
- Say hello, B. [smooching]
- Hi.

137
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:44,364
Anyways, guys, I gotta go.
Big love to the Z-Nation.

138
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,615
[speaking Farsi]

139
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:49,637
Insert that clip
at the end of the current file.

140
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:50,680
We'll start cutting tonight.

141
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:53,164
You two can set up glam
in the bathroom for touch-ups.

142
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,459
Hey, I thought this was
supposed to be a family party.

143
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,438
Huh, says the woman who just invited
her 48 million followers into her house.

144
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,464
It's 51 million. Try to keep up.

145
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:04,009
Zari, darling, isn't it marvelous?

146
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:07,095
Your brother brought home
one of his professors from grad school.

147
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,472
Zari, Nate. Nate, Zari.

148
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,639
Hi.

149
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,266
It's you.

150
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:14,728
[whispers] I saw the video.

151
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:17,439
Oh. Thanks for subscribing.

152
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,859
You know, it's the fans that really
make all the hard work worth it.

153
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:21,942
[chuckles]

154
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:26,322
What a weirdo.

155
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:40,211
Your sister is the secret woman
from the hologram message.

156
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:41,755
Secret what?

157
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:44,591
I thought I was hallucinating,
but Gideon was scrubbing her memory,

158
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,193
and there was a secret message
from your sister...

159
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,346
...telling me to find her,
and she's the reason I came back.

160
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,201
Are you having a psychological break?

161
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:52,682
No! I'm being serious.

162
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:54,893
Remember when
we dented history at Heyworld?

163
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,439
Your sister is the dent.

164
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,163
The traces of magical energy
lead into this office.

165
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,999
There's an infernal residue in here.

166
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:22,587
Sure is. Residue of a dead guy.

167
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:25,006
[grunts]

168
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,466
Oh, oh, stand back.

169
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,470
Ugh.

170
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:35,517
The victim was consumed
by <i>ignis inferni.</i>

171
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:37,184
It's hellfire.

172
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:40,105
Whoever did this to him
was not of this world.

173
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:43,483
Well, looks like our killer
is the Encore.

174
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,984
Bollocks!

175
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,278
Huh, there's the ticket.

176
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:52,117
[heels tapping]

177
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,790
[woman] Don't come any closer!

178
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:02,210
All right, easy. You can put
the gun down. We're here to help.

179
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:03,669
Where's Webb?

180
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:08,383
[Ray] Uh, we are the "& Moore"
of Webb & Moore.

181
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,135
We work with Moore. Webb.

182
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,096
You must be Moore.

183
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:16,933
[in American accent] Sure.
That's me. Johnny Moore.

184
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,394
Sara is my secretary,
and this fella here...

185
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:20,937
Has got a cop face.

186
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:22,104
Oh, thank you.

187
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:25,108
[chuckles] Sergeant Palmer
at your service. I'm undercover.

188
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:27,294
Tell Webb to call me when he's back.

189
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,362
He's, uh, on holiday. Vacation.

190
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:33,116
Which leaves me
handling your case, Miss...

191
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:34,658
Hill.

192
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:36,452
Jeanie Hill.

193
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:39,456
I hired your partner
to protect me from my boyfriend.

194
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,166
Oh, well, you're in good hands, ma'am.

195
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,753
[sighs] Give me a break, Johnny Law.
Half the PD is in Bugsy's pocket.

196
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:47,422
- Bugsy as in...
- Benjamin Siegel.

197
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:49,606
Doesn't like it when you call him Bugsy.

198
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:50,883
But here's the kicker.

199
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:53,595
He died last week.

200
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,431
And now he's back from the dead.

201
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,267
[Jeanie] <i>And he's more dangerous
than ever.</i>

202
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,686
[band playing swing music]

203
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,442
<i>He took over a joint on Sunset Boulevard
called the Blue Iguana.</i>

204
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,153
<i>Playground of gangsters
and the Hollywood elite.</i>

205
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,199
<i>Whatever vice floats your boat,
that's where you'll find it.</i>

206
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,161
[music concludes]

207
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,537
Ladies and gentlemen...

208
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,707
welcome to the Blue Iguana.

209
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,876
Now, have fun. I insist.

210
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,128
If you don't,
I just might have to shoot you.

211
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:28,505
[laughter]

212
00:10:29,923 --> 00:10:31,007
[photographer] Mr. Siegel.

213
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:33,468
Big smile for the camera, Mr. Siegel.

214
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,844
[camera shutter clicking]

215
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:46,864
Just, uh, cleaning up
a little bit of crumbs.

216
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,650
Please, Miss Hill, continue.

217
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:52,070
I was there when Bugsy
was assassinated by a mob hitman.

218
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,321
Saw the whole thing.

219
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,324
But then, the very next day,
lover boy shows up on my doorstep,

220
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,326
takes me to his club
like nothing had happened.

221
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,620
And that's just the biscuit.
Here comes the gravy.

222
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:02,622
He's different now.

223
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,583
More ambitious and fearless.

224
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:09,337
I want to leave him, but I can't
because I know he'd kill me.

225
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:10,839
[exhales heavily]

226
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:13,675
Look, Miss Hill, we can protect you
from your boyfriend.

227
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,083
But you're gonna need
to get out of town for a few days,

228
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,179
stay in a motel. Things could get messy.

229
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,139
But I don't have any money.

230
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:22,475
Bugsy takes care of all that.

231
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:28,940
How can I ever repay you?

232
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:31,997
No need to worry about that.
We just want to make sure you're safe.

233
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,782
Secretary Sara,
can you, uh, show Miss Hill the way out?

234
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,460
[in normal voice] Well, she took you
for an easy mark, Raymondo.

235
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,422
What? She was absolutely terrified.

236
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:54,089
Sara?

237
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:56,092
Jury's still out on the missus.

238
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:58,970
But it sounds like we need
to pay a visit to the Blue Iguana.

239
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,430
[band playing swing music]

240
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,445
All right, this is more like it.

241
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:16,988
Feels good to be back in the field.

242
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,284
Ava, what's your status?

243
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:22,911
Uh, beer.

244
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:24,763
Rory and I are just
sidling up to the bar now.

245
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,289
We're gonna keep an eye on things.

246
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:29,125
I'm, uh, seeing two zones of egress.

247
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,793
Back door's a gray zone.

248
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:32,646
Front door's got about four guys
sitting around it,

249
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,230
which quite frankly feels like overkill.
What do you think, Mick?

250
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,925
I think you need to relax.

251
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,259
[Agent Sharpe scoffs]

252
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:41,137
Ray, are you ready to grab Bugsy
when he comes out?

253
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,973
Ready and walking the beat.

254
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,851
Gotta say, feeling pretty spiffy
in this uniform.

255
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,022
[Sara] Bugsy's drawn himself
quite a crowd of ass-kissers.

256
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,858
Yeah, and judging by the cheap threads
and conservative haircuts,

257
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:55,860
I'd say they're politicians.

258
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,826
Well, if it isn't
our damsel in distress.

259
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:05,971
[scoffs] It's gonna be kind of hard
to protect her from her beau

260
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:07,497
when she's hanging on his arm.

261
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:10,208
I knew it.
She's as bent as a nine bob note.

262
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:18,257
Let's go.

263
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:22,929
[Sara] Not so fast, sister.

264
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,057
- [sighs]
- What happened to getting out of town?

265
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:28,702
You think a cab ride could get me away
from what Bugsy's got on me?

266
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,871
[with American accent] You and the rest
of town, by the looks of it.

267
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:31,895
Look...

268
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:36,067
Ever since Bugsy came back,
he gets whatever he wants.

269
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,069
And everyone answers to him.

270
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,989
- Politicians, studio heads...
- Even the cops.

271
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:44,617
Then tell me, how did he get
so much juice so fast?

272
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:48,204
By using America's favorite pastime,
of course. Blackmail.

273
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:52,000
He's got a secret stash of compromising
photographs he uses against all of them.

274
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,602
And what does that have to do with you?

275
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:56,629
Everything. I'm in those pictures.

276
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:00,800
Bugsy used me as bait to lure men
and women into his trap.

277
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,137
[chuckles softly]

278
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,055
When I first moved here
from Shaker Heights,

279
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,057
I thought I was gonna be famous.

280
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,686
And sure, I became famous, all right.

281
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,397
Just not the right kind of famous.

282
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,110
I can't leave without those pictures.

283
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,486
Satisfied?

284
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:26,200
You know, if Bugsy
likes honeytraps so much,

285
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:28,911
why don't we give him
a taste of his own medicine?

286
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,563
I couldn't help but notice you,
and I gotta tell you,

287
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,737
I like the way you walk.

288
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,491
I learned to do it all by myself,
Mr. Siegel.

289
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,785
Oh, please. Benjamin.

290
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:12,121
Hmm. Sara Lance. At your service.

291
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,414
Lance, huh?

292
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,209
What's the matter? You don't like it?

293
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,836
Well, I don't know yet.
Just trying it out for size.

294
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,923
You know, even if it fits, I'm a little
curious about the price tag.

295
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:25,134
Well, if you have to ask,
it's probably too expensive.

296
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,677
[chuckles]

297
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,221
I take what I want.

298
00:15:28,805 --> 00:15:31,516
Does that make you a thief, Mr. Siegel?

299
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,144
I am a lot of things, Miss Lance.

300
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,731
And I am especially a thief.

301
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:42,527
Well, then let's stop
all the tiddlywinks

302
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,238
and get straight
to the big reveal, shall we?

303
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,907
Now, I'm a reporter
for a new gossip rag,

304
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:52,745
and I've got some dirt on half the city
councilmen and the new archbishop.

305
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,247
It's in my car.

306
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:56,415
What do you say we go out back,

307
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,252
and you can take a peek
what's in my trunk?

308
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:03,631
I say, you keep talking like that,

309
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,925
I just might follow you anywhere.

310
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,343
[chuckles]

311
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,356
- Ray, I'm outside with...
- [earpiece beeps]

312
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:15,351
Benjamin. Car's this way.

313
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:18,938
You know, on second thought,
why don't we ditch the club?

314
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:22,024
How about you and me, we go someplace
with a little less company?

315
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,362
Actually, I think we
already have company.

316
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,825
Your eyesight's 20/20, doll.
Those are Mickey Cohen's boys.

317
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:34,245
But after going through hell,
I ain't afraid of nothing on this Earth.

318
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,669
You might want to jump out of the pot.
Water's about to boil.

319
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:53,472
[snarls]

320
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,483
Drop the gun. Put your hands in the air.

321
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,527
[siren wails]

322
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,032
Stand down, son.
We'll take it from here.

323
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,538
[Ray] It feels weird to be foiled
by the good guys.

324
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:19,040
What's the plan B?

325
00:17:20,124 --> 00:17:23,211
Well, it looks like
you're going downtown, Sergeant.

326
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:31,719
Tomorrow is huge.
We're making a line of dressy sneakers.

327
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,305
- It's gonna be so major.
- That's nice, dear.

328
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:37,266
So, Behrad, any girlfriends
we should know about?

329
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:41,187
No, Ma. There's not really much time
for dating, given all the coursework.

330
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:44,649
But you need to take your nose
out of your books on occasion,

331
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,694
otherwise you'll never find
a nice Persian girl to marry.

332
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,921
[clears throat] Behrad...
[speaking Farsi]

333
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,123
[in English] By all means.
Add to your entourage.

334
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:03,167
How much does worshipping you
pay these days?

335
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,295
[in English] My team
is my extended family.

336
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:09,298
They help me manage a multi-platform,
multi-million-dollar brand,

337
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:11,193
and I didn't even have
to go to business school.

338
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,426
Wow.

339
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:19,548
- Is that the Air Totem in the...
- [Behrad stamps foot]

340
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,020
[Mrs. Tarazi]
Why, yes, it is, Professor.

341
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:25,189
How do you know
about our family heirloom?

342
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,857
Behrad told me.

343
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,652
Really? What did he tell you
about the Air Totem?

344
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:30,820
[Behrad] Just that...

345
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:34,336
[voice breaking] I was so broken up
when I found out it was stolen.

346
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,409
We keep the painting up as a memento.

347
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:40,788
Even though it's lost, I feel like
it's still here with us today

348
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,331
in this very room.

349
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,629
- [earpiece beeps]
- So, Sara,

350
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:51,716
do you, uh, want us back at the ship
for a post-mission debrief?

351
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,175
[Sara] <i>No. Mission ain't over yet.</i>

352
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,386
I need you guys posted at the club.

353
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,722
<i>Keep your eyes peeled
and your ears open.</i>

354
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:58,848
Great.

355
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,434
- What?
- Mmm?

356
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:03,728
[chuckles]

357
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:05,437
You wouldn't understand.

358
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,566
That you were the boss of
a massive government organization

359
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:10,276
and now you do diddly-squat?

360
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,489
Wow. I take it back, Rory.
You just summed up my life perfectly.

361
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,994
Can I get a double?

362
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,790
Bugsy is gonna be pretty hard to catch
if he still has that gun.

363
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:26,685
[in normal voice] Well,
we best get our hands on it pronto,

364
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:30,546
because only a weapon from hell
can eliminate a hell-spawned Encore.

365
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,259
And that gun, it may be useful
in more ways than one.

366
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,471
Well, good thing
I have my best man on the job.

367
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:56,697
Jeanie was right.

368
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:59,617
Bugsy really does have the LAPD
in his pocket.

369
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,985
I'm gonna have to figure out
another way to get that gun.

370
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,354
Can I take those arrest summaries
off your hands?

371
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:11,879
I'm on my way to records.

372
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:14,882
Sure. Aah.
That'd be super helpful. Thanks.

373
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:20,035
[officer] Tough to watch the department
kowtow to a gangster.

374
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,973
That's exactly what I was thinking.

375
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,643
Ah. Good cops like you are hard to find.

376
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,018
Name's Sullivan.

377
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:29,021
Palmer. Ray Palmer.

378
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:31,649
Well, see you around, Sergeant.

379
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,276
Officer Sullivan.

380
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:35,652
[chuckles]

381
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,239
Can certainly set your watch
to that fine constable.

382
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,575
We need a plan B.
If Ray can't get this gun,

383
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,703
the last thing we need is Bugsy
blasting anyone else out of existence.

384
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:47,248
Yeah, well,
maybe a stretch of the old legs

385
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,208
and some fresh air
will give us some clarity.

386
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,884
I think I know how to get Bugsy's gun.

387
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,150
[with American accent]
So, you got my message.

388
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:14,084
Look, if this is about the money
your friend gave me, I already spent it.

389
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:17,194
I knew you were on the grift
from the moment I laid eyes on you.

390
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:20,072
And I never once fell
for that Yankee accent of yours.

391
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:22,950
[laughs]

392
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,828
[in normal voice]
Well, all right, then. [sighs]

393
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,911
Well, now that we've
dropped the charades, tell me,

394
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:28,998
what is your angle?

395
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:33,210
I want to take Bugsy down.
Free this town from his sway.

396
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:35,880
The only way to do that
is to destroy his blackmail stash.

397
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:37,756
Webb said he'd found it,

398
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,080
but I'm guessing Bugsy killed him
for snooping too close.

399
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,470
Well, that's bad news for Webb
and good news for me,

400
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,305
because I know where the stash is.

401
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:48,184
Well, aren't I the luckiest girl
in the world?

402
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:50,936
What do you want in exchange?

403
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,107
I want Bugsy's gun.

404
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,109
You're looking to ice Bugsy?

405
00:21:57,193 --> 00:21:58,903
No, that bloke's not worth it.

406
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,155
I'm aiming at the person
who brought him back.

407
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:02,865
Then we have a deal.

408
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:06,160
You get your guy, I get my freedom.

409
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:10,873
Now, how exactly are you planning
on stealing Bugsy's prized weapon, eh?

410
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:12,750
When we kiss,

411
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,045
I'll press my hand against his chest,

412
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:20,090
and then I'll run my hand
all the way down his body,

413
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,260
and then I'll grab it, like this.

414
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:24,469
[grunts]

415
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,808
[objects clatter]

[band playing mellow jazz]

417
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,818
- Do you want to know a secret?
- No.

418
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,821
I just turned in my keys
for my place in D.C.

419
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,405
Yep.

420
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,867
Everything I own is now stuffed inside

421
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:49,119
a Time Bureau
softball league duffel bag.

422
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,705
I'm essentially homeless, Rory.

423
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:54,542
Congratulations.
You're part of the team.

424
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,671
Mmm? Mmm-mmm. I'm a vagrant, a vagabond.

425
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:03,384
- Hmm. No job, no rent, no kids...
- Mmm-mmm.

426
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,511
Perfect.

427
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,890
I had so many responsibilities
at the Time Bureau. People needed me.

428
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,182
You get it?

429
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:18,148
You see that clown sitting over there?
The one riddled with responsibilities.

430
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:22,111
Look at him. He's miserable.
And he's welcome to it.

431
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,210
I just can't get over the fact
that nobody needs me to do anything.

432
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:27,783
Wait.

433
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,120
Nobody needs me to do anything.

434

[Sara] <i>You two still at the Blue Iguana?</i>

435
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,500
Uh... Yes, Captain.
Just following orders.

436
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:39,670
Great. I need you and Ava
to create a diversion.

437
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,381
Clear the place out.
I'm gonna draw Bugsy back to the club,

438
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,674
so we can capture him.

439
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:46,968
I can do that.

440
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:50,639
- [music concludes]

441

Always a pleasure, Chief.
The lobster was excellent.

442
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,063
Stop right there, Mr. Siegel.

443
00:23:58,147 --> 00:23:59,481
What's the problem, Officer?

444
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,318
I, uh... I just need to search you
before you leave.

445
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,777
This is highly irregular.

446
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,738
Actually, it's quite regular.

447
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,992
A new directive just came down
from Deputy Chief... Wiggum.

448
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,704
- It's just gonna take a second.
- What are you doing, son?

449
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,791
Mr. Siegel, call for you. Sounds urgent.

450
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,424
- Siegel here.
- [Sara] <i>Benjamin, darling,</i>

00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,014
Lance. What's the rumpus?

453
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,908
Must be pretty heavy
if you're calling me on the blower.

454
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:36,435
Well, something is going down
at your club.

455
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,936
Primo blackmail material.

456
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,522
Better leg it over here PDQ.

[officers chatting]

Sorry, guys. Bugsy's leaving
the station. He still has the gun.

[Constantine] <i>Don't worry, big man.</i>

You back to working the beat, Sergeant?

466
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:28,445
Ha! I was just admiring
Mr. Siegel's automobile.

467
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,447

00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:27,441
Jeanie, no!

627
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:42,999
They killed her.

628
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,335
Forget it, Ray.

629
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:48,380
It's Burbank.

630
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:00,350
Hey, holding cell still works.

631
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,229
Who are you people?

632
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,023
- You communists?
- Idiots.

633
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:09,859
I know you're probably
pretty confused, Mr. Siegel,

634
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,504
but you might as well
make yourself comfortable

635
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,238
because you may be here for a while.

636
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,867
I should blast you straight to oblivion,
you dumb bastard.

637
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,246
You made Jeanie's life miserable,
and now she's dead because of you.

638
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:23,790
I may have corrupted a wannabe starlet,

639
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,836
but you, you created a real monster.

640
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:30,463
Astra Logue.

641
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,759
You know what?
It's funny that you mention her.

642
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,886
I was just about to go and see her.

643
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:40,140
John, if you're about to do
what I think you're gonna do,

644
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:41,308
then you'd better be sure.

645
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:44,644
Hand him over, big man.

646
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:45,936
Go on.

647
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:50,608
That's it, big boy.
See, you're my ticket to hell.

648
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,702
Flesh become my flesh.

649
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:02,537
Soul become my soul.

650
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,914
Hades, firstborn of Cronus and Rhea,

651
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,666
I call upon you.

652
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,585
Light her up, big man.

653
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,980
Hey, Astra says you're banned.

654
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,273
Is that so?

655
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,027
[patrons screaming]

656
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,498
You just can't stay away, can you?

657
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,458
Careful. He's still got one bullet left.

658
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,420
I appreciate your concern, Benjamin,
but I'm not worried about him.

659
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,672
We're old friends, aren't we, Johnny?

660
00:36:56,758 --> 00:37:01,012
So, why don't you tell me
what you came all the way down here for?

661
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,598
I came all the way down here
to tell you...

662
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,149
that I'm not giving up on you.

663
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:16,986
And even if it takes me till
the end of my days, I promise you

664
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:19,531
that I will find a way.

665
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:24,953
Another meaningless promise
made by the great John Constantine.

666
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,206
You've gone soft.

667
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,833
[both laughing]

668
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,002
Not that soft.

669
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:35,463
This one's for Jeanie.

670
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,636
[howls]

671
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:46,474
I'll be seeing you around, love.

672
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,607
So what happened down there?

673
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:57,777
- I need a drink.
- Not this time.

674
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:00,028
Is Astra...

675
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:03,241
[sighs] When I got down there,
I was swarmed.

676
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,204
Astra had the drop on me.
She knew I was coming.

677
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,163
- And the gun?
- Is gone.

678
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,499
We'll figure out another way.

679
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:21,551
Hey, whatever really happened back there
with Astra, I'm sure it wasn't easy.

680
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,344
What are you talking about, big man?

681
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:25,972
Just so you know,
if I had "taken care" of Nora

682
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:27,599
back when we all thought
she was evil,

683
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:29,934
we wouldn't be happy
and together right now.

684
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:34,689
I had the chance to
pull the trigger to end all this...

685
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,192
but I couldn't do it.

686
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:41,446
What's all your grinning about?

687
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,616
I'm just happy there are
still good guys out there.

688
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,744
Even if one of them is
a Master of the Dark Arts.

689
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:49,829
You know, you're wrong about me, Ray.

690
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:53,541
But I will save Astra, and you
should know it's just as much for me

691
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,543
as it is for her. All right?

692
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:03,301
Hey, don't give Ava a hard time
for getting on stage, all right?

693
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,820
I don't want her to be too embarrassed.

694
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:06,596
[Mick] She's not gonna remember a thing.

695
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:09,849
Well, hello! Ha.

696
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:12,018
Where's my invite
to this party, huh, Mickey boy?

697
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,064
I spat in that. Old prison habit.

698
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:17,524
Mmm.

699
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:22,654
I cannot believe that I sang
in front of all those people.

700
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:24,738
I...

701
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:28,076
[exclaims] I was awesome.

702
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:30,370
I killed it.

703
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,723
And did you see my backup band?
They were like...

704
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:34,999
[imitates instruments and smooches]

705
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,002
Please... please tell me
somebody got a video.

706
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:41,172
- Actually, we...
- [Sara] Mmm-mmm.

707
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:47,387
Mmm, and another thing.
Seriously, Sara, I love you so much.

708
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,640
Working that side mish with Rory
was way more fun

709
00:39:50,848 --> 00:39:52,892
than running any stupid Time Bureau.

710
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:54,561
[slurs] Like, responsibilities?

711
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:55,644
Ha!

712
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,106
- Who needs them?
- Well, good, babe.

713
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,941
I'm glad you had fun.

714
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:04,195
Just know there's no small role
on this team. Right, Rory?

715
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,530
Right.

716
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:09,576
[snoring]

717
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,287
Okay. Night-night, sweetheart.

718
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,209
[exhaling heavily]

719
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:20,962
Look, there is more to Zari
than you give her credit for.

720
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:24,841
She's buried down deep inside
underneath all that fame.

721
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:26,092
You were getting played, man.

722
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:28,636
Don't feel bad.
She does this all the time.

723
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,431
- I know who you are.
- You do?

724
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:34,142
Yeah. The more we talked,
the more you looked familiar.

725
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:36,603
- Then I realized where I knew you from.
- The <i>Waverider.</i>

726
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,272
What's a <i>Waverider?</i> No. Heyworld.

727
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:42,817
Tell me that's not you there
in the star-spangled outfit.

728
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:45,903
In fact, you were both there.
That's totally you, Behrad.

729
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:47,795
Can't believe I never noticed it before.

730
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:51,159
What I don't get is
how Heyworld was 24 years ago,

731
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:53,453
but you two haven't aged a day.

732
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:55,330
What the hell is going on?

733
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,498
Zari, you've finally lost it.

734
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:02,170
You accuse me of being a fake,
but you're the one living a lie.

735
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:03,796
<i>- Mâmân. Bâbâ.</i>
- Okay, shh.

736
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:06,090
- Just hang on.
- No, I will not hang on.

737
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,259
It's time they finally heard the truth.

738
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,935
What the hell? Where am I?

739
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:20,021

Hey, guys. Who's your friend?

We can explain everything.

00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:29,155
Yeah. You better.

745
00:41:29,614 --> 00:41:31,324
Who are you people?

746
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,494
Guys, meet Zari. She's my sister.
