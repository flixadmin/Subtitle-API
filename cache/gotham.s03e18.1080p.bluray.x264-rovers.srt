00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:03,950
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

2
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:16,999
Shall we begin?

3
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,919
BRUCE 2: I am not Bruce,

4
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:21,363
and I won't let you tell Alfred.

5
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:22,498
How are you gonna stop me?

6
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,844
I'd like to introduce our newest member,

7
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:38,531
James Gordon.

8
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:42,195
Welcome to the Court of Owls.

9
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,325
- Are you okay?
- OSWALD: I just remembered.

10
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:52,938
There's someone I need to kill.

11
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,759
BARNES: This virus isn't a disease.

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,023
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

13
00:00:58,102 --> 00:00:59,334
I don't need a cure.

14
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,461
I will purge Gotham

15
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,898
and the innocents will thank me!

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,332
Their savior!

17
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:08,532
Their executioner.

18
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:21,165
BARNES' VOICE:
Guilty. Guilty.

19
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:25,844
What's this I see?

20
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,842
Captain Barnes being escorted
away by the orderlies.

21
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:55,290
Oh, who is this new player
that enters the fray?

22
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:13,589
JERVIS: And with that, it was over.

23
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:16,745
Leaving me to wonder what
mysterious forces are at play

24
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,614
in the middle of the night.

25
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:24,358
KATHRYN: Captain Barnes.

26
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:26,265
At last we meet.

27
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:30,108
- Who are you?
- Let's just say I'm a fan.

28
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:32,140
What do you want?

29
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,674
KATHRYN: The same thing you do,

30
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:37,778
for Gotham to be judged
and the guilty punished.

31
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:41,169
Well, then release me
and I'll do just that.

32
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,193
Unfortunately...

33
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:48,499
we're looking to pass sentence
on a much larger scale.

34
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:50,781
And to do that we need
what's inside of you.

35
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,149
The virus.

36
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:56,218
KATHRYN: Precisely. But don't worry.

37
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,282
I'll make sure he doesn't drain you...

38
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,751
completely.

39
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,660
Hello, Captain.

40
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:10,027
Strange.

41
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,300
STRANGE: I'm sorry, Captain.

42
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,681
This might sting.

44
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:26,269
Hey, Lee.

45
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,925
- What's this?
- My final report on Frank Gordon.

46
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:34,555
Cause of death...

47
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:37,246
homicide.

48
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:39,186
I thought Jim's uncle killed himself.

49
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:41,021
Did you?

50
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:43,757
Look, I know you're upset.

51
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:45,956
After everything you've been through...

52
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,162
D-Don't. Don't you dare do that.

53
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:50,331
- This is not about Mario.
- Then what's it about?

54
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:52,832
Why are, why are you here?
What do you want me to do?

55
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,051
Harvey, you are acting captain.

56
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,104
I want you to open an investigation

57
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,572
into the murder of Frank Gordon,

58
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,241
and I think Jim should be questioned.

59
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:05,212
You're accusing Jim
of killing his own uncle?

60
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,364
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know,

61
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:09,750
but I know that he is involved somehow,

62
00:04:09,926 --> 00:04:12,497
maybe not in his death,
but maybe in covering it up,

63
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,622
making it look like a suicide.

64
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,325
And I want to know who else is involved.

65
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:23,597
Are you implying I'm involved as well?

66
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:26,923
Tell me I'm wrong, Harvey.

67
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,245
Tell me there's nothing else going on.

68
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:32,239
Look me in the eyes
and tell me I'm crazy.

69
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,009
You're not crazy, Lee.

70
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,779
You're hurt.

71
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:41,991
And there's nothing going on.

72
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,329
We used to be friends, Harvey.

73
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:53,627
I know you're covering for him.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,529
I don't know what he's involved in,

75
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:57,274
but I'm gonna find out.

76
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:03,937
KATHRYN: The ruling council has decided

77
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:08,175
to suspend all Court activity
in order to focus our attention

78
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:10,410
on the preparations at hand.

79
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:13,824
Gotham's judgment is imminent.

80
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,116
To that end,

81
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,618
any members who have not

82
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:20,120
submitted their list
for review and approval

83
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,344
should do so today.

84
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,190
We are adjourned.

85
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:45,698
Excuse me?

86
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,096
Yeah?

87
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,964
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

88
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:51,091
Knock yourself out.

89
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,895
Her name's Selina.

90
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,520
Selina Kyle.

91
00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:58,465
She knew Barbara Kean.

92
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:00,467
She used to hang out here.

93
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:02,293
I think.

94
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:03,437
You think?

95
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:04,872
You don't sound real close.

96
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,437
Oh, no, we were... kind of,

97
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:10,654
but she was always
really bossy, you know?

98
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:13,113
And then we got into this fight.
I was gone for awhile and...

99
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:14,701
Yeah, I don't care.

They can't do what I can do.

134
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:59,646
I will heal you.

135
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,234
I promise.

136

Isn't it enough, you holding
me against my will?

Must you also hover while I work?

138
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,966
I'd think you would prefer this

139
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:22,679
to playing nursemaid to Fish Mooney.

140
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:25,505
I was able to save Fish Mooney

141

despite the fact that she had
one foot in the grave.

I took it as a personal challenge.

Grandstanding doesn't suit you.

144
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,985
Were you able to accomplish
what we asked?

145
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:41,254
See for yourself.

What do you want from me?

148
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:52,855
Someone tell me what's going on.

149
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:56,035
Previously, the Alice Tetch
virus could only be transmitted

150
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:58,738
through direct contact with her blood.

151
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:06,812
What is that?

152
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,679
Someone please help!

153
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:21,800
KATHRYN: We've done it.

154
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:24,030
You've weaponized the virus.

155
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:39,375
Pick it up.

156
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,116
No.

157
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,920
You win, and you go free.

158
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:48,853
Pick up the stick,

159
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:51,188
and defeat this man.

160
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:54,558
You're lying!

161
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:56,360
This is just another way
of manipulating me.

162
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:59,163
Pick it up. Prove me wrong.

163
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,230
All that pain and anger...

164
00:11:05,652 --> 00:11:07,433
you think it's strength.

165
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,019
It's not.

166
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:11,909
You think can harness it... you can't.

167
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,113
You think it's part of you,

168
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:15,780
but it doesn't have to be.

169
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:28,325
Do you know why you were
so easily defeated?

170
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:29,727
No.

171
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,829
Your rage, Bruce.

172
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,316
It blinds you.

173
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,902
You seek to control it,

174
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:41,339
and yet it controls you
and has ever since that night.

175
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:48,071
Rage and pain are two sides
of the same coin.

176
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:51,868
I can release you
from the pain of that night.

177
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,240
And when I do,

178
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:57,584
nothing will be able to stop you.

179
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,863
BULLOCK : <i>Listen, Jim,</i>

180
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:06,130
we got a hit on the prints
you lifted off the mask.

181
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:08,617
Kathryn's last name is Monroe.

182
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:10,835
She's from one of Gotham's
oldest families.

183
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,670
Her address is 450

184
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:15,644
<i>- Clinton Ave...</i>
- Nice work, Harvey.

185
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:18,202
Kathryn seems to be the only one
who knows what the weapon is.

186
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:19,851
So what's the plan?

187
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:21,846
Break in, see what I can find out.

188
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:23,214
What do you think,

189
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:25,155
she's keeping it
on her fireplace mantel?

190
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,650
<i>I searched the Court chambers.</i>

191
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:28,723
She isn't taking any chances
with the rank and file

192
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:30,262
knowing what the weapon is.

193
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:31,856
If there is something to find,

194
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,158
- it'll be at her house.
<i>- That's a big risk.</i>

195
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:36,327
You get caught, ball game over.

196
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:37,728
<i>I don't have a choice.</i>

197
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:40,506
Listen, Jim, about your uncle...

198
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:42,733
Lee came into my office wanting to

199
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:44,769
<i>open an investigation into his death.</i>

200
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:48,098
<i>She asked me point blank
what you were doing.</i>

201
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:49,840
What'd you say?

202
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:50,952
<i>Nothing.</i>

203
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:52,276
I lied.

204
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:58,504
Jim, she seemed like she was
in a pretty dark place.

205
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:00,551
Anything else?

206
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:02,620
Uh, yeah.

207
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:05,118
Not to add on, but I got a call
from a buddy of mine

208
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:06,442
at Arkham last night.

209
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,852
<i>Barnes was transferred.</i>

210
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,194
- Transferred? To where?
<i>- We don't know.</i>

211
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:14,030
I got Alvarez looking into it.
But don't worry, we will find him.

212
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:16,667
- Thanks, Harvey.
<i>- Jim, be careful.</i>

213
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,937
Oswald.

214
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,033
Hello, Jim.

215
00:13:28,533 --> 00:13:32,399
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
you're still alive.

216
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,740
Yes, I am quite hard to kill.

217
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:43,882
I take it this isn't a social call.

218
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:45,346
I'm looking for Ed.

219
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:46,751
We have some unfinished business.

220
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:50,049
And it turns out you are
the last one who saw him.

221
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,991
Yeah, before he escaped police custody.

222
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:54,926
"Escaped"?

223
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,661
From the great Detective Gordon?

224
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:58,163
I think not.

225
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:01,864
Ed went on television
demanding information

226
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:05,365
about a group that runs Gotham.

227
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,338
A group called the "Court."

228
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:10,108
And you called him and said
you had that information.

229
00:14:10,162 --> 00:14:12,777
- A ruse to get him to the GCPD.
- Perhaps.

230
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:15,810
But then you arrest him,

231
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:18,302
and, voilà, he disappears.

232
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:21,763
Sorry, "escapes custody."

233
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:25,023
Can you see how I might think

234
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:26,925
you may have handed Ed off to this

235
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,294
all-powerful group for some reason?

236
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,371
For your own sake, Oswald, drop it.

237
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,809
I knew it.

238
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:37,566
You don't know anything.

239
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:40,763
Trust me, let it go.

240
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,849
Sorry, no can do.

241
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:46,444
I assume the Court
doesn't like publicity,

242
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:50,014
hence Ed's sudden disappearance
after his television debut.

243
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:53,585
But that is exactly
what they're going to get.

244
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,620
Unless they deal with me

245
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:57,433
in a civilized and professional manner.

246
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,628
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
facilitating something on my behalf.

247
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:05,330
My number is the only one in here.

248
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,365
I will expect a call
by the end of the day.

249
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:11,870
Why do I get the sense
I'm being threatened?

250
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:16,207
This is a favor, Jim.

251
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:20,005
After all, we're old friends.

252
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,647
Right?

253
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,602
♪ ♪

254
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,766
KATHRYN: Talon?

255
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:52,036
TALON: Yes, ma'am.

256
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,924
GORDON: Kathryn.

257
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,310
Detective Gordon,
what is the meaning of this?

258
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:14,659
Who let you in here?

259
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:18,522
Oswald Cobblepot is alive
and back in Gotham.

260
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:20,741
He paid me a visit this morning.

261
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:24,702
He knows Nygma's disappearance
has something to do with the Court.

262
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:26,204
Is that all?

263
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:29,849
I'm tired of being kept in the dark.

264
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,542
I want a seat at the table.

265
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:33,444
How ambitious.

266
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:36,335
You asked me to be on the Court.

267
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:38,554
Now, I have done
everything you've asked.

268
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,835
I think I've proved my commitment.

269
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:42,887
I want to know what's going on.

270
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,723
I want to know what
the judgment entails.

271
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,826
And if you don't like what you hear?

272
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:50,914
Try me.

273
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,631
Gotham is sick.

274
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Crime and violence are so common

275
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:58,958
the people have become numb to it.

276
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,659
To heal the city,

277
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:03,387
we have to force them to take notice.

278
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:06,077
Force them how?

279
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:10,014
By showing the people of Gotham
their darkest selves.

280
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:16,288
I'll consider your request.

281
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:19,953
Now leave my house at once.

282
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,788
<i>BULLOCK: It's Harvey. Leave a message.</i>

283
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:31,656
Harvey, I know what the weapon is.

284
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:34,343
I know how they're gonna
pass judgment on Gotham.

285
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,127
The weapon is the Alice Tetch virus?

286
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:51,854
Kathryn said the weapon would

287
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,862
"show Gotham its darkest self."

288
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:56,259
Alice Tetch was
in Indian Hill for years.

289
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:57,564
They would have known about her.

290
00:18:57,642 --> 00:19:00,166
- It's the virus. I'm sure of it.
- Is that even possible?

291
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:01,967
Well, that's why you're here, Lucius.

292
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:04,471
I'm sorry to throw you into
the deep end of the pool like this,

293
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,179
but I need to know
what we're up against.

294
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:09,694
You mean beyond a secret society
that controls all of Gotham.

295
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:12,541
Well, if they could isolate the virus

296
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,164
they could transform it into any number

297
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:15,666
of compounds that could be released

298
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:17,414
on a large scale into the city.

299
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:19,054
All they'd need is
a sample of her blood.

300
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:20,710
Well, they ain't getting it
from the source.

301
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:22,489
After Mario broke into
the hematology lab,

302
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:24,569
they destroyed the rest
of Alice's blood.

303
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:26,670
I mean, where do they get a sample?

304
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:28,846
They don't need a sample
of Alice's blood,

305
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:30,114
just a sample of the virus.

306
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:33,217
The virus that she passed along
to the people she infected.

307
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:35,419
- Barnes.
- Exactly.

308
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:37,522
Barnes wasn't transferred out of Arkham,

309
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:40,250
Kathryn kidnapped him.

310
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:41,336
So...

311
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:43,628
if we can find out where he was taken,
we can stop this.

312
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,906
And how do we go about doing that?

313
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:49,167
I found this in Kathryn's study.

314
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,270
- Any idea what lab it belongs to?
- No.

315
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:54,405
But when I was running

316
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,507
the Wayne Enterprises R&D division,

317
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,643
we only had a half dozen off-site labs.

318
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:02,213
Barnes isn't exactly the kind of guy
who's gonna blend in.

319
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:03,877
It'd have to be somewhere isolated,

320
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:06,299
and small enough for them to control.

321
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,353
I think I know where they took him.

322
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:22,789
Just put them down
wherever there's space,

323
00:20:22,814 --> 00:20:24,313
and then go back to where I found you.

324
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:25,403
NURSE: Yes, ma'am.

325
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:31,342
Selina, I would like to introduce you to

326
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:32,843
Nepeta Cataria.

327
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,478
Or, rather, a very specialized strain

328
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:38,044
of a plant that I've been cultivating.

329
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:42,673
This guy is a "break in case
of emergency" type of deal.

330
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:49,105
You've always been there for me.

331
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,863
Even when I screwed things up.

332
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,779
Which was most of the time.

333
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:58,146
Just breathe deep,

334
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:01,105
and I'll be here when you wake up.

335
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:07,006
Just wake up, okay?

336
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,819
Are we going back to the alley

337
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:16,489
where my parents were murdered?

338
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,528
No. There's another memory
I want to start with.

339
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:23,947
The first time you felt the rage
after your parents' death...

340
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:26,546
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

341
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:29,705
The rage from that day
continues to burn inside of you,

342
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,051
feeding on your pain,

343
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:33,053
blinding you from everything else,

344
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:36,389
and, if left unchecked,
will one day consume you.

345
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:39,077
We need to remove it
before that happens.

346
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:41,394
You want me to give up
my memory of that day?

347
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:45,031
No. The events themselves will remain.

348
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,400
I'm only talking about
releasing you from

349
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:50,670
the destructive emotions
connected with them.

350
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:52,972
And if I don't want to be released?

351
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:56,810
You have chosen your prison, Bruce.
I'm offering you a way out.

352
00:21:56,878 --> 00:21:58,211
Why?

353
00:21:58,324 --> 00:22:01,839
You said I was to become
the protector of Gotham.

354
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:03,383
Why me?

355
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:05,518
Because you need each other.

356
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:07,941
Gotham needs a protector,

357
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:10,972
and you need a purpose.

358
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,361
I'm only trying to show you the way.

359
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,696
But it has to be...

360
00:22:18,661 --> 00:22:20,473
...your choice.

361
00:22:30,946 --> 00:22:32,772
Do you know where you are?

362
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,548
- My parents' wake.
- Yes.

363
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:39,052
You were surrounded by friends
and family, and yet...

364
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,849
I felt alone.

365
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:46,286
This was the first
time I truly processed

366
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:48,224
that my parents were gone.

367
00:22:49,732 --> 00:22:52,643
The first time I thought
of myself as an orphan.

368
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:55,245
Is that why you left?

369
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:59,096
No.

370
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,808
Then why did you?

371
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,699
I heard what they were saying.

372
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:08,113
He witnessed the whole thing.

373
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:10,718
- He must have been terrified.
- Devastated.

374
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:12,711
Traumatized.

375
00:23:12,736 --> 00:23:16,602
My parents were dead, but all
anybody was talking about was me.

376
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,821
How concerned they were about me.

377
00:23:20,548 --> 00:23:23,087
My parents had been murdered.

378
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,410
Gunned down and left for
dead and nobody seemed...

379
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:26,667
Angry.

380
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:27,901
Yes.

381
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:29,697
And so you left.

382
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:33,741
I hid in my parents' room.

383
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:36,702
My father was supposed to be
buried in a pair of cufflinks

384
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:39,178
that I'd bought him for his
birthday the year before.

385
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:43,684
He always said they were his favorite.

386
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:46,287
But when it came time to give them up...

387
00:23:49,076 --> 00:23:51,125
...I couldn't let them go.

388
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,485
It's time to let them go.

389
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:01,918
There.

390
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:04,622
You can lock it away, and once you do,

391
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:08,833
you'll be free of the power
it holds over you.

392
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:24,291
I've been waiting a long
time for this, Bruce.

393
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:26,573
Together,

394
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:30,308
we will make Gotham pay.

395
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:36,223
No guards.

396
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:38,593
No security.

397
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:40,335
I don't like it, either.

398
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:57,308
I guess we know where the guards went.

399
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,831
MAN: Hello?

400
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,038
GCPD. Freeze.

401
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:08,695
The police, thank God.

402
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:10,398
Keep your hands where we can see them!

403
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:12,253
I didn't want to kill
these people, I-I...

404
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:13,964
I just lost control.

405
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,480
On the ground, now. Now!

406
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,175
I'm the good guy here.

407
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,170
Oh, you're just like them.
You're out to get me.

408
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,950
GORDON: What have you done with the virus?

409
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:54,803
Who has it?

410
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:56,889
A woman, named Kathryn.

411
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:59,271
- Where is she? Where's she taken it?
- I don't know.

412
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:01,966
As I told you, I was
brought here against my will.

413
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,348
I know nothing of their other plans.

414
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:05,179
Hugo Strange, you're under arrest

415
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:07,679
for attempts to weaponize a viral...

416
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,373
hell, you know why.

417
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:12,500
Oh, you don't want to do that.

418
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:15,341
The delivery mechanism
that they plan to use

419
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:16,896
to release the virus

420
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,904
just recently arrived.

421
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:21,189
The shipment that came into dock 9C.

422
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:23,613
Yes. It still needs to be tested,

423
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,448
which means that
you still have enough time

424
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:28,276
to keep them from
unleashing it citywide.

425
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:29,286
But, of course,

426
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:32,643
if they discover that their
lab has been compromised...

427
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,729
He's right, they might
unleash it right away.

428
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,394
We can't take him in

429
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,229
or the Court will know we're onto them.

430
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,564
Are you crazy? What if
he's yanking our chain?

431
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,567
What stops him from picking up the phone
and calling the owl brigade

432
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,503
- the second we walk out that door?
- My research.

433
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:51,159
And a vial of my virus compound

434
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:54,680
which I secreted away,
unbeknownst to my captors.

435
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:57,352
A token of goodwill,

436
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:01,539
which I hope will be remembered
when the time comes.

437
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,872
Goodwill?

438
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,997
You're playing both sides.

439
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,158
You help us take down
the Court and what?

440
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,779
We cut you a deal?

441
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,873
But we fail,

442
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,318
and you appear to be loyal
to the Court, is that it?

443
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,810
You logical bastard.

444
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,684
Don't worry about the mess.

445
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,606
We have our poor test
subject to blame for that.

446
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,426
Good luck, detectives.

447
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,977
Get Lucius the virus
compound and the research.

448
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:39,657
See if he can find anyone we can trust

449
00:27:39,682 --> 00:27:41,236
to start working on the cure.

450
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:42,479
Where you going?

451
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:45,962
I gotta find out where
Kathryn's testing the bomb.

452
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:55,616
Kathryn?

453
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,314
KATHRYN: <i>I've thought about
what you said.</i>

454
00:27:57,379 --> 00:27:59,491
<i>You have done what we've asked.</i>

455
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,875
Maybe it is time to take the next step.

456
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,148
<i>Meet me at 331 Smith Place.</i>

457
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,773
Can't give me any more than that?

458
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:09,673
<i>You said you didn't want
to be kept in the dark.</i>

459
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,493
Let's see if you're worthy of the light.

460
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:24,673
Is that all you have?

461
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,771
I thought you wanted
to leave this place.

462
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,740
That's it!

463
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,224
That's it.

464
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,314
Yes.

465
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:44,538
See what you can accomplish once
you remove destructive emotions?

466
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:46,460
Tell me,

467
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:49,392
how did you feel when you
were fighting this time?

468
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,775
I felt...

469
00:28:58,064 --> 00:28:59,959
...nothing.

470
00:29:02,928 --> 00:29:04,131
I beat him.

471
00:29:04,444 --> 00:29:06,147
Does that mean I can leave?

472
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,651
Is that what you want?
The pain to go away?

473
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,809
I can take it away, Bruce.

474
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:20,623
I can take it away
and you can return to Gotham

475
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,465
with a power you never thought possible.

476
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:25,559
It's your choice.

477
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,839
Get up.

478
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,541
We're not done.

479
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,266
KATHRYN: James.

480
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,889
Glad you could make it.

481
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:54,961
Not sure I had a choice.

482
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,993
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you

483
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,397
for your gun and your phone.

484
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:23,810
Nice party.

485
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,288
The daughters of Gotham.

486
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,359
Socialites who believe they hold
the power in this city,

487
00:30:29,491 --> 00:30:32,319
when really what they really
are is window dressing.

488
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,295
My family was one of
the first in Gotham.

489
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,868
We've been on the Court
since its founding,

490
00:30:38,977 --> 00:30:41,149
making the difficult decisions

491
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:43,406
to ensure its long-term survival.

492
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:47,140
Which is why I've brought you here.

493
00:30:51,171 --> 00:30:53,436
Interesting centerpiece.

494
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:56,452
It's an aerosol dispersal bomb.

495
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,596
Dispersal bomb for what?

496
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,241
For the Alice Tetch virus.

497
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,743
So that's what you meant
by showing Gotham

498
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:09,986
- its darkest self.
- Precisely.

499
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:12,535
Infecting 200 people
won't change anything.

500
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:17,088
True. But the virus compound
only lives in aerated form

501
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:19,276
for a matter of minutes, so,

502
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,511
in a closed space like the room below,

503
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,246
it will be contained to our guests.

504
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:25,582
But in an open space,

505
00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:29,110
the radius of infection is a half mile.

506
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,354
This is merely a test.

507
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:51,493
KATHRYN: Place it in the
middle of the room.

508
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:57,814
Don't worry, you'll be safe up here.

509
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,979
I need to trust that you're ready to make

510
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:04,299
the difficult decisions
when the time comes.

511
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,641
That's why I'm here.

512
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,844
Good.

513
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:08,558
Because if it's not,

514
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:12,149
if you try to stop the bomb

515
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:14,149
or interfere in any way,

516
00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:18,197
Talon has instructions
to execute you on the spot.

517
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:35,888
Talon, right?

518
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:37,811
I'm assuming that's a nickname.

519
00:32:39,318 --> 00:32:41,215
Right.

520
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:43,484
Wouldn't want to miss out
on the sounds of 200 people

521
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,853
tearing each other's throats out.

522
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:53,409
The device is in place.

523
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:05,573
Hello, Jim.

524
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:08,042
I was beginning to think
I wasn't going to hear from you.

525
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,144
GORDON: <i>I met you
the other night, didn't I?</i>

526
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:11,823
<i>When you took Nygma?</i>

527
00:33:11,904 --> 00:33:13,372
- Jim?
- <i>I keep wondering...</i>

528
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,709
...what it is the Court
is planning to do with him.

529
00:33:15,852 --> 00:33:17,601
Stop talking.

530
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:22,025
This used to be a bank, right?

531
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:23,858
<i>First Bank of Gotham?</i>

532
00:33:24,056 --> 00:33:27,454
<i>I just hope it can withstand
whatever the bomb's going to do to it.</i>

533
00:33:27,564 --> 00:33:29,163
It sounds like we don't have much time.

534
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,360
Shut up.

535
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,532
Sure.

536
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:46,447
Where's Jim?

537
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,175
He's not responding to my calls.

538
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:49,386
I'm heading into the bullpen

539
00:33:49,434 --> 00:33:51,190
to see if anyone's heard from him.

540
00:33:57,455 --> 00:33:58,665
What's going on?

541
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:01,463
- Hey, Lee.
- Are you helping Jim?

542
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:04,315
Bullock, I get.

543
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:06,634
But has Jim also pulled you
into his madness?

544
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,574
- It's not madness, Lee.
- Then what is it?

545
00:34:09,706 --> 00:34:11,924
How many people does he have to kill

546
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:14,565
- before you all see what I see?
- You got it wrong.

547
00:34:14,682 --> 00:34:17,245
Jim's trying to make sure
that what happened to Mario

548
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,660
never happens to anyone again.

549
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:20,027
What are you talking about?

550
00:34:22,824 --> 00:34:24,324
Lucius.

551
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:26,459
Please, just tell me what's going on.

552
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:30,721
I can't.

553
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:32,260
I'm sorry, Lee.

554
00:34:32,588 --> 00:34:34,960
You're just like everybody else here.

555
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:54,153
Screw it.

556
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:28,721
FIREFLY: Duck!

557
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:42,769
Everyone out!

558
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,225
Now!

559
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,217
Took you long enough.

560
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:53,124
- I need to get these people out of here.
- And I need to talk to the Court.

561
00:35:53,148 --> 00:35:54,614
Have them turn over Ed. Remember?

562
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:56,215
There is a bomb down there

563
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,156
with a weaponized version
of the Alice Tetch virus.

564
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,766
If you want to be here when
it goes off, be my guest.

565
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:04,097
- What about our deal?
- You just torched their assassin.

566
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,366
My guess is, they'll be in touch.

567
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,008
Mommy! Mom!

568
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:25,391
Mommy!

569
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,420
WOMAN: My daughter. Where's my daughter?!

570
00:37:01,598 --> 00:37:02,659
Yes, sir.

571
00:37:02,684 --> 00:37:04,520
Hello, Kathryn.

572
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:08,068
- My apologies for the time.
- Not at all.

573
00:37:08,232 --> 00:37:10,365
How are things progressing
with Bruce Wayne?

574
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:11,301
<i>Excellent.</i>

575
00:37:11,352 --> 00:37:14,067
He believes in the destiny
I have promised,

576
00:37:14,129 --> 00:37:16,793
in a life free
from the pain of his past.

577
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:19,429
The boy and I will be leaving tonight.

578
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:23,593
<i>I trust everything will be
in place by the time we arrive.</i>

579
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:24,867
Of course.

580
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:26,732
OSWALD: Why haven't they made contact?

581
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:30,336
And where the hell is Ivy
and the human popsicle?

582
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:33,172
Hello?

583
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:35,714
Are you listening to me?

584
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,103
You're awake.

585
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:53,770
Selina!

586
00:37:54,293 --> 00:37:55,928
Are you okay?

587
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:58,866
Say something
so that I know you're okay.

588
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:03,887
Why does my room smell like
a giant bag of potpourri?

589
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,106
Oh! You're back.

590
00:38:08,426 --> 00:38:10,709
Oh, I can't believe it.

591
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,551
Oh, wait.

592
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,175
What are you doing?

593
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:24,081
You just got out of a coma.
You need to rest.

594
00:38:24,253 --> 00:38:25,624
This can't wait.

595
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:27,964
What are you talking about?

596
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,253
Where are you going?

597
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:31,811
To Wayne Manor.

598
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:34,866
To kill someone.

599
00:38:43,076 --> 00:38:44,263
GORDON: What are you doing?

600
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,709
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm leaving.

601
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:50,167
Well, actually, I'm resigning,
and then I'm leaving.

602
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:51,995
Don't. You belong here.

603
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:53,489
I thought I did.

604
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:57,156
Then you infected this place
and everyone around you.

605
00:38:58,328 --> 00:38:59,734
I'm done.

606
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:03,015
I am done with you, with the GCPD...

607
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:05,209
with Gotham.

608
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:07,145
What are you talking about?

609
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:09,257
You've taken everything away from me.

610
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:10,785
Everything.

611
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,651
There's nothing left.

612
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:14,893
And for what?

613
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:18,010
I would ask you for the truth,

614
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:21,783
but I honestly don't even think
you know what that is anymore.

615
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:24,415
You want the truth?

616
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:26,165
Fine.

617
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:28,587
I killed Mario.

618
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,802
I'm done apologizing for it.

619
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:32,437
He was gonna kill you.

620
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:34,844
- No.
- I saw the knife.

621
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:36,962
I saw the knife
and I pulled the trigger.

622
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:38,813
And I would do it again.

623
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,991
- He was infected.
- Yes.

624
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:45,178
Because Jervis Tetch
wanted to punish you. You!

625
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:47,690
Not Mario. Mario didn't deserve
what happened to him.

626
00:39:47,715 --> 00:39:49,861
You want to blame me
for Mario's death, fine!

627
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:51,719
You want to walk out that door
and never come back,

628
00:39:51,743 --> 00:39:52,743
I can't stop you.

629
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:54,742
But it will not help.

630

Believe me.

631
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:09,878
The other day, you asked me at Mario's
grave how I could walk away.

632
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:12,451
Move on.

633
