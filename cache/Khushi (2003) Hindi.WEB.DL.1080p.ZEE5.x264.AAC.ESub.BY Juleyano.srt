Don't be afraid. Everything

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:-2
Don't be afraid at all.
Be brave. Give me that towel.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:-1
Be strong.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:-1
Give me some warm water.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:-1
No, my dear. Be brave.

Praise the Lord!

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:-1
She's so lovable.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:-1
Does my moustache prick?

'This is the world in which every
man lives for just one reason.'

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:-2

'Love manifests in many ways.
Love between a mother and a son.'

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:-2
'Love between brothers and sisters,

You'll find every
kind of sari here.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:-2
What do you think of this one?
- It's nice.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:-1
Show me that yellow one.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:-2
Show me that one too.
- Show us few saris.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:-1
Did you like this one?

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:-2
Why's she so late?
She should have been here by now.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.880 align:middle line:-2
Who? Are you talking
about Ram Singh?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:-1
No. I am talking about Lali.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:-2
So what if your daughter
is a little late? Stop ranting.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:-2
Mind your own business.
Don't tell me what to do.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:-1
Lali is here. Lali!

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:-2
Ram Singh, hasn't Lali come?
- No.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:-2
Moron! You might not
have seen her in the crowd.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:-1
What crowd, sir?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:-2
There's just a single railway
line and a hut over there.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:-2
If anyone ever gets
off the train there,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:-1
it's only to have some water.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:-1
Then how can there be a crowd?

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:-1
Strange!

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:-1
She told me that she'd be coming.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:-1
What could have happened?

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:-2
Ram Singh!
- Yes.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:-1

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:-1
"The flowers are due to me."

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:-1
"Without me, they're all fake."

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.240 align:middle line:-1
"The season is my laughter."

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:-1

"Khushi."

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:-1
"Khushi."

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.080 align:middle line:-1
"Khushi."

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.520 align:middle line:-1
"Khushi."

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:-1
"The rains come down in a patter."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:-1
"The rains come down in a patter."

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:-1
"I feel like swinging."

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:-2
"I feel like kissing
the skies without wings."

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.240 align:middle line:-2
"I tread a new path
towards a new goal."

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:-1
"I can turn water into a spark."

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:-1
"I can turn water into a spark."

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:-2

go berserk at my touch."

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:-1

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:-1
"Here comes Khushi."

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:-1
"Khushi."

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:-1
"Here comes Khushi."

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:-1

"O little girl!"

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:-1
"At your feet, lies the world."

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:-1
"I wonder, so does everybody."

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:-1
"What is it about you?"

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:-2
"When you smile,
it ushers in a new dawn."

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:-2
"When you cry,
it plunges us into darkness."

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:-1

"It's all about
my stunning beauty."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.960 align:middle line:-1
"I'm the talk of the town."

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:-1
"My bangles tinkle,"

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:-1
"my anklets chime!"

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:-1
"My bangles tinkle,"

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:-1
"my anklets chime!"

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:-2
"Like a crazy beauty,
I sway in my gait."

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:-2
"I'm a bit mischievous
and a bit shy."

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:-1
"Nobody can guess what I am."

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:-1

Welcome, sir. Greetings!

Sir, Lali says that they're
here in the village to help us.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:-2
I've made all the arrangements
as per their instructions.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:-2
Where is my daughter
donating blood?

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.000 align:middle line:-2
Over there.
- Moron!

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:-1
Hey, you!

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:-2
Dad!
- You, moron!

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:-2
Dad! - How dare you
take my daughter's blood?

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:-1
Dad!

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:-2
How dare you?
- Dad, leave him.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:-2
Put that blood back.
- Dad...

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:-1
Come on!

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:-1
Hurry up!

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:-2
Get the syringe out that
you used to take her blood. - Dad!

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:-2
Listen... - And get another syringe
to put the blood back in her.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:-2
How dare you take her blood?
- Donating blood isn't a bad thing.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:-2
Donating blood isn't a bad thing.
- Blood is blood. It isn't water.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:-1
'Karan.'

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:-1
"It's 6 am. I love you, mom."

It's going to be rave."

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:-2

"I'm about to fall in love."

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:-1
"I'm about to lose my heart."

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:-1

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:-1
"Good morning India!"

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.720 align:middle line:-1
"I'll get to Tollygunj."

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:-1
"I'll ask them, How are you?"

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:-1
"The girl will ask, what happened?"

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:-1
"I'll ask her to come with me."

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:-1
"We'll have snacks,"

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:-1
"sweets and sweet curd."

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.880 align:middle line:-1
"Love blossoms in my heart."

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:-2
"I see the stars and
the moon at daytime."

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:-1
"I'm about to fall in love."

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:-1
"I'm about to lose my heart."

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:-1
"Good morning India!"

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:-1
"Good morning India!"

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:-1
"Life's short."

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:-1
"I'll find a girl as crazy as I."

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:-1
"Our love story will begin."

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:-2
"In the boat,
we'll sail across the vast gangs."

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:-2
"In the boat,
we'll sail across the vast gangs."

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:-2
"The boat goes in
rhythm on the gangs."

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:-1
"We'll sail in the boat."

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:-2
"The girl that prefers
Bengali music,"

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.040 align:middle line:-1
"will be my mate for life."

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:-2
"The girl that prefers
Bengali music,"

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:-1
"will be my mate for life."

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.560 align:middle line:-1
"Love blossoms in my heart."

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:-2
"I see the stars and
the moon at daytime."

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:-1
"I'm about to fall in love."

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.360 align:middle line:-1
"I'm about to lose my heart."

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:-1
"Good night India!"

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:-2
"See you tomorrow!
Oh, darling India!"

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:-2
Goddess Kali, please don't
let my son go away from me.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:-1
Please, answer my prayer.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.880 align:middle line:-2
Mom! Please don't
pray like this for me.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:-2
Why do you always get
angry with your mother?

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:-2
What should I do?
She is praying for exactly

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle line:-2
the opposite of
what I am praying for.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:-2
God must be confused. Should He
answer my prayer or mom's?

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:-2
What have you prayed for
and what has your mom prayed for?

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.280 align:middle line:-2
I prayed that I go to Canada
and she prayed that I don't go.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:-2
She is praying for
just the opposite.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:-2
Dad, do you mind
me going to Canada?

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:-1
Not at all.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:-1
If my son studies in Canada,

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:-2
what would be better than that?
- How true!

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.560 align:middle line:-2
If it were about five months,
I wouldn't have said anything.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:-1
But it's about five years.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:-2
Just five years, mom.
They'll pass in a jiffy.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:-2
What haven't I done
to get an admission?

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:-2
I gave so many tests. I ran
around for the passport and visa.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:-2
Mom, when I can stay away from you
for 5 years, can't you do the same?

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:-1
She's always crying, dad!

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:-2
Obviously, my son.
She's your mother.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:-2
One thing is for sure.
It's decided. It's confirmed.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.720 align:middle line:-1
I'm going and nobody can stop me.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.200 align:middle line:-1
I'm going.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:-1
What? You want to study further!

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:-2
Yes.
- Of course not.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:-2
We have very few educated
boys in our community anyway.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:-2
And you want to study further!
Where will I find a suitor for you?

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:-1
A suitor! What for?

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:-1
To play cricket with you.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:-2
Dad, why are you talking
about marriage right now?

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:-2
I want to complete my MSc. I've
filled in the application form too.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:-1
Sign it.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:-1
Sign it, dad.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.400 align:middle line:-2
Don't force me to
be strict with you.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:-1
Who do you think you are?

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:-1
You always do what you wish to do.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:-2
There are just four boys in total
who've done BSc in our village

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:-1
and the neighbouring villages.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:-2
Two of them belong
to our community.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:-2
One of them is going to America.
God knows why he is going there.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:-2
That leaves just one boy.
Ranvir Chaudhary's son.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:-2
I've begged him
and got him to agree

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:-2
to live with us
after your marriage.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:-2
I've called them over
tomorrow for your engagement.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.200 align:middle line:-2
Called them over!
With whose permission?

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:-1
Whose permission do I need to take?

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:-2
I don't want to get married.
I want to study.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:-1
Lali!

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:-1
My child, listen to me.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:-2
After ten years of prayers,
God blessed us with a child.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:-1
A baby girl.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:-2
If I get you married
in another town,

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:-2
I'll keep thinking
and worrying about you.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:-2
Tell me, will I be able to
live if you're far away from me?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:-2
Who said that I'd get married
and live in another town?

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.440 align:middle line:-2
If you study any further,
you will have to go.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:-2
So, I've called them
for your engagement tomorrow.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:-2
Ask them not to come. I want
to study further. Please sign this.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:-1
Here you are!

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.520 align:middle line:-1
You tore my application form!

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:-2
That suitor is coming
to meet me tomorrow, isn't he?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:-2
Just see what I do.
I'll beat him up.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:-1
Wait and watch!

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:-2
Why are you so restless?
Go to sleep.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:-1
I'm not sleepy. You go to sleep.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.440 align:middle line:-2
It's 2 am. And you...
- I'm not sleepy. You go to sleep!

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:-1
Lord Hanuman...

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:-1
Lord Hanuman,

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:-2
please make my daughter
agree to get married.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:-2
Lord Hanuman, please make
my daughter agree to get married.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:-2
Lord Hanuman, please make
my daughter agree to get married.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:-2
Lord Hanuman, please make
my daughter agree to get married.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.600 align:middle line:-2
Dad! - Lord Hanuman, please make
my daughter agree to get married.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:-2
Dad! - Lord Hanuman, please make
my daughter agree to get married.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.400 align:middle line:-2
Lord Hanuman...
- Dad!

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:-1
God has answered your prayers.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:-1
What? Really?

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:-2
You may call them over.
I am ready to get married.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.800 align:middle line:-1
Hail Lord Hanuman!

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.200 align:middle line:-1
This is my daughter, Khushi.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:-1
I call her Lali.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:-2
After the marriage, you can
call her either Khushi or Lali.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.840 align:middle line:-2
You can even give her a new name.
It's your choice.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:-1
Lali!

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:-1
Do you like the boy?

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:-2
I'm so happy that you've
agreed to the wedding.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:39.640 align:middle line:-2
But if you don't like the boy,
tell me. I'll find another boy.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:-1
Now tell me. Do you like this boy?

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:-2
'That suitor is coming
to meet me tomorrow, isn't he?'

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.680 align:middle line:-2
'Just see what I do.
I'll beat him up.'

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:-1
Wow! So, you approve of him.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:-2
The wedding of Virbhadra
Singh's daughter, Khushi

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.920 align:middle line:-2
has been fixed with Ranvir
Singh's son, Mahendra.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.680 align:middle line:-1
"I am Culcutta's 'Rasgulla'."

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:-1
"I am Culcutta's..."

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:-2
Where are my glasses?
- I haven't done anything.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:-2
Look over there.
- Please!

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:-2
I haven't done anything.
- Who is it?

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:-1
Karan!

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:-2
Passport, visa and ticket,
everything is done.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:-2
I'm flying to Canada!
- I am flying to Canada!

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:-1
Why are you laughing?

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:-1
I'm the one who's going.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.800 align:middle line:-2
You are going! - My passport,
my visa and my ticket are done.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.800 align:middle line:-1
I'm flying to Canada.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:-2
Go away to Canada.
I'm going to rot here.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:-2
Yes. I am going to Canada!
- I don't like Canada.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:-1
I only like you.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.000 align:middle line:-1
Oh, God! How could this happen?

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:-1
Why are you crying?

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:-2
What happened, mom?
- I don't know, dear.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:-2
The groom's sister is crying
after she read this letter.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:-2
Dear Khushi, forgive me.
I'm in love with someone else.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.560 align:middle line:-2
Had I told my father,
he'd have killed me.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:-1
I know, it's terrible to tell

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:-2
the girl a day before the wedding.
- Lali!

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:-1
What happened, Lali?

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.040 align:middle line:-1
What happened?

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:-2
I'll be fine.
- Bye. All the best.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.680 align:middle line:-2
Thank you!
- Bye, mom.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.760 align:middle line:-2
Dad, look at her.
She always sports a long face.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:-2
Look at dad, Mom.
He's so happy to see me off.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:-1
But all you know is to shed tears.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:-1
Let me come to the airport.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:-1
You! At the airport! No! No! No!

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:-2
I want to see smiling faces before
I leave. Not crying faces. Okay?

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:-2
My darling mom!
- Look after yourself.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.760 align:middle line:-1
I'll return soon. I promise.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:-2
See you, dad.
- Bye.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:-2
Bye, mom.
- Bye.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:-2
'Take a careful look at the
guy wearing glasses in that crowd.'

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.160 align:middle line:-2
'This guy has nothing
to do with our story.'

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:-2
'But he's the one who's going
to give the story a new twist.'

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.240 align:middle line:-1
Watch out! Apply the brakes.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.240 align:middle line:-2
'Do you know whose blood this is?
Yes. It's Khushi's blood.'

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:-2
'The blood she donated in Chamoli
has journeyed far to reach here.'

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.320 align:middle line:-1
'For Karan.'

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:-1
Lali! My child!

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.880 align:middle line:-1
Lali, just don't worry.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.800 align:middle line:-2
I've told the priest to
find another suitor for you.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:-2
You're going to
be married next week.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:-1
Keep quiet, dad.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:-1
Why, my child?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:-2
How can you make such decisions
without even thinking?

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.920 align:middle line:-2
Do you know what I've been through?
A boy has just walked out on me.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.720 align:middle line:-2
And you're already thinking
of finding another boy!

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.800 align:middle line:-1
I want to study further. But you...

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:-2
Yes, you wanted to study further.
But I stood in your way.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:28.840 align:middle line:-2
Dad, can I study further?
Can I complete my MSc?

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:34.440 align:middle line:-2
How will you study further?
I tore your application form.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:-2
You tore the form
of Pune University.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.360 align:middle line:-2
But I've also applied
to the Mumbai University.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:-2
They've even called
me for an interview.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.560 align:middle line:-2
If you permit me,
I'll go for further studies.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.960 align:middle line:-2
Mumbai University?
- Yes.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.680 align:middle line:-2
But you didn't take
my signature on the form.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:-2
Big deal!
Your signature is easy to forge.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.920 align:middle line:-1
I've done it already.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:-1
You have an evil mind.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:-1
What happened?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:-2
I have seen limbs
plastered and hands too,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:-1
but not the whole face!

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.000 align:middle line:-1
Moron! Wear your glasses!

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:-2
Those are my legs.
The face is up here!

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:-2
You rascal, you're laughing
at me instead of feeling sorry!

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.640 align:middle line:-1
You said you were going to Canada.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.200 align:middle line:-2
Passport okay,
visa okay, everything okay.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:-1
Nobody can stop me.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:-2
You are lying.
- Shut up!

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.400 align:middle line:-1
And your legs are flying.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.840 align:middle line:-2
One to Kashmir and another one
to Kanyakumari.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.280 align:middle line:-2
You can't leave me
and go away anywhere.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.600 align:middle line:-2
Karan! My son!
- Oh, my God!

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.720 align:middle line:-2
Greetings.
- Greetings.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:-1
Goddess, what's happened to my son?

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.080 align:middle line:-1
O Goddess...

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.000 align:middle line:-1
Mom, please! Please, don't cry.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.200 align:middle line:-1
Why are you angry?

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.440 align:middle line:-2
She's crying because
you've met with an accident.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.280 align:middle line:-2
This accident took
place because she cried.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.080 align:middle line:-2
She cried before I got into
the car, so the accident happened.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.320 align:middle line:-2
Thank God she didn't
come to the airport.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.400 align:middle line:-2
Had she come there,
maybe the plane would've crashed.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.760 align:middle line:-2
Dad, please send me to
Canada some way or the other.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:-2
Rascal! Why are you laughing?
I haven't cracked a joke.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:-1
It is a joke indeed.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.080 align:middle line:-2
When I broke a little toe,
I was laid up for a week.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:-2
And you... You'll be advised
bed rest for two months at least.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.120 align:middle line:-2
Forget Canada. You can't even
go to the loo for two months.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.040 align:middle line:-2
Shut up!
- Why must he shut up? He's right.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.360 align:middle line:-2
The doctor says you need
bed rest for at least two months.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.520 align:middle line:-1
Dad, what happens of my studies?

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.360 align:middle line:-2
You so badly wanted
to go to Canada,

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:-2
that you didn't apply
to any college here.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.920 align:middle line:-1
There's just one way now.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.160 align:middle line:-2
The Vice-Chancellor at Mumbai
University is a friend of mine.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.000 align:middle line:-1
If you wish,

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.720 align:middle line:-2
I can have a word with him
and have a seat reserved for you.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:-1
Will you go to Mumbai then?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.160 align:middle line:-2
What difference does it make
when I can't go to Canada anyway?

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:-1
Be it Calcutta or Mumbai.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.520 align:middle line:-2
"Outside inside out.
Living my life on coca."

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.040 align:middle line:-2
"Outside inside out.
My life is empty."

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:10.000 align:middle line:-2
"Outside inside out.
There is wind in the air."

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.840 align:middle line:-2
Hi, everybody!
- Hi, I'm Vicky.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.120 align:middle line:-2
Karan.
- Hi!

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:-1
Hi, I'm Madan Martin.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.200 align:middle line:-2
It looks like you're a
huge fan of Ricky Martin.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:-1
Exactly.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.080 align:middle line:-2
I follow a rule.
I fit in with whoever's a big hit.

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.640 align:middle line:-2
Whether it's Ricky
Martin or a rusty tin.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.240 align:middle line:-1
Thank you.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.040 align:middle line:-2
I'm Khushi.
- I'm Priya.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.600 align:middle line:-2
Whenever I visit a temple,
I find a lot of peace of mind.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.440 align:middle line:-2
I used to visit the temple
in the village every day.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.240 align:middle line:-2
I liked going there.
- Really? That's good.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:-2
Look at the politician. It looks
as if he's asking God for votes.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:-2
What did you say?
- I was only kidding.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.720 align:middle line:-1
Hi!

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:-1
Hello.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.600 align:middle line:-1
I've seen you somewhere.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.200 align:middle line:-2
No, that wasn't what
I was getting at. Please.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.920 align:middle line:-2
But it's true that
boys use this line

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:-1
when they want to befriend a girl.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.000 align:middle line:-1
But that wasn't I was getting at.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.280 align:middle line:-2
But I'm speaking the truth.
I've seen you somewhere.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:-1
I get that feeling too.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.680 align:middle line:-2
This is the first time we've met,
but somehow I feel,

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:-1
as if I've known you for 20 years.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.000 align:middle line:-1
True. That's how I feel too.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.600 align:middle line:-1
Anyway, I'm Karan.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.880 align:middle line:-2
I'm Khushi.
- Khushi.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.840 align:middle line:-1
Nice name. You do look happy.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.000 align:middle line:-2
Khushi.
- Yes.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.720 align:middle line:-2
You're here to...
- Khushi.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.440 align:middle line:-2
Friends.
- Friends.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.240 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.640 align:middle line:-2
Bye.
- Bye.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:-1
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:-1
Yes, in our college.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.960 align:middle line:-1
In our class?

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.560 align:middle line:-1
No, in the math's section.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.600 align:middle line:-1
What's her name?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.440 align:middle line:-2
Priya. - What hanky-panky
have you been up to?

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.760 align:middle line:-1
I've been up to no hanky-panky.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.520 align:middle line:-2
It's the same old status problem.
She's the daughter of a rich man.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.120 align:middle line:-2
And I was brought
up in an orphanage.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.800 align:middle line:-2
Why do we always have this angle
in every love-story? It's very sad!

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.760 align:middle line:-2
Okay.
- Tell me.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.640 align:middle line:-1
So now?

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.600 align:middle line:-1
Somehow or the other,

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.960 align:middle line:-2
I am trying to send
this letter to her.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:-2
Do you intend to get us
killed with this scheme of yours?

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.520 align:middle line:-2
Ma'am, please.
- Give it to me.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.560 align:middle line:-1
Address.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:-1
Listen, make him see reason.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.840 align:middle line:-2
If he doesn't understand,
finish him.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.960 align:middle line:-1
Sure.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.840 align:middle line:-1
You've had it, Vicky.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.800 align:middle line:-2
Did you have to fall in
love with this guy's daughter?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.400 align:middle line:-1
Hurry up!

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.400 align:middle line:-1
Hello, uncle.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.600 align:middle line:-1
Khushi, my dear. How are you?

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.560 align:middle line:-1
I'm all right.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.400 align:middle line:-1
Khushi.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.200 align:middle line:-1
How's your friend doing at studies?

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.160 align:middle line:-1
Very well.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.280 align:middle line:-1
Bye, uncle. Bye, Priya.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.200 align:middle line:-1
Bye.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.200 align:middle line:-1
Hi!

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.960 align:middle line:-1
Hi, I'm Karan.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.600 align:middle line:-1
Hi, Karan.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.000 align:middle line:-2
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:-1
What's that in your hand?

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:-1
Letter.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.280 align:middle line:-1
Love letter?

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.080 align:middle line:-1
Yes. How did you know?

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:-1
It's all over your face.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:-1
Don't you have any manners on

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.440 align:middle line:-2
how to behave with
a girl in public? - Hello!

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.680 align:middle line:-2
Don't you realise what people
on the streets will think? - Hello!

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.960 align:middle line:-2
Hello!
- You dress so well

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.320 align:middle line:-2
but you behave like
a cheapskate... - Hello!

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.640 align:middle line:-2
Mind your tongue!
You're talking any nonsense.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.160 align:middle line:-2
My mouth, my tongue...
I will say what I want to.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.080 align:middle line:-2
But my ears can't
listen to all this.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.000 align:middle line:-1
You're hurting my feelings.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.880 align:middle line:-1
Feelings, I see!

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.440 align:middle line:-2
You get friendly
at the first meeting and

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.840 align:middle line:-1
pass love letters the next moment!

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.000 align:middle line:-1
What feelings are those? So cheap!

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.080 align:middle line:-2
Ma'am, I haven't written
this love letter to you.

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.920 align:middle line:-2
My friend Vicky wrote
it for your friend Priya.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.880 align:middle line:-1
He said that she has

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000 align:middle line:-2
a strict father who won't
let her take his calls,

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.400 align:middle line:-2
and asked me if I could
deliver this letter to Priya.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.240 align:middle line:-2
I'm sorry.
- When I came here with the letter,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.760 align:middle line:-1
I saw a watchman at the gate.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.200 align:middle line:-2
I was wondering what I could
do when these cars arrived. - Okay.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.680 align:middle line:-2
There were these dangerous-looking
thugs with Priya's father. - Okay.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.200 align:middle line:-2
Okay, I'm sorry.
- I was so shocked to see them,

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:-2
I didn't know what to do.
- Okay!

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.960 align:middle line:-2
That's when I saw you
walking out with Priya.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:24.960 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:-2
Oh my God! - She's the
girl I met at the temple.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.280 align:middle line:-2
Okay. - I thought my
friend's work was done.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.280 align:middle line:-2
I'd send the letter
to her through you. - Okay.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.200 align:middle line:-2
But you, you tell me that I don't
have any sense, any manners...

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.080 align:middle line:-2
I'm sorry.
- Who do you think you are?

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.760 align:middle line:-2
I'm sorry. - I get it that
you have a tongue and you can talk,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.240 align:middle line:-2
but you also need brains to think.
- I'm sorry.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.680 align:middle line:-2
What do you think I am?
Some roadside Romeo?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:-1
I'm sorry.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.680 align:middle line:-1
You look pretty.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.120 align:middle line:-1
That is so sweet.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.280 align:middle line:-2
We've been studying
in the same college and

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.880 align:middle line:-1
yet we didn't know each other.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.160 align:middle line:-1
That's strange, isn't it?

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:-2
I also think it's strange
that we're here together.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.840 align:middle line:-1
For love.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.280 align:middle line:-2
For love?
- Yes. Priya and Vicky's love.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.840 align:middle line:-1
Oh!

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.400 align:middle line:-1
What did you think?

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.640 align:middle line:-1
Nothing at all.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.760 align:middle line:-2
May I ask something?
Have you ever fallen in love?

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.240 align:middle line:-1
You?

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.280 align:middle line:-1
Why not?

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.200 align:middle line:-1
Why not...

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.520 align:middle line:-2
What will I say?
Why didn't you fall in love?

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.440 align:middle line:-1
I don't know.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.240 align:middle line:-1
You don't know how to fall in love!

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.440 align:middle line:-2
No!
- So you do?

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.640 align:middle line:-1
O Karan. Please, change the topic.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.400 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.760 align:middle line:-2
Hurry up!
- Shall we leave, Vicky?

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.160 align:middle line:-2
Okay.
- Yeah, sure.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.160 align:middle line:-2
Bye, Priya.
- Bye.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.680 align:middle line:-2
Bye, Priya.
- Bye.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:15.880 align:middle line:-1
Bye Khushi, bye Karan.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.160 align:middle line:-2
Bye.
- Bye.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.040 align:middle line:-1
So...

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.160 align:middle line:-1
So?

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.240 align:middle line:-2
Thanks!
- For what?

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.200 align:middle line:-2
For dropping me home.
- You say thanks to strangers.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.880 align:middle line:-2
We are not strangers anymore.
So why be formal?

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.280 align:middle line:-2
But I've already said it.
What do we do?

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.640 align:middle line:-1
You must withdraw the words.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.520 align:middle line:-1
Okay. Return them.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.280 align:middle line:-1
Bye.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.800 align:middle line:-1
Bye.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:10.240 align:middle line:-2
Our cultural programme is
about to begin.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:-1
Come on. Practise.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.280 align:middle line:-2
Hi.
- Hi.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.320 align:middle line:-2
Letter.
- Okay.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.640 align:middle line:-2
Bye.
- Bye.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.760 align:middle line:-1
Oh, no!

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.840 align:middle line:-2
What happened?
- It's open.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.160 align:middle line:-2
The way you reacted over such a
trivial thing, I got scared.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.440 align:middle line:-2
Very good. I should
appreciate your friendship.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.280 align:middle line:-2
This is how friends should be.
Your friend showed trust in you,

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.280 align:middle line:-2
and gave you an
open personal letter.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.520 align:middle line:-2
He must have so
much of faith in you.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.800 align:middle line:-2
That's not such a big thing.
You may read it if you wish to.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.640 align:middle line:-2
No! It's a love letter.
It's very personal.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.800 align:middle line:-2
Your friend gave it to you
because he trusted you.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:-2
You gave it to me
because you trust me.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.160 align:middle line:-2
And my friend has faith in me. We
must never betray someone's faith.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.240 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.840 align:middle line:-2
What's the big deal?
The letter says, Dear Priya,

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.640 align:middle line:-2
I can't take you to
the movies this Friday,

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.160 align:middle line:-2
I've got to go to Nasik
for two days,

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.360 align:middle line:-1
so please don't be angry with me.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.920 align:middle line:-2
I don't know what I will
do without you these two days.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.960 align:middle line:-2
There's so much I will miss.
You, your voice, your lovely eyes,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.440 align:middle line:-2
your cheeks,
beautiful lips, the ones I kiss,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000 align:middle line:-2
and your lap, in which I
rest my head. I will keep saying...

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.000 align:middle line:-2
I love you...
- Enough!

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.840 align:middle line:-2
What?
- What a character you are!

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.120 align:middle line:-2
You should never read
someone's letter.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.200 align:middle line:-1
This is not an ordinary letter.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.760 align:middle line:-1
It's a love letter!

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.800 align:middle line:-2
It's full of personal emotions.
- Yes.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.240 align:middle line:-2
You've let your friend down.
You have betrayed his trust.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.400 align:middle line:-1
You are a freak!

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:-2
You are a cheat, you are a liar.
- Okay.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.400 align:middle line:-1
You are a pervert!

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.520 align:middle line:-2
You're a dirty man. You are jerk!
- Wait!

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.800 align:middle line:-1
Are you through? May I speak now?

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.960 align:middle line:-2
Vicky hurt his thumb, not me.
It was bleeding.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.120 align:middle line:-2
Can someone write
when he has a hurt thumb?

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.640 align:middle line:-2
No? So he dictated letter to me,
and I wrote it for him. Get it?

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.280 align:middle line:-2
I'm sorry.
- Do you need an explanation?

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.360 align:middle line:-2
I'm sorry.
- You just need a chance.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.840 align:middle line:-2
To fly off the handle
and you won't stop.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.680 align:middle line:-2
And you even say sorry... - I'm
sorry, I'm sorry and I'm sorry.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.760 align:middle line:-1
Do one thing.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.200 align:middle line:-2
Record I'm sorry on a
cassette a thousand times...

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.560 align:middle line:-2
I'm sorry. - Because you use those
words often and often. Okay?

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.560 align:middle line:-1
I'm sorry.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.840 align:middle line:-2
Damn it!
- What happened?

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.400 align:middle line:-1
The fan-belt seems to have snapped,

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.760 align:middle line:-1
I had one fixed just yesterday.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:20.960 align:middle line:-1
What do we do now?

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.960 align:middle line:-1
We'll lock it up and walk.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.600 align:middle line:-1
No problem.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.840 align:middle line:-2
The mechanic will take
it away in the morning.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.640 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.440 align:middle line:-2
Fine?
- Thank you.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.760 align:middle line:-2
Khushi, what are
you thinking about?

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.000 align:middle line:-2
Nothing.
What are you thinking about?

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.120 align:middle line:-1
Nothing.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.440 align:middle line:-2
Khushi, if I ask you a question
will you answer me? - Yes.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.400 align:middle line:-2
Of course.
- Okay.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.400 align:middle line:-1
Whom do you like most?

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.040 align:middle line:-1
Whom do I like most? My dad.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.600 align:middle line:-1
Of course.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.440 align:middle line:-2
Every one of us loves his dad.
He's the one who brings us up.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.840 align:middle line:-1
I too like my father very much.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.880 align:middle line:-2
Apart from dad,
who else do you like?

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.560 align:middle line:-1
Apart from dad, my mom!

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.600 align:middle line:-1
Who can forget mom?

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.440 align:middle line:-2
Moms are great.
At her feet lie the heavens.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.240 align:middle line:-2
Look outside the house. Whom
do you like, apart from your folks?

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.320 align:middle line:-2
Hrithik.
- What?

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.680 align:middle line:-1
Hrithik?

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.320 align:middle line:-1
Yes. Film actor, Hrithik Roshan.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.880 align:middle line:-1
I see.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.000 align:middle line:-1
Who doesn't like him?

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.600 align:middle line:-2
I mean, he is a good actor
and has got a good physique.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.040 align:middle line:-1
I too like him very much.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.080 align:middle line:-1
Look away from the film industry.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.920 align:middle line:-1
There must be someone else?

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.240 align:middle line:-2
There is...
- Is there?

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.680 align:middle line:-2
There is.
- Is there?

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.280 align:middle line:-2
Who?
- Sachin Tendulkar.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.000 align:middle line:-1
Oh my God!

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.000 align:middle line:-2
I know, of course.
I too like him very much.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.520 align:middle line:-2
He is a good batsman.
He is a good all-rounder.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.240 align:middle line:-1
I too like him.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:10.840 align:middle line:-2
Khushi, fathers, mothers, actors
and cricketers are all so common.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.520 align:middle line:-1
Everyone likes them.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.760 align:middle line:-2
But whom do you like
specially and personally?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.400 align:middle line:-1
Khushi... wait.

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.200 align:middle line:-1
Khushi, wait.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.040 align:middle line:-1
What happened?

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.680 align:middle line:-2
Tell me the name and
I'll say that I like him.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.840 align:middle line:-2
But please don't
bother me like this.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.040 align:middle line:-1
So what's the name?

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.760 align:middle line:-1
Nothing. It's all right.

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.760 align:middle line:-1
Never mind.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.840 align:middle line:-2
Good night.
- Good night.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.960 align:middle line:-2
I was supposed
to come there, but...

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.160 align:middle line:-1
Hi, Khushi.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.520 align:middle line:-1
Have you seen Karan around?

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.360 align:middle line:-1
Is it your birthday?

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.040 align:middle line:-1
No.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.600 align:middle line:-1
Something special at home?

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.960 align:middle line:-1
No. Why?

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.720 align:middle line:-2
Your new dress and
you look very happy...

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.520 align:middle line:-1
Something special?

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.760 align:middle line:-1
Nothing of the sort. Where's Karan?

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.440 align:middle line:-1
He's there in the corridor.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.760 align:middle line:-2
He wasn't there.
That's where I came from.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.600 align:middle line:-2
Maybe, but he's in
the telephone booth.

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.440 align:middle line:-2
In the telephone booth?
- Yes.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.960 align:middle line:-2
Okay.
- Please try to understand me.

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.560 align:middle line:-1
Please try to understand me.

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.000 align:middle line:-1
Hello! Hello!

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.240 align:middle line:-2
I couldn't come because
my friends asked me to stay back.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.160 align:middle line:-1
Hello, Madhu.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.760 align:middle line:-2
We have two or three
days off again next month.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.960 align:middle line:-1
Yes, I promise.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.440 align:middle line:-1
Madhu, I love you.

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.960 align:middle line:-1
Yes, I love you very much.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.000 align:middle line:-2
There's still a week, right?
So let me make up for it.

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.560 align:middle line:-1
Bye.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.360 align:middle line:-1
Hi.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.800 align:middle line:-1
Were you waiting for me?

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.640 align:middle line:-2
Well? You aren't
looking nice today.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.560 align:middle line:-1
Oh yes, that's what you will say.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.240 align:middle line:-2
Oh no, you're really
looking very beautiful.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.280 align:middle line:-1
I spoke just the opposite.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.360 align:middle line:-1
That's how you've always been!

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.920 align:middle line:-2
I was only kidding.
Why are you taking it seriously?

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.920 align:middle line:-2
Karan.
- Yes.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.880 align:middle line:-2
Khushi's looking for you.
- Yes.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.960 align:middle line:-1
Okay. Bye.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.760 align:middle line:-1
Were you looking for me?

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.240 align:middle line:-2
Yes.
- What for?

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.160 align:middle line:-2
It was something important
but I've forgotten what it was.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.400 align:middle line:-2
Okay.
- Karan.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.880 align:middle line:-1
Who?

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.280 align:middle line:-1
Who?

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.000 align:middle line:-1
On the phone.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.360 align:middle line:-2
Madhu.
- Madhu, who?

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.320 align:middle line:-2
My mom.
- Mom?

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.640 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.880 align:middle line:-1
But you were uttering her name.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.560 align:middle line:-2
That's my mother's name and
I address my mother by her name.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.160 align:middle line:-1
Mom.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.120 align:middle line:-1
Yes, mom.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.520 align:middle line:-1
Mom.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.640 align:middle line:-1
Yes, mom.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.160 align:middle line:-2
Get cracking.
The show begins in two hours.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.400 align:middle line:-1
I don't have time to waste.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.000 align:middle line:-1
Khushi! Khushi! Khushi!

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.960 align:middle line:-1
Remember your steps?

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.040 align:middle line:-1
You always teach me the same step.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.520 align:middle line:-1
Because that's all I know.

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.120 align:middle line:-2
What? Can you show
me something else?

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:54.520 align:middle line:-2
Everyone,
I would like you all to meet my

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.400 align:middle line:-1
old man.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.400 align:middle line:-1
Come, dad.

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.560 align:middle line:-1
Hi! Hi!

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.920 align:middle line:-1
Dad, this is Vicky.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.320 align:middle line:-2
He is studying physics.
He is classmate, my friend.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.760 align:middle line:-2
Hello.
- Hello.

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.560 align:middle line:-2
This is one and only Madan.
- Yes.

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.800 align:middle line:-2
He is studying maths.
He is also my classmate and friend.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:13.920 align:middle line:-1
Milestone.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.440 align:middle line:-2
Yes.
- Milestone?

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.920 align:middle line:-2
For the last ten years, I've been
in this college like a milestone!

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000 align:middle line:-1
My juniors have turned professors.

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:24.400 align:middle line:-2
But I'm still here, because
my friends, my cronies, my...

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.720 align:middle line:-1
Okay. I got it.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.360 align:middle line:-2
Dad, that's Jai. He is studying
physics. He is my friend.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.080 align:middle line:-2
Hello.
- And...

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.440 align:middle line:-1
Dad, she is Khushi.

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.440 align:middle line:-2
Hello.
- Hello.

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.920 align:middle line:-1
She is studying physics.

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.120 align:middle line:-1
She is my college mate.

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.000 align:middle line:-1
My...

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.960 align:middle line:-1
My...

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.120 align:middle line:-1
My friend.

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.280 align:middle line:-1
Meaning?

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.800 align:middle line:-1
Meaning she's a friend.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:14.240 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:19.720 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:33.280 align:middle line:-1
"Without you, life's tough."

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.320 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:44.040 align:middle line:-2
"It's impossible
to die without you."

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:49.520 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:54.680 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:08.520 align:middle line:-1
"Without you, I get no sleep."

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.600 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:19.200 align:middle line:-1
"Without you, life's restless."

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:24.520 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:30.320 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:14.160 align:middle line:-2
"Pining overwhelms me every moment,
I swear on you."

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:25.040 align:middle line:-2
"In the nights,
I see you in my dreams, beloved."

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:34.680 align:middle line:-2
"Without you,
laughter sounds like a wail."

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.880 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:45.440 align:middle line:-2
"Without you,
attaining is like losing."

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:50.680 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.240 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:35.120 align:middle line:-1
"I was lost in your memories."

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.680 align:middle line:-1
"I couldn't sleep all night."

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.600 align:middle line:-1
"Loneliness troubles me."

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.960 align:middle line:-1
"I have no one."

01:00:53.040 --> 01:01:00.720 align:middle line:-2
"Without you,
rose-gardens appear to be barren."

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.240 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:11.520 align:middle line:-2
"Without you,
this moment seems frozen."

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.760 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.520 align:middle line:-1
"Without you."

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.360 align:middle line:-1
Boo!

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:12.920 align:middle line:-1
Hi.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040 align:middle line:-1
Did you get scared?

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.520 align:middle line:-1
No.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.760 align:middle line:-2
What's this?
- A gift.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.600 align:middle line:-1
For me? Okay.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.560 align:middle line:-1
What's the hurry? Open it slowly.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.280 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.320 align:middle line:-1
Oh! It's an ashtray.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.160 align:middle line:-2
It's very useful
for smokers like me.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.280 align:middle line:-1
True.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.960 align:middle line:-1
Where did you buy it from?

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.360 align:middle line:-1
I bought it from Akbarali.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.720 align:middle line:-1
For how much?

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.760 align:middle line:-1
Rs 5000.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000 align:middle line:-1
Rs 5000!

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.000 align:middle line:-2
You bought an ashtray for Rs 5000!
- Yes.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.840 align:middle line:-2
It's no ordinary ashtray.
It's made up of French crystal.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.840 align:middle line:-2
It's expensive because
of its intricate artwork.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.000 align:middle line:-1
It's very nice indeed.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.000 align:middle line:-2
But you could have gifted
me something else instead of this.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.800 align:middle line:-1
I mean, I like it very much. But...

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.840 align:middle line:-2
It's such an expensive
and beautiful ashtray.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.840 align:middle line:-2
I'd hate to drop
ash in it when I smoke.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.280 align:middle line:-2
That's exactly why
I got this ashtray.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.680 align:middle line:-2
So that whenever you drop
ash in it, you remember me.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.880 align:middle line:-2
And you feel that
you're dropping ash

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.640 align:middle line:-1
not in the ashtray, but on me.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.000 align:middle line:-2
So, you will have
to give up smoking.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.560 align:middle line:-1
No. No. Absolutely not.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.360 align:middle line:-2
Karan quits smoking!
That's not possible.

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.000 align:middle line:-2
Ask me for anything else, and I'll
do it. But I can't give up smoking.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.640 align:middle line:-1
If you

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.880 align:middle line:-1
respect me,

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.280 align:middle line:-1
you will give up smoking.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.120 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.560 align:middle line:-1
Can I have a last drag?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.240 align:middle line:-1
Are you happy now?

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.160 align:middle line:-1
That's good!

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.160 align:middle line:-2
Bye.
- Bye.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000 align:middle line:-1
That's good!

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.320 align:middle line:-1
I have exams. I'm studying.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.520 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.280 align:middle line:-1
Karan.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.000 align:middle line:-1
Karan!

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.440 align:middle line:-1
What?

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.040 align:middle line:-1
This is not nice.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.720 align:middle line:-2
What?
- What you are doing is not nice.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.400 align:middle line:-1
Reading a book is a nice thing.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.440 align:middle line:-2
In any case, it isn't a girlie
magazine. It's a college book.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.680 align:middle line:-2
I'm not talking about
what you're reading.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.120 align:middle line:-2
I'm talking about what
you've been staring at.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.760 align:middle line:-2
Yes. I am taking
a good look at this.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.080 align:middle line:-1
Don't switch the topic. You...

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.560 align:middle line:-1
You were staring at my waist.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.080 align:middle line:-1
What!

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.440 align:middle line:-2
Don't act ignorant.
You were staring at my waist.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.080 align:middle line:-2
I wasn't.
- You were.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.560 align:middle line:-1
I wasn't, I say.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.600 align:middle line:-2
And I say that you were.
I caught you staring at it.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.960 align:middle line:-2
Well, maybe my eyes must have
wandered when I was turning a page.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.520 align:middle line:-2
But I didn't have
any bad intention.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.160 align:middle line:-2
You haven't been here
for more than a minute,

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.960 align:middle line:-1
nor have you read a page yet.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.440 align:middle line:-2
But you looked at
my waist a dozen times!

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.640 align:middle line:-1
Look, Khushi.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.160 align:middle line:-1
You're mistaking me.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.520 align:middle line:-1
What? I... I'm mistaking you!

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.640 align:middle line:-1
Khushi, you always mistake me.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.000 align:middle line:-2
Remember what all
has happened until now.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.800 align:middle line:-1
When I gave you Vicky's letter,

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.400 align:middle line:-2
when I told you what was
written in it, what did you say?

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.680 align:middle line:-2
That one must never
see other's private things.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.320 align:middle line:-2
You're wrong. You're a cheat.
You're a pervert. You're a liar.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.000 align:middle line:-2
You said such bad things about me.
Didn't you?

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.520 align:middle line:-2
And when I told you that
he had hurt his thumb,

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.240 align:middle line:-1
and he dictated this letter to me,

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:04.040 align:middle line:-2
and I wrote the letter for him,
you said sorry to me. Didn't you?

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.640 align:middle line:-2
Never mind that.
Let's talk about our first meeting.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.800 align:middle line:-2
When I gave you Vicky's
first love letter for Priya,

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.520 align:middle line:-1
what conclusion did you jump into?

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.760 align:middle line:-2
That I was giving
you that letter. Right?

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.440 align:middle line:-1
You yelled so much at me.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.600 align:middle line:-1
You just kept yelling at me.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.560 align:middle line:-2
Didn't you yell at me?
But when you got to know the truth,

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.160 align:middle line:-2
you said sorry to me.
Didn't you? I know what you want.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:33.000 align:middle line:-2
You want everyone to praise
your beauty, to be crazy about you

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.080 align:middle line:-2
and say I love you to you.
And when someone does that,

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.120 align:middle line:-1
you get worked up. You make a fuss.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.360 align:middle line:-2
You start accusing him
and say that he's after girls.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.200 align:middle line:-1
That's how girls are. Right?

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.520 align:middle line:-2
Talk about me,
not about other girls.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.880 align:middle line:-2
What do you know
about female psychology?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.960 align:middle line:-2
We girls don't pretend.
I don't pretend. But you boys do.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.920 align:middle line:-1
Do you get it?

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.840 align:middle line:-2
What did you do at the
restaurant the other day?

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.320 align:middle line:-2
You deliberately
dropped your spoon,

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.440 align:middle line:-1
so you could use my spoon to eat.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.360 align:middle line:-2
You were putting on an act.
What was going on in your mind?

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.800 align:middle line:-2
The other day, you said
your car had broken down and

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880 align:middle line:-1
that we'd have to walk.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.720 align:middle line:-2
And what did you
ask me while walking?

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.240 align:middle line:-1
That whom I liked the most. Right?

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.960 align:middle line:-1
You bored me to death.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.760 align:middle line:-2
And when your dad had come to
college, you introduced everyone.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.920 align:middle line:-2
You introduced Vicky to
your dad without hesitating.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.920 align:middle line:-2
You introduced Ajay
too without hesitating.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.680 align:middle line:-1
But when you introduced me,

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.320 align:middle line:-1
why did you hesitate? Tell me.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.440 align:middle line:-1
Why didn't you say it freely?

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.040 align:middle line:-2
Why did you hesitate then?
What feelings were you hiding?

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.560 align:middle line:-2
Yes. So what?
Despite knowing everything

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.600 align:middle line:-2
why have you been acting
as if you didn't know anything?

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.880 align:middle line:-1
What do I take that for?

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.400 align:middle line:-2
Despite knowing everything,
you gifted me an ashtray.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.920 align:middle line:-2
Okay. You gave that
to me as a friend.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.240 align:middle line:-2
But when I was talking to
my mother on phone the other day,

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.880 align:middle line:-2
when I said I love
you to her and blew a kiss,

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.680 align:middle line:-2
why were you anxious
to know whom I was talking to?

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.440 align:middle line:-1
You calmed down only after

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.360 align:middle line:-2
I told you that I was
talking to my mother, Madhu.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.760 align:middle line:-2
You presented me an ashtray
so that I give up smoking.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.080 align:middle line:-1
Alright, maybe that's friendship.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.680 align:middle line:-2
But the restlessness
you showed when

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.960 align:middle line:-1
you wanted to know who Madhu was,

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.520 align:middle line:-2
the possessiveness that you showed,
what would you call that?

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.640 align:middle line:-2
Let's not stray from the point.
Didn't you stare at my waist?

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.320 align:middle line:-1
Haven't you fallen in love with me?

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.720 align:middle line:-2
No.
- I didn't stare either.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:40.000 align:middle line:-2
I happen to talk to a girl
and she finds faults in me!

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.000 align:middle line:-2
I can never be friends
with an egoistic girl like her.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.920 align:middle line:-2
Even if we are friends,
it'll never lead to love.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.880 align:middle line:-2
Even if we fall in love,
we'll never marry.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.120 align:middle line:-2
And even if we somehow
make it to the marriage altar,

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.960 align:middle line:-2
I'll say that I can't marry a girl
like her and run away from there.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.880 align:middle line:-1
What a girl she is!

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:02.080 align:middle line:-2
I have never seen a girl like her.
What an ego...

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.760 align:middle line:-1
Khushi.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.360 align:middle line:-2
You have no right to
talk about my character.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.120 align:middle line:-2
I'll forget that I ever
met someone called Karan.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.440 align:middle line:-2
You and I have nothing
to do with each other.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.880 align:middle line:-2
There is nothing
between you and me.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.040 align:middle line:-1
Khushi, I...

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.880 align:middle line:-1
I...

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.600 align:middle line:-2
She looks like our
master's twin sister!

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.040 align:middle line:-2
Excuse me!
- Yes!

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.080 align:middle line:-2
Are you our master's twin?
- Oh no!

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.600 align:middle line:-1
We are all sisters!

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.000 align:middle line:-1
It's the master himself!

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.160 align:middle line:-2
What disguise is this?
- What?

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.800 align:middle line:-2
People stoop low to
have an album released!

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.840 align:middle line:-2
I've only changed my name!
From Madan to Badan Bhosle!

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.320 align:middle line:-1
What's wrong in it?

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.920 align:middle line:-1
Name an album of yours.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.040 align:middle line:-2
'Don't be stubborn, my love!'
- How about humming the tune?

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.840 align:middle line:-1
The tune! It's fantastic!

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.800 align:middle line:-2
I have really worked
hard on this song.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.040 align:middle line:-1
It's going to be a chartbuster!

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.960 align:middle line:-2
Do you want me to sing?
- Yes!

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.920 align:middle line:-2
"The bud of the night,
blossoms by day."

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.000 align:middle line:-2
"She's mischievous.
She wanders everywhere."

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.920 align:middle line:-1
"What else should I say?"

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.600 align:middle line:-1
"Don't be stubborn, my love."

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:58.080 align:middle line:-1
"What else should I say?"

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.200 align:middle line:-1
"Don't be stubborn, my love."

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.920 align:middle line:-2
That's the song
from a famous album!

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.000 align:middle line:-2
Nonsense!
That's the title of a movie!

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.960 align:middle line:-2
The album of the
same name was a hit,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.160 align:middle line:-1
but the film was a flop!

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.400 align:middle line:-2
Poonam!
- Yes, sir.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.000 align:middle line:-1
What's our relation?

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.680 align:middle line:-1
That's for you to decide, sir.

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:22.000 align:middle line:-1
I'll decide later.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.640 align:middle line:-1
Now tell me what do you mean to me?

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.280 align:middle line:-2
Secretary.
- What's a secretary's job?

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.880 align:middle line:-2
You find out which
album is doing well

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.760 align:middle line:-2
and its status,
so that they don't clash with ours.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.080 align:middle line:-2
Sorry, sir.
- Sorry? What were you doing?

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.240 align:middle line:-2
Well, sir.
- No excuses!

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.000 align:middle line:-1
You are not efficient!

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.960 align:middle line:-2
Want me to sing another song?
- Yes!

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.200 align:middle line:-1
"What would I do, if not die?"

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:51.400 align:middle line:-2
"You're the chosen
one in thousands."

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.160 align:middle line:-1
"My love."

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:21.560 align:middle line:-1
Karan.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:32.000 align:middle line:-2
Do not be mistaken. I haven't
come here for a compromise.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.800 align:middle line:-1
Why? What's wrong in compromising?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.160 align:middle line:-1
I don't want to...

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.600 align:middle line:-1
Sorry.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.000 align:middle line:-1
I don't wish...

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.000 align:middle line:-2
To argue with you.
I have something important to say.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.520 align:middle line:-2
During the summer vacations
when we were not around,

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.240 align:middle line:-1
a lot has happened.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.640 align:middle line:-2
Vicky went to meet
Priya at her place.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.000 align:middle line:-2
He mistook her father
for her and awakened him.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.880 align:middle line:-2
And got caught.
- No!

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.960 align:middle line:-2
Priya's father has held
her captive in the house.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.960 align:middle line:-2
Did Vicky attend class?
- No.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.720 align:middle line:-2
Vicky's and Priya's love affair
is going through a rough time.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.720 align:middle line:-2
We were the ones to
encourage their affair.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.040 align:middle line:-1
Khushi, did you meet Priya?

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.080 align:middle line:-2
I mean,
Ms Singh, did you meet Priya?

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.200 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.080 align:middle line:-2
I have come from her place only.
She was crying a lot.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.840 align:middle line:-1
I told her not to worry.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:41.080 align:middle line:-2
I promised her that it's
my duty to unite her with Vicky.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.120 align:middle line:-2
And you too have promised your
friend to unite the two of them.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.240 align:middle line:-2
So, to honour the promise
I've made to my friend,

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.000 align:middle line:-2
and for you to honour the
promise you've made to your friend,

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.200 align:middle line:-1
we must.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.240 align:middle line:-1
Keep speaking.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.800 align:middle line:-2
We must get together
and unite them.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.720 align:middle line:-1
Together we must...

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.960 align:middle line:-2
What I'm saying is that...
Let me make it clear to you.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.880 align:middle line:-2
In the process of uniting them,
the relationship that we'll share

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.840 align:middle line:-1
is what I'll decide right now.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.160 align:middle line:-2
It will not be love,
nor friendship.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.920 align:middle line:-2
There won't be any
relationship between us.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.640 align:middle line:-1
We'll only be acquaintances.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.640 align:middle line:-2
We'll be together only
till they are united.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.640 align:middle line:-1
I hope that you will do so.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.400 align:middle line:-2
That you will do it,
is what I am sure of.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:02.640 align:middle line:-2
What can I say now?
You've said what I wanted to say.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.800 align:middle line:-1
Shall we go to meet Vicky?

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.680 align:middle line:-1
Let's go.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:29.200 align:middle line:-2
You're the limit!
Couldn't you wait for two months?

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.920 align:middle line:-1
Vicky, all I want to know is

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.640 align:middle line:-2
what did you tell Priya's
dad when you woke him up?

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.800 align:middle line:-2
Did you say, 'Priya, here I am.'
Or did you say,

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.520 align:middle line:-2
'Sorry, uncle. I am here
for your daughter. Not you.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.800 align:middle line:-1
Karan, please.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.680 align:middle line:-2
This is exactly why I
tell you not to fall in love.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.680 align:middle line:-2
Look at me. I'm such a happy man.
Do you know why?

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.800 align:middle line:-2
Because I'm not
in love with anyone.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.800 align:middle line:-2
That's why I don't
have any problems like you.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.760 align:middle line:-2
Look at your face.
You look like a jilted lover.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.440 align:middle line:-2
All you can think
or speak about is Priya.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.840 align:middle line:-2
Karan!
- Yes.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:13.280 align:middle line:-2
To hide your pain and fake a
laughter is nothing but stupidity.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.840 align:middle line:-2
What?
- I'm talking about Vicky's pain.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.040 align:middle line:-1
The one you're feeling too.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.160 align:middle line:-1
Do you think that feeling sad

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.560 align:middle line:-2
and crying is going
to solve the problem? No.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.840 align:middle line:-2
Just concentrate on your studies,
Vicky. As for your love,

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.240 align:middle line:-1
leave it to us.

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.320 align:middle line:-2
It's our responsibility
to unite Priya and you.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.680 align:middle line:-1
Don't you trust my words? Okay.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.840 align:middle line:-1
You do trust your love, don't you?

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.640 align:middle line:-2
If your love is true,
it'll surely unite the two of you.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.680 align:middle line:-2
Am I right?
- What?

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.080 align:middle line:-2
If our love is true,
it'll surely unite us. Right?

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.680 align:middle line:-2
Yes.
- Yes. Yes, indeed.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.000 align:middle line:-2
Bye, Vicky!
- Bye, Vicky!

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:10.880 align:middle line:-1
Bye!

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:23.000 align:middle line:-2
Khushi. There is no need
to go walking. I'll drop you.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:31.640 align:middle line:-2
You needn't be my girlfriend
or friend for me to drop you.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.640 align:middle line:-2
It doesn't need a relationship
at all. You could say

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.240 align:middle line:-2
that you've taken a
lift in a stranger's car.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.920 align:middle line:-2
And I too will think that I gave a
lift to a girl who was a stranger.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:49.280 align:middle line:-2
If you still want to walk,
it's up to you.

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.000 align:middle line:-1
What can I do about it?

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.240 align:middle line:-2
I live in the hostel now.
Not in that flat.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.440 align:middle line:-2
I went to stay in
the hostel in order

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.160 align:middle line:-1
to distance myself from someone.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.680 align:middle line:-2
Okay. I'll drop you
at your hostel then.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.440 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:58.360 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:02.760 align:middle line:-2
"Two strangers, where
are they headed?"

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:07.680 align:middle line:-1
"Where are they headed?"

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.800 align:middle line:-2
"They appear to be
angry with each other."

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:17.760 align:middle line:-2
"They appear to be
angry with each other."

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:22.920 align:middle line:-1
"Even as they go together."

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.680 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:32.640 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:42.160 align:middle line:-2
"Two strangers,
where are they headed?"

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:52.440 align:middle line:-2
"They appear to be
angry with each other."

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:56.960 align:middle line:-1
"Even as they go together."

01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.840 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:07.080 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:52.280 align:middle line:-2
"They're awake. They're asleep.
Where are they lost?"

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:02.640 align:middle line:-2
"They're awake. They're asleep.
Where are they lost?"

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:07.640 align:middle line:-2
"Stop faking anger.
Be friends again."

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.240 align:middle line:-1
"Don't break each other's hearts,"

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.040 align:middle line:-1
"that isn't a nice thing to do."

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.960 align:middle line:-1
"From a distance, up close."

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:23.040 align:middle line:-1
"From a distance, up close."

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.240 align:middle line:-2
"They torment each other,
but they go together."

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.840 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:36.000 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.920 align:middle line:-1
"A little desire, a little hatred."

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:16.920 align:middle line:-2
"What exactly do
they want in love?"

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.840 align:middle line:-1
"A little desire, a little hatred."

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.920 align:middle line:-2
"What exactly do
they want in love?"

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.840 align:middle line:-1
"Yes and no is all they say."

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:37.280 align:middle line:-2
"What's in their hearts?
No one knows."

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.280 align:middle line:-2
"Longing in their
eyes to see each other."

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:47.280 align:middle line:-2
"Longing in their
eyes to see each other."

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.800 align:middle line:-1
"They're afraid, they go together."

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:57.000 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.000 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:11.760 align:middle line:-2
"Two strangers,
where are they headed?"

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.560 align:middle line:-2
"They appear to be
angry with each other."

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.520 align:middle line:-2
"They appear to be
angry with each other."

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.320 align:middle line:-1
"Even as they go together."

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.320 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:36.080 align:middle line:-1
"Oh gosh!"

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.040 align:middle line:-1
No!

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.040 align:middle line:-2
I haven't done anything this time.
It has stalled on its own.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.320 align:middle line:-1
Really! Please believe me!

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.000 align:middle line:-2
The wire of the spark-plug
has come off. Two minutes.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:32.920 align:middle line:-1
Wait.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.760 align:middle line:-1
Thank you.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.360 align:middle line:-1
Thanks.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.560 align:middle line:-2
When a stranger drops me home,
I always thank him.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.600 align:middle line:-1
That's a habit of mine.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.920 align:middle line:-1
Nice habit.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.000 align:middle line:-2
Because of the way I am dressed
up... - Please listen to me.

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.800 align:middle line:-2
You got to know that
I'm from the village!

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.360 align:middle line:-2
You want to rob me?
- No, sir.

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.720 align:middle line:-2
Thief! I asked you to take
me to the Mumbai University.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.680 align:middle line:-2
No, sir. - And you've been taking
me around Mumbai!

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.680 align:middle line:-2
You've been driving around
the same place again and again.

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:28.640 align:middle line:-2
No, sir. - Forget it, sir.
It's human to err.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.880 align:middle line:-2
It looks like you are
hand in glove with him.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.400 align:middle line:-2
You cheat! You thief!
- Sir!

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.720 align:middle line:-2
I made a mistake.
Please forgive me. - Sir...

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.120 align:middle line:-1
Please let him go, sir.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000 align:middle line:-2
Come with me.
I'll drop you wherever you say.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:46.080 align:middle line:-2
You don't appear to be a cabby.
Why will you drop me anywhere?

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.920 align:middle line:-2
He's the one who'll take me there.
You get going.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.840 align:middle line:-2
You.
- Sir, please.

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:53.160 align:middle line:-2
Until you leave, no one else
will be able to move from here.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.560 align:middle line:-2
The traffic has come to
a standstill because of you.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:00.600 align:middle line:-2
I study at the Mumbai University.
Come with me. I'll take you there.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.800 align:middle line:-1
Please come with me.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.800 align:middle line:-2
You take me to be an idiot!
- Sir, please stop. Please.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:12.000 align:middle line:-1
The moron!

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.960 align:middle line:-1
Son, how do you live in this city?

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.560 align:middle line:-2
Everyone here appears
to be a fraud to me.

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.640 align:middle line:-2
But you're a nice boy.
- Thank you.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.640 align:middle line:-1
Guess what I like most about you!

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.040 align:middle line:-1
Your smile.

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.160 align:middle line:-1
Do you know my daughter?

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.720 align:middle line:-2
Who?
- Lali.

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.840 align:middle line:-2
Lali?
- Yes.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:46.880 align:middle line:-2
How would you know her? There must
be so many girls in the college.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:47.800 align:middle line:-1
Right.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:52.120 align:middle line:-2
There's this hostel
near the college.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.240 align:middle line:-1
Which hostel?

01:28:53.800 --> 01:29:00.560 align:middle line:-1
Now what is the name? Mary...

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.840 align:middle line:-1
St Mary's Girls Hostel!

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.000 align:middle line:-2
Right, St Mary's Girls Hostel!
- Right.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.800 align:middle line:-2
Do you know where the hostel is?
- Know?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.280 align:middle line:-1
I can't ever forget that hostel.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.320 align:middle line:-1
Why?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.880 align:middle line:-2
There's this girl
I know who stays there.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:19.880 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000 align:middle line:-2
She's no ordinary girl, mind you.
She has a massive ego.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.320 align:middle line:-1
What?

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.640 align:middle line:-1
Ego.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.360 align:middle line:-1
What does that mean?

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.800 align:middle line:-1
Ego meaning...

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.080 align:middle line:-1
Ego meaning...

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.760 align:middle line:-1
She thinks she's the last word.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.800 align:middle line:-1
I see.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.240 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:43.280 align:middle line:-2
Even when she knows she's wrong,
she'll never say sorry.

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.560 align:middle line:-1
Ego!

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.200 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.600 align:middle line:-1
This damn ego...

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:54.040 align:middle line:-2
How will I explain it to you?
This girl...

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:59.880 align:middle line:-1
She's stubborn, a bit eccentric...

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.760 align:middle line:-1
She is...

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:04.000 align:middle line:-1
I get it.

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.200 align:middle line:-2
That daughter of
an ass is arrogant.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.960 align:middle line:-1
Yes, arrogant!

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.560 align:middle line:-1
Uncle, you are right.

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.640 align:middle line:-2
I wanted to tell
you about the girl,

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:20.000 align:middle line:-1
but you've spoken about her family!

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.120 align:middle line:-1
You are great, uncle.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.320 align:middle line:-1
Uncle.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:31.400 align:middle line:-1
She's just a girl, you know.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.680 align:middle line:-2
If she can be so arrogant,
am I any less?

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.200 align:middle line:-2
Oh yes.
- Oh yes!

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.120 align:middle line:-1
That's the block.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.000 align:middle line:-1
Thank you very much.

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.120 align:middle line:-1
Thank you very much.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.760 align:middle line:-1
I live in Chamoli, son.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.120 align:middle line:-2
If you ever visit the place,
do meet me. - Okay.

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:03.960 align:middle line:-2
Bye.
- See you.

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.960 align:middle line:-2
Lali! My dear!
- Dad!

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.000 align:middle line:-2
How are you?
- I'm fine.

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.640 align:middle line:-1
Why are you so late?

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.200 align:middle line:-1
What will I tell you?

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.280 align:middle line:-2
On my way,
I got into a fight with a cabbie.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.640 align:middle line:-2
It was a terrible fight
and a nice boy helped me.

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:25.240 align:middle line:-1
He... Just hold on for a moment.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:27.560 align:middle line:-2
Hello, son... hello!
- Dad!

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:31.880 align:middle line:-1
Son, come here.

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:34.360 align:middle line:-1
Lali, come here.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:54.440 align:middle line:-2
As I was telling you, I got
into a fight with a crazy cabbie.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:58.240 align:middle line:-2
And a decent boy came along
and helped me. He's the one.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.560 align:middle line:-1
This is my daughter, Lali.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.520 align:middle line:-2
Lali?
- That's my pet name.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:04.920 align:middle line:-1
Oh!

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.600 align:middle line:-1
Nice to meet you, Lali.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.440 align:middle line:-1
Anyway, I'm Karan.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.920 align:middle line:-2
Have some coffee with me
before you leave.

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:17.760 align:middle line:-2
Thanks, but I've got to go.
- Oh no.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.440 align:middle line:-2
Back in the village,
we don't let a guest go away

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.520 align:middle line:-1
without extending our hospitality.

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.280 align:middle line:-2
Uncle. - If you leave
without having coffee,

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.920 align:middle line:-1
I'm going to feel bad.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.520 align:middle line:-2
But, uncle...
- Ask him to stay, dear.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.720 align:middle line:-1
Please have some coffee

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.000 align:middle line:-1
I'll go and lock my car.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:41.400 align:middle line:-1
All right. Let's go.

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.680 align:middle line:-1
I don't want to get married.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.880 align:middle line:-1
Why not?

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.080 align:middle line:-2
When you wanted to study further,
I agreed with you.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:52.680 align:middle line:-2
And now that I want you to
get married, you must listen to me.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:56.400 align:middle line:-1
Come, son. Have some coffee.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.720 align:middle line:-1
I just don't agree!

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.200 align:middle line:-1
Why not?

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.280 align:middle line:-2
Look at her, son.
- Yes.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:01.960 align:middle line:-1
She's not listening to me.

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:09.000 align:middle line:-1
You must listen to dad, right?

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.560 align:middle line:-1
Do you know what he's saying?

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.080 align:middle line:-2
And this is between the two of us.
You aren't interfering.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:17.520 align:middle line:-2
You'll get a slap, Lali.
He's a guest...

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.600 align:middle line:-1
Is that how you talk to a guest?

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.280 align:middle line:-2
What wrong have I said, son?
- Yes.

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.160 align:middle line:-2
No. - I'm looking for a groom
for her, and she's refusing me.

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:35.080 align:middle line:-2
When a girl keeps refusing
to get married, what does it mean?

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:39.280 align:middle line:-2
It means there is
someone else she loves.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.520 align:middle line:-2
I'm not against that. All I want
is for you to have a nice wedding.

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:50.920 align:middle line:-2
But how should the suitor be?
He must be just like this boy.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.960 align:middle line:-2
A guy with a kind heart,
innocent eyes...

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.720 align:middle line:-1
A handsome young man.

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:03.600 align:middle line:-2
If there is someone you love,
tell me about him.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.520 align:middle line:-1
I'm not in love with anyone.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:12.080 align:middle line:-2
If you don't love anyone,
you must obey your dad.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:17.080 align:middle line:-1
Dad, I'm willing to get married.

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.840 align:middle line:-1
Wow!

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:21.920 align:middle line:-1
This is amazing!

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:25.000 align:middle line:-2
I've been trying for so long,
and she just wouldn't agree.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:28.400 align:middle line:-2
You spoke to her just once
and she agreed!

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:32.200 align:middle line:-2
Looks like we share some
strange connection, son.

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:36.000 align:middle line:-2
I had a problem with the cabbie,
and you solved it.

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:39.920 align:middle line:-2
And this problem of her marriage,
you have solved too.

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:44.800 align:middle line:-2
I'm happy to have achieved
what I set out to do.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.720 align:middle line:-2
Lali, I'm leaving
by this evening's train.

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.640 align:middle line:-1
Do look after yourself, okay.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:54.000 align:middle line:-1
Come on, drop me on the way.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000 align:middle line:-2
Lali, I forgot to tell
you something very important.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.960 align:middle line:-2
There's a girl he
knows who stays here.

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.040 align:middle line:-2
They have a fight
going between themselves.

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.800 align:middle line:-2
Never mind, uncle. Please...
- Now wait a moment!

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:18.040 align:middle line:-2
Uncle. - Won't I do anything for
all the help you've extended to me?

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.800 align:middle line:-1
What will people say?

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:23.520 align:middle line:-1
She's a very arrogant girl, Lali.

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:26.720 align:middle line:-2
As he said,
she's very stubborn too.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.200 align:middle line:-1
Not just stubborn, she's...

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:36.040 align:middle line:-2
a bit mental, echo...
What word did you use?

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.560 align:middle line:-2
Never mind, uncle. Forget it...
- Give me the word! What was it?

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:42.040 align:middle line:-1
Come on, speak up.

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.400 align:middle line:-1
Ego!

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:49.440 align:middle line:-2
Yes! Ego!
She is very egoistic and arrogant.

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:53.280 align:middle line:-2
Like spirits taking
possession of people's bodies,

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.240 align:middle line:-1
this girl is possessed with ego!

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.600 align:middle line:-2
Ask the girl not
to fight with him, dear.

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:06.520 align:middle line:-2
He's a very nice boy. Tell her
that even your dad agrees with you.

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.920 align:middle line:-2
Bring the two of
them together. Okay.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:15.200 align:middle line:-2
Will that be enough or do you want
me to stay over for your help, son?

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.880 align:middle line:-2
No, thank you, uncle.
You've done so much!

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.000 align:middle line:-1
That's all right. See you.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:26.200 align:middle line:-2
She's a fool to get into
a fight with a nice boy like you.

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:29.560 align:middle line:-2
It isn't her fault.
It must be her father,

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:33.640 align:middle line:-2
who has really pampered
the arrogant girl.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:40.360 align:middle line:-1
"What happened? And why?"

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000 align:middle line:-1
"Don't think about it."

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.360 align:middle line:-1
Think,

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:56.680 align:middle line:-2
how could that girl blow such
a small thing out of proportion?

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.720 align:middle line:-1
I can't get this.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:03.320 align:middle line:-2
This little part
of the female anatomy.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.640 align:middle line:-1
See this.

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:10.600 align:middle line:-2
Don't remind me, please!
- Everyone gets to look at it!

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.840 align:middle line:-1
What's wrong if you looked at it?

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.560 align:middle line:-1
In Mumbai, girls expose their legs!

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:20.000 align:middle line:-2
This is just what
I can't understand!

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.520 align:middle line:-1
Don't worry.

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.720 align:middle line:-1
Your friend Shibu,

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.520 align:middle line:-2
has come all the way from
Kolkata to solve your problem!

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.240 align:middle line:-2
Thank you.
- And I'll solve it too.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.440 align:middle line:-1
Thank you.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.280 align:middle line:-1
You see.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:36.840 align:middle line:-1
See.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.960 align:middle line:-2
Once you drink it,
your woes will vanish.

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.000 align:middle line:-2
Come on.
- No.

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.840 align:middle line:-2
Drink.
- I don't drink.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.240 align:middle line:-1
Drink it!

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:50.000 align:middle line:-2
Listen! Come!
- What is this?

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.920 align:middle line:-2
Shibu!
- Just a little!

01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.560 align:middle line:-1
Had fun?

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:07.200 align:middle line:-1
I'll sing a hit song for you.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:11.560 align:middle line:-2
You'll find happiness.
- Happiness?

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.200 align:middle line:-1
"I love..."

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.400 align:middle line:-1
"Bangladesh!"

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.760 align:middle line:-1
"I like it!"

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.120 align:middle line:-2
"My."
- Shut up!

01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:34.920 align:middle line:-1
You have made me sad!

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.200 align:middle line:-1
Have some more.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.720 align:middle line:-2
The more you drink,
the better you'll feel!

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:41.120 align:middle line:-2
Drink!
- Ok!

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.640 align:middle line:-2
You didn't approve of
my Bengali song, did you?

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.560 align:middle line:-1
I'll sing a song from Mumbai.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:54.840 align:middle line:-2
"If a person like you comes
into my life, it would be great!"

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:10.000 align:middle line:-1
"Heart and waist."

01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:13.360 align:middle line:-1
"Everyone wants a slender waist!"

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.640 align:middle line:-2
"If only your waist
could listen to your heart!"

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.160 align:middle line:-1
"The waist must agree."

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.880 align:middle line:-1
Fun, wasn't it?

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.080 align:middle line:-1
The song's over,

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.920 align:middle line:-1
so is the booze.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.040 align:middle line:-1
No problem.

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.040 align:middle line:-1
Friend,

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.280 align:middle line:-1
have a smoke.

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.240 align:middle line:-1
I'll just come back.

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.200 align:middle line:-1
I'll get lots of booze!

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.640 align:middle line:-2
Friend!
- Bye!

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.640 align:middle line:-1
'That's why I got this ashtray.'

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.440 align:middle line:-2
'When you drop
ash in this ashtray,'

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:05.720 align:middle line:-1
'you'll remember me'

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.520 align:middle line:-2
'You must know that it's
not the ashtray, but me.'

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:27.920 align:middle line:-1
What're you staring at?

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.080 align:middle line:-1
This way!

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:37.360 align:middle line:-1
Look here!

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.640 align:middle line:-1
What?

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:47.280 align:middle line:-2
What're you staring
at with your big...

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:55.000 align:middle line:-1
No, with your two small eyes.

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:56.960 align:middle line:-1
What are you looking at?

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:20.240 align:middle line:-2
All I did was to look
at this little waist.

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.920 align:middle line:-1
You think you're very beautiful?

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:28.720 align:middle line:-1
Your face is like a chameleon with,

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:31.960 align:middle line:-1
a pencil-thin nose!

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.680 align:middle line:-1
And your body?

01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:37.360 align:middle line:-1
Alright.

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:41.960 align:middle line:-2
Your waist is the only
thing one can look at.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.600 align:middle line:-1
This little waist.

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:51.720 align:middle line:-2
Draped in a black sari,
that little area,

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:55.000 align:middle line:-1
is like a red lemon.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:57.840 align:middle line:-1
No, lemons are yellow.

01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.760 align:middle line:-1
Ok!

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.880 align:middle line:-1
Mixed in red and yellow,

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:06.440 align:middle line:-2
if it's shown in a romantic light,
naturally, I'll look at it.

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:10.000 align:middle line:-2
If you mind,
then you must cover it!

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.000 align:middle line:-1
No!

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.080 align:middle line:-2
Just as your face
is a part of your body,

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:16.160 align:middle line:-1
so is your waist!

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.000 align:middle line:-2
If I look at your face,
you don't mind.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.080 align:middle line:-1
But the waist you do, why?

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:23.640 align:middle line:-1
Tell me, darling!

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:29.000 align:middle line:-2
Not just your face, I'm
going to look at your whole body!

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:38.000 align:middle line:-2
You've no right to
stand there before me!

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.680 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.520 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.240 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.400 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.960 align:middle line:-2
Come!
- Don't!

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.240 align:middle line:-1
Don't touch it!

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:38.120 align:middle line:-1
You've no right to touch it!

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.920 align:middle line:-2
I came here to discuss
something important!

01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:58.080 align:middle line:-2
But neither are you
in the mood to listen,

01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:59.880 align:middle line:-1
nor am I in the mood to tell you!

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:09.080 align:middle line:-1
Khushi.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.920 align:middle line:-1
I've done nothing!

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.640 align:middle line:-1
It's my Bengali friend!

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.040 align:middle line:-1
He forced me to drink!

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:20.400 align:middle line:-2
If people smoke and drink,
why must I care?

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:24.680 align:middle line:-2
It isn't necessary for me
to know why you had liquor!

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.760 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:29.280 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.760 align:middle line:-1
Shut up!

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.000 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:35.800 align:middle line:-2
"This crazy fellow
has brought liquor!"

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:38.720 align:middle line:-1
Good morning.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.880 align:middle line:-2
Want some? It's..
- Shut up!

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.080 align:middle line:-1
I thought you were a nice man,

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:51.680 align:middle line:-1
so I came over.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.840 align:middle line:-2
But you're worse than
I could ever imagine!

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.160 align:middle line:-1
Bye!

01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.720 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:01.320 align:middle line:-1
Listen to me.

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.600 align:middle line:-1
"You're a performer!"

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.560 align:middle line:-1
"You can't get them to dance!"

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.040 align:middle line:-1
"You're a performer!"

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.040 align:middle line:-1
"You can't get them to dance!"

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:59.680 align:middle line:-2
"When it's your turn,
you'll run away!"

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:01.320 align:middle line:-1
Wow! You're amazing!

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.280 align:middle line:-2
Thanks.
- Amazing!

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.000 align:middle line:-2
Master, that's Altaf Raja's tune.
- What?

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.200 align:middle line:-1
A foreigner?

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.680 align:middle line:-1
He's a famous singer.

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:12.520 align:middle line:-2
This is a tune from
his famous album.

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:14.120 align:middle line:-1
How is that possible?

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.840 align:middle line:-2
It is.
- How?

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:19.560 align:middle line:-2
He must've heard the
tune from you and copied it.

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.160 align:middle line:-1
But this is a three-year old tune.

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:24.120 align:middle line:-1
What a thief!

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:29.680 align:middle line:-2
I composed the tune three days ago,
and he stole it three years back!

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.840 align:middle line:-1
No more poetry from today!

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.160 align:middle line:-2
Poonam, what's happening with us?
It's very bad.

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:39.000 align:middle line:-2
Hi, Pinky.
- Hi, master.

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:40.960 align:middle line:-2
How are you?
- I'm fine.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.120 align:middle line:-2
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.680 align:middle line:-2
Master.
- Yes?

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.000 align:middle line:-2
How could you tell
that that was Pinky?

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.000 align:middle line:-1
Her perfume gave her away.

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:52.720 align:middle line:-2
I remember every pretty
lady by her perfume.

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:54.840 align:middle line:-1
Somebody stinks!

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:55.960 align:middle line:-1
Get lost.

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:00.920 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.360 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:03.680 align:middle line:-2
Poonam,
you like my hair, don't you?

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:05.080 align:middle line:-2
Yes.
- Here.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.440 align:middle line:-1
Come on, Khushi. How are you?

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.600 align:middle line:-1
Hi, master.

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:14.560 align:middle line:-1
What a maintained size!

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:18.320 align:middle line:-2
Remember, the cultural programme
at the college is fast approaching?

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.680 align:middle line:-1
What about the practise?

01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:22.880 align:middle line:-2
Join Karan immediately
and start your rehearsals.

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:24.960 align:middle line:-2
Composition, movements... Why?
- No, Master.

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.160 align:middle line:-2
I can't participate
in this function.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.920 align:middle line:-1
Why not?

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.280 align:middle line:-2
I've told you.
I'm not participating.

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:35.800 align:middle line:-2
Okay. Bad luck for you.
Better luck next time.

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.960 align:middle line:-2
Mukesh!
- Yes, master.

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.000 align:middle line:-2
Mukesh, make a team of Karan and
Roma and send them on the stage.

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:45.760 align:middle line:-2
You have my blessings!
- Okay, master.

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:47.720 align:middle line:-1
I don't want to waste my time.

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:49.080 align:middle line:-1
Master.

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.960 align:middle line:-1
What again?

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:53.280 align:middle line:-1
Who's Roma?

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.160 align:middle line:-1
You don't know Roma! Roma!

01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:58.520 align:middle line:-1
A new student in the first year!

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.240 align:middle line:-2
She's kicked up a
storm in the college.

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:02.520 align:middle line:-2
The students are
crazy about her and

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.720 align:middle line:-2
go around her like blind men.
- What for?

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:29.080 align:middle line:-2
Excuse me!
- Yes.

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.560 align:middle line:-1
Could you help me cross the road?

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:33.120 align:middle line:-1
Sure.

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:44.920 align:middle line:-2
You've crossed the road.
- Small road.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.240 align:middle line:-2
What?
- You've helped a blind man.

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:51.240 align:middle line:-2
Thank you so much.
You are large-hearted.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.280 align:middle line:-2
It's okay.
- Okay.

01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:56.560 align:middle line:-1
Darn! I missed it.

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:04.120 align:middle line:-1
Karan.

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:09.240 align:middle line:-1
What is the matter?

01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:10.360 align:middle line:-1
Priya has sent a letter.

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.280 align:middle line:-1
You can give it to Vicky.

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:13.360 align:middle line:-1
It's not for him.

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:14.720 align:middle line:-2
Is it for me?
- No.

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:16.240 align:middle line:-2
It must be for you then.
- Not.

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.920 align:middle line:-2
If not for me, you nor Vicky...
- It's for the two of us!

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.200 align:middle line:-1
To Karan and Khushi.

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:31.440 align:middle line:-1
You read it.

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:39.200 align:middle line:-1
Dear Karan and Khushi.

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.280 align:middle line:-1
I love Vicky so dearly,

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:46.240 align:middle line:-2
I don't think anyone in
the world loves anyone as much.

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:51.840 align:middle line:-2
You must think why every
lover in the world says that.

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:54.960 align:middle line:-2
It's because they have
true love for each other.

01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:59.400 align:middle line:-2
And the suffering of separation
those truly in love go through,

01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:01.360 align:middle line:-1
only I know about.

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:07.080 align:middle line:-2
I'm pining to meet Vicky.
Please bring us together.

01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.800 align:middle line:-1
Yours, Priya.

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:12.680 align:middle line:-1
What are we to do now?

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.360 align:middle line:-2
Priya has a friend
called Shehnaz, right?

01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:20.040 align:middle line:-1
Isn't this pretty?

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:21.120 align:middle line:-1
Did you like it?

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.080 align:middle line:-1
Hello, uncle.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:26.000 align:middle line:-2
How are you, Rukhsana?
- I am Fine!

01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:28.000 align:middle line:-1
Be careful, Vicky.

01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:29.880 align:middle line:-2
Be careful.
I'll take care. Don't worry.

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:34.440 align:middle line:-2
The two of you chat,
I'm going to bed.

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.360 align:middle line:-2
Priya!
- Yes.

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.080 align:middle line:-1
Who's this girl?

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.120 align:middle line:-1
It's Shabana. Shehnaz's friend.

01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:00.880 align:middle line:-2
Is she coming here
for the first time?

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:02.960 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.320 align:middle line:-2
I see. Go ahead and
chat with Rukhsana,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.240 align:middle line:-1
I'll take Shabana around the house.

01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:13.200 align:middle line:-2
Come on, Shabana.
- Run away, Vicky!

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.080 align:middle line:-1
Wait!

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.440 align:middle line:-1
Get in, Vicky!

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:25.800 align:middle line:-1
Let's go.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.320 align:middle line:-1
MH-01-B-906.

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:43.200 align:middle line:-1
Car number 906. Is it yours?

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.880 align:middle line:-2
Yes.
- Karan?

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:47.120 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:48.600 align:middle line:-1
Karan.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.200 align:middle line:-1
Karan!

01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:14.640 align:middle line:-1
Karan!

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.320 align:middle line:-1
Khushi!

01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.320 align:middle line:-1
Khushi.

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:26.440 align:middle line:-1
Let me do it.

01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:18.560 align:middle line:-1
Good morning.

01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.600 align:middle line:-2
Hey man, who are you?
- Me?

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:22.520 align:middle line:-1
How are you related to the girl?

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:23.880 align:middle line:-1
I...

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:27.240 align:middle line:-2
Whoever you are,
help me with the injection.

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:28.440 align:middle line:-1
All right.

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:30.800 align:middle line:-1
Injection?

01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:42.680 align:middle line:-1
In the waist.

01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:43.640 align:middle line:-1
Alright.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.360 align:middle line:-2
No!
- What?

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.680 align:middle line:-1
Give it to her in the arm.

01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:50.000 align:middle line:-1
This is meant for the waist.

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:51.520 align:middle line:-1
No, give it to her in the arm.

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.720 align:middle line:-2
The one for the arm
is given on the arm,

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.840 align:middle line:-2
the one for the waist
is given on the waist.

01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:58.320 align:middle line:-1
Doctor!

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:02.000 align:middle line:-2
You don't know anything
about this waist, doctor.

01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:06.840 align:middle line:-2
Doctor, this waist has caused
a big problem already.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.840 align:middle line:-2
If I go into details,
it'll take at least 2 hours.

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.680 align:middle line:-2
Your duty hours will be over
and when the next doctor come sin,

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:17.520 align:middle line:-2
I'll have to explain to him!
Have mercy on me,

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:20.240 align:middle line:-1
and give it to her in the arm.

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:21.600 align:middle line:-1
Nurse, send him out.

01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:24.680 align:middle line:-1
That's all right!

01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:29.080 align:middle line:-2
I mean, you can give
it wherever you wish.

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:33.080 align:middle line:-2
Give it to anyone.
To her, the nurse or yourself,

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:35.640 align:middle line:-2
I've seen nothing.
I will see nothing!

01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:41.080 align:middle line:-2
God, why did You
make this waist? Why?

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:09.880 align:middle line:-1
"I've given you..."

01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:14.680 align:middle line:-1
"My heart"

01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:24.240 align:middle line:-1
"My love, what have you done?"

01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:29.000 align:middle line:-1
"When I saw you,"

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:33.640 align:middle line:-2
"I realised that I'm
crazy about you."

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:38.520 align:middle line:-1
"It's something my heart knows."

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:43.440 align:middle line:-2
"You're the one I've
taken to be my beloved."

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:57.000 align:middle line:-1
"I've given you my heart."

01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:02.960 align:middle line:-1
"My love..."

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:06.440 align:middle line:-1
"What have you done?"

01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:56.000 align:middle line:-2
"On your lips is a smile.
Your eyes hold intoxication."

01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:00.160 align:middle line:-2
"The sight of you
makes my heart sway."

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:02.960 align:middle line:-1
"I love you all day and night."

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.880 align:middle line:-2
"I find peace only
after meeting you."

01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:14.240 align:middle line:-2
"Your dark tresses lend
a fragrance to my being."

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:17.160 align:middle line:-1
"All I wish to say is that"

01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:19.640 align:middle line:-1
"it's your arms I must stay in."

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:24.240 align:middle line:-1
"Don't ever forget this promise."

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:29.000 align:middle line:-2
"Don't make me cry,
now that you've made me smile."

01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:33.720 align:middle line:-1
"Don't make excuses."

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:38.280 align:middle line:-1
"Don't ever hide anything from me."

01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:52.360 align:middle line:-1
"I've given you my heart."

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:48.000 align:middle line:-2
"My dream, my desire, is to adorn
your arms with bridal bangles."

02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:53.800 align:middle line:-2
"These lovely meetings,
I love your talk."

02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:56.040 align:middle line:-1
"If you agree,

02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:02.760 align:middle line:-2
"I'd bring the bridal
palanquin to your house."

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:08.000 align:middle line:-2
"I spend my nights pining.
I dream of marriage."

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:12.760 align:middle line:-2
"You must embellish
my world of love."

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:16.920 align:middle line:-1
"Never leave me."

02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:21.920 align:middle line:-1
"Keep your promises."

02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:26.440 align:middle line:-1
"Hold me in your arms."

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:41.040 align:middle line:-1
"I've given you my heart."

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:46.280 align:middle line:-1
"My love..."

02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:49.960 align:middle line:-1
"What have you done?"

02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:04.920 align:middle line:-1
What is it? What?

02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:07.800 align:middle line:-2
I tried several times
to meet you at your office,

02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:10.560 align:middle line:-2
but you staff
wouldn't let me. So...

02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:13.600 align:middle line:-1
My name is Karan.

02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:18.800 align:middle line:-2
Vicky's my friend, sir.
He has no past to tell you about.

02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:22.360 align:middle line:-2
At present, he's a student
but he has a very bright future.

02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.320 align:middle line:-1
You don't know that, but I do.

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:27.840 align:middle line:-2
At my age, my father was
even worse off than Vicky is.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.200 align:middle line:-2
At this age, even you...
Please don't feel bad.

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.200 align:middle line:-1
You used to be a small-time thug.

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:37.200 align:middle line:-1
But I tell you, at your age,

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:41.880 align:middle line:-2
Vicky will be far ahead of you,
even my father and me.

02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:46.360 align:middle line:-2
Apart from all this,
he has a very kind heart.

02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:51.360 align:middle line:-2
When a boy falls
in love with a girl,

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:55.880 align:middle line:-2
and he finds the girl
without any problem,

02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:59.600 align:middle line:-1
imagine how happy it'll make him.

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:02.960 align:middle line:-1
Please don't separate them.

02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:04.680 align:middle line:-1
Please unite them.

02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:06.000 align:middle line:-1
Please.

02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:16.160 align:middle line:-2
Your two minutes are up.
Let's go, Goty.

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.320 align:middle line:-1
Did he have nothing to say?

02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:25.200 align:middle line:-2
Your two minutes are up, he said.
And left.

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:26.600 align:middle line:-1
Oh!

02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:31.240 align:middle line:-1
All right. Even if he said nothing,

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.160 align:middle line:-2
couldn't you guess
what was on his mind?

02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:36.200 align:middle line:-1
What?

02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:41.600 align:middle line:-2
Couldn't you guess
what was on his mind?

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.920 align:middle line:-2
If one knew what's
on everyone's mind,

02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.240 align:middle line:-2
there wouldn't be
any problem at all.

02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:49.960 align:middle line:-2
We have these problems
because we don't know.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.080 align:middle line:-1
What do you mean by these problems?

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:52.960 align:middle line:-1
These problems. Period.

02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:59.160 align:middle line:-1
All right. I must leave now.

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:00.840 align:middle line:-1
Bye.

02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.520 align:middle line:-1
Khushi.

02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:14.280 align:middle line:-1
Did you call?

02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:17.720 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:18.960 align:middle line:-1
What for?

02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:22.200 align:middle line:-1
To talk.

02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:24.240 align:middle line:-1
That's what we've been doing.

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.080 align:middle line:-2
No, there's something
else I want to talk about.

02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:34.880 align:middle line:-1
What is it about?

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.440 align:middle line:-2
She knows why!
Must she ask what it's about?

02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:45.640 align:middle line:-1
The arrogant one!

02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:48.240 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:53.120 align:middle line:-1
It's about what you are thinking.

02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:58.960 align:middle line:-2
I'm thinking about nothing.
You wanted to talk to me.

02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:00.280 align:middle line:-1
So tell me what you want to.

02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.960 align:middle line:-2
Bye.
- What?

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:16.560 align:middle line:-1
Bye.

02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:21.320 align:middle line:-1
Is that what you called me to say?

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:22.960 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:29.040 align:middle line:-1
Okay, bye.

02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:29.080 align:middle line:-2
Karan, I need you.
- What?

02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:31.400 align:middle line:-2
I love you.
- What?

02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:32.720 align:middle line:-1
You know...

02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:36.040 align:middle line:-1
Your intoxicating eyes,

02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:41.360 align:middle line:-1
your lips.

02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:46.080 align:middle line:-1
Oh!

02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:49.440 align:middle line:-1
There's a huge list I have of you.

02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:55.840 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:00.920 align:middle line:-1
Roma, can you fall in love with me?

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:01.880 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:05.680 align:middle line:-2
Can you really like me?
- Yes.

02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:08.360 align:middle line:-1
But...

02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:15.640 align:middle line:-2
However the possibility
of me falling in love with you,

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:20.080 align:middle line:-1
does exist.

02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:23.080 align:middle line:-1
Thanks.

02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:29.680 align:middle line:-2
Yes.
- Yes.

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:35.640 align:middle line:-2
I don't know you so well, you see.
Let's see each other for a few days

02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:39.320 align:middle line:-2
and then I'll decide about it.
It'll take a bit of time, okay?

02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:41.920 align:middle line:-2
Okay.
- Take all the time you need.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.360 align:middle line:-1
All my time is now yours.

02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.880 align:middle line:-1
Thanks.

02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:48.800 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:50.000 align:middle line:-2
You know, Roma.
- What?

02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:53.720 align:middle line:-1
I also feel strongly about you.

02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:57.440 align:middle line:-2
Your lovely tresses.
- Really?

02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:00.440 align:middle line:-2
Your rose-like lips.
- Really?

02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:03.880 align:middle line:-1
Ouch! Relax!

02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:08.840 align:middle line:-1
And this lovely neck and...

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:11.520 align:middle line:-1
And your...

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:12.600 align:middle line:-1
Karan!

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.520 align:middle line:-1
Oh, Khushi!

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:24.280 align:middle line:-2
I'm not calling you because
you have a girl in your arms.

02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:25.400 align:middle line:-1
What?

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:27.960 align:middle line:-1
Neither have I called you

02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:30.360 align:middle line:-2
because you're drawing
pictures on her body.

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.320 align:middle line:-2
I haven't called
out to disturb you.

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:39.400 align:middle line:-2
We've got to be at Priya's
place at 7:30. You remember that?

02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:42.960 align:middle line:-2
Karan, who's she?
- Yes.

02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:45.600 align:middle line:-2
Is she a friend of yours?
- A friend?

02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:48.040 align:middle line:-1
Oh no, no chance at all.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:50.280 align:middle line:-1
Is she a lover then?

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.600 align:middle line:-1
Lover? How disgusting!

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:57.800 align:middle line:-2
To be my lover,
a girl needs extra qualities.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.120 align:middle line:-1
Extra!

02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:00.840 align:middle line:-1
So who's she?

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:03.320 align:middle line:-1
Relax!

02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:10.400 align:middle line:-2
She's Khushi. There's
nothing else I know about her.

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:15.640 align:middle line:-2
Karan, just 15 minutes
to go for 7:30. May we leave now?

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.760 align:middle line:-1
Okay. Bye, Roma.

02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:21.000 align:middle line:-2
Karan.
- Roma!

02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:23.000 align:middle line:-1
When will you meet me again?

02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:24.600 align:middle line:-2
Again?
- Yes.

02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:26.560 align:middle line:-2
Again?
- Yes.

02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:29.760 align:middle line:-2
Sunday.
- At lunch?

02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:33.280 align:middle line:-2
Not lunch. At dinner.
- Really?

02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:37.360 align:middle line:-1
At night. Candle-light.

02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:40.440 align:middle line:-1
Sunday 10, at my place.

02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:43.760 align:middle line:-2
Sure.
- Yes.

02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:46.640 align:middle line:-1
Great! Bye, Roma.

02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:47.840 align:middle line:-1
Bye, Karan.

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:49.680 align:middle line:-2
Roma!
- Karan!

02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:51.600 align:middle line:-1
Bye.

02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:52.800 align:middle line:-1
Bye.

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:54.280 align:middle line:-1
Shall we?

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.840 align:middle line:-1
'Queen Mary's Women's Hostel'

02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:06.080 align:middle line:-1
'March 31'

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:09.280 align:middle line:-1
'Today's Sunday. So what?'

02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:48.680 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:51.800 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:59.640 align:middle line:-1
"Something happens in my bracelet."

02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:05.000 align:middle line:-2
"There is such a pleasure
in this bond."

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:10.720 align:middle line:-1
"My body is on fire."

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.720 align:middle line:-1
"Something happens in my bracelet."

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:16.000 align:middle line:-2
"There is such a
pleasure in this bond."

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:20.400 align:middle line:-2
"My body is on fire.
Take me in your embrace."

02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:24.960 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.760 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:31.880 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:41.400 align:middle line:-2
"My bindi flashes red.
Cast your eyes on them."

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:46.200 align:middle line:-2
"My bangles clatter
and my gait alters."

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.040 align:middle line:-2
"The scarf slipping from
my head said this to you."

02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:55.040 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:57.840 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:51.400 align:middle line:-2
"I've applied black kohl
in my eyes."

02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:56.600 align:middle line:-2
"Why don t you drown in them?
How foolish you are!"

02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:01.320 align:middle line:-2
"My heart is whispering in
every pores of my body."

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:05.080 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:10.120 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:13.280 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:18.000 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.120 align:middle line:-1
"Come to me, my love."

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:39.960 align:middle line:-2
Karan! Please, Karan!
- Roma, relax!

02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:43.840 align:middle line:-2
No! Roma!
- Karan! Please, Karan!

02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:48.320 align:middle line:-2
Karan! Karan!
- Relax, Roma!

02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:50.680 align:middle line:-1
It was you who said it.

02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:53.960 align:middle line:-2
Karan! Karan!
- Yes, I did, but.

02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:59.840 align:middle line:-1
Karan! Please!

02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:04.000 align:middle line:-2
No!
- Ouch!

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:21.640 align:middle line:-1
Hello! Hello!

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.120 align:middle line:-1
Who is that?

02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:32.760 align:middle line:-2
Hello?
- Karan!

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.160 align:middle line:-2
No!
- Karan!

02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.440 align:middle line:-1
Karan!

02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:42.160 align:middle line:-2
Karan!
- Roma!

02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:44.440 align:middle line:-1
Don't bite me.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.240 align:middle line:-1
Karan..!

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:51.800 align:middle line:-2
Roma..!
- Karan..!

02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:54.280 align:middle line:-2
Roma..!
- Karan..!

02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:05.960 align:middle line:-2
Whoever you are with,
why must I care?

02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:19.400 align:middle line:-1
Karan.

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:20.800 align:middle line:-1
What?

02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:23.440 align:middle line:-1
Sorry, I'm late.

02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:25.400 align:middle line:-1
It's okay.

02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:33.320 align:middle line:-1
What happened?

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:37.440 align:middle line:-1
Last night... Nothing.

02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:42.520 align:middle line:-1
What did Priya have to say?

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:45.200 align:middle line:-1
She says forget it.

02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:47.880 align:middle line:-2
Forget what?
- Love.

02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:49.280 align:middle line:-1
Whose love?

02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:51.720 align:middle line:-1
The love Vicky had for Priya.

02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:53.520 align:middle line:-1
Priya asks to forget it.

02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:55.360 align:middle line:-1
Oh!

02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:58.720 align:middle line:-1
And what did you tell her?

02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:01.040 align:middle line:-2
When she isn't interested,
what can I do?

02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:02.120 align:middle line:-1
What?

02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:03.840 align:middle line:-1
What is it with girls?

02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:06.760 align:middle line:-2
Flirt when you want to,
dump the guy when you wish.

02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:11.840 align:middle line:-2
Have you girls ever considered
what it does to us guys?

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.440 align:middle line:-2
You're acting like
a very decent guy!

02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:15.840 align:middle line:-2
Do you think I don't
know the truth about you?

02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:18.800 align:middle line:-2
Were you breathing heavily
last night, or weren't you?

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:21.240 align:middle line:-1
What?

02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:23.680 align:middle line:-2
Were you breathing last night,
or weren't you?

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.240 align:middle line:-1
Breathing?

02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:29.960 align:middle line:-2
I was breathing last night
and the night before that too.

02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:33.040 align:middle line:-2
And I breathe every
day and well at that.

02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:35.840 align:middle line:-2
It's good for the health.
Is it bad to breathe?

02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:39.280 align:middle line:-2
Maybe it's bad to look at
this but why's it bad to breathe?

02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:41.600 align:middle line:-2
How will man live
if he doesn't breathe?

02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:44.840 align:middle line:-2
Am I the only one who breathes?
Everyone does. Every single day.

02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:46.880 align:middle line:-1
Your parents do, so do mine.

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:52.160 align:middle line:-2
Because they breathe you are here,
I am here so is the dog.

02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:56.320 align:middle line:-2
He breathes every day.
Nicely at that. Right, puppy?

02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:59.720 align:middle line:-2
See? If you call that bad,
what can I do?

02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:01.760 align:middle line:-2
The breathing I spoke
about is different from

02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:03.040 align:middle line:-1
the one you allude to.

02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:06.920 align:middle line:-2
It's all the same. If breathing
is wrong, everything is wrong.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.400 align:middle line:-1
I'll leave if you talk like this.

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:09.760 align:middle line:-1
No, we have to talk.

02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:12.880 align:middle line:-2
About what?
- About love and pain.

02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:16.280 align:middle line:-2
I know the suffering
of one truly in love.

02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:20.000 align:middle line:-2
Priya's words, weren't they? So
how can she ask him to forget it?

02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:22.800 align:middle line:-1
What does it mean? We have to talk.

02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:37.240 align:middle line:-2
Today's the last day at college.
It's time to separate.

02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:40.000 align:middle line:-2
So come forth and
take my blessings.

02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:41.960 align:middle line:-2
Bye.
- It's my lucky day.

02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:43.680 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:48.280 align:middle line:-1
Next!

02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:52.960 align:middle line:-1
Get out!

02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:55.440 align:middle line:-1
Hi!

02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:57.400 align:middle line:-2
Did you just come back
from a crowded train?

02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:01.360 align:middle line:-1
Roma!

02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:05.120 align:middle line:-2
So many of them have
gone into coma for you,

02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:10.240 align:middle line:-2
I'm in a coma too. Embrace me
and revive me from the coma, Roma.

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:15.920 align:middle line:-1
She is coming here.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.600 align:middle line:-1
Priya's wedding has been fixed.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:21.920 align:middle line:-1
Invitation card.

02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:30.600 align:middle line:-1
What are we to do?

02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:38.760 align:middle line:-1
Greetings.

02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:40.840 align:middle line:-1
Hello! Hello!

02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:43.920 align:middle line:-1
Mr Zorawar Singh, over here.

02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:46.600 align:middle line:-1
Hi.

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:48.720 align:middle line:-1
Do you remember me? I'm Karan.

02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:51.240 align:middle line:-2
Where are you going?
To bring your daughter?

02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:54.160 align:middle line:-1
She's with us right now.

02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:58.800 align:middle line:-1
She's marrying the man she loves.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:00.920 align:middle line:-1
Come on.

02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:22.400 align:middle line:-1
Congratulations.

02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:30.600 align:middle line:-2
From the look of it, it appears as
if you want to give me a thrashing.

02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:36.680 align:middle line:-1
Don't even think of it. Pray to God

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:40.200 align:middle line:-2
that I am not harmed.
If something happens to me,

02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:43.720 align:middle line:-2
you'll be the guilty
one in the eyes of the law.

02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:46.720 align:middle line:-1
I've made arrangements, you know.

02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:52.120 align:middle line:-2
You're picking up
something to throw at me.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.640 align:middle line:-2
Forget me.
You can't even touch my image.

02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:10.040 align:middle line:-2
Spend a month in Mahabaleshwar
before you return to Calcutta.

02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:14.000 align:middle line:-2
Dad has found a job
for you over there. Okay?

02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:17.040 align:middle line:-2
Spend your lives together.
Be happy.

02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.800 align:middle line:-1
Bye, Khushi.

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:22.920 align:middle line:-2
Take care, Priya.
- Thank you very much.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:23.960 align:middle line:-1
All the best.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:24.920 align:middle line:-2
Thanks, Karan.
- Bye Khushi.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:26.320 align:middle line:-2
Bye, Priya.
- Bye.

02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:44.440 align:middle line:-2
There are problems between
you and Khushi, right?

02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:52.920 align:middle line:-1
You know why man faces problems!

02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:55.440 align:middle line:-1
Because he hides his feelings.

02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:59.240 align:middle line:-2
If you speak your heart,
you face no problems.

02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:01.600 align:middle line:-2
But I don't know why
man doesn't understand that.

02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:04.840 align:middle line:-2
He loves someone,
but he pretends to hate her.

02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:07.880 align:middle line:-2
He hates someone, and he pretends
to love her. What is it for?

02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:15.000 align:middle line:-2
Poor heart. Why do we burden
it with a thousand worries

02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:18.120 align:middle line:-1
and make life unbearable for it?

02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:20.960 align:middle line:-2
If you love her, then tell her
that. And if you don't,

02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:23.120 align:middle line:-2
you should tell her that too.
That's all.

02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:29.000 align:middle line:-2
God has given you eyes to see,
ears to listen,

02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:33.000 align:middle line:-1
and a heart to love.

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:38.680 align:middle line:-2
So forget about
egos and fall in love.

02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:40.200 align:middle line:-1
Love each other.

02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:45.680 align:middle line:-1
I've told you how I feel.

02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:48.080 align:middle line:-2
Bye and take care.
- Bye.

02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:02.240 align:middle line:-1
So...

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:04.160 align:middle line:-1
So?

02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:07.040 align:middle line:-1
So, thanks.

02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:08.120 align:middle line:-1
What?

02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:12.960 align:middle line:-2
You've been a great help in
uniting my friend with his beloved.

02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:15.640 align:middle line:-1
So, thanks.

02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:22.120 align:middle line:-1
Thanks to you too.

02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:27.080 align:middle line:-2
In uniting my friend
with her beloved,

02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:31.160 align:middle line:-1
you've been a great help.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:34.600 align:middle line:-1
Thank you.

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:41.560 align:middle line:-1
Thanks!

02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:43.920 align:middle line:-1
Thanks!

02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:46.040 align:middle line:-1
Thanks!

02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:47.600 align:middle line:-1
Thanks!

02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:49.600 align:middle line:-2
Thanks!
- Thanks!

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:20.520 align:middle line:-2
Hello, Karan.
- This is Seema here.

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:25.760 align:middle line:-2
I'm leaving today.
- Okay.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.760 align:middle line:-2
I'm leaving, and you're
just saying okay.

02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:30.800 align:middle line:-2
I am in the middle
of something, Seema.

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:33.080 align:middle line:-2
I'm sorry. Bye.
- Bye.

02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:54.560 align:middle line:-2
Sir, the taxi has arrived.
- What?

02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:15.280 align:middle line:-2
Watchman.
- Yes.

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:18.880 align:middle line:-2
Karan? He left?
- He has left for VT Station.

02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:21.200 align:middle line:-2
Which train is it?
- Howrah Mail at 7:15.

02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:27.240 align:middle line:-2
Ruhi!
- Hi, Karan!

02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:28.840 align:middle line:-2
Is Khushi there?
- She has left.

02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:31.600 align:middle line:-2
Where to?
- Bombay Central.

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:35.000 align:middle line:-2
Which train?
- Golden Temple Express at 7:10.

02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:36.280 align:middle line:-1
Bye.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.040 align:middle line:-1
Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.440 align:middle line:-1
Karan?

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000 align:middle line:-2
Karan?
- No one has arrived yet.

02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:46.520 align:middle line:-1
Yes.

02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:53.640 align:middle line:-2
Was there a girl
called Khushi here?

02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:55.080 align:middle line:-1
There's no one.

02:27:58.640 --> 02:27:59.920 align:middle line:-1
Thank you.

02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:30.600 align:middle line:-2
Maybe he has gone to
Mumbai Central to meet me.

02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:33.600 align:middle line:-2
Maybe she has gone
to VT Station to meet me.

02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:34.880 align:middle line:-1
And what if he hasn't?

02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:36.600 align:middle line:-1
Now?

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:42.440 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:44.000 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:51.560 align:middle line:-2
A girl called Khushi will come
here. Please give her this letter.

02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:52.600 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:57.560 align:middle line:-2
A boy called Karan will come here.
Please give him this.

02:28:57.640 --> 02:28:58.440 align:middle line:-1
Okay.

02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:39.320 align:middle line:-1
Karan?

02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:40.600 align:middle line:-1
Yes?

02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:45.240 align:middle line:-1
'Dear, Karan.'

02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:47.840 align:middle line:-2
'I wanted to tell you something
for a very long time.'

02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:52.760 align:middle line:-2
'You know what?
I love you, Khushi.'

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.120 align:middle line:-2
'When we were together,
this is what I wanted to say,'

02:30:57.360 --> 02:31:01.040 align:middle line:-2
'but I never could,
I don't know why.'

02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:04.600 align:middle line:-2
'And now that I want to speak,
you are not with me.'

02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:07.600 align:middle line:-2
'We said so much to each
other when we fought,'

02:31:07.720 --> 02:31:11.280 align:middle line:-2
'but we couldn't say one
single word to get together.

02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:14.880 align:middle line:-1
I'm sorry, Khushi.'

02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:18.800 align:middle line:-2
'When I left your hand
after the last handshake,'

02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:21.400 align:middle line:-2
'I felt something strange
stir in my heart.'

02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:26.000 align:middle line:-2
'I don't know what it was.
But I need you, Karan.'

02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:32.280 align:middle line:-2
'I now realise that the fights
we had were all part of our love.'

02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:35.600 align:middle line:-1
'I need you, Khushi.'

02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:40.120 align:middle line:-1
'To love me, to fight with me.'

02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:50.520 align:middle line:-2
You're a lucky girl
to have a father like yours.

02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:52.440 align:middle line:-2
Ever since you agreed
to the wedding,

02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:54.400 align:middle line:-2
all he has done is
to look out for suitors.

02:31:54.520 --> 02:31:58.640 align:middle line:-2
He decided to have you married
the day you returned from the city.

02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:01.880 align:middle line:-2
Everything is ready.
The bridegroom, the garland

02:32:01.960 --> 02:32:05.120 align:middle line:-1
step forward and be garlanded.

02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:18.160 align:middle line:-1
Lali! My dear!

02:32:18.440 --> 02:32:21.080 align:middle line:-1
You're back! Welcome home!

02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:23.880 align:middle line:-2
Go and get ready quickly.
- But dad...

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:28.320 align:middle line:-2
Just don't worry, my little girl.
The boy I've chosen this time,

02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:31.320 align:middle line:-2
is neither running away
nor leaving behind letters,

02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:34.240 align:middle line:-2
and he's not in love
with another girl either.

02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:36.680 align:middle line:-2
Dad!
- Why are you chanting dad?

02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:38.280 align:middle line:-2
Go and get dressed quickly.
- Hurry up and get ready.

02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:40.960 align:middle line:-2
Just a minute.
- Dad!

02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:54.280 align:middle line:-2
Lali, take a look
at your bridegroom.

02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:57.920 align:middle line:-1
Take a look at him.

02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:18.000 align:middle line:-2
You left this note
for him in the train

02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:20.440 align:middle line:-2
and he turned out
to be faster than you.

02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:25.320 align:middle line:-2
He halted the train and
took a flight to get here.

02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:27.080 align:middle line:-1
He has told me everything.

02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:30.800 align:middle line:-2
Karan's parents will also
be coming here for the wedding.

02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:32.200 align:middle line:-1
Are you happy now?

02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:34.160 align:middle line:-1
Thank you, dad.

02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:48.080 align:middle line:-2
'This is how two hearts
met and accepted each other.'

02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:53.280 align:middle line:-2
'They're celebrating
their ninth anniversary'

02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:57.120 align:middle line:-2
'and they're still fighting.
What is surprising is that'

02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:01.880 align:middle line:-2
'they don't have one or two kids,
they have 17 children in 8 years.'

02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:05.840 align:middle line:-2
'Twins every year. But
how does it still add up to 17?'

02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:10.080 align:middle line:-2
'Confusing, isn't it?
They didn't fight for a year,'

02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:11.640 align:middle line:-1
'and they had triplets.'

02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:19.280 align:middle line:-2
'Khushi's expecting again.
Twins or triplets, I don't know. '

02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:24.640 align:middle line:-2
'I'm just looking
on and praying for them.'

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.280 align:middle line:-2
'May Karan keep giving Khushi
this happiness all her life. '
