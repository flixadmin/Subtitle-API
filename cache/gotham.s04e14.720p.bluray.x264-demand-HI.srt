GORDON: <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,665
- The Doc? You know him?
- I know the Doc.

3
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,794
LEE: <i>Sometimes we search
for things we don't wish to find.</i>

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,216
I enjoy being the queen of Gotham.

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,543
Glad we understand each other.

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,799
There are other ways
for me to hurt you.

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,714
HARVEY: Something's eating at you, Jim.

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,924
And you're not gonna feel clean
till you get it off your chest.

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,680
That's done now.

10
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,604
I'm at Sofia Falcone's.
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,731
<i>I see Arkham's treating you well.</i>

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,228
Goodbye, Oswald.

00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,149
PENGUIN: <i>"I am held captive.
All my brilliance locked away."</i>

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,605
<i>- You're still there.</i>
- (LAUGHING)

15
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,109
<i>And you're gonna help me
find a way out of here.</i>

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,190
I need a name.

17
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,365
- Ivy Pepper.
- I know Ivy.

18
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,240
SELINA: <i>No, Gordon, she's changed.
Like a lot.</i>

Called Lazarus Water.

LUCIUS: <i>What are you going
to do with it?</i>

21
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,203
IVY: <i>I'm going to make miracles happen.</i>

22
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,003
You'll reel it in a little,
or should I call your keeper?

23
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,879
- Alfred? He won't answer.
- SELINA: <i>Why?</i>

24
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,047
BRUCE: <i>'Cause I fired him.</i>

25
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,189
Where's the other guy who works here?

26
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,398
You mean, Harvey?

27
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,022
He's out sick.
You wanna leave a message?

28
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,195

29

(SMACKING)

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,322
- I do.
- (BURPS)

31
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,653
All right.

32
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,037
What should I say?

33
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:04,785
Nothing.

34
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,408
Because all of you,

35
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,087
with your blood and your flesh,

36
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,665
and what you will become...

37
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,463
You are the message.

38
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,065
He was a good man.

39
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,407
Doesn't matter that Mario's gone,
you'll always be my sister.

40
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,497
For Falcones, it's all about family.

41
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,078
I appreciate that.

42
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,252
So, sister to sister...

43
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,171
We're not really here
to look at photographs.

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,253
There's only one neighborhood
in Gotham that hasn't bent the knee.

45
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,881
The Narrows has never submitted
to an outside boss.

46
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,641
There's never been someone
like me ruling Gotham.

47
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,468
Okay.

48
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,057
What do you want?

49
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,262
A tax.

50
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,810
Thirty percent on all income coming
from The Narrows, legal and illegal.

51
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,734
Every family there lives
hand to mouth. They'll starve.

52
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,069
We all have to make sacrifices.

53
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,235
I'll need an answer
by the end of the day.

54
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,996
You want me to kiss the ring?
I'll do it.

55
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,121
To keep the peace. But what you're
asking for is impossible.

56
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,131
You'll find a way.

57
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,668
Thought it was all about family.

58
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,672
Never said it was a happy family.

59
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,514
(DOOR OPENS)

60
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,724
Thank you.

61
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,827
Thank you for meeting me.

62
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,922
My parents' foundation is having
their annual dinner tonight.

63
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,169
I thought we could go.

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,875
Somehow, I don't think you got me
all the way down here

65
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,926
to talk about a fundraiser, did you?

66
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,762
Bruce, what exactly is it that
you want from me?

67
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,189
Help.

68
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,319
Figuring this out.
I can't do it alone, I...

69
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,065
Alfred, I need your help.

70
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,529
No.

71
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,909
What?

72
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,087
Listen, you can't just waltz back
in here and expect me to go

73
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,916
and clean your smalls and cook
your tea. After what you've done.

74
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,921
Alfred, I'm not asking for that.
I've changed.

75
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,047
You have, have you?

76
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,379
It's one thing saying
that you've changed,

77
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,260
and another actually changing.

78
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:14,062
So show me. Show me how you've
changed, and I might reconsider.

79
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,440
Show you how?

80
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,237
That's for you to figure out, innit?

81
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,993
I'm asking as a friend.

82
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,331
I'm not your friend.

83
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,790
I was your butler.

84
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,842
And you fired me.

85
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,307
He'll pay for the tea, miss.

86
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,817
Sure hope Lee is gonna
figure something out with Sofia.

87
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,697
Lee being the love
of your life and all.

88
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,741
We're friends.

89
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,865
You know, those koo-koo pills
aren't gonna make me go away.

90
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,623
Well, they have stopped you
from getting out

91
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,452
and trying to kill Lee again.
So works for me.

92
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,537
Mail arrived.

93
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,793
Oh, who's it from?

94
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,712
Oswald.

95
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,799
"I want to apologize...
Can we be friends again?"

96
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,510
What? I'm never gonna forgive him.

97
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,561
I think it's a nice letter.

98
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,889
- Shut up!
- Hey, Ed.

99
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,266
What has two eyes but can't see?

100
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,318
What has two...

(LAUGHING)

102
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,155
Good lord.

103
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,950
This is new. More aggressive.

104
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,670
The plants are literally bursting
through their flesh.

You! Get away from that! Now!

107
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,335
Now.

108
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,217
Same flower growing out
of these bodies.

109

That's a weapon?

110
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,303
Gordon, this must be what Ivy
did with the Lazarus Water.

111
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,763
Used it to increase
the potency of a toxic plant.

112
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,769
- The seeds made it airborne...
- GORDON: Where's Bullock?

00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,691
- What?
- He works here.

114

- Who?
- Mario Pepper's kid.

She's been working on some biotech.

Look, I gotta think
that you were the target.

That's in Ives Square.
House must be right across.

159

You should go to the precinct.

00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,759
Okay, then we'll work on it together.
You can wear the badge.

163
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,838
Get this straight, Jim.
I ain't working for you now or ever.

164
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,633
I got more contacts in The Narrows
than any of you.

165
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,518
I'm gonna find her. Alone.

166
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,979
Once I find my pants.

167
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,190
LEE: Doesn't make any sense.

168
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,784
There's no money here.

169
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,406
Okay, so it's about power.

170
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,664
I offered to bend the knee.

171
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,246
She's asking for something
she knew I couldn't give.

172
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,755
She wants...

173
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,126
She wants to punish me.

174
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,173
For what?

175
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,006
I don't know.
But you can't fight an enemy

176
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,513
whose motivations
you don't understand, Lee.

You are the greatest spies
in all of Gotham.

The survival of The Narrows
depends upon you.

wants to destroy Lee Thompkins

- Yeah!

185
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,343

188
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,277
She wasn't bluffing.

189
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,656
With this many plants, she could kill
hundreds if not thousands of people.

190
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,318
Search the other room for any signs
of where she's heading.

191
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,205
What are you gonna do to her?

192
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,293
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

193
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,095
I just saw the news.

194
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,297
She killed four more people today.

195
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,467
You knew where she was staying.
If you had told me,

196
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,762
- we could've saved lives.
- Or not.

197
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,644
I mean, you couldn't even stop her
from hypnotizing your own cops.

198
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,317
So why did you come here?

199
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,359
To try to reason with her.

200
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,782
Have you heard a word she said?
She's a fanatic.

201
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,858
She's my friend.

202
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,156
What do you expect me to do?

203
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,073
She contacts you again, call me.

204
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,125
I'll try and find her,
and bring her in quietly.

205
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,369
Otherwise, stay out of her way.

206
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,673

207
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,505
Hey, I got a lead.

Great.

HARVEY: I knocked some heads.

210
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,849
Heard a hot redhead was poking around
in that dive bar next door.

211
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,147
That is the place in The Narrows
for low-end muscle.

212
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,190
So I figured,
if she was planning something big,

213
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,768
she might've gone there to recruit.

214
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,478
That's the back entrance.

215

I think you might be exceeding

224
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,347
Are you experiencing

Check. "Cognitive impairment"?
Definite check.

Though to be fair,
how would you know?

Shut up!

Take all the pills you want, Ed.
I'm only getting stronger.

Soon I'm gonna be out,
and the fun begins.

230
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,987
No. I won't let you.
'Cause I know what you'll do.

231
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,946
Oh, you mean kill Lee?

232
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,917
Yeah, I guess I will do that.
And you can't stop me.

233
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,585
There are things that I can do.

234
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,958
Like what? You need to face it, pal.

235
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,336
The only way you'll get
rid of me is to kill yourself.

236
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,087
I guess you are smarter than me.

237
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,342
- You wouldn't actually...
- Oh, yeah.

238
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,930
Oh, yeah.

239

Do you believe in fate,
Detective Gordon?

241

I went out today to test my plants
on the man who shot my father.

242
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,707
He wasn't there.
That's disappointing.

243
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,918
Then he found me.

244
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,303
And I realized I could make him
deliver his partner as well.

Stay strong, Harvey.

You were hypnotized.
I need you to focus.

322
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,279
Did Ivy give you any clue
about who she's targeting next?

323
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,026
I can't believe I let her get to me.

324
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,863
Hey, you wanna help? Here's how.
Did she say anything?

325
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,125
Something about,
"They get rich by murdering plants."

326
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,836
So she's targeting
a group of rich people.

327
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,509
At her place, she was trying on
fancy clothes, fancy shoes.

328
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,048
A party?

329
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,380
She said she had big plans,
couldn't be late.

330
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,929
- Yeah, black tie.
- No, no, no, come on.

331
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,136
Fancy schmancy, like a charity
for hobos or something.

332
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,722
Wayne Foundation's
annual dinner is tonight

333
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,098
over at Gotham Square.

334
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,808
All right. Get the strike force.

335
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,565
I want full body armor,
gas masks, nonlethal rounds.

336
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,814
To fight plants?

337
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,442
When Ivy got me, she was hypnotizing
a bunch of low-end muscle.

338
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,609
Go.

339
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,790
We could really use you there, Harv.

340
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,418
Jim, she got in my head.

341
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,622
I really...
I just don't trust myself right now.

342
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,712
All right, you can help out here.
Man the phones.

343

Hey, Jim.

344
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,476
I spent too long
putting this all on you.

345
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,350
What happened between us.

346
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,189
The fact is I only got
myself to blame.

347
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,941

00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,034
Good evening.

354
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,204
Welcome to the third annual dinner

355
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,873
for the Thomas and
Martha Wayne Foundation.

356
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,327
This year we disbursed $4 million...

357
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,880
Um...

358
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:51,346
We disbursed $4 million and, uh...

359
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,817
My parents spent their
lives helping people.

360
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,532
I was so proud of them, and I always
wanted them to be proud of me.

361
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,880
And then I saw them get murdered.

362
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,091
I survived because someone in
my life kept me going.

363
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,428
He's been everything to me.

364
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,723
A teacher,

365
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,850
a protector.

366
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,643
He's been a father to me.

367
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,572
I hope...

368
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,199
I hope he can see that.

369
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,988
And give me another chance.

370
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,955
Thank you.

371

(APPLAUDING)

372
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,510
Thank you.

373
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,768
That meant a great deal.

374
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,138
But I can't help you.

375
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,273
Not until you accept
who you really are.

376
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,948
I know who I am,
I've seen what's inside of me.

377
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,074
Darkness and anger?

378
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,114
But what's beneath that?

379
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,489
It's a heart that feels pain.

380
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,826
Your heart is what makes you
want to help other people.

381
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,911
Your heart is your strength.

382
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,753
Deny the darkness and you deny that.

383
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,137
But accepting that is something that
you must do on your own.

384
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,679
Do you understand me?

385
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,557
I was stupid for reaching out.

386
