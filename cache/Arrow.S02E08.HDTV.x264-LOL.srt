1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:03,727
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:07,186
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:09,522
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:12,692
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:16,946
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:22,251
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:26,973
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,069
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,488
The defendant
is found not guilty.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,324
Hello, Moira.

11
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,608
What do you want, Malcolm?

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,777
Thea is my daughter.

13
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:41,381
What do these guys want
with a seven year old sub?

14
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,316
What's on it,
it'll save the human race.

15
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:44,884
Will it save him?

16
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:46,552
Sir, there's been
a development.

17
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:50,289
Brother Cyrus...

18
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,793
How do you feel?

19
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:55,628
Stronger.

20
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,163
What was that?

21
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:59,044

23
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:08,705
Mrs. Queen, welcome back
to the company.

24
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:10,405
Thank you.
You look fabulous.

25
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:12,458
Really, better than ever.
Did you do something to your hair?

26
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,210
Yes, I shampooed it
without eight women

27
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:16,578
and a guard
watching me.

28
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,881
Is it ok to laugh?
Because I was ordered

29
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:21,634
not to say anything about you being
in prison, just to avoid any awkward...

30
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:24,103
exchanges.
Like that one.

31
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,524
Right.

32
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:32,511
We need to drill down on these
numbers before the earnings call.

33
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:34,246
Oliver. I didn't realize

34
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:36,282
your mother was stopping by
for a visit today.

35
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:39,601
Well, it's not a visit.
This is her company, too.

36
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:41,821
Of course.

37
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:44,106
How are you, Moira?

38
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:46,826
Back, Isabel.

39
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:49,795
Mr. Queen, may I speak
to you for a minute?

40
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:53,849
What sort of message
does it send

41
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:56,085
to the investment
committee, to the city,

42
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:59,088
if we hand Queen Consolidated right
back to your mother?

43
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,639
She was acquitted.
By a jury.

44
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:03,309
Not by the city.
Oliver.

45
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,810
Stop thinking
like a son

46
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:07,613
and start thinking
like a CEO.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,985
Oliver.

48
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:15,321
There's been a break-in.

49
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,648
Damn!

50
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:35,324
This door was made of expanded
reinforced titanium.

51
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,343
What did they use
to do this?

52
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:39,845
Not sure yet.
No sign of any explosives.

53
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,881
Maybe a crane,
maybe a forklift.

54
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:44,499
I'm guessing there was
at least three of them, maybe four.

55
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,336
And given how quick
they got in and out of here...

56
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:50,606
They were fast.

57
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:54,026
Whoa, hey, stop, wait!

58
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:55,728
You don't even
have a fare!

59
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:04,553
Any idea what these guys
were so hot to break in here for?

60
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,355
You didn't happen to leave
a spare earthquake machine

61
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:09,491
lying around, did you?

62
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:11,243
Sorry.

63
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:16,298
This is what we're able to
pull off the security cameras.

64
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:23,872
He was the only guy
we got on video.

65
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:25,991
The rest of the crew
must have come in after him.

66
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:28,093
Actually, it was
only one guy.

67
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:30,379
Ah, sorry I'm late.

68
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,565
But actually, my train was late.
Well, the second one.

69
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,734
The first one I did miss, but
that was my cab driver's fault.

70
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,937
I've got this great
traffic app, and...

71
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:41,240
But he thought
that he was right.

72
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:43,225
I'm here now,
though. So.

73
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:44,643
Great. Who the hell are you?

74
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:46,195
And do your parents
know that you're here?

75
00:04:46,197 --> 00:04:47,947
I'm Barry Allen.

76
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,215
I'm from the Central
City police department.

77
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:52,918
I'm with the crime scene
investigation unit.

78
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,454
We're working on a case
with some similar

79
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:57,923
unexplained elements
in Central City,

80
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:00,459
so when the report of your robbery
came over the wire,

81
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:02,911
my captain
sent me up here.

82
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,632
And you think one guy ripped
through this door

83
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:08,300
like it was
tin foil?

84
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:11,353
One very
strong guy, yeah.

85
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:15,224
Uh, it takes about 1,250 foot
pounds of torque

86
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:17,109
to break someone's neck.

87
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,861
You see the marks
on the guard's neck?

88
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:22,982
The bruising pattern suggests
the killer used only one hand.

89
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:25,484
I'm guessing you don't know
how hard it is

90
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:26,702
to break someone's neck.

91
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:28,937
Hmm? No. No idea.

92
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:31,907
Uh, we're going to need
a list of the entire inventory here

93
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:34,293
to figure out exactly
what was stolen.

94
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:37,079
Actually, I think
I know what was stolen.

95
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:40,082
A centrifuge.
An industrial centrifuge.

96
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:43,052
Probably the Cord
Enterprises 2BX 900.

97
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:44,637
Maybe the six series.

98
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,389
Both have
a three column base.

99
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,642
Here, you can see
the three sets of broken bolts

100
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:53,512
where the thief just...
ripped it out of the ground.

101
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:56,315
And what exactly
is a centrifuge?

102
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:57,950
It separates liquids.

103
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:00,019
The centripetal acceleration
causes denser substances

104
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,488
to separate out
along the radial direction.

105
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,606
And lighter objects
move to the top.

106
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:06,542
What did you say
your name was again?

107
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:08,077
Barry. Allen.

108
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,046
Felicity. Smoak.

109
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,983
Um, you can
see the cracks

110
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,836
heading towards
the door. Footsteps.

111
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:21,373
One guy.

112
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,442
Anyway,
it's just a theory.

113
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:26,311
One backed by
a lot of evidence.

114
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:28,597
There has to be
another explanation.

115
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,800
Yeah. I'm sure
you're right.

116
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:35,054
You might want to fill
our mutual friend in on this.

117
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:37,272
Yeah. Don't worry.

118
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:39,841
I'm sure
he's already on it.

119
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,868
We need to change
directions

120
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,521
10 degrees north.
We need to rest.

121
00:06:52,523 --> 00:06:54,873
If Ivo and any of his men
survived that blast,

122
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,158
they'll be tracking us.

123
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,545
We keep moving.

124
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:02,081
Five minutes.

125
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,702
You watch him,
please.

126
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:09,088
Of course.

127
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:14,093
Do you believe them?

128
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:16,595
That this Hosen will lead us
to a wrecked Japanese sub?

129
00:07:16,597 --> 00:07:18,430
Ivo seems to think so.

130
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:20,783
I just hope whatever
miracle serum

131
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:22,551
they're after
is actually onboard.

132
00:07:22,553 --> 00:07:25,554
For his sake.

133
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:28,390
How do you know that girl?

134
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:31,577
Sara was on
my father's boat...

135
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:34,613
with me.

136
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,333
What about the girl
in the picture?

137
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:39,901
Laurel?

138
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:43,455
The girl you told me
you were in love with.

139
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:46,258
Sara is her sister.

140
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,914
I feel like
taking a walk.

141
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,969
Anyone care to join me?

142
00:07:56,971 --> 00:08:00,022
I guess a lot's happened
in the last year.

143
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:05,427
Oliver.

144
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:07,896
Got the final inventory
from applied sciences.

145
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:09,948
That CSI from Central City
was right.

146
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,267
The only thing missing
is a centrifuge.

147
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:14,769
You have to see this.
I pulled up CC traffic camera footage

148
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:17,072
from across the street
of applied sciences.

149
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:19,374
This is three minutes
after the alarm went off.

150
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:28,133
Can we help you
with something, Detective?

151
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:31,653
Oh, CSIs aren't
actually detectives.

152
00:08:31,655 --> 00:08:32,838
We don't even carry guns.

153
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,724
Just some plastic baggies.

154
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:39,595
Uh, where should I
set up my equipment?

155
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:40,846
I'll show you.
What's going on?

156
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:43,182
Your assistant said
that you preferred

157
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:45,651
to keep
the investigation in house,

158
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:47,802
so I cleared it with my captain
to give you a hand.

159
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,492
What are you doing?

160
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:55,444
We need to find this intruder.

161
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:57,979
And he seems to know
more about it than any of us.

162
00:08:57,981 --> 00:09:01,533
Forensic science
isn't exactly my forte, so...

163
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:07,289
I'd say we need him.

164
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,924
Wouldn't you?

165
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:12,511
Mm-hmm.

166
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:14,997
I'll show you around.

167
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,202
Why am I getting the feeling

168
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,420
you know more about this
than Felicity's new friend?

169
00:09:25,226 --> 00:09:28,727
Pray I'm wrong.

170
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:39,708
Hi. I'm sorry
about what happened

171
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,040
at the office
this morning.

172
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,875
There are a lot of people who think
I got away with murder, Oliver.

173
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:45,209
Maybe I did.

174
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,712
Mom, the trial,
the Undertaking,

175
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,731
Malcolm Merlyn,
all of that is behind us now.

176
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,266
And we need everyone
to see that.

177
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:54,269
How are we going to do that?
We throw a party.

178
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:57,388
Thea.

179
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,090
Roy.

180
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,859
Did I hear you guys say
something about a party?

181
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:02,744
A welcome back to Queen Consolidated
party for mom.

182
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:04,045
I don't think so.

183
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:06,081
If things are going to get
back to normal,

184
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,316
then we need
to start acting normal.

185
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:10,518
Normal for us is
a lavish party.

186
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,040
Oh. I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen,
I can't stay for brunch.

187
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:17,292
I guess
we got to go.

188
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:21,429
Bye.

189
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:24,299
I'll take care
of everything.

190
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:37,278
What exactly
are you looking for?

191
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,930
Your thief's shoes
touched the ground,

192
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:41,700
which means he tracked
in dozens of clues

193
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:44,536
as to where he's been
the past few days.

194
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:48,289
Got ya.

195
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:58,383
Shouldn't take long.

196
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:03,221
So you've seen him, right?

197
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:05,273
The Vigilante?

198
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,976
I read that he saved you.

199
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:10,045
What was he like?

200
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:12,347
Green.

201
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,015
Green.

202
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:16,117
That's interesting, right?

203
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,019
I mean, why green?

204
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:19,654
Black would be better
for stealth,

205
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,239
and urban camouflage.

206
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,807
Me, personally,

207
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:25,994
I think that he trained
in some sort of like forest

208
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:27,662
or jungle environment,

209
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:29,848
and the green
is a nod to that.

210
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,083
I don't give the vigilante
much thought.

211
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:35,170
Police reports show that
he uses carbon arrows,

212
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:37,205
but if he switched
to an aluminum carbon composite,

213
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,425
he would have
far better penetration.

214
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:42,660
Maybe he thinks
he penetrates just fine.

215
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:43,862
Do you want
to know something else?

216
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:46,431
I think that he has partners.

217
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:50,552
Definitely someone with
a background in computer sciences.

218
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:52,854
Yeah.

219
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:56,074
Why are you
so interested in the Vigilante?

220
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,599
When I was 11,
my mom was murdered.

221
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:06,918
I'm so sorry.

222
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,737
They never caught
the guy who did it.

223
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:12,690
Maybe he would have.

224
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:21,416
The soil...there's
a crystalline structure in it.

225
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,652
That's weird.

226
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:27,388
What's weird?

227
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,741
It's sugar.

228
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:37,816
Sin, you said
this was an emergency.

229
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:41,352
No offense, but Thea,
you shouldn't be here.

230
00:12:41,354 --> 00:12:44,005
In the alleyway
of the club I own?

231
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:46,224
It's my friend Max.

232
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:48,576
He's missing. I haven't seen him
for a week, no one has.

233
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:50,445
Something happened to him.

234
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,415
I figured you knew
someone who could help.

235
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,918
Roy can help you.

236
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,370
I thought you wanted me
to stay out of trouble.

237
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:01,435
I kind of like that you never

238
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,940
turn away from someone
who needs help.

239
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:05,259
I'll just get someone
to cover the club.

240
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:06,811
What do you mean?

241
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:09,147
Oh, I'm coming with you.

242
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:17,721
I hear you're
throwing a party.

243
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:20,041
I didn't get my invite.

244
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:23,494
Where exactly
should I have addressed it?

245
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:25,429
Starling City cemetery?

246
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,765
I know that's where you wish
I was right now.

247
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,233
Lying beside my son.

248
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:32,053
Am I supposed to feel sorry
for you, Malcolm?

249
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:34,589
You killed Tommy.

250
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,525
You killed your son.

251
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:40,495
You cannot have my daughter.
Our daughter.

252
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:43,598
I think we both
needed someone that night.

253
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,802
I felt so bad about betraying
Rebecca's memory

254
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:50,521
that I left
Starling.

255
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:54,141
Left Tommy behind.

256
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,663
That's when I made my way
to Nanda Parbat,

257
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:01,282
where I found
my new purpose.

258
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:03,451
In a way, Moira,

259
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:06,487
you made me the man
I am today.

260
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:09,123
Thea is innocent.

261
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,658
She loved Robert.

262
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,159
Please don't
take that away from her,

263
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:13,628
I'm begging you.

264
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,830
Thea is all
I have left.

265
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:18,499
Tell her the truth,

266
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:21,002
and tell her soon.

267
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:26,663
You found something?

268
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:27,649
We found something.

269
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,316
There were
trace amounts of sucrose

270
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:31,852
and a spec of dirt the killer
dragged in here on his boot.

271
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:33,821
Which got me thinking.
There is a sugar refinery

272
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:35,372
two miles from here.
The land around it

273
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,207
is suffused in waste sugar.
So I checked.

274
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,909
They had a delivery truck
stolen a few days ago.

275
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,611
Their truck matches
the make and model

276
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,046
of the truck the thief used
to steal the centrifuge.

277
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,698
Can you track the vehicle?
We've been trying.

278
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,750
What was that?

279
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:51,922
You're not going
to believe this.

280
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,040
The truck, it was just
used to rob a blood bank.

281
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:55,542
Are you sure?
Yeah. Our guy

282
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:57,544
just made off with 30,000 ccs
of O-negative.

283
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:59,880
What, he has super
strength, likes blood?

284
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:02,382
Please don't tell me
we suddenly believe in vampires.

285
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:04,902
We should give this information
to the local police.

286
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,304
I'll...take care of that.

287
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:08,329
Did you say that you were
working a similar case

288
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,723
in Central City?

289
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:11,241
Oh, yeah, um...

290
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,726
Yeah, you know,
it's similar.

291
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,060
Has similar
elements.

292
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:17,564
A lot of
similarities.

293
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:19,232
Right. Yeah.

294
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,371
I want you to look into
this Allen kid.

295
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:26,089
There's more to him
than he's letting on.

296
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,592
His intentions seem
pretty clear to me.

297
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:33,246
Just do it, please.

298
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:34,748
Oliver, when are you
going to tell me

299
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,301
what exactly
we're up against?

300
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,850
Yeooww!

301
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,931
Sorry.

302
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:00,348
Ahh.

303
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:03,911
Thank you.

304
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:08,099
You were right to ask if
I knew more than I was letting on.

305
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:11,085
I've seen men
with abilities like that before.

306
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:13,271
You have?

307
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:15,974
Where?

308
00:17:15,976 --> 00:17:18,092
The island.

309
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:20,545
My second year
marooned there, we--

310
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:23,381
I came across
the remains

311
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:26,835
of a Japanese World War II
military project.

312
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,672
It was a serum designed
to create human weapons.

313
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,875
Human weapons. My God,
what's next, aliens?

314
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:36,161
This is real, Diggle.

315
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,812
Those five years
that I was away,

316
00:17:37,814 --> 00:17:39,848
I came across things
that just...

317
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,467
defy explanation.

318
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:45,470
There's a doctor,
his name is Ivo,

319
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:47,305
and he came to the island

320
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:50,909
to test the serum on people.

321
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:53,645
The ones that survived,
their endurance,

322
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,848
reflexes and strength
were all enhanced.

323
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,900
And you think this Ivo's
in Starling City?

324
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:01,136
He's dead.

325
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:04,355
And so is everyone that he
injected with the serum.

326
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:07,008
The last of which...I burned.

327
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,610
You think someone
found the recipe.

328
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:10,311
The centrifuge
and a large supply of blood.

329
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:12,146
I think someone
wants to make more of it.

330
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:14,399
A lot more.

331
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:16,651
Why couldn't you have
been marooned on Aruba?

332
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:20,872
There's a third component--
a strong sedative.

333
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:22,373
I think I preferred it

334
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,492
when you left these
in people.

335
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:26,160
I need you to analyze
the blood on the arrowhead.

336
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:28,296
If we can figure out
which sedative they're using...

337
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:31,499
We can figure out
where the next robbery will be.

338
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,002
Barry and I will
get right on it.

339
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:39,274
I think our Miss Smoak
is smitten.

340
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:42,360
Diggle, what did you
find out about Mr. Allen?

341
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:44,779
He's not who he says he is.

342
00:18:52,071 --> 00:18:54,188
How are you holding up?

343
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,876
I could do with
a better looking crutch.

344
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:01,379
You two seem
like you've gotten pretty chummy.

345
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:04,198
We're here.

346
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,638
There must be
a fissure in the island

347
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,393
below the waterline
for it to come that far inland.

348
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:18,279
Unbelievable.

349
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:22,400
They have nitric acid
next to hydrazine?

350
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:25,219
Permanganates
on top of acetone?

351
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,705
This is the definition
of dangerous.

352
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:30,992
If it's so dangerous, maybe you
shouldn't be touching them.

353
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:36,531
Barry.

354
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,533
I managed
to get a sample

355
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,034
of the perpetrator's blood
from the police department.

356
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:41,736
We need to isolate
a sedative in the blood.

357
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:42,921
It could lead us
to the thief.

358
00:19:42,923 --> 00:19:44,372
How did the police get it?

359
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:46,791
Apparently the Vigilante
shot him with an arrow.

360
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:49,127
You're kidding.

361
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:52,463
You know what
this means, right?

362
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:55,233
This means the Vigilante's
working the same case we are!

363
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,752
Heh. Go figure.

364
00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:59,587
How did you get it?

365
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,589
Oliver has a lot
of connections.

366
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:03,741
Wow.

367
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:06,594
Pays to work for a billionaire.

368
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,947
Actually my take home's
nothing special.

369
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:11,366
Especially given
I am rarely at home,

370
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:13,484
since I'm with him
every night.

371
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:16,621
Ah. Well, I didn't
realize you and he were...

372
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:17,789
Oh, no.

373
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,958
Work. He...and I

374
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,178
are not, no, I do
not like Oliver.

375
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:27,782
Um, I was invited

376
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:30,168
to a work function.

377
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,136
It's a party.

378
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:35,924
And I have
a plus-one.

379
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:37,425
I was thinking
you would make

380
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:40,612
a really good...
plus one.

381
00:20:44,683 --> 00:20:47,285
There's not going to be
dancing, is there?

382
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,972
I'm not just not
too good on my feet.

383
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,580
Ohh.

384
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,366
It reeks in here.

385
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:05,319
I guess your friend wasn't too
into painting seascapes.

386
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:14,212
Max is like
any starving artist...

387
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:16,848
starving.

388
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,969
But I could always crash here
when I didn't have a place to stay.

389
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:23,021
Hey, this blood drive
was a week ago.

390
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:25,673
When did you say
he went missing?

391
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,994
That day.

392
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:42,690
It's Daily.

393
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:45,026
Someone's looking
for Maxwell Stanton.

394
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:47,261
And they should
find him.

395
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:49,363
Yes, brother blood.

396
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:56,888
Blood provides life.

397
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,874
Blood provides power.

398
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:02,143
And with power...

399
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:05,480
There's no limit
to what I can do.

400
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:10,768
Central City is just a day away
from making history

401
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,738
when the controversial
S.T.A.R. Lab's particle accelerator

402
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,857
is finally turned on.

403
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,608
Pretty cool,
right?

404
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,577
You know there's been
a hundred percent increase

405
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,030
in earthquakes since they've turned on
the Large Hadron Collider.

406
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:25,249
That data is misleading.
Oh, do tell.

407
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,234
You know about
misleading, don't you?

408
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:28,903
What are you
talking about?

409
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:30,455
He's not from CSI,
he's an assistant.

410
00:22:30,457 --> 00:22:32,573
Whose bosses don't know
you're in Starling.

411
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:34,125
And there is no similar case
in Central City.

412
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,728
So tell me, Barry...

413
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,765
What are you really
doing here?

414
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:47,789
I told you my mom
was murdered.

415
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,557
By your father.

416
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,442
He didn't do it.

417
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:54,695
You said that the police
didn't find the man who killed her.

418
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:59,584
The police
think they did.

419
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,354
My dad has been serving
a life sentence.

420
00:23:05,391 --> 00:23:08,609
They didn't believe me.

421
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:11,278
About what?

422
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:15,516
I was 11.

423
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:22,306
One night...

424
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:26,611
something just came
into our house, like a tornado.

425
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,113
A blur.

426
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:34,352
Somewhere inside The Blur,
I saw a person.

427
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:37,488
My dad went to fight it.

428
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,342
I tried to get 'em
when suddenly...

429
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,866
I was 20 blocks
away from our house.

430
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:51,419
Nobody believed me.

431
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:56,007
They thought I was trying
to cover for my father.

432
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:58,259
But what I saw that night

433
00:23:58,261 --> 00:24:00,294
was real.

434
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:02,180
As real as the man
that ripped down

435
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:04,765
that metal door
with his bare hands.

436
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:12,140
That's why I look
into cases like this.

437
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:17,395
The ones nobody
believes are possible.

438
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:20,331
Maybe if I can just
make sense of one,

439
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:25,019
I might be able to find out
who really killed my mother.

440
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:28,706
And free my dad.

441
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:36,697
I am sorry I lied to you.

442
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:41,719
Better find
another plus one.

443
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:52,546
He did like about
who he really was.

444
00:24:56,485 --> 00:24:59,270
And what do we do every day?

445
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,751
Hey.

446
00:25:15,753 --> 00:25:16,886
How's everything
going in there?

447
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:18,554
Good evening,
Queens.

448
00:25:18,556 --> 00:25:21,607
Can I have a word?
Yeah.

449
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:26,028
I'm sorry if I overreacted
a little bit earlier.

450
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,947
Oh, you think?

451
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:30,933
Look, right now you need to apologize
to your mother. Not me.

452
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:32,301
For what?

453
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:33,686
Your being wrong.

454
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:44,881
I guess these days,
I only draw a crowd

455
00:25:44,883 --> 00:25:46,716
when I'm on trial
for murder.

456
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:48,451
Mom, you don't have to...

457
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:49,769
We have guests.

458
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:53,055
However few of them
there are.

459
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,627
This is not your fault, Ollie.

460
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:08,271
How's your mom doing?

461
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:11,858
Oh, you know us Queen women--
nothing gets to us.

462
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,475
You must take
after your dad.

463
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:15,778
Sorry.

464
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,197
Sin. What's up?

465
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,650
I found Max.
Where?

466
00:26:21,702 --> 00:26:24,503
I'm on my way.
They find Max?

467
00:26:24,505 --> 00:26:25,922
Um, no.

468
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:27,823
She just wants me
to stop by.

469
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:29,125
I can come with you.

470
00:26:29,127 --> 00:26:31,794
You should stay here.
Your mom needs you.

471
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:33,495
Ok, I'll call you later.

472
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:48,895
Time for a dance?

473
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:51,948
Not really feeling like
dancing with you, Oliver.

474
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,149
I know.

475
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:56,786
And that is why
I called him.

476
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:01,707
Fyi--

477
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:05,244
they will card him
at the bar.

478
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:11,067
Hi.
Hi.

479
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:14,720
I was serious
about not being able to dance.

480
00:27:14,722 --> 00:27:18,507
But I'll hold
your hands and sway.

481
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:20,810
Sold.
Ok.

482
00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:42,949
I tried to warn you.

483
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:45,401
I tried to ignore you.

484
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:55,261
I am sorry,
Oliver.

485
00:27:58,382 --> 00:28:01,133
Yeah.

486
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:12,528
Oliver threw you
a lovely party.

487
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,063
Oliver's a good son,

488
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:16,732
if not the best
judge of character.

489
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:19,768
Is everything ok?

490
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,456
Everything's going perfectly.

491
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:50,239
He doesn't have long.

492
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:54,937
If this miracle drug is onboard,
then we need to find it now.

493
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:58,474
Slade, be back
in a few minutes, ok?

494
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:00,976
I'll just get comfortable.

495
00:29:00,978 --> 00:29:03,662
Come on.

496
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,037
There.

497
00:29:17,044 --> 00:29:18,878
Mirakuru.

498
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,964
Miracle.

499
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:25,267
I was never sure
it was real.

500
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:26,886
What happens
if we give it to Slade?

501
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:29,271
He needs a sedative
in his bloodstream first.

502
00:29:29,273 --> 00:29:32,391
They might have
potassium bromide or barbital.

503
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:35,027
Ohh.

504
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:37,696
It's empty.

505
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:39,982
What happens if we give it
to him without the sedative?

506
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:42,902
Sarah!

507
00:29:42,904 --> 00:29:44,703
He'll die, for sure.

508
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:46,021
He's going
to die anyway.

509
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:49,408
What was that?

510
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,429
Ivo and his men.
They're on the sub.

511
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,074
Have you made contact?
Yes.

512
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,857
He said to tell you that

513
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,470
your information was
gratefully accepted.

514
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:07,916
Thank you.

515
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:13,588
Who was that?

516
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,224
Nothing to worry about.

517
00:30:15,226 --> 00:30:18,727
Thank you for tonight, Oliver.
It was a lovely party.

518
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:21,130
I'm so sorry that
I put you through that.

519
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:23,556
Oh, listen, I don't care

520
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:25,434
what anyone else in
this city thinks of me.

521
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:27,269
I only care
what you two think.

522
00:30:29,156 --> 00:30:32,098
And I have to get
back to the office.

523
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,590
Excuse me.

524
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:39,681
Thea.

525
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:42,117
There's something
I need to tell you.

526
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,686
Sure. What is it?

527
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:51,677
I love you.

528
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:57,182
I love you, too.

529
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:04,690
Yes.

530
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:06,925
Yes, sir. I--

531
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:10,779
yes, director, I know that this is
not the first time.

532
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:14,616
Yes, sir, I do value
my job, very much.

533
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:17,136
Look, I will be on
the next train.

534
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:20,656
Mm-hmm. I'll be back
tonight. Ok.

535
00:31:20,658 --> 00:31:23,509
Thank--

536
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:28,263
Well, my boss found out I don't
have food poisoning.

537
00:31:28,265 --> 00:31:29,765
I need to get back
to Central City

538
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,800
if I still want
to be employed.

539
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:34,019
Which I do.

540
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:37,306
Tell the SCPD that
the sedative in the thief's blood

541
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:39,174
is Ketamine. It's a schedule
three controlled substance.

542
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,559
It shouldn't be
too hard to track.

543
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,110
Yeah, I'll make sure
they get it.

544
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:43,979
Thank you.
It was really nice--

545
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:46,615
thank you for--
working with you.

546
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:48,317
everything,
We couldn't have done it...

547
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,169
Without you.

548
00:31:57,994 --> 00:32:00,162
Good-bye, Felicity.

549
00:32:02,765 --> 00:32:05,751
Good-bye.

550
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:10,038
Max!

551
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,674
Get off, let go!
Max! Get off of me!

552
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:13,675
Hey! Let her go.

553
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:15,093
Cut it out!

554
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:17,629
Stupid cops.

555
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:18,730
They're saying
Max ODed.

556
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:20,048
Was he using?
No!

557
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,484
He made extra cash
donating blood.

558
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:23,735
You really think
the hospital would let him

559
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:25,938
be a donor
if he was an addict?

560
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:39,334
Hey. Can't be here, kid.

561
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:41,753
Let's go.

562
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:48,627
They found trace amounts of
Ketamine in the thief's blood.

563
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:52,014
It's a common surgical anesthesia
derived from hydrochloric salt.

564
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:54,633
Can you use that
to track him?

565
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:57,519
With the current concentration ratio
in the blood sample, there's only

566
00:32:57,521 --> 00:33:01,206
one possible location with
a large enough quality of the sedative

567
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:02,674
that correlates
with the amount of blood

568
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,977
the stolen centrifuge
can process.

569
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:08,363
What is it?
There's no sign.

570
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:10,782
A.R.G.U.S. doesn't
like to advertise.

571
00:33:10,784 --> 00:33:12,784
It's a disaster bunker.
Right on the edge of the Glades.

572
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:14,403
A.R.G.U.S. has them
all over the country.

573
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:15,704
They store relief supplies--

574
00:33:15,706 --> 00:33:17,873
food, clothing...
Medicine.

575
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,459
I'm on my way.

576
00:33:22,078 --> 00:33:24,997
Oliver...

577
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:26,748
I can't believe
I'm actually saying this.

578
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,885
The way this arrowhead
is bent...

579
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:31,553
It means our thief's
muscle density

580
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:35,457
is at least 120 pounds
per cubic foot.

581
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:38,226
That's almost the same
density as common concrete.

582
00:33:38,228 --> 00:33:41,596
Your arrows may cut this guy,
but they will not stop him.

583
00:33:41,598 --> 00:33:44,850
Well, I've beat someone like
this before, Felicity.

584
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:46,885
I can do it again.

585
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,420
What if you can't?

586
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:54,526
Oliver.

587
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:03,869
Now this, it could save you...

588
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:06,004
Or it could kill you.

589
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:08,707
By the looks
on your faces,

590
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:12,511
I'm going to die anyway.

591
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:27,842
Sorry.

592
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:29,628
For what?

593
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:37,903
For not telling you
how I really feel.

594
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:47,979
Do it.

595
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:07,065
No!

596
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,054
What?

597
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,056
I need your help.

598
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:16,908
A friend of mine's
friend, well,

599
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,993
the cops think
he ODed, but we think

600
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:20,262
he was murdered.
Why?

601
00:35:20,264 --> 00:35:22,614
Well, he wasn't an addict,
for starters. And this...

602
00:35:22,616 --> 00:35:25,384
This doesn't look like
any OD I've ever seen.

603
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:29,237
Stay away from that.

604
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,922
You know something?

605
00:35:30,924 --> 00:35:32,941
What happened to him?

606
00:35:32,943 --> 00:35:34,174
You're the one who told

607
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,511
me to be your eyes
and ears on the streets.

608
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:37,763
You know what, that is not
good enough for me anymore.

609
00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:40,799
Fine. Then we're done
altogether.

610
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:42,717
I don't need you!

611
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,919
I have friends
that can help me.

612
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:47,389
You can't stop us.

613
00:35:47,391 --> 00:35:49,724
Slow you down.

614
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:52,310
Ah!

615
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:13,533
And I thought it couldn't hurt
to add extra security guards.

616
00:36:13,535 --> 00:36:16,186
It hurt them.

617
00:36:16,188 --> 00:36:17,971
Badly.

618
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,140
Have you prepared Thea?

619
00:36:20,142 --> 00:36:22,259
No.

620
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:25,679
You will not go near Thea,
you will not speak to her

621
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:28,148
and you will never
set foot in this house again.

622
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,800
I set you free, Moira.

623
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:31,702
Your life belongs to me.

624
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,524
I am through
being afraid of you.

625
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:40,494
You think
you can stop me?

626
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:43,563
Even the Vigilante
couldn't kill me.

627
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:46,199
No, he couldn't.

628
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:48,302
But I know someone who can.

629
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:51,305
Ra's al Ghul.

630
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:53,573
How do you know
that name?

631
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:55,475
Well, I didn't.

632
00:36:55,477 --> 00:36:59,329
Until you mentioned
Nanda Parbat.

633
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:03,150
The League of Assassins,
however twisted their aims,

634
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:07,904
believes very deeply
in a code of honor.

635
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:11,625
Your undertaking
betrayed that code.

636
00:37:11,627 --> 00:37:13,059
You told Ra's
I'm still alive?

637
00:37:13,061 --> 00:37:15,495
He was so grateful to hear it.

638
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:19,899
Because he so very much
wants to kill you himself.

639
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:23,754
So my advice to you, Malcolm...

640
00:37:23,756 --> 00:37:26,556
Run.

641
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:34,214
This isn't
finished, Moira.

642
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:58,622
Who are you?

643
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:00,040
Merely a follower.

644
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,808
Of who?!
My brother.

645
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,443
Did he give you
the mirakuru?

646
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:04,778
Did he inject you with it?!

647
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,964
No. He saved me with it.

648
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:21,521
No.

649
00:39:21,523 --> 00:39:23,857
Please.

650
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:26,827
Please!

651
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:29,045
Please.

652
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:46,480
Oliver!
Oliver!

653
00:39:46,482 --> 00:39:48,899
Oliver!
Oliver!

654
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:53,720
Is he alive?

655
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:55,388
His pulse is weak,
but it's there. Oliver!

656
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,240
Can you hear me?

657
00:39:57,242 --> 00:39:59,993
His pupils are dilated!

658
00:39:59,995 --> 00:40:01,828
What the hell
was that?

659
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,930
I don't know,
it's coded.

660
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,118
Damn it. Damn it!

661
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,504
I can't break into
the dispensary files.

662
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:12,088
I have no idea
what he was injected with!

663
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,924
Poisoned with.

664
00:40:13,926 --> 00:40:15,775
All right, we have no choice.
What are you doing?

665
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:17,294
Calling 9-1-1.

666
00:40:17,296 --> 00:40:18,428
Dig, wait!
Can't wait!

667
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,597
How are we supposed
to explain this?

668
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,081
Everyone's going to find out
Oliver's the Vigilante!

669
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,517
Which won't matter
if he's dead.

670
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,418
Felicity, we can't save him!

671
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,803
I know, you're right...

672
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:29,773
We can't.

673
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:40,534
One way to Central City.

674
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:42,652
It left
ten minutes ago.

675
00:40:42,654 --> 00:40:44,738
Of course it did.

676
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,156
When is the next one?

677
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:47,591
In the morning.

678
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:06,509
Ahh.

679
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,145
Ohh.

680
00:41:56,644 --> 00:42:00,146
Please save my friend.

681
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:05,171
