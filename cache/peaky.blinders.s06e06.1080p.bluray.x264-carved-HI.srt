passed away four years ago,</i>

<i>Tommy and I
haven't even spoken.</i>

I'm very much looking forward

8
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:15,857
to working with you again,
Michael.

- To Canada,

to collect payment
for the shipment.

15
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,641
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman,

16
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,801
to have each day what
I have only sampled once.

A daughter lost. A son found.

This is my son.
They call him Duke.

21
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:43,521
It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

- How long?
- Perhaps 18 months.

26
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,601
towards me, Gina?

And if you lie, I will know.

28
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,961
It is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.

29
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:25,217
MICHAEL: <i>It was the ambitions
and strategies of one man</i>

30
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,321
<i>that caused this.</i>

31
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,881
<i>I will take revenge
on Tommy Shelby.</i>

Do you want a drink first
or a whore first?

33
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,761
I want to see my wife first.

34
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,441
After you've fucked your wife,

35
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:10,921
you're going to kill a man,
right?

You're not so good at lying
any more, Tommy.

These days,
the truth gets in your eyes.

47
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,321
I have to go to Canada, Lizzie.

48
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,161
I need to know
where you will go.

You don't fight it.

You are cursed, Tommy.

52
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:52,161
Never to understand the limits
that other people will accept.

53
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:57,201
Never to be allowed in
where everybody else is.

54

A curse never to be lifted.

55

I will be away, Lizzie.

I know a place where...

Always gone, always away.

58

Well, now your rings are gone,

Mum, where are you going?

68
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,561
A hotel.

69
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:27,521
And then your father
will get me a house.

70
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:35,841
Mum, I'll come with you.

71
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,561
I'd rather be with you.

Oh, Charles, love...

would allow that.

I'll arrange that place.

you can take him, eh?

They have stables
at this new place.

After a while,
he'll... he'll listen to you.

86
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,161
He'll forget about Ruby.

when they were taking care

or may not...

166
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,401
...love me...

167
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:20,441
...to have to see me crawl...

168
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:24,441
...or grow insane and helpless.

169
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:27,721
It would be a cruelty to me
and to them.

170
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:34,681
By the time people know
the truth, I will be gone.

171
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:38,161
What about Lizzie?

172
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,081
I have some papers
I need you to sign

173
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,481
on behalf of the company.

174
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:44,921
Told Lizzie?

175
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,801
I'm working
with the housing minister.

176
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,801
I will be allocating contracts,

177
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,281
construction contracts
worth £10 million.

178
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,121
You haven't told Lizzie?

179
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:55,961
Some of the contracts
I will be allocating

180
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,697
are with companies
in which we have an interest.

181
00:11:57,721 --> 00:12:00,481
Fuck you and your contracts!

182
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,641
So the Shelby Company Limited
will continue

183
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,081
to earn money.

184
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:07,761
But mostly, Arthur, I'm doing
it because it's a good thing.

185
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:11,081
- Building houses.
- Oh...

186
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:12,801
Yeah, for ordinary
working people...

187
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:14,561
Oh, yeah, good for you.
Fuckin'...

188
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,441
...in the interests
of a fairer future.

189
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:21,881
And before that,
I will be going to Canada

190
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,681
to collect payment
for the shipment - £5 million!

191
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:26,481
Oh, five fucking million?

192
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:29,961
Which I will share
among the Shelby family.

193
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:33,681
And that will be my legacy.

194
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:36,001
Instead of me,
there will be money.

195
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,241
Because for most
of the people

196
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:40,481
who are close to me,
that is what I am!

197
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:43,201
Fucking money.
That is my agency.

198
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:45,441

eh?

199

Hmm?

I'll tell you where.
It'll be a wagon.

Well, Finn here never even

You said something
about the truth.

Truth. The truth is...

265

that I can trust...

I will be going away.

I have a job for you all.

I need you
to go to Arrow House.

00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:10,361
I will be leaving Arrow House
for good.

There is cash,
there are valuables.

00:52:19,961 --> 00:52:20,961
Let's go.

661
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:30,401
I'll go with Tommy.

662
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:31,921
You boys follow behind.

663
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:42,201
Ah, shit. Forgot my cigarettes.

664
00:54:35,241 --> 00:54:36,521
Mum...

665
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:40,881
...it's done.

666
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:45,161
It's over.

667
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:49,441
And may God forgive me.

668
00:55:23,481 --> 00:55:27,241
Johnny! Johnny, where are you?

669
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:31,601
I switched the ticker
like you said, Tom.

670
00:55:35,841 --> 00:55:38,241
Tell me I've done
a good thing here, Tom.

671
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:51,201
Goodbye, Michael.

672
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:52,721
Goodbye, Johnny.

673
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:56,561
You're a good man.

674
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:03,721
I'm gonna go look at the fog,
Tom.

675
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:11,161
Speak to me.

676
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:14,241
Speak to me, Michael.

677
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:19,001
You killed her.

678
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:20,521
Polly made her own choices,

679
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:21,801
- Michael.
- No...

680
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:24,241
No-one close to you

681
00:56:24,361 --> 00:56:26,561
makes a choice
without your opinion, Tom.

682
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:30,161
Not Arthur,

683
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:33,241
not me, not Ada.

684
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:37,841
We can't escape you.

685
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:42,521
Your lethal hand is always
on our shoulders.

686
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:48,761
Polly was half of me.

687
00:56:50,161 --> 00:56:52,081
Still visits me in my dreams.

688
00:56:54,241 --> 00:56:56,081
She'll visit me no more.

689
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:11,441
I have no limitations.

690
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:19,841
ALFIE: I smell the smell
of roasting Irishmen.

691
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:22,041
Oh, yes, hello.

692
00:58:23,281 --> 00:58:25,361
(PLAYS PIANO) I also smell
the smell of tobacco,

693
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:27,041
which is forbidden
in my presence

694
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:28,321
for all except for one -

695
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:30,401
my new wife, Edna.

696
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:34,801
With the Irish being rendered
to smoke and fat,

697
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:37,961
I now own half of Boston, so...

698
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:42,521
...out of respect
for my restored authority...

699
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:46,721
...put the fucking cigarette
out now, Tommy.

700
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:50,281
Hello, Alfie.

701
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,801
I heard it was a good wedding.

702
00:58:51,921 --> 00:58:54,001
Yeah, it was, actually.
Thank you.

703
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:56,481
Edna's from a family circus.

704
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:59,121
So, after the ketubah
and the old swapping of rings

705
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:03,281
and the smashing of glass,
we left aboard elephants!

706
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:04,721
Yeah, it was quite a thing.

707
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,961
They had to shut down
Camden High Street,

708
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:09,241
and even the Gentile
what normally fucking hate me,

709
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:11,121
they waved with their hankies.

710
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:14,401
Justice.

711
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:20,681
And housekeeping. Long overdue.

712
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:22,721
Yeah, look at
that little cunt ascending,

713
00:59:22,841 --> 00:59:25,201
he's ascending to the heavens!

714
00:59:25,321 --> 00:59:27,641
Right in front of us.
Before our very eyes.

715
00:59:27,761 --> 00:59:29,841
I can see with this eye.
I'm not blind.

716
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:32,121
This eye is the eye
of a dead man.

717
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:33,801
Dead men can see through life

718
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:35,721
like it was a curtain
that billows

719
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:37,441
with the flicker of truth
upon it.

720
00:59:37,561 --> 00:59:39,721
And I can see with this eye,
Tommy,

721
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:43,041
that your nephew is ascending,
and he will be forgiven.

722
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,601
Unlike you,

723
00:59:45,721 --> 00:59:47,841
who, on Judgment Day,

724
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:49,721
is probably truly fucked

725
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:51,801
when the other shoe drops.

726
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,321
Hmm?

727
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:58,601
All right, Tommy?
How are you keeping?

728
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:02,201
You know, Alfie...

729
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:06,561
...so many people,

730
01:00:06,681 --> 01:00:08,721
so many times

731
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:10,561
going to so much trouble
to kill me.

732
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,321
I'm fucking dying anyway.

733
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:15,241
We're all dying anyway.

734
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,521
No.

735
01:00:17,641 --> 01:00:20,681
Not a bullet, not a bomb,

736
01:00:20,801 --> 01:00:22,681
not a knife.

737
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:24,961
Is it clap? Is it clap?

738
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:27,761
No, not even that noble.

739
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:29,937
What are you trying to say?

740
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:33,001
I'm about to sign over
half of fucking Camden Town

741
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:34,241
to you as part of this deal.

742
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:38,241
Are you saying you're
just gonna die in your bed?

743
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:41,161
I'm not gonna die in bed,
Alfie. Who fucking dies in bed?

744
01:00:41,281 --> 01:00:43,961
Good people die in their bed,
Tommy. Good people.

745
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:45,521
- Good people, eh?
- Hmm.

746
01:00:46,921 --> 01:00:48,521
Good people.

747
01:00:48,641 --> 01:00:50,401
And yet here we are, Alfie.

748
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,761
After all this time,
just you and me.

749
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:58,081
And I crossed the line.

750
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:02,921
Michael.

751
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:06,481
Polly.

752
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:10,481
Ruby.

753
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:18,761
Tommy, if you are about
to express profound emotion,

754
01:01:18,881 --> 01:01:21,041
you might be better served
expressing it

755
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:23,681
to someone
who gives a fuck

756
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:26,921
or perhaps to somebody
who is being paid

757
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,881
to pretend to have to.

758
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:33,161
Like a fucking nurse.
Or a priest! Someone.

759
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:37,641
And as for death,

760
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:40,081
speaking as someone
who has been dead

761
01:01:40,201 --> 01:01:42,321
for a number of years,

762
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:44,361
I can only
heartily recommend it.

763
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:50,241
Well, Alfie,
your opera is complete.

764
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,241
Shall we go
and witness the final act?

765
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:47,481
Whenever you're ready, boys.

766
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:32,201
That's enough.
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

767
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:35,121
Thank you all for coming.

768
01:03:37,361 --> 01:03:39,081
Well, at least I can say that,
er...

769
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:42,401
...I am one of those
rare politicians

770
01:03:42,521 --> 01:03:44,201
who actually makes good
on his promises.

771
01:03:46,601 --> 01:03:48,361
Country estate -

772
01:03:48,481 --> 01:03:52,681
requisitioned to make way
for houses for working people.

773
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:55,841
I improved my own home
with good intentions

774
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:58,521
and 1,500lb of dynamite.

775
01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:05,001
Now I'm back where we began...

776
01:04:06,721 --> 01:04:08,361
...with horses and caravans...

777
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:12,761
...vagabonds and thieves.

778
01:04:16,281 --> 01:04:18,361
Frances, sit down, please.

779
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:29,241
I'd like to raise a toast.

780
01:04:30,921 --> 01:04:32,161
A simple toast.

781
01:04:35,561 --> 01:04:36,881
To family.

782
01:04:37,001 --> 01:04:38,601
- To family.
- To family.

783
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:42,921
Sometimes it is shelter
from the storm.

784
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,561
Sometimes it is
the storm itself.

785
01:04:57,921 --> 01:05:00,281
I'm planning on going away
for a bit.

786
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:03,041
After I'm gone...

787
01:05:06,441 --> 01:05:07,521
Ada.

788
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:10,121
...in this family...

789
01:05:11,481 --> 01:05:13,841
...it was you who was born
to be a politician, not me.

790
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:16,921
Remember that.

791
01:05:18,401 --> 01:05:20,841
And if ever a seat
is to become available

792
01:05:20,961 --> 01:05:23,281
in this ugly old city,
you should run.

Where's Arthur?

795
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:29,201
LINDA: He went for a walk
down the river.

796
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:31,481
He said he's not good
at farewells

797
01:05:31,601 --> 01:05:34,081
so he's decided to go
and catch a trout instead.

798
01:05:37,561 --> 01:05:39,201
He told me to tell you that...

799
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,521
"Where you're going, Tommy,
there will I be...

800
01:05:45,721 --> 01:05:48,321
"...very soon. Love, Arthur."

801

How does Arthur know
where you're going, Tommy?

...I want you
to look after your mum.

01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:16,001
You tell her I'm sorry,
you hear me?

807
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:23,401
I want you to be the bes...

808
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:31,721
Exactly how long
are you going away for, Tommy?

809
01:06:42,241 --> 01:06:43,801
Thanks, Curly.

810

01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:17,521
Tommy, you tell me right now,
where are you going?

You have to carry the bucket
on your own this time, Ada.

Tommy, you come to me
with everything.

You always come to me.

Not this time.
Not this one, sister.

Where are you going?
