1
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,529
There's a big gap.

2
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,868
This feels like the only
route, let's keep going.

3
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,042
You okay?

4
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,339
It's all right, kid.
Never be easy.

5
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,800
Okay.

6
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,636
One...  Be careful.

7
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,096
...two, three!

8
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,016
You okay?

9
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,767
Okay.

10
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,895
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:44,938
Never better.

12
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:48,817
Okay.

13
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,616
Whoa, whoa, you're good.  Shit.

14
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,493
You're good. Yeah?

15
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,828
You're good?

16
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,330
No.

17
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,999
Okay, you've done
way scarier than this.

18
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,293
Remember A.J. Hackett,
Snake Dike.

19
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,211
Stupid singing competition.

20
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,629
God, you married
this sad sack,

21
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,715
for Christ's sake.

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,176
Yeah? Okay.  Okay.

23
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,928
One... Two...

24
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,014
Three!

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,683
Come on! I got you.

26
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,893
That's my girl.

27
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,814
Ew! Gross!

28
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,524
You guys, get a room!

29
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,944
Here comes Ethan Hunt.

30
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,238
Careful, H, there's loose
rock around the elbow.

31
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,741
Worry about
your ropes, bitches.

32
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,201
I'm fine.

33
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,913
Try to keep up!

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,385
Taking your time there,
hotshot.

35
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,262
Hunter, you show off!

36
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,052
Dan!

37
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,515
Dan!

38
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,435
Hold on, Dan.
Hold on, I'm coming.

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,936
Dan, are you okay?

40
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,772
Just hold on.
I'm coming down.

41
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,442
Come on. Come on.
I can't make it.

42
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,694
Oh, my God.  Okay, Becky, Becky.

43
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,237
I just need
a little more length.

44
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,322
Can you un-clip?
Are you secure?

45
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,032
Are you secure?  Yeah.

46
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,659
Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.

47
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,619
Just un-clip and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

48
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,538
Okay.  I think I can reach it.

49
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,456
Ready?

50
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,295
Can you reach it?

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,754
Just...
Just one second.

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,381
All right.
I think I can make it.

53
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,008
Hold on, Dan.

54
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,342
I'm almost there.

55
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,552
Just need
a little more momentum.

56
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,304
Okay.

57
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,055
No!

58
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,100
Dan!

59
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,502
Hey!

60
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,669
Hey,
this is Becky and Dan.

61
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,629
Leave a message.

62
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,881
Hey, Becky, it's me.

63
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,760
Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.

64
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,345
But I...

65
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,681
I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.

66
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,434
Sweetheart,
I'm worried about you.

67
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,354
So whenever
you stop hating on me,

68
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,897
I am here.

69
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,554
Hey, what's up?

70
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,391
This is just the voice mail.

71
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,934
You've reached Dan.

72
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,727
Just leave a message,
I'll hit you back when I can.

73
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,355
Get it off at the beep.

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,773
Hey.

75
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,859
Miss you.

76
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,288
Dad, what?
Are you stalking me now?

77
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,914
No, I just don't know
what else to do,

78
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,541
'cause you're not
answering your phone.

79
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,084
Take a hint.

80
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,419
I... I think this is getting
a little bit ridiculous.

81
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,087
"Ridiculous"?

82
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,715
You told me I shouldn't be
so broken up about him,

83
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,842
because he was an asshole.  No.

84
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,844
I said that maybe he didn't
belong on this pedestal

85
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,846
that you were
putting him up on,

86
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,056
that he wasn't this martyr that
you've been making him out to be.

87
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,933
This is how
you console your daughter?

88
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,352
I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.

89
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,481
I don't want to move on.
I miss him!

90
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,775
Every day, I miss the way
he looked at me.

91
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,152
I miss the way
he made me feel.

92
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,194
Sweetie.  Don't!

93
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,487
Don't what?

94
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,239
What do you think
you're doing, Becky?

95
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,116
Getting away from you.
You are not driving. Stop it.

96
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,534
Fuck off!

97
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,202
You don't get to
talk to me like that.

98
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,205
Your mother and I, we
raised you better than that.

99
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,957
So getting shit-faced

100
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,294
and pushing the people away
that love you,

101
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,587
it's not gonna work.

102
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,713
All right, look,

103
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,591
a horrible thing
happened to you,

104
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,843
but you have to start
living your life again.

105
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,345
All right?

106
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,971
There's a whole big wide
world out there that needs you

107
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,890
and believe it or not,
I need you.

108
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,893
Let me give you
a ride home.

109
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,271
I'd rather walk.

110
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,109
Let me ask you something.

111
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,820
If roles reversed,

112
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,698
if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

113
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,700
do you think Dan
is standing out here alone?

114
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,662
Drowning in booze,
grief, sorrow,

115
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,789
whatever the hell this is?

116
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,125
He's not.

117
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,627
And you damn well know it.

118
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,631
God damn it, Becky,
I need you to try.

119
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,177
Do you know
what I need, Dad?

120
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,346
I need you
to leave me alone.

121
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,147
God damn it.

122
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,450
The number you have called
has been disconnected.

123
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,912
No.

124
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,123
No!

125
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,331
Hi!  Hey.

126
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,126
You look, um...

127
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,586
Awful.  Yeah.

128
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,379
Yeah, like
really freakin' awful.

129
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,881
Well, come here.

130
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,721
So, what brings you back?

131
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,389
Are you finally ready
to rest?

132
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,225
I'll rest when I'm dead.

133
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,562
I have something
that's planned.

134
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,230
And I need
a partner in crime.

135
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,944
Look, your dad called me
a few weeks ago.

136
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,696
He didn't know
who else to turn to.

137
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,782
And he said that
you were in a bad place.

138
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,242
He had no right to do
that.  He's worried about you.

139
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,494
It's coming up on a year.

140
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,662
He doesn't want you
to be alone.

141
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,748
Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier

142
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,667
than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there,

143
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,796
is my best friend
stuck in here with him.

144
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,256
So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

145
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,424
You're not gonna like it,

146
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,176
but just try to keep
an open mind.

147
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,427
Look...

148
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,724
The B-67 TV Tower.

149
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,768
It's only a six-hour drive
from here.

150
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,812
I was planning on
climbing it this weekend

151
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,147
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

152
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,778
It would be an adventure,

153
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,988
like old times.

154
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,199
And you could scatter
Dan's ashes on top.

155
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,036
I just...
I haven't climbed since...

156
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,120
I get it.

157
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,082
But if you don't
confront your fears,

158
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,834
you are always
going to be afraid.

159
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,753
What is it that
Dan used to say?

160
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,757
Don't die if you wanna live

161
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,343
or keep living
even if you're dying.

162
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,262
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

163
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,972
No, I'm sorry.

164
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,765
Hunter, I just... I can't.

165
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,853
It's like I know I
can't do it, I'm sorry.

166
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,688
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

167
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,690
I can't.  Hey, hey, it's okay.

168
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,817
It's okay.

169
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,815
Morning, princess.

170
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,403
What's wrong?

171
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,864
"If you're scared of dying,
don't be afraid to live."

172
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,492
That's what Dan used to say.

173
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,913
Let's do it.

174
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,291
Let's climb your stupid tower.

175
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,003
Oh, my God, Becky,
baby, I'm so excited!

176
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,428
I've never
actually seen this video.

177
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,681
Shit, I was really ripped.

178
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,100
Yeah! You're awesome.

179
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,353
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

180
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,065
Aw!

181
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,193
Holy shit!
Look at your beaming face.

182
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,945
Now, who's this
in the photo with you?

183
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,947
I don't know. It's an oldie.

184
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,282
Who is it?  Nobody.

185
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,117
Just give it back.
Hunter has a boyfriend.

186
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,411
It's nothing.
Just some guy.

187
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,081
Oh, that some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

188
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,428
Yo, what's up, guys?

189
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,931
Danger D,
and I'm back stateside, yo,

190
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,808
hashtag, super badass.

191
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,352
Okay, in my defense,

192
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,646
I may act like
a total dick on camera,

193
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,689
but it's worth it.

194
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,190
I get paid for this shit.

195
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,484
It's enough to keep me
traveling and you know me,

196
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,153
I have to be doing dangerous
shit to keep my blood pumping,

197
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,197
so I might as well
monetize that.

198
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,992
I'm just saying if
you're gonna be a YouTuber,

199
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,868
why not be yourself?
You are awesome.

200
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,705
Natural born click-bait.  No.

201
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,791
What we're doing here,
this is clickbait.

202
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,171
Excuse me?

203
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,132
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?

204
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,009
Power ain't free, ma'am.

205
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,178
Oh, and do you know
where the B-67 TV Tower is?

206
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,513
We can't find it on the map.

207
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,891
You don't need a map.

208
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,518
You see that light
way up there?

209
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,896
That's your tower.

210
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,149
That's insanely high.

211
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,902
What's with the light?

212
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:40,778
I thought you said
it was out of commission.

213
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,406
So aircraft can see it.

214
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,992
You know, this was once the
tallest structure in the U.S.

215
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,079
Now it's just this old relic.

216
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,248
They're due to tear it down
next winter.

217
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,084
Becky?

218
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,919
Becky?

219
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,130
What?  Give me
your phone charger.

220
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,299
What are you doing?

221
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,470
A very cool life hack.

222
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,223
Now I'm just gonna
line up the prongs

223
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,434
with the elements in the lamp.

224
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,643
And...

225
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,190
How's that
for a dumb YouTuber?

226
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,253
Hey, honey.

227
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,380
Mm-hmm.  Did you sleep well?

228
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,763
I love you.

229
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,062
You're not gonna say it back?

230
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,481
I am saying it.

231
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,399
One...

232
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,693
Four...

233
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,321
Three...

234
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,657
I love you.

235
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,055
- Hey, come on, Becks.
- Sun's up.

236
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,439
What up, El Capitan?

237
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,526
I don't know, but something's
up, Sports Illustrated.

238
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,610
Tits for clicks.

239
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,908
Are you live streaming?

240
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,994
No, dude.
Shoot now, post later.

241
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,579
Oh, good.
I don't wanna be in it.

242
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,791
Hey, guys. Danger D here

243
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,794
and I have somebody
very special for you to meet.

244
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,173
Say hello, Becky C.  Hi.

245
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,008
And we have something

246
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,761
totally batshit crazy
for you guys today.

247
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,640
The B-67 TV Tower.

248
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,019
This bad boy is
over 2,000 feet tall.

249
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,729
And your homegirls

250
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,523
are gonna be climbing
to the tippy, tippy top.

251
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,068
But don't worry, Becky C,
because you're safe with...

252
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,236
Watch out!

253
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,829
Holy shit!

254
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,957
Eight more lives, baby!

255
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,662
Shit.

256
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,089
Looks like
we're walking from here.

257
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,216
How far?  I don't know.

258
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,679
Like a mile?

259
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,930
Maybe two-ish?

260
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,520
Damn, it's hot.

261
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,897
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

262
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,608
We've got enough water,
you think?

263
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,111
Water's check.
Harnesses check.

264
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,613
Super badass
4K drone check.

265
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,157
Selfie stick,
all the essentials.

266
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,701
Food?

267
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,827
Nah, we'll be back in time
before lunch...

268
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,745
Oh, Jesus.

269
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,750
Holy shit, they're big.

270
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,257
It's still alive.

271
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,633
Get off of him!

272
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,262
Hey! Hey!  Go away!

273
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,930
Just go. Go!

274
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,314
Poor thing.

275
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,694
Pricks.

276
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,197
Survival of the fittest, right?

277
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,160
You'd do the same
if you were starving out here.

278
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,331
"Feeling peckish."  Hunter.

279
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,874
What?

280
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,083
That's funny.

281
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,974
Holy shit, 300 likes.

282
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,434
Oh, wow.

283
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,854
350.

284
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,939
I wonder how many of your
followers are serial killers.

285
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,194
Holy shit.

286
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,822
Looks a lot bigger
up close, right?

287
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,910
This is sick.

288
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,163
This is awful.

289
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,665
Hey, guys!

290
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,834
Danger D here.

291
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,588
And we are at the foot of
this stomach-churningly massive

292
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,132
fourth-highest structure
in the U.S.

293
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,510
We're gonna begin
our grueling journey

294
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,179
with an 1,800-foot
ladder climb

295
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,556
inside a steel cage.

296
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,016
And then after the cage...

297
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,312
...we have a 200-foot,
vertigo-inspiring mast

298
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,939
with an external ladder.

299
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,900
Your girl's gonna be wide open
to the elements.

300
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,903
And then beyond that,
we have the precipice.

301
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,240
The ledge.
The top of the world, Ma.

302
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,366
Hunter?

303
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,747
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

304
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,457
Babe, of course you can.

305
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,251
No, um, I really can't.
I'm, like...

306
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,129
I'm petrified.
I'm, like, shaking.

307
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,256
I'm here.

308
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,758
Take a breath.

309
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,889
After Dan died, I was
afraid of my own shadow.

310
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,058
But I pushed through.

311
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,894
I overcame the fear.
I took control.

312
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,898
Do not let this fear
consume you.

313
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,026
Come at it head on
and kick its ass.

314
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,238
If you can beat it,
you can beat anything.

315
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,783
And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.

316
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,037
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

317
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,707
So shut your shit.

318
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,167
And let's do this.

319
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,962
God, Hunter.

320
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,797
You know,
that's the kind of shit

321
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,466
you should be posting
on Instagram.

322
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,468
Come on.

323
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,224
Dude, this is so cool.

324
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,601
Holy shit.

325
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,646
Look at this.

326
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,774
Damn it, Hunter.
You are such an asshole.

327
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,319
What are you getting us into?

328
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,570
Don't worry.

329
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,697
We've got 50 feet of rope
between us.

330
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,824
We're clipped in
and we're all good.

331
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,327
Okay.

332
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,661
One rung at a time,

333
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,954
and let me know
if you have to rest.

334
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,196
Okay, okay.

335
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,540
See?

336
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,958
It's easy.

337
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,004
Sure.

338
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,633
You're doing great.
Come on.

339
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,554
You okay?

340
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,390
No.

341
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,560
You're doing great.

342
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:15,603
Come on.

343
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,308
Hunter?

344
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,646
Hunter?  Yeah?

345
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,606
Can we rest a moment?

346
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:01,815
I need a drink.

347
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,108
Of course.

348
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,446
Those guy lines means
we're halfway up.

349
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,951
Perfect spot.

350
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,205
Wanna know something crazy?

351
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,457
What?

352
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,125
Halfway up.

353
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,087
That means we've
climbed about 1,000 feet.

354
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,381
So we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

355
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,592
Please don't say
shit like that, Hunter.

356
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,178
Whoa!

357
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,139
There's the motel.
And the diner.

358
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,518
No way. Looks like
a little toy town.

359
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,816
Let's just get this
over with.

360
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,067
Yeah.

361
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:49,863
Come on.

362
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,156
Catch up.

363
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,177
That's it.

364
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,179
Becky, you're doing amazing.

365
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,976
Come on!

366
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,436
Come on, Becky!

367
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,246
Okay.

368
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,874
This is the end
of the internal ladder.

369
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,917
One step at a time, okay.
You got this.

370
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,922
The next 200 feet
is external.

371
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,257
I'm not gonna lie.

372
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,759
It's gonna get
a little bit crazy

373
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,385
when we're out of the cage
in the open.

374
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,511
But don't panic.

375
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,900
Hunter.

376
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,443
Hunter!

377
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,028
Hunter! Hunter!

378
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,614
Becky! You gotta come up.
It's so sick!

379
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,533
Okay.

380
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,923
Hunter?

381
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,466
I'm here.

382
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,384
It's just like 200 feet more,
that's all.

383
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,886
I can't!

384
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,305
Yes, you can!

385
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,433
Just look up and only up.

386
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,816
You're doing great.
You got this.

387
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,529
Okay.

388
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:54,696
Okay.

389
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,167
Okay.

390
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,482
Yeah! You're killing it!

391
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,655
You're okay.

392
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,825
Remember, only look up.

393
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,333
What the hell are we doing?

394
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,751
Hey!

395
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,378
Stop overthinking.

396
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,255
How?  I don't know.

397
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,924
Concentrate on
something else, like...

398
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,678
Sing a, a nursery rhyme
or some shit.

399
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,725
Okay, okay.

400
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,685
Okay.

401
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,070
Down!

402
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,865
I wouldn't have
picked that one.

403
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,076
Wow.

404
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,870
Okay. Okay, Becks,

405
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,248
this is gonna look a
little bit worse than it is.

406
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,251
Ah, what the hell, Hunter?
Let's just go back down!

407
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,092
Becky, if I let you
go back now,

408
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,594
fear wins.

409
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,180
And I'm not going
to let that happen.

410
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,633
It's okay, Becks.

411
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,761
It's okay.

412
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,262
I've got your weight.

413
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,392
Thanks. Okay.

414
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,202
Reach up.

415
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,245
Okay.  Oh, yeah.

416
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,713
Okay.

417
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,340
Smooth as sailing
to the top now.

418
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,633
You got this.

419
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,304
I actually really
do hate you, Hunter.

420
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,683
Hey, does this ladder
feel loose to you?

421
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,188
Stop, you dick, Hunter!

422
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,190
Sorry.

423
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,450
What was that?

424
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,994
Come on,
we're almost there.

425
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,583
Come on.  Okay.

426
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,655
Wow.

427
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,453
Becky, you're not gonna
believe this.

428
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,913
You gotta come up
here.  I'm coming.

429
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,375
Okay.  Whoo!

430
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,668
Okay.

431
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,508
Hunter.

432
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,892
Hey, trust me.

433
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,395
Okay, okay.

434
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,616
Fuck, Becky!

435
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,618
Oh, I'm here.
Oh, my God.

436
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,337
Oh, my God.

437
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,880
We did it, Becks!

438
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,048
I knew you could.

439
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,448
Here we go!

440
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,121
On top
of the goddamn world!

441
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,544
Do you wanna try?

442
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,881
Shit! Hunter, stop!

443
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,716
Just focus on
getting a good shot.

444
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,676
I didn't wear this
stupid bra for nothing.

445
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,969
No.

446
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,137
No, Hunter.  Whoo!

447
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,682
Swoop it around!

448
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,561
Seize your day!

449
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,980
Okay. Oh, my God.

450
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,327
How'd it look?

451
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,913
Insane! Insane. Crazy.

452
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,292
Let's get this bad boy back.

453
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,046
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

454
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,715
Okay. Now the ultimate, Becks.

455
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,008
Your turn.

456
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,890
What? No.

457
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,892
Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?

458
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,437
No. No, Hunter.

459
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,522
The old Becky
would have done it.

460
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,276
Just saying...  Dude.

461
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,779
Here. I'll hold your hand.

462
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,245
Okay.  Yeah?

463
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,247
Okay.

464
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,040
Shit.

465
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,708
Come on, come on!

466
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,586
You can do this.

467
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,507
You can do it.

468
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,927
Okay, okay, okay.

469
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,013
I got you.  Okay.

470
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,515
Okay. Whoa!

471
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,058
You can trust me.  Whoa, okay.

472
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,018
I've got you,
Becks.  Oh, my God.

473
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,562
Careful over the ledge.

474
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,399
Take it easy.

475
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,151
Okay, I've got you.
I've got you.

476
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,951
Open your eyes.

477
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,580
Whoo-hoo!

478
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,964
Okay, just one more.

479
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,595
You're coming up right now.

480
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,809
My God, you did it.

481
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,895
You did it!
You did it, you idiot.

482
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,859
Yes! Look.

483
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,153
Look how amazing
these are.  Oh, my God.

484
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,238
Whoa!

485
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,745
Next time you are
ever afraid of anything,

486
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,621
I want you to look at these

487
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,707
and know that you have
nothing to be afraid of.

488
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,003
Thank you.  Yeah.

489
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,588
I'm really proud of you.

490
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,132
Dan would be, too.

491
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,262
Yeah.

492
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,522
Okay.

493
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,191
Okay, it's time.

494
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,063
You and I were one, Dan.

495
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,691
And whenever
I needed a laugh,

496
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,487
you told me
one of your shit jokes.

497
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,577
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on,

498
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,870
it was yours.

499
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,251
And now you're gone
and I'm...

500
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,840
I don't feel whole anymore.

501
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,932
I miss you, um,
just so much and I'm...

502
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,227
I love you.

503
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,063
Goodbye, Dan.

504
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,832
Hey.  I'm sorry.

505
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,545
I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.

506
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,422
Yeah.

507
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,424
I've just been
so far away for so long.

508
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,178
It just didn't really
feel real until then.

509
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,684
Come on.

510
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:54,898
Let's get back down
on earth, okay?

511
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,816
I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.

512
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,985
I've needed to pee since
we passed the Eiffel Tower.

513
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,821
Okay?

514
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,115
Okay, home time.

515
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,533
Home time.

516
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,660
Harnesses?  Harnesses.

517
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,792
Think of the ice-cold
beers waiting for us.

518
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,294
Oh, stop.

519
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,257
I've got you.  Okay, slowly.

520
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,592
Okay.

521
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,385
Uh, I'm just getting
a stitch here.

522
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,137
Okay, okay.

523
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,114
Okay.

524
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,007
Hunter!

525
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,477
No!

526
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,031
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, holy shit.

527
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,786
Don't let go.  Yeah, I got you.

528
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,870
Hunter!

529
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,214
Oh, God,
please don't drop me.

530
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,137
Don't drop me.

531
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:02,400
Becks?

532
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,365
I've got you, Becks.

533
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,995
I can see the ladder.

534
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,261
I've got you.

535
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,017
I just died almost.

536
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,981
Oh, my God.

537
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,525
Did that really just happen?

538
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,736
Oh, my...  Jesus Christ!

539
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,112
I wish we'd filmed that.

540
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,574
Oh, you're here.

541
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,785
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.

542
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,244
Yeah.

543
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,287
Okay, take two.

544
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,256
Oh, no.

545
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,842
The ladder.

546
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,177
It's gone.

547
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,822
Hunter, how do we get down?

548
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,281
Shit!

549
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,075
Please tell me there's
a way to go down.

550
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,702
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.

551
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,578
No.  Oh, no.

552
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,163
No, no, no.

553
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,541
Um, there must be something.

554
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,836
No. Shit.

555
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,587
I don't have a signal.

556
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,341
I don't get it, either.

557
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,010
I'm sure there's something,

558
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,554
I'm sure it's just
really spotty up here.

559
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,097
No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.

560
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,682
We're gonna be okay.

561
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,058
Freaking out is not gonna
help anything right now.

562
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,393
So just take a breath.

563
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,936
We're stuck on
a pizza-sized platform

564
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,521
in the middle of nowhere,
Hunter.

565
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,982
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

566
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,276
It's not gonna help, okay.

567
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,360
It's okay.

568
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,740
I'm sure we can...  Wait,
Hunter. Hunter, Hunter.

569
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,907
Look at this.

570
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,909
Oh, my God.

571
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,871
Binoculars. Amazing.  Okay.

572
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,247
We have a flare.

573
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,331
Okay.

574
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,251
Okay.

575
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,502
This is great news.  Okay.

576
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,680
Oh, shit,
our bag is down there.

577
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,517
Oh, man,
our water's in there.

578
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,645
Shit, we're gonna
die of thirst.

579
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,272
No. No.  We don't have water.

580
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,940
No, think about it...
The noise!

581
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,275
That is how you die
when you're stranded.

582
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,943
The noise that this thing made
when it crashed,

583
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,738
there is no way
nobody heard that.

584
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,948
Okay? I'm...
I'm sure that there

585
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,118
are like multiple calls to 911
as we speak.

586
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,370
Do you really think so?

587
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,747
Yeah.

588
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:03,790
Yeah, the cavalry
is coming, okay?

589
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,000
We just...
We just have to wait.

590
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,211
Okay. Okay.

591
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,798
Holy...

592
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,299
What? What?  Becky, your leg.

593
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,926
My God.

594
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,804
What the hell?

595
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,889
I didn't even notice this.

596
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,599
Whoa!

597
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,393
Um, whoa!  Come here.
Let's compress it.

598
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,145
Are you okay? I know.
Ow! It really hurts.

599
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,647
Can you just like...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

600
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,148
Can you warn me?  Okay.

601
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,983
Count of three?  Yeah. One...

602
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,945
Two... Sorry.
I'm really sorry.

603
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,446
I know.  Oh, man.

604
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,323
Are you okay?

605
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,617
Yeah, I know I'm like,
I'm okay. It's like...

606
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,624
I really have to pee.

607
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,334
Just go.  No.

608
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,503
Just pee.  No, it's
fine. I can hold it.

609
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,296
I just need
to get comfortable.

610
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,807
Can you go any farther?

611
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:05,017
It's, like, spraying.

612
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,894
Okay, careful over
the ledge.  I'm trying.

613
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,896
Stop looking at me.

614
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,899
Oh, God. That's a relief.

615
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,611
I'm just grateful
you didn't need to shit.

616
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,738
Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable,

617
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:19,740
'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.

618
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:22,743
All right.

619
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,292
All right!

620
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,258
Do you really think
someone's coming?

621
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,678
One million percent.

622
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:24,597
Hey, Danger D,
what's happening, guys?

623
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,558
I'll tell you what's happenin',
Becky C.

624
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:32,396
We are stuck at the top of a
2,000-foot tower with no way down.

625
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,274
And I shot some of the best
goddamn footage of my life.

626
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,151
And no way to upload it.

627
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,653
That's what worrying you
about the situation?

628
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,614
It's quite ironic.

629
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,616
Well, don't worry, you'll
still be famous if you fall,

630
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,785
as the girl who died
taking a selfie.

631
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,787
Now, that is ironic.

632
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,414
I would like to be remembered
for my life, not my death.

633
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,375
Thank you very much.

634
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,168
Hashtag, life over death.

635
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,671
Hashtag,
Becky's a dick hole.

636
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,547
Hashtag, Hunter says

637
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,966
she's doing this YouTube
thing for the money,

638
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,301
but really I think
she's just like a "like" whore.

639
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,511
It's not like that.

640
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,513
Okay, what is it like then?

641
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,765
Come on, show us who you are.

642
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,975
Show us Shiloh Hunter.

643
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,560
Tell us why you vlog.

644
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,982
Okay, firstly,

645
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,274
you're an asshole.

646
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,610
Hmm.  Yeah.

647
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,778
Secondly,

648
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,739
um...

649
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,786
And this is
gonna sound stupid,

650
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,373
but I do this because of Dan.

651
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,755
What happened...

652
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,299
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

653
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:48,848
And I want to spread that
message, that life is short,

654
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,016
too short.

655
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,352
So, you gotta use every moment.

656
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,814
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

657
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,951
That was amazing.

658
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,581
Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.

659
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,333
That was really great.

660
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,672
Should I kill Danger D?

661
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,675
I'll help you
bury the body.

662
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,569
Oh, shit.

663
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,237
There's like
an old RV thing down there.

664
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,572
Can I see?

665
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,616
Just past the gate,
a little over.

666
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:51,911
Yeah.

667
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:53,954
That looks abandoned.

668
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,458
It's been five hours.

669
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,418
If anyone called 911,
they'd be here by now.

670
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,604
Oh, my God.

671
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,897
Holy shit.

672
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,192
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

673
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,610
but we definitely
did down there.

674
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,112
Remember,
I got all those likes?

675
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,114
Shit.

676
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,949
Okay.

677
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,450
Okay, so we don't know at
what point we lost service.

678
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,952
Maybe it was just up here

679
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,620
because of some
like interference with the...

680
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,288
The broadcast antenna.  Yeah.

681
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,998
I think you're definitely
onto something, Hunter.

682
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,625
Okay, we have
50 feet of rope.

683
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,418
We can try to fish
for coverage.

684
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,629
I just need something
to secure this with.

685
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,965
My hair tie.  Yeah, perfect.

686
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,049
Okay.

687
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,385
Okay.

688
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,886
Can you message
emergency services?

689
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,221
I don't think so.

690
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,305
But I have
over 60,000 followers.

691
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,765
Okay.

692
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:02,106
"Help us. Stuck on
B-67 Tower. Call 911."

693
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,315
It's ready to post.

694
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,984
We should hear it
when it sends.

695
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,284
Come on, come on.

696
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,702
Okay.

697
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,662
Okay.

698
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,543
Let's see
if I can get lower.

699
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,256
Just be careful.

700
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,633
Got it, okay. Come on.

701
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,515
That's the end.

702
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,559
I didn't hear anything.
I didn't, either.

703
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,144
I don't think it posted.

704
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,065
Okay, maybe I can get lower.

705
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,068
What? What do you mean?
Just...

706
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,153
I've got it.
I've got an idea.

707
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,205
Careful, Hunter.  Feels solid.

708
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,250
Are you okay?  Yeah, I'm okay.

709
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,549
Okay.

710
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,468
Oh, my God.  Shit.

711
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,552
Careful.  Shit.

712
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,221
Oh, my God, Hunter.

713
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,181
Are you okay?  Yeah.

714
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,265
Oh, my God.  Yeah.

715
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,937
Careful. Shit.

716
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,655
I don't hear anything.
Nothing.

717
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,198
Okay, you need
to come back up.

718
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,161
Shit.

719
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,836
I got it.

720
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,848
Did it post?

721
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,101
No.

722
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,688
What do we do
now?  I don't know.

723
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,818
Wait, hold on.

724
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,987
We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.

725
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,113
Yeah.

726
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,156
What if we just drop the phone?

727
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,658
Okay, but what if my phone just
shatters into a million pieces?

728
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,368
Not if we reinforce it somehow,

729
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,911
so it doesn't like
the egg drop challenge.

730
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,663
Yeah. Okay, shit.

731
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,624
Um, we just need something
to... To put it in.

732
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,294
Yeah.  This.

733
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,004
It's welded on.

734
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,630
My shoe's too flimsy.

735
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,508
Your shoe?  Yeah, perfect.

736
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,218
Okay, got it.

737
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,682
We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?

738
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,102
Yeah. Okay.

739
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,730
Okay.

740
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,485
We still need something
more substantial.

741
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,321
Oh, Hunter.

742
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:56,822
Your push-up bra.

743
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,325
That is more substantial.  Yeah.

744
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,243
Dying to get
this thing off, anyway.

745
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,621
Thank you, VS.

746
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,292
Okay.

747
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,793
Hope it's strong enough.

748
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,795
Shove it real good.

749
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,216
Okay.

750
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,054
Here goes nothing.

751
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,487
Did it work?

752
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:37,905
I don't know.
I can't tell.

753
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,296
Do you see anything?

754
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,006
No, nothing.

755
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,175
Don't worry.

756
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,260
They're coming.

757
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:10,354
Holy shit!
There's a freaking guy!

758
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,564
What?  Oh, my God. Yes.

759
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,024
And a dog, too.

760
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,028
Hey! Up here!  Hey, help us!

761
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,951
Look, I sent you the
check, man. Come on.

762
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,453
I need that...

763
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,205
Hey!  Hey, boy! Big boy!

764
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,878
Parker.

765
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,215
Come! Come on, boy.

766
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,425
No, no, no, no, no.

767
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:41,844
Shit!

768
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,346
Hey!

769
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,058
Let's go.

770
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,104
God damn it,
they're getting away.

771
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,120
Parker.

772
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,123
He got the shoe.

773
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,958
Hey! Up here!  Look
up here. Please!

774
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:23,510
Hey!  Hey!

775
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,803
He's walking!  Hey!

776
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,520
No, no, no, turn
around!  Turn around!

777
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,938
Right here!

778
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,023
Hey!

779
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,485
Shit! Shit!  Hey!

780
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:43,822
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

781
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,616
Do not fire the flare,
he's not looking.

782
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:46,867
This might be
our only chance.

783
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,119
No, no, no,
he's not looking.

784
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,997
Wait.

785
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,957
Hold on.
There's somebody by the RV.

786
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,043
He's setting up
a grill or some shit.

787
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,294
Okay.

788
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,004
And we'll fire the flare
when the sun goes down

789
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,839
in like...
In like an hour.

790
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,132
We've only got
one shot at this.

791
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,385
Oh, damn.

792
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:06,512
What?

793
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:09,014
They're making ribs.  Oh, no.

794
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,599
And they have
really cold beer.

795
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,767
Don't.

796
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,911
These guys
are definitely a couple.

797
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,622
Dirty weekend away.

798
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,998
I'm jealous.

799
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,060
Hey, hey, hey.
They're finishing up.

800
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,645
It's now or never,
fire the flare.

801
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,730
Is it dark enough?  Uh-huh.

802
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,024
Okay.

803
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,526
Shit.  Shit. What the hell?

804
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,236
Why isn't it
firing?  I fired it.

805
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,071
I cocked it, maybe there's
a safety or something?

806
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,864
Shit. Okay, they're
going in, they're going in.

807
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,032
You have to do the
flare now.  I'm trying.

808
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,284
Get it to go.  It's stuck.

809
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:11,868
Okay, I got it. I got it.

810
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,835
Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.

811
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,212
Okay, give me your phone.  Okay.

812
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,009
Hey, sons of bitches,
up here!

813
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,261
Holy shit! Check this out.

814
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:31,847
Up here! Hey!

815
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:32,931
Wait, wait, wait,
they're looking at us.

816
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,141
What?  They can see us.

817
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,392
Oh, my God!

818
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,727
Holy shit! Oh, my God,

819
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:39,062
let me see, let me see,
let me see.

820
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,897
Oh, my God,
they're coming.

821
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,941
Hey!

822
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,155
Holy shit,
they found the car.

823
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,032
They found our car,
they found our car.

824
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,119
They have a... A crowbar.

825
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,537
They're probably
gonna open the gate.

826
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,123
Okay.  Okay.

827
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,458
Wait, what the hell?

828
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,792
Wait, what's going on?

829
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,878
They stopped.  What?

830
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,130
Quit chatting,
go open the freakin' gate.

831
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,966
No. No, no, no.
What the hell?

832
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,217
They're stealing
my freakin' car!

833
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:10,427
What?

834
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,596
No, you sons of bitches!  Hey!

835
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,681
You asshole!
What the hell?

836
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,600
No! I need to see it!

837
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:22,564
Oh, my God. No, no!  Die,
you freakin' assholes!

838
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,034
Okay. New rule.

839
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,371
If somebody
falls off the tower,

840
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,331
they bring the cell phone
with them.

841
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,542
And call for help
on the way down.

842
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,629
And maybe post that video.

843
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,717
Kidding, ish.

844
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,555
Yeah, my leg.

845
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,974
I could eat aspirin
like Skittles right now.

846
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,102
Yeah.

847
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,854
It's looking a little funky.

848
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,647
Could use
some washing, here.

849
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,535
I'm sorry.

850
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,255
We'll just
keep it wrapped up.

851
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,384
What's wrong?

852
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,432
Dan could never say
the words, "I love you."

853
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,270
1-4-3.

854
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,443
1-4-3.

855
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,159
Becky, I...  How long?

856
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,081
Four months.

857
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:52,172
It was a huge mistake.

858
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:56,092
I'm sorry,
I am so, so sorry.

859
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,512
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

860
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,722
For falling in love
with the same guy.

861
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,006
Who made the move?

862
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,133
Both super drunk.  Who?

863
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,263
He did.

864
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:47,269
But it was a huge,
huge mistake, Becks.

865
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,690
No.

866
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,360
A mistake is a kiss.
A one-night stand.

867
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,239
You said you loved him, so...

868
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,202
It got out of hand.

869
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:09,124
I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him. I mean...

870
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:12,294
He listened to me,
he was...

871
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:14,212
He was just different
than every other douchebag

872
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,672
that I'd ever dated and...

873
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,676
And I'd never
felt that way before.

874
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,555
And then you asked me
to be your maid of honor

875
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,181
and it all hit me
like a ton of bricks,

876
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:26,850
how messed up
this all was.

877
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,187
I loved him,

878
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,692
but I love you more,
so I ended it.

879
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,198
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

880
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,535
And after Dan died, I...

881
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,830
I just didn't
have the strength

882
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,123
to be there for you.

883
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,542
To be strong enough
for you, so...

884
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:54,878
So, I ran away.

885
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,757
And now you hate me
and I don't blame you,

886
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,426
and now we're stuck on
this stupid, freaking tower

887
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,345
in the middle
of freaking nowhere.

888
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,889
And it's all my fault.

889
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,685
I am so, so sorry.

890
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,303
What's that?

891
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,806
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

892
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,643
It's been 24 hours.

893
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,690
I think it's time to accept

894
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,567
that either your 60,000
followers don't give a shit

895
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:44,029
or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.

896
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,531
Okay.

897
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,743
Well, we've got one
more shot. Your phone.

898
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:51,703
Yeah, no padding
this time, though.

899
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,455
Even less of a chance.

900
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,956
And if this fails we
really don't have any hope.

901
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,795
How long till
we die of thirst?

902
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:03,590
It's just killing me
that our water

903
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,842
is just right down there
in that bag.

904
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,055
Yeah, with the drone.

905
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,223
We could've used that
to get help.

906
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,560
We could have flown it back to our
motel with a good old fashioned note.

907
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,859
Wait, maybe I can get it.

908
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,737
What do you mean?

909
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,363
You said it was too smooth.
No footholds.

910
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:28,865
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday,

911
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,409
I think the rope was
long enough to reach it.

912
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,955
Are you serious?  Yeah.

913
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,584
Yeah, I seriously think
I can get it.

914
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,303
Hunter, I don't think
this is a good idea.

915
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:53,181
Becky, I don't think
we have a choice.

916
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,350
Every hour that passes,
the weaker we get.

917
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,689
Besides...

918
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,900
Maybe you'll get lucky
and I'll fall.

919
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:15,912
Hunter.

920
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:20,750
Be careful.

921
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:24,921
I'm sorry, Becks.

922
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,757
I love you.

923
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,104
Okay.

924
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,073
Are you okay?

925
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,117
Yeah.

926
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,953
Yeah, all good.

927
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,545
Okay.

928
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:13,636
Okay.

929
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:22,812
Hunter, careful.

930
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,732
Shit.

931
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,194
I can't quite reach it.

932
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,403
Just come back up.

933
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,155
We'll attach it lower.  Come on.

934
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,157
Shit.

935
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,370
I think I can
drop myself lower.

936
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,372
What?

937
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,833
What the hell
are you doing, Hunter?

938
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,169
Hunter!

939
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:55,178
Shit.

940
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,563
I think I can swing
to it.  Hunter, no!

941
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,982
Hunter! Come back up!

942
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,234
Hunter, no!

943
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,526
Hunter!

944
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,493
Are you okay?

945
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:21,746
Yeah.

946
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,753
Is there a way down?

947
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,798
No. The ladder ripped
all the way off.

948
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,227
Water.

949
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:50,525
Oh, my God.  Wait, Hunter.

950
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,902
How are you gonna
get back on the rope?

951
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,118
Shit.

952
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,997
Can... Can you reach it?

953
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,721
Oh, my God.

954
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:35,945
Shit.

955
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,618
You okay?  Yeah.

956
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,329
I have an idea.

957
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:55,590
Okay.

958
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:57,842
I'm gonna try
to hook it on with this,

959
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,553
and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.

960
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,056
Okay?  That's amazing.

961
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,308
That's some good
MacGyver shit right there.

962
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,339
Oh, come on. Please.
Come on.

963
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,511
You did it!  Okay.

964
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:44,847
Okay. I'm gonna
jump onto this.

965
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,141
I'm gonna need
your help to pull me up.

966
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,434
Okay.  Get ready, Becks.

967
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:51,229
Okay.  Okay.

968
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:52,397
Okay.

969
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,777
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

970
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:08,913
Shit.

971
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,207
Hunter, are you okay?
You okay?

972
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,546
Okay. I'm okay.

973
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,464
Let's do this
fast and quick, Becky.

974
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,924
Work together to pull me up.

975
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,428
Okay.  I climb, you pull.

976
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,848
Okay? Okay, now!

977
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,046
I can almost
reach the ladder.

978
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,303
Almost there, Becks.

979
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:13,936
Okay.

980
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,512
Becky! I landed on the bag!

981
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,514
Oh, my God...
Are you okay?

982
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:53,184
I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.

983
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,269
You're gonna
have to pull me up, okay?

984
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,521
Okay. Okay.

985
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,442
I got you.

986
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,273
Oh, shit.

987
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,528
Oh, no. Are you okay?

988
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:48,030
Shit. I thought
you died there.

989
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:50,741
I'm not going anywhere, Becks.

990
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,535
Yeah, that was scary.

991
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:01,877
We should ration it.  Okay.

992
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:03,129
You're right.

993
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,716
Is there any food in there?

994
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,093
No, it's just
your cherry lip balm.

995
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,429
I don't think
you can eat that.

996
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,723
Okay. It's getting dark.

997
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:16,225
I think it's now or never
on that drone.

998
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:20,104
I guess we need to...
We need to write a note.

999
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,356
Okay, the receipt
from the diner.

1000
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:25,985
A pen... Do you have a
pen?  Eye liner in here.

1001
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,403
Aren't you glad
I brought up makeup now?

1002
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:31,991
"Help.

1003
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:37,413
"Stuck on top of B-67 Tower.
Call 911."

1004
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,541
Yeah, perfect.

1005
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,922
Okay. See that?

1006
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,467
That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.

1007
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,927
It leads to the motel.

1008
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,929
Let's do this while
we still have light.

1009
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,893
Okay.

1010
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:03,981
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the road.

1011
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,192
Let it drift down
as it goes.  Okay.

1012
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,666
Okay.

1013
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:24,001
Okay, we're almost
past the gate.

1014
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,252
Oh, my God.

1015
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:26,796
No, no, no. The battery.  What?

1016
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,839
It's running out
of juice.  Oh, shit.

1017
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,342
Hit retrieve.
Or has it gone too far?

1018
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,344
Is it gonna make it?
There's no chance!

1019
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,346
Are you sure?  It's
not even at the gate.

1020
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,847
Shit. It's dropping.

1021
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:37,807
Hit retrieve, hit
retrieve...  Hunter.

1022
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:38,891
...hit retrieve.  Okay.

1023
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,852
It's coming back.  Fly it up.

1024
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,354
Give it the best shot
to get back to us.

1025
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,106
Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.

1026
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,026
Just get it higher!  I'm trying.

1027
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,696
We'll grab it
when it gets close.

1028
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:52,780
Okay.

1029
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,119
Okay.
We've got this.

1030
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:00,955
Get it, Becks, get it.

1031
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,502
Nice! Good job.

1032
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,851
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

1033
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,352
Maybe just turn it off

1034
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,062
and once it's rested,
it will have more juice.

1035
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,690
It's never gonna
be enough. Hunter.

1036
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,034
What are we gonna do?

1037
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,412
Hey, we're not
gonna panic.

1038
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,831
We're gonna stay calm.

1039
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,791
We're gonna
figure it out, okay?

1040
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,042
There's gotta be a way.

1041
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,631
Are we gonna die?

1042
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:54,592
No.

1043
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,260
No, we're gonna be okay.

1044
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,082
Hunter. Hunter...

1045
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,752
Where are you? Hunter...

1046
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:38,219
Hunter...

1047
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:41,639
Hunter, where are you?

1048
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,728
Hunter. Hunter!

1049
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:51,834
Becky, it's okay.

1050
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,920
You just had a bad dream.

1051
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:57,006
You're nice and safe,

1052
01:17:57,131 --> 01:18:00,426
2,000 feet up
in the middle of nowhere.

1053
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,103
I have an idea.

1054
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:12,730
How to charge the drone.

1055
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,858
Your dumb life hack.

1056
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,861
Becky, you freakin' genius.

1057
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,495
I think it's light
enough now. Let's do it.

1058
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,100
Okay, it's a standard
bulb fitting,

1059
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:51,769
but it's gonna be hot.

1060
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,854
It's 30 feet but it's
gonna feel like 1,000.

1061
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,319
Is your leg okay?  Yeah.

1062
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,571
It smells,
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

1063
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:03,572
It's fine.

1064
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,574
Okay.

1065
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:10,913
You can do this.

1066
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,215
Yeah!  Yeah.

1067
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,470
Keep going, Becky.

1068
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,559
You got this, Becky.

1069
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:44,613
I can't.

1070
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:45,990
It's okay, it's okay.

1071
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,992
I can't.

1072
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,994
You can do it, Becky.

1073
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,286
You got it.

1074
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:56,333
It's okay.

1075
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,794
It's just like pole dancing.

1076
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:01,422
Um... Okay, Cherry Pie.

1077
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:29,658
Yes!

1078
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:36,874
You did it,
my little cherry pie.

1079
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:38,042
Good job!

1080
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,463
Okay.  Yeah!

1081
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,673
You did it,
cherry pie!

1082
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,052
All right. All right.

1083
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:50,929
Okay. Okay.  Remember, it's hot.

1084
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:54,850
Be careful.

1085
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,788
Okay, just think back
to the diner.

1086
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,248
You're gonna want to line
the prongs of the charger

1087
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,542
with the elements
of the bulb socket.

1088
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,092
I don't think
it's long enough.

1089
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,927
I think the back prong
doesn't reach.

1090
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,678
Okay, you're gonna need

1091
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,681
something small and metal to
carry the current, like a...

1092
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:38,060
Like a screw or something
that you can jam in there.

1093
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:40,854
There isn't
anything.  Jesus. Um...

1094
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,177
It's working!
It's freaking working!

1095
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:14,263
Holy shit, my hero!

1096
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:16,765
Okay, we're gonna need
a full charge.

1097
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,518
I don't know.
It just has four lights.

1098
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,645
Okay, we have to
charge it all the way.

1099
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,480
Give ourselves the best shot.

1100
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:24,982
You gonna be okay?

1101
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:26,316
Yeah.

1102
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,568
I got this.

1103
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,057
You okay?

1104
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:01,643
Yeah.

1105
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:03,020
Hang in there, Becks.

1106
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:06,064
Past halfway.

1107
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:28,587
Get off of me!

1108
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:39,514
It's okay, it's okay,
Becky. You've got it.

1109
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,643
Three lights.

1110
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,024
Come on, Becky,
you're so close.

1111
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:58,033
Get the hell away
from me!

1112
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:05,165
You did it!

1113
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,047
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

1114
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,762
Why didn't you
catch the bag?  Uh...

1115
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,889
Babe, you okay?

1116
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:31,441
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

1117
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,111
Checkout, 10:00 a.m.

1118
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:35,737
Just a couple of hours.

1119
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,393
You know,
he was right about Dan.

1120
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,186
He was just
trying to help me.

1121
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,941
And I was
so horrible to him.

1122
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:18,530
If there was anyone I
could text, it would be him.

1123
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:19,906
Just to say...

1124
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,076
I'm so sorry.

1125
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:26,955
I love him.

1126
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:35,005
I'm tapping out here.

1127
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:38,342
Stay with me.

1128
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:41,345
Try to keep
your mind occupied.

1129
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,889
Tell me something,
something that...

1130
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:45,974
That you and your dad
used to do together.

1131
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,355
We would watch wrestling.

1132
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:55,859
WWE.  Yeah.

1133
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,028
I forgot you guys
were into that.

1134
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,321
Yeah.

1135
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:01,656
It was our thing,
you know.

1136
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,450
He was always said

1137
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:08,205
I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

1138
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:11,124
I always felt so close to him
when we would watch it.

1139
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,797
Name some of
your favorite wrestlers.

1140
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:23,011
Uh, "Stone Cold"
Steve Austin.

1141
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:26,807
The Rock.

1142
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:30,268
What was Cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing the mask?

1143
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,770
Mankind.

1144
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,689
Mankind.

1145
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,402
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1146
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,404
I didn't.

1147
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,322
Keep going,
you need to stay awake.

1148
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:46,201
Batista.

1149
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:54,000
Okay. It's checkout time.

1150
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:58,839
Okay, here it goes.

1151
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:07,681
Just keep
that shit straight.

1152
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:09,724
Follow the line
of the road.

1153
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,106
Come on,
you son of a...

1154
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,239
I'm past the point
of no return,

1155
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:26,324
so how's the battery?

1156
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,617
Should I retrieve?

1157
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:30,287
No, keep going.

1158
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:35,208
Come on, come on,
just follow the road.

1159
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,258
Oh, shit.

1160
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,349
It's gonna work.

1161
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:01,443
Oh, God.

1162
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:06,281
No.

1163
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,203
Screw your truck.
Get the drone!

1164
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:12,454
Get it!

1165
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,961
No, no, no, no!

1166
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:23,173
Go back! Go back.

1167
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,510
No, no, no. Go back!

1168
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:27,802
Go back!

1169
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:34,309
Fuck, no!

1170
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:25,360
Is that a storm?

1171
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:29,364
It's kind of beautiful
from up here.

1172
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,914
I can't survive
another night.

1173
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,583
Becky, don't talk like that.

1174
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,796
I just...

1175
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:48,174
I just wanna sleep.
You can't sleep.

1176
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,885
The vultures,
they can smell your leg.

1177
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:53,054
They're waiting for you to
give up so they can attack.

1178
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,893
Survival of the fittest.

1179
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:01,855
You need energy.

1180
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,024
We should eat something.

1181
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,026
What?

1182
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:09,446
We're 2,000 feet up in
the middle of the desert.

1183
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,448
There's no food up here.

1184
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:13,074
There's always something.

1185
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:17,871
It's hopeless.

1186
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,294
Let's send
another message.

1187
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:26,630
We can pad the cell
better this time.

1188
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:28,798
With what?  Give me your shoe.

1189
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:31,718
I can't.  Why?

1190
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:34,220
It's not up here, is it?  What?

1191
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:38,516
It's down there.

1192
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,436
It's on your foot.

1193
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:44,105
Yes.

1194
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:52,113
But I'm down there,
remember?

1195
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:58,912
I fell.

1196
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,959
You can't have the shoe,

1197
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:07,295
because I didn't
catch the bag.

1198
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:09,964
I bled out.

1199
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:31,027
You didn't really think your
scrawny ass could pull me up, did you?

1200
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,501
You pulled the bag up.

1201
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:01,307
I guess you were
just too afraid

1202
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:04,728
to realize that
you were up here,

1203
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:07,272
all alone.

1204
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:24,015
Hi, Dad.

1205
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,895
I wanted you to know
that I...

1206
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,272
I found my fight again.

1207
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:36,694
Please leave your message...

1208
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:39,656
I wanna live.

1209
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:43,117
I wanna go home,

1210
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:48,581
but I'm not gonna
make it.

1211
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:56,548
You were right
about everything and I...

1212
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:59,342
I'm sorry, Dad.

1213
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:07,392
By the time you see this...

1214
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:11,271
I'll be gone.

1215
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,072
I love you.

1216
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:58,753
That's it! Fuck!

1217
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:24,612
You need energy.

1218
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:27,198
You should eat something.

1219
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,579
Survival of the fittest.

1220
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:13,286
I can pad the cell
better this time.

1221
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:15,830
Give me your shoe.

1222
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,327
Hunter.

1223
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:51,634
God, I love you.

1224
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:26,794
I'm sorry.

1225
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:28,629
I'm so sorry,

1226
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:30,339
but I really have to make
sure this gets through.

1227
01:39:30,464 --> 01:39:32,300
God, God, I'm sorry.

1228
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:52,964
You can't park here.

1229
01:40:53,089 --> 01:40:56,008
Becky! Becky!

1230
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:03,015
No.

1231
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:06,018
No.

1232
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:10,690
Dad?

1233
01:41:10,815 --> 01:41:11,732
Dad?

1234
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:14,151
Dad!

1235
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:23,244
I thought that was you.

1236
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:26,998
Dad, I love you.
I'm so sorry.

1237
01:41:28,374 --> 01:41:29,750
It's okay.

1238
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:33,170
I just...

1239
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:34,880
I just want you to be okay.

1240
01:41:39,176 --> 01:41:40,886
I am, you know.

1241
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:42,054
I'm gonna be okay.

1242
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:44,724
Really.

1243
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:01,073
Let's go home.

1244
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:06,287
Life is fleeting.

1245
01:42:06,412 --> 01:42:08,497
Life is short.

1246
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:09,957
Too short.

1247
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:13,336
So, you gotta use
every moment.

1248
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:16,589
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

1249
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:18,716
And that shit?

1250
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:22,887
That would spread that
message far and wide.
