1
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,329
Go on! Get him!

2
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,989
- Get him!
- Got you!

3
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,829
- Look out!
- You kids get in here right now!

4
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,904
You're not allowed out after dark!
I thought you were upstairs.

5
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,564
What do you think you are doing?
Get in here.

6
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,178
- What's that?
- Oh, God.

7
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,839
Take the baby, honey. I'll get her.

8
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,348
- Oh, God. Not here.
- Let's go, let's go.

9
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,686
- Hurry.
- Come on, come on. Hurry.

10
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,166
- Harry, please.
- Come on.

11
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,516
Someone's gotta do something
about this.

12
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,129
Look at this shield you have here.

13
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,527
Thanks. Thank you.

14
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,097
Wait, Jay. You didn't make a wish.

15
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,843
What did you wish for, big guy?

16
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,777
- For a little bit of my brother's brains.
- Hey, leave me out of this.

17
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,752
You're not doing so bad
on your own.

18
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,752
Hell, 42 years old, commander
of the motorcycle division.

19
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,918
You're doing pretty damn well
for yourself.

20
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:19,326
Not to mention taking down
that Conway and his hijacking crew.

21
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,229
Dad, Barry and the Crime Lab boys
put us on to Conway.

22
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,165
Sure, the lab boys are important.

23
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,101
But real cops, you know,
work the street...

24
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,208
...facing the scum of the earth,
with nothing to back you up...

25
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,402
...but a gun, a badge and a prayer.
- A gun, a badge and a prayer.

26
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,514
- Okay, Dad.
- Okay, who wants coffee?

27
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,979
- I do.
- Is that for me?

28
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,983
- Just hot water, Mrs. Allen. I brought tea.
- I've got it.

29
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,984
- What is that?
- Korean ginseng.

30
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:46,148
Ginseng? Isn't that some kind
of aphrodisiac?

31
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,287
Yeah, skip the coffee, Mom.

32
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,453
Hey, Mom, give me one of those
ginseng things for Evie and I.

33
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:55,294
- Jay!
- Honey, it's my birthday.

34
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,766
If you teenagers
are done screwing around...

35
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,839
Now, what the hell is the police department
doing about those biker punks?

36
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:06,206
- Yeah, the Dark Riders.
- Shawn, where did you hear that name?

37
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,816
- It was all over the news this morning.
- It just makes my skin crawl.

38
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,009
So, what are we doing
to shut them down?

39
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,847
We can't seem to get
a make on them.

40
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,184
They run over our roadblocks,
disappear like rats down a hole.

41
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,849
Hell, when I was on the force...

42
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,894
...bunch of hoods leaving dead bodies
all over the damn city...

43
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:28,557
Shawn, why don't you take Earl
into the kitchen. Give him a biscuit.

44
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,568
Not until you read my fingerprints.

45
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,205
You got it, pal.

46
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,432
Okay. Come on, boy.

47
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,839
Now, that's enough shoptalk.

48
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,277
- Let's take our cake into the next room.
- Good idea.

49
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,042
I should have married
that nice, quiet accountant.

50
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,778
- How about that dentist, huh, Mom?
- Or the millionaire.

51
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,445
Don't tease your mother, boys.

52
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,422
- Oh, Jay, not tonight.
- No, it's mine.

53
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,788
Iris, Barry tells me you're going
to have a first show.

54
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,867
- That's right. It opens Saturday.
- Well, that's wonderful.

55
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,970
- Yeah.
- Well, what kind of work do you do?

56
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,469
Painting? Sculpture?

57
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,233
Actually, it's mostly
hand-tinted computer graphics.

58
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,706
How graphic?

59
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,641
That was the station.
Crime scene in West Ridge. The Riders.

60
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,576
- I'm going.
- Shooting's over, cowboy.

61
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,216
Nothing left but the mop-up. I gotta go.

62
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,148
- Call me later.
- You bet. Jay, take Iris home for me.

63
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,754
Yeah, no problem.

64
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,789
And big Earl too, huh?

65
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,557
Yeah, I love dog hair in my back seat.

66
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,062
Better run him around the block a couple
times or he'll drive you nuts.

67
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,030
- You be careful out there, honey.
- I will.

68
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,727
What's he gonna do,
stub his toe on a footprint?

69
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,929
Henry.

70
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,231
I didn't mean anything.

71
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,467
Yeah, I know, Dad.

72
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,306
Good night.

73
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,079
Barry!

74
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,845
Don't let the old man get to you.

75
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,958
Every time he starts that "real cops work
the streets," he's taking a shot at me.

76
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,323
You know better. The old man loves you.
He's just blowing off hot air.

77
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,191
- Come on.
- Well, it's Mom too.

78
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,856
I'm just tired of being worried about
for nothing.

79
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,731
Hey, look, you promised the folks
you wouldn't be a street cop.

80
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,396
If I had the brains for lab work,
I'd change jobs with you in a second.

81
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,065
Yeah, I bet you would.

82
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,040
But thanks.

83
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,873
Oh, yeah.

84
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,016
Happy birthday.

85
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,775
You're kidding me.

86
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,184
Hey, I had this in high school.

87
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:36,692
The city relays. I used to wear this
on my letterman's jacket for good luck.

88
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,761
- God, I thought I'd lost it.
- No, I borrowed it.

89
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,265
- Forgot to give it back.
- For 25 years?

90
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,028
Yeah, well.

91
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,365
You're gonna need it
if you're gonna catch those Riders.

92
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,868
- Thanks, Barry. I love you.
- Yeah. You too.

93
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,215
- Hey, what else you have of mine?
- Wait till Christmas.

94
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,919
Take care, buddy.

95
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,948
Linda Park, WCCN News.

96
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,179
Tell us about the assault on the arsenal
and the watchman's murder.

97
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,652
I just got here, and I'm...

98
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,089
Is it true the Riders have taken
automatic weapons and explosives?

99
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,458
- I don't know, but...
- Is there another officer we can speak with?

100
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,622
Well, here comes one now.

101
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:53,667
- You're not with the Homicide department?
- No, Crime Lab.

102
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,331
Wanna film us pouring plaster
into tire tracks?

103
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,876
Cut it. Let's see if we can find
a real detective.

104
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,981
See if you can find us a real newscaster
while you're at it.

105
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,142
I swear she was on that shopping channel
selling earrings last week.

106
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,151
Hey, Steve.

107
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,153
What do we got here?
Better take a sample of these.

108
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,160
The mud might have come out
of a tire tread.

109
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,193
- Better get my rain suit.
- You gonna melt?

110
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:27,203
Hurry up, will you? This whole place
will be washed clean in five minutes.

111
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,984
Hey, Barry. Barry, check this out.

112
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,629
Haven't seen an electrical storm like this
since I was a kid.

113
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,357
Nothing like the storm brewing here.

114
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:59,062
<i>We've set up roadblocks. We have additional</i>
<i>squad cars from neighboring counties.</i>

115
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:03,106
<i>Chief, admit it. The Central City police are</i>
<i>incapable of dealing with this problem.</i>

116
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,042
<i>Now, that's nonsense. The entire</i>
<i>department is working around the clock.</i>

117
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,113
- I hear that.
- <i>And we are forming...</i>

118
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,649
<i>... a special task force made up</i>
<i>of our most experienced men.</i>

119
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,184
<i>I wish them luck,</i>
<i>but I think they're outmatched.</i>

120
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,914
<i>I have complete faith</i>
<i>in my officers, Mr. Kline.</i>

121
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,183
<i>I wish the man on the street</i>
<i>shared that view.</i>

122
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,554
<i>Where'd you get that?</i>
<i>Did you take a poll?</i>

123
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,889
<i>Who needs a poll?</i>
<i>Stand on any street corner</i>...

124
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,194
Forget it. I've heard enough.
Julio, check the clay content on this.

125
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,394
Cross-reference the sample
from that gun shop they hit on Tuesday.

126
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,370
- Send this shell casing to Ballistics.
- Wait a minute, Barry.

127
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,805
It's 10:00. We're getting
into serious OT here.

128
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,037
Yeah, well, that's my call. Problems?

129
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,511
- No, I don't have a life.
- Good thing, huh?

130
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:47,642
You know, I don't know why I bother
to bring you this food. You never eat.

131
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,721
- You want my sandwich?
- Sure.

132
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,881
That's why you bother.

133
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:14,439
Julio, get me a solution
of 10 percent iodine and...

134
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,274
Julio.

135
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,787
What, what? I'm up. I'm up.
Just let me get some coffee.

136
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,654
Hey, no, no.
Get some rest instead, okay?

137
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,557
Go home.

138
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,823
Are you gonna keep working?

139
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,160
Yeah, I'll see you in the morning.

140
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,563
Come on, what's the deal, Barry?
You onto something here?

141
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,196
Not yet. Still breaking down the tire
rubber I pulled off those skid marks.

142
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,502
Can't it wait till morning?
Why kill yourself?

143
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,511
Somebody's gotta figure out who these
Riders are and where they disappear to.

144
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,673
I get it. He hit the family nerve, huh?

145
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,183
- Who? What are you talk...?
- That guy on TV, Kline.

146
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:58,346
Come on, Barry. Every time someone
goes blasting the force, you go off.

147
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,719
Julio, your mother's calling.

148
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,827
Barry!

149
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,062
Barry!

150
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,773
Barry. Oh, God. Barry.
Can you hear me, Barry?

151
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,942
Barry. Barry.

152
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,712
Somebody help!

153
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,384
Help!

154
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,024
Help! Somebody come up
to the lab!

155
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:21,796
Where the hell are those doctors?
Keeping us in the dark like this.

156
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,440
- What did the doctor say?
- Is Barry okay?

157
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,442
Judge for yourself.

158
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,949
- Barry, what on earth are you doing?
- He's making a big mistake. Mr. Allen...

159
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,088
...you've been exposed to highly
volatile and reactive chemicals.

160
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,780
You've suffered abrasions,
lacerations and head trauma.

161
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,586
Cuts, bruises and a headache.
Hardly enough to keep me.

162
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,322
- Barry, if the doctor's telling you...
- You ran tests, and they were negative.

163
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,524
I'd still prefer to keep you here
for a few days for observation.

164
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,034
But I can't lock you up!
Excuse me.

165
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,899
Hell, I know how Barry feels.

166
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:00,671
When Jack Cogan put two.38 slugs in me,
I was out the next day hunting him down.

167
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,007
Henry, this is not about you.

168
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,878
Look, kid, a couple days' rest
isn't gonna hurt you, okay?

169
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,315
You heard what Dad said. Come on, Jay.

170
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,150
A bunch of hoods are leaving corpses
all over the city. Some of them are cops.

171
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,758
I've got work to do.
Iris, take me home, will you?

172
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,589
If we get you some breakfast
before you save the world.

173
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,596
- Call you later, Mom.
- But, Barry...

174
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,728
<i>Dr. Blair. Dr. Blair. Dr. Jay Hamilton...</i>

175
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,175
They hung the two big canvases
on the east wall where the lighting's weak.

176
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,301
You know me, I can't say anything,
it being my first show and all.

177
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
But I don't know,
I think my prices are too high.

178
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,381
I don't wanna blow a sale on Saturday.

179
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,120
Saturday? Oh, God, that's tomorrow.

180
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,257
Do you think you'll...?

181
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,051
Barry.

182
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,586
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay? You've been kind of quiet.

183
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,597
Yeah, yeah. It's just...

184
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,895
I was thinking, you know,
I could have been killed last night.

185
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,971
And something like that
makes you look at your life, you know.

186
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,202
- I know where this is going.
- Yeah, what's wrong with it?

187
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,844
I love you. Isn't that enough for now?

188
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,913
I'm sorry. Yeah.
Yeah, I guess it has to be.

189
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,744
Now, look, I gotta get to the lab, okay?

190
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:17,082
You're too much. What were you doing
there at 3:00 in the morning anyway?

191
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,714
In case you haven't noticed,
the department's practically under siege.

192
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,054
And you're the only man on the force?

193
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,790
What do you think you have to prove?

194
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,192
- I'll pay the check.
- No, I got it.

195
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,228
Hey, steak.

196
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,872
Again. Great.

197
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,632
- Is it?
- Yeah, man.

198
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,470
We'd never eat this good on the streets.

199
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,983
Hey, what's the matter with you, Rick?
We scored tonight, right?

200
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,415
Fifth time without the cops
even coming near us.

201
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,146
Hey, I felt their headlights
on the back of my neck.

202
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,450
This ain't clipping cigarettes
from a minimart.

203
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,388
When we get busted, it's gonna be bad.

204
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,496
Hey, that's if we get busted, baby.
Pike is not gonna let that happen to us.

205
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,064
Let me tell you something, Lila.

206
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,327
He scares me.
I think he's completely gone.

207
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:15,496
I mean, look at the scars on his face. The
guy must have got scrambled or something.

208
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,940
What are you talking about? The man
is a genius. Hey, he takes care of us!

209
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,013
Yeah, where he's taking us is hell,
but we ain't going!

210
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,343
We're getting out of here tonight.

211
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,508
Because I got this.

212
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,784
Rick.

213
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,947
I've been pinching it from our jobs
the last couple of weeks.

214
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,615
Don't worry, nobody saw me.

215
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,819
There's 300 bucks here.
It's enough to get us out of town.

216
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,225
Are you coming?

217
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,233
- When?
- Right now.

218
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,439
Let me get the rest of my stuff.

219
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,226
You were right to come to me with this.

220
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,597
All of you...

221
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,599
...listen up.

222
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,097
- Central City is crumbling.
- Yeah!

223
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,937
The streets are empty...

224
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,840
...and its people live in fear.
- Yes.

225
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,810
- As you once did.
- Yeah.

226
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,471
Why?

227
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,641
Because of lies.

228
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,381
Now, the police say that
they'll protect their citizens.

229
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,786
Yeah, right.

230
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,950
- Did they protect you? No.
- No!

231
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,119
- Did they offer you food?
- No!

232
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:22,461
- Shelter? Or even a little hope?
- No! No!

233
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,625
- They left you cold and hungry.
- Yeah.

234
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,499
- Living in the gutter.
- Hey, what is this? Let go of me.

235
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,164
Hey, where are you taking me?

236
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,667
Hey, what is this?

237
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,176
Lila, why?

238
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,583
Pike.

239
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,185
I was gonna give you the money.

240
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,219
No, that's a lie, Rick.

241
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,248
I promised all of you...

242
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,692
...when the city and its police force
are broken...

243
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,025
...you'd be given your fair share.

244
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,997
Right! Yeah.

245
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,003
But you, you couldn't wait, could you?

246
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,706
In the days of Genghis Khan...

247
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:10,942
...a disloyal warrior was tied
to a wild horse and then set free.

248
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,480
His punishment was left to fate.

249
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,754
Let's take him!

250
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,450
Lila!

251
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,897
He's crazy, come on!

252
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,601
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait. Don't do this.

253
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,535
No. No, please. Please.

254
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,698
Please.

255
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,400
- Get him!
- Strap him down!

256
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,906
Let go of me!

257
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,712
Traitor!

258
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,296
All right!

259
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,773
Barry. Oh, man, I'm glad to see you.

260
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:24,249
- Kind of figured you'd be down for days.
- What, and leave you in charge?

261
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:28,359
When I saw that lightning bolt hit the
window, well, I thought you were done.

262
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,358
Well-done, you know?

263
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,525
- So how much evidence did we lose?
- Enough to slow us down.

264
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,794
Your doctor called and wanted
to talk to you as soon as you got in.

265
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,131
- Thanks.
- Hey, no problem.

266
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,576
Dr. Lawrence. Barry Allen.

267
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,976
What tests?
I thought you had all the results.

268
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,685
I see.

269
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,188
Well, what kind of problems?

270
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,853
What? No, I didn't authorize that.

271
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:07,021
No, I won't make an appointment.
It's out of the question. I'm sorry.

272
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,124
What was that all about?

273
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,961
Nothing.

274
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,505
Come on, Barry, it's me.

275
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:22,074
There's some kind of cell damage.
Lawrence didn't know what to make of it.

276
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,114
So he sent my results to a specialist.

277
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,275
- At Star Labs.
- Star Labs?

278
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,148
Didn't some guy get killed last year
in one of their tests?

279
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,516
That's what I heard.

280
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,591
If they think I'll be a guinea pig,
they're out of their minds.

281
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,388
Listen, could you get the crosscheck
on that soil sample?

282
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,894
- Give me 10 minutes.
- You got it.

283
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,600
What happened?

284
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,309
I guess I lost my grip.

285
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:58,205
Yeah, well, I'm switching you
to decaf, man.

286
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:13,387
Earl. Come on, it's Saturday.
I'd really like to sleep in, huh?

287
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,890
Morning breath.

288
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,969
Okay, Anderson, you're up first.
Keep your eye on the ball.

289
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,265
What's your hurry?
You got someplace to go?

290
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,738
- Here we go.
- Come on.

291
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,900
Yeah! Run it in!

292
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,444
For crying out loud, I just got blown up.

293
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,776
- Nope. No, you don't.
- Go for second. Go on.

294
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,911
Earl, that's not our ball.

295
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,614
That's not ours. Earl, that's not ours!

296
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,022
I can't believe I'm still hungry.

297
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,230
Hey, Earl, want some chicken?

298
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,702
What? What's wrong? Hey, it's okay.

299
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,212
Earl, what is it?

300
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,782
What? It's okay.

301
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,283
What are you doing back there?

302
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,921
<i>Barry, where are you? It's after 11.</i>
<i>I'm at the gallery.</i>

303
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,120
<i>I thought you were gonna</i>
<i>help me set up here.</i>

304
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:56,063
<i>I hope you're okay.</i>
<i>I'll just assume you're on the way.</i>

305
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,773
Damn!

306
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,068
- Look at that.
- Come on.

307
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,976
- Give him a hand.
- Who is he?

308
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,643
- I don't know what happened.
- You all right?

309
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,593
Call an ambulance.

310
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,200
What...? What happened?

311
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,910
Crystal Beach?

312
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,046
That's 30 miles.

313
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,330
Oh, my God.

314
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,159
- Hello?
- It's me.

315
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,991
- Barry, are you okay?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

316
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,497
- Where are you?
- Crystal Beach.

317
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,568
Crystal Beach?

318
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,297
I know you don't take my art seriously,
but I thought you'd at least show up.

319
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,804
<i>I tried.</i>

320
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,136
This'll sound crazy...

321
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:23,543
...but I had a flat tire, so I ran for a bus,
and suddenly...

322
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,343
...here I was.
- You're right, it does sound crazy.

323
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:30,386
Look, Iris, we'll talk about it,
all right? Just...

324
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,115
Can you just come down here
and pick me up?

325
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,854
Guess not.

326
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,761
<i>Another wave of attacks by the Dark Riders</i>
<i>left three police officers...</i>

327
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:49,168
- Excuse me, Earl.
- <i>Cars were ambushed along Riverview Road.</i>

328
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:53,300
<i>In another Riders assault,</i>
<i>fire bombing, looting and armed robbery...</i>

329
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,845
<i>... followed a raid on the north</i>
<i>Main Street shopping district.</i>

330
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,607
- <i>The latest violence...</i>
- Iris?

331
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,549
<i>Mr. Allen? This is Christina McGee</i>
<i>from Star Labs.</i>

332
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,552
Oh, yeah.

333
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,613
My doctor...

334
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,692
...said you had the file about my accident.
- <i>Yes.</i>

335
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:13,319
- <i>That's right.</i>
- Well, I've been having some...

336
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,830
...very interesting reactions,
and I was hoping...

337
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,401
...there was something
you might be able to tell me.

338
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,834
<i>I think you should come in, Mr. Allen.</i>

339
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,100
- Great. When?
- <i>How's 10:00 tomorrow?</i>

340
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,936
On Sunday?

341
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,274
- That bad, huh?
- <i>Why don't we talk in the morning?</i>

342
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,439
<i>Meet me at 50 Garrick Avenue.</i>

343
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,941
Garrick.

344
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,987
Okay. Thanks, Dr. McGee.

345
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,147
- Goodbye.
- <i>Goodbye.</i>

346
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,853
Oh, thank you, Earl.
Would you like an after-dinner mint?

347
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,433
Come on, let's go down to Burger World
so I can get something to eat.

348
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,032
Okay, we'll drive.

349
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,834
Barry Allen.

350
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,997
- I'm Tina McGee.
- Hi.

351
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:34,601
- Something wrong?
- No. No.

352
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,538
You're not what I expected.

353
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,877
Then we're even.

354
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,790
It's pretty quiet.

355
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,194
- We the only ones here?
- Yes.

356
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,172
I understand you're a police chemist.
Are you familiar with our program?

357
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:08,745
No, not really. You people are federal.
We don't have much contact.

358
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,245
Your doctor said you didn't want
to come here.

359
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,749
You're a scientist.
What are you afraid of?

360
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,256
Face it, Star Labs isn't exactly
Children's Hospital, you know.

361
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,858
You people have a reputation.

362
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:26,292
Unorthodox experiments.
Secret government contracts.

363
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,692
Rumors mostly.

364
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,767
One of your researchers
was killed last year. Is that a rumor?

365
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,768
- No, that's true.
- Lovely.

366
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,730
He was my husband.

367
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,752
- How many people work here?
- Just me.

368
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,850
- Barry?
- Oh, sorry.

369
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:07,031
Tell me everything that happened,
beginning with the accident.

370
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,765
- Right.
- The lightning struck a rack of chemicals.

371
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,932
Have you any idea
what was on those shelves?

372
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,944
Any idea? Yeah, roughly.

373
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:20,073
Aluminum sulfate, glycerin,
potassium nitrate, magnesium hydroxide...

374
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:23,743
...hydrochloric acid, sulfur, tannic acid,
phosphorus. That's the top shelf.

375
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,890
- On the second shelf...
- You know all that?

376
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,184
You know all this?

377
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,927
- Never seen these before.
- That's because I built them.

378
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:41,765
Each sensor transmits its own signal.
It keeps me from tripping over wires.

379
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,907
Now, if you ran to Crystal Beach in
a few seconds, let's see how you got there.

380
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,909
You're sure about this?

381
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,271
We have to start somewhere.

382
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,779
My God, are you all right?

383
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,646
Yeah, yeah.

384
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:30,347
Listen, I'm really sorry about that.

385
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,851
Three hundred and forty-seven
miles an hour?!

386
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:38,860
That was before the equipment crashed.
You may not have hit your top speed.

387
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,225
What's happening to me?

388
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,701
All your electrochemical systems
are accelerated.

389
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:55,369
Nerve synapses, brain waves.
Even when you're at rest.

390
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,640
Your muscle and bone tissue
are changing in order to keep pace.

391
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,377
Changing? Into what?

392
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,783
No, there's gotta be something
you can do.

393
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,720
Just bear with me for a few more tests.

394
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,592
Card tricks?

395
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,254
Put these in order as fast as you can.

396
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,824
Go.

397
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,333
Stop.

398
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,241
If all else fails,
we can always go to Vegas.

399
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,706
I don't know why I'm so worn out.

400
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:37,378
No wonder. Your blood sugar's
incredibly low. Hungry?

401
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,686
- Want this one?
- No, help yourself.

402
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,762
Great. Thanks.

403
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:52,859
Would you...?
Would you like another one?

404
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,837
- No. Thanks.
- Here, I'll take these.

405
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,402
I can't believe I ate all this food.

406
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:06,042
- Pretty disgusting, isn't it?
- No, it's interesting.

407
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:10,210
You're burning up so much energy,
your body's demanding that you replace it.

408
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,213
Tina, I can't pretend
to understand all of this...

409
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,451
...but if everything's moving faster,
I could be aging prematurely.

410
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,289
My body could fail. I could burn up.

411
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,962
I think I can help you. But I don't want
anyone else to know I'm treating you.

412
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,933
- Why? What's wrong?
- Lf people I work with learn about you...

413
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,096
...they'll take control
of your treatment.

414
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:33,209
- You'll be studied, analyzed, tested.
- They can't do that. I'm a private citizen.

415
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,176
If you have anywhere near
the power I suspect...

416
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,907
...the government will classify you
as a security risk.

417
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,210
They'll take your cells apart,
make 100 of you.

418
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,616
I think you've been reading
too many comic books.

419
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,451
I'm being serious, Barry.
I've seen it happen.

420
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,256
Your husband?

421
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,862
David discovered an enzyme that stimulated
the brain and enhanced the senses.

422
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:07,868
We were asked to test human subjects
before the process was perfected.

423
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,404
David said no.

424
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:15,177
Our funding was threatened.
So one night when he was alone...

425
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,015
...he tried the enzyme on himself.

426
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,855
My husband was dead when I found him.

427
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,790
Okay.

428
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,896
We'll do this however you want.

429
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,730
Okay. Now, does anyone else
know about your condition?

430
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,566
No one. Earl, I guess.

431
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,833
- Earl?
- My dog.

432
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,274
I feel lucky that you came to me.
You could just be my life's work.

433
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:44,972
- I better not be.
- I didn't mean...

434
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,983
I want to be rid of this.
And that's the deal.

435
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,920
Now I know I'm in trouble.

436
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,430
Even the kibble's starting to look good.

437
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,604
- Hi.
- I was just driving by, so...

438
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,573
- Barry, your shoes are on fire!
- What?

439
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,110
Yeah. Well...

440
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:28,182
Dropped a match on the rug.
Damn synthetic fibers.

441
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:34,220
- What happened here, Barry?
- Oh, you know that Earl.

442
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,383
He's a wild man.

443
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,592
Barry, we need to talk.

444
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:42,392
Yeah, Iris, listen. I'm sorry
I missed your show, okay?

445
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,400
- But I've been having these blackouts.
- Did you call a doctor?

446
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,062
- Yeah, I was with a specialist all afternoon.
- On Sunday?

447
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,201
House call.

448
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,970
Anyway, we did some tests,
and I'm gonna be fine.

449
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,909
Well, that's good to hear.

450
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,310
Listen, I've been doing some thinking.

451
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,179
Yeah?

452
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,144
This is kind of hard to say, Barry.

453
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,150
Maybe we shouldn't see
each other for a while.

454
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,857
Why?

455
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,360
Barry, we've both been dealing
with a lot lately.

456
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,795
Even before your accident,
it was your job...

457
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,366
- No, wait.
...or my career.

458
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,662
- Things have been moving too fast.
- No kidding.

459
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:24,331
I just think we need to slow things down
and figure out what we want.

460
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,441
I know what I want.

461
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,673
Barry, I'm 25. I'm not
even thinking about...

462
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,714
...getting married now.
- Not that again.

463
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,819
- I don't wanna hurt you, Barry. I love you.
- Well, then don't.

464
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:40,321
And if you need me,
I'll be there for you. Okay? I just...

465
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,391
I need some time to think.

466
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,291
And I gotta go. I just gotta go.

467
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,159
Iris, wait.

468
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,797
Iris!

469
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,956
Pike.

470
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,615
You never...

471
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,689
I found out about the task force.

472
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,435
What did you find out?

473
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,513
The police chief is gonna show them off
to the whole city tonight...

474
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,949
...on TV at 9.

475
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,452
- Tell Billy to gas up the bikes.
- Okay.

476
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,963
I think the Dark Riders
are ready for prime time.

477
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,401
What's this?

478
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,102
Something I wrote...

479
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,402
...a lifetime ago.

480
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,588
I told you to stay out
of my chemistry set.

481
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,757
- How you feeling, kid?
- Good.

482
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,666
- I'm gonna be okay.
- Yeah?

483
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,671
So how come it looks like
you just came from the morgue?

484
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,934
Because my love life just tagged DO A.

485
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,374
- Iris, she dumped you.
- Yeah.

486
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,070
She tried to make it sound
like something else though.

487
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,148
I'm telling you, you're too good for her.

488
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,308
- Those artsy chicks...
- Hey, can it, Jay.

489
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,717
- Don't even start with me, all right?
- Gentlemen, we may have a lead.

490
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,916
The Riders stormed Central City Mall
last night, and one of them lost this.

491
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:59,460
- I got a hair sample.
- We'll send it to Chicago for DNA profile.

492
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,157
- Hey, I'm way ahead of you. Just sign it.
- Yeah? Good man.

493
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,829
After Cooper's press conference, you've got
a meeting with the head of the task force.

494
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,171
Wouldn't wish that job
on my worst enemy.

495
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,742
Yeah?

496
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,742
How about your brother?

497
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,111
Who else?

498
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,007
Congratulations.

499
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,884
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

500
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,316
See you.

501
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:32,557
Your police department is determined
to give you back your streets...

502
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,393
...and rid them of the fear
that keeps us all awake at night.

503
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:40,401
So this evening we are rolling
out our first task force...

504
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,905
...intended to deal directly
with the criminals plaguing our city.

505
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,908
Commander Jay Allen is leading the unit.

506
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:52,913
I can assure you that there is
no more capable officer on the force.

507
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,744
Jay.

508
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,510
Chief.

509
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,285
I'm not so great at making speeches.

510
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:05,851
So I just wanna say
that my men and I...

511
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,260
...we all have families like you.

512
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:12,232
And we wanna clean this up
as soon as possible.

513
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,365
Get down!

514
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,500
Julio, the Riders! Get down!

515
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,710
- You all right?
- Yeah, what hit me?

516
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,544
I did.

517
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,276
Come on.

518
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,183
Easy, easy, easy.
Watch your step here.

519
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,722
Let's get the paramedics
down here. Move it!

520
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,985
Linda Park, WCCN News.
Can we get a statement?

521
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,822
- Let's move it out of here.
- Give me a hand here, please.

522
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,989
- How do you intend...?
- Yeah. Yeah.

523
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,861
We're gonna bury these guys.

524
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,401
And you can quote me on that.

525
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,869
There are injuries here,
including Chief Cooper.

526
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,565
Can your task force recover
from this humiliating raid?

527
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,973
- Listen. Linda, right?
- Right.

528
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:32,138
- Why don't you parasites start backing us...?
- Back off. Interview's over.

529
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,314
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah. Damn it!

530
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,684
This was a hit-and-run just to show
they could do it. Look at this.

531
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,587
Marking their turf like stinking dogs.

532
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,561
<i>And this was the scene earlier this evening</i>
<i>when our WCCN cameras...</i>

533
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,723
<i>... caught the raid live as it happened.</i>

534
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,505
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

535
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,877
- Someone got hurt, honey.
- <i>Get paramedics here. Let's go. Move it!</i>

536
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,645
<i>Linda Park, WCCN News.</i>
<i>Can we get a statement?</i>

537
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,919
<i>Yeah. I'll give you a statement.</i>
<i>We're gonna bury these guys.</i>

538
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,491
<i>And you can quote me on that.</i>

539
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,152
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.
- What's up?

540
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,893
- Pike.
- Quiet.

541
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,501
This is the man who betrayed me.

542
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,843
The man who gave me my scars.

543
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,983
- We've crushed his city.
- Yeah!

544
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:47,817
We've humiliated his beloved police force.

545
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:53,486
Now it's time
for Commander Jay Allen to die.

546
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,437
You really think this is gonna work?

547
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:06,235
Well, if we're gonna control your power,
it's the first step.

548
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,241
You're the doctor.

549
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:15,548
So, what am I wearing here?

550
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,710
That's a Soviet prototype deep-sea suit.

551
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,517
The project was abandoned months ago,
so I borrowed it.

552
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,684
- How does it feel?
- It's okay.

553
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,523
It's...

554
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:31,760
...strange. I don't know. Like it's molding
to my body and expanding somehow.

555
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:35,735
Well, it is. There's a layer
of reactive insulation next to your skin.

556
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:40,070
The suit can handle high-velocity pressure,
and it will regulate your body temperature.

557
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,577
Listen, my skin isn't affected by speed.
Do I really need to wear this?

558
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:47,478
As your clothes keep falling apart,
it's either this or you can run buck-naked.

559
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,312
Oh, thank you.

560
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:52,478
Okay, put this communicator in your ear.

561
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,286
Okay.

562
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,069
Okay, Barry, whenever you're ready.

563
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,987
- Barry, can you hear me?
- <i>Yeah, what's my velocity?</i>

564
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:31,821
Holding at 480. Can you go any faster?

565
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,194
530.

566
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,801
570.

567
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:47,637
620. Be careful, Barry,
you're about to cause a sonic boom.

568
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,540
Barry?

569
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,705
Barry, please answer me.

570
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,349
<i>Sorry, my ears were ringing.</i>

571
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,316
I think I'm starting to like this.

572
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,822
I envy you. How does it feel?

573
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,360
<i>See for yourself.</i>

574
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,965
Barry, what are you doing?

575
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,382
Sorry.

576
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:34,217
I got carried away. Or you did, I guess.

577
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,325
Your breathing's regular.

578
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,894
Your pulse is too.

579
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,793
Yeah, I guess my body's adapting
like you said.

580
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,991
- Oh, how did the suit hold up?
- Great.

581
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:48,366
For the first time, I felt I was in control.
Like everything was...

582
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,801
...working together.

583
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,737
Don't get too confident.
We've got a lot more testing to do.

584
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,073
Barry? Barry? What's wrong?

585
00:46:56,246 --> 00:47:00,410
Okay, put your head between
your legs and breathe deeply.

586
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,648
- I'm gonna go and get some oxygen.
- No, wait.

587
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,150
I'm okay.

588
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,991
What was that?

589
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,756
Dehydration, perhaps.
Or glucose deficiency.

590
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,696
But I think we should get back to the van
and check you out.

591
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,645
- Going somewhere?
- When you didn't show up, I figured I'd...

592
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:38,379
- Put in a couple more hours.
- Yeah, you read my mind, Barry.

593
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,182
Excellent. Tina, this is Julio.

594
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,654
- Hello.
- My pleasure.

595
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,851
I asked Barry to show me the lab.
Thought it might be interesting.

596
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,893
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, look around.

597
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:50,625
Just stay away from the windows.
We've had trouble in that area lately.

598
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:52,462
Okay.

599
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,768
I thought I was a fast mover.

600
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:57,065
Iris is gone two days,
and you got a new woman.

601
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,404
- Knock it off.
- Her idea of a hot date is a visit to the lab?

602
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,910
- Marry her.
- Something's coming in here.

603
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,243
It's the DNA identification
from that hair sample.

604
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:16,592
Wait, what is this?
This is a department ID photo.

605
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,820
- Motorcycle cop. I told these guys not to...
- Wait a minute.

606
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,158
Pike was thrown off the force
three years ago.

607
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,926
- Did you know him?
- He was my brother's partner.

608
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:29,163
Pike had a hijacking operation on the side.
Guns, narcotics, explosives.

609
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:33,605
Jay got onto him.
He set up a decoy out on Highway 61.

610
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,938
A semi full of phony cargo.

611
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:40,607
When Pike showed, Jay chased him down.
Pike's cycle crashed and burned.

612
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,548
A couple weeks later,
he escaped from a prison hospital.

613
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,188
- He hasn't been seen since.
- Oh, my God.

614
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:47,983
Gotta tell Jay.

615
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,683
You can't. He's on escort.
They're on radio silence.

616
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,419
Where? Where?

617
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:56,259
They got a tip the Riders were gonna
hit a semi full of medical supplies...

618
00:48:56,433 --> 00:49:00,028
...on Highway 61. Now, look, you don't
think Pike's setting the same trap?

619
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,570
- I have to contact that escort.
- You can't. You need authorization.

620
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,709
- Where are you going?
- To find Jay. I have to warn him.

621
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:10,142
Look, please don't try anything.
You don't know what could happen.

622
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,305
He's my brother.

623
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,463
What seems to be the problem?

624
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,363
My engine died.

625
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,039
Well, we've gotta get this vehicle
off this highway right now.

626
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,698
Well, I wish I could, but it won't start.

627
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,379
Gentlemen...

628
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:19,879
...I need a push here!

629
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,988
Listen...

630
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:30,923
...l've been standing out here
a long time. I'm kind of freezing.

631
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,652
Yeah, I bet you are.

632
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:35,421
You're not gonna leave me out here,
are you?

633
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,130
Look, I'm not supposed to do this...

634
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,930
...but I'll radio in for a tow.

635
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,641
Thanks. I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.

636
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,313
Get away from the car!

637
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,335
Remember me?

638
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,277
Nick.

639
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,314
Jay.

640
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,121
Jay!

641
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,858
Jay.

642
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:26,058
- Dad.
- Barry. Hello, son.

643
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,833
Mom told me you'd be out here.

644
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:34,340
I could hardly cry yesterday
with 300 cops standing around.

645
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:40,513
Just wanted to say my own goodbye,
I guess.

646
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,612
Yeah.

647
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,082
I stopped by Jay's house.

648
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:49,384
Eve's holding up pretty well,
considering.

649
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,791
But Shawn...

650
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,930
...he wouldn't let go of me.
- Damn it.

651
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:04,003
I walked a beat for 30 years,
never made it higher than sergeant.

652
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,735
But your brother,
he could've made chief.

653
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,573
Could have been anything he wanted.

654
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,913
I made a decision, Dad.

655
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:17,410
- I'm going after Pike myself.
- Don't be a damn fool.

656
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:21,546
I'm onto something. If I play
my cards right, I can track him down.

657
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:25,422
Leave that for the Homicide boys.
Your mother's got enough grief.

658
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,256
Mom doesn't have to know.

659
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,764
Son, I know what you're feeling.
I'm torn up too.

660
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,904
But a man's got to know his limitations.

661
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,671
You don't have any faith
in me at all, do you?

662
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,208
That's not it, Barry.

663
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,744
I'm asking for your blessing.

664
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:48,645
Well, I can't, Barry.
You're all we've got left.

665
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:52,112
It's not the same anymore.

666
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,849
If there's anything
I tried to teach you two boys...

667
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:58,517
...it's that you don't fire a gun
without a bullet in the chamber.

668
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,686
I have the bullet.

669
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,837
- What are you doing here?
- We're through with this crap.

670
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,639
No more testing. No more games.

671
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,749
- I know what you're going through.
- Do you?

672
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,010
Yes, maybe I do.

673
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,821
I'm sorry.

674
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,584
- It's okay.
- But if you understand...

675
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,750
...you'll give me what I need.

676
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:34,328
The red suit. I need more of it.

677
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,260
- Why?
- I want you to build a hood...

678
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:39,425
...to cover my face so no one
will know who I am. And gloves...

679
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,036
...so I won't leave fingerprints.
Can you do that?

680
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:47,370
- Well, yes, I suppose so, but l...
- Pike murdered Jay.

681
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,136
I'm gonna bring him in.

682
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,678
That's crazy.
You're barely able to control your...

683
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,338
Power?

684
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,817
That's what you called it.

685
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,977
Yes. And a very unstable one.

686
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,214
You came here asking to get rid of it.

687
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:04,391
I've changed my mind.

688
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,887
Well, then I'm afraid I cannot help you.

689
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,530
Fine.

690
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,862
I'll do this without you.

691
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,596
Wait.

692
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,738
I'll give you what you want.

693
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:26,605
But let me build in sensors
so I can track you and monitor vital signs.

694
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:31,186
I don't believe you! You're still worried
about your experiment, your life's work.

695
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,754
I am worried about you!

696
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,624
Okay.

697
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,092
Okay. Now, there's one more thing.

698
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:43,426
Pike has been terrorizing this city.
Well, I'm gonna terrorize him.

699
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,297
You know that insignia of his,
that blood dot they all wear on their backs?

700
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,303
Well, I've got one of my own.

701
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,454
Damn!

702
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,641
What happened to Bill and Steve?

703
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:40,214
I don't know, man,
but Pike said don't stop for nothing.

704
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,036
Hey, what's that?

705
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,133
Run him down!

706
00:59:58,561 --> 00:59:59,755
I want Pike.

707
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,456
Where is he?

708
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,464
Tell me!

709
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,929
Go to hell!

710
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,057
Freeze!

711
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,365
Come on, Barry. Where are you?

712
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,353
Hey, Allen, is that you?

713
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:37,351
- How's it going, Murph?
- All right.

714
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,997
What are you doing here?
Thought you lived in North Park.

715
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,827
Yeah, my damn dog saw a poodle.

716
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:48,368
- Been chasing him for blocks.
- Something wrong with your leg?

717
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,870
Yeah, he bit me on the way out.

718
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:55,368
- Must have been some poodle.
- Well, hop in. We'll give you a ride home.

719
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,745
- Thanks.
- No problem.

720
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:08,118
Barry, I want you to know
we're all real sorry about Jay.

721
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,282
Thanks, fellas.

722
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,623
Did you hear the latest?
We bagged a couple of those Riders tonight.

723
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:17,254
And get this, they said a ghost
tore them right off their bikes.

724
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,492
If you ask me, they're all on crack.

725
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:47,885
Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

726
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:49,963
Hey, Allen.

727
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,391
How much is that doggy
in the window?

728
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:02,377
- Guess he beat us back, huh?
- Looks like it.

729
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,706
- Good night.
- Good night.

730
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,884
- Hey, Bellows.
- What?

731
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,578
I know those guys from the crime lab
are whacked out...

732
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:17,487
...but did you check his red boots?
I'm sorry.

733
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,924
- Murph. Will you give the poor guy a break?
- What?

734
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,259
I mean, how would you act
if you got hit by lightning?

735
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,627
I'd probably go out and buy red boots.

736
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,398
- Who ate all the doughnuts, man?
- What?

737
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,008
- I don't believe you. You pig.
- Me?

738
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,338
I don't believe you.

739
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:56,698
Where did you come from?

740
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:59,027
- I've been following you.
- What?

741
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:02,603
I thought you were gonna monitor
from your lab, not your ice-cream truck.

742
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,741
You're injured. I saw it on the readout.
What happened?

743
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,638
- I was stabbed in the leg.
- How bad is it?

744
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:12,144
Well, the pain and stiffness
are almost gone.

745
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:15,148
Well, that doesn't seem possible.
I'd like to check it out.

746
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,650
Okay. Come on up.

747
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,454
Barry.

748
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:36,598
Sorry. I guess I shouldn't
have let myself in.

749
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,331
- Here's your keys anyways.
- It's not what you think.

750
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,839
- This is Tina McGee.
- Hi.

751
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:47,915
- She's a doctor. A scientist. And she's...
- A genetic-fingerprint specialist.

752
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,245
I'm helping Barry
track down the Pike gang.

753
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:54,019
This isn't the best time
to compare notes.

754
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:58,524
- Look, if you have business to talk about...
- No. We can talk about it tomorrow.

755
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,424
- It was nice meeting you, Iris.
- You too.

756
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:04,828
- Good night.
- Well, I'm gonna show her out.

757
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:08,266
- I'll be right back.
- Sure. Sure.

758
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,206
Tina.

759
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,406
Listen, I'm sorry.
I did not know she was there.

760
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,811
- I understand. I'm worried about your leg.
- It's okay.

761
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,315
Look, if it's not, I'll call you.

762
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,547
Okay.

763
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:39,533
Barry, I wanted to talk to you
at the funeral.

764
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,863
But there was just so much to say.

765
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:46,438
I'm really sorry about Jay.
I know how close you were.

766
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,137
Yeah.

767
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,511
Look, I know I should have called first...

768
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,811
...but I just needed to see you.

769
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,318
Tell you how much I missed you.

770
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:02,080
Well, I missed you too.

771
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,120
- You still love me, don't you?
- Of course. Yeah.

772
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,823
But after everything that's happened
in the last few days...

773
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,730
...I think I feel differently
about a few things.

774
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,736
- Well, like what?
- Well, like marriage for one.

775
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:20,069
- I mean, we weren't doing so bad before.
- No, I didn't think so.

776
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:22,005
Yeah, well, you were right.

777
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:25,306
I mean, there's a lot going on
in our lives right now.

778
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,346
And...

779
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:30,246
...l'm gonna make it a lot easier
on both of us.

780
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:32,250
The pressure's off.

781
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,784
- It is?
- Yeah.

782
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:39,291
Well, that's great, Barry. I mean...

783
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,760
I mean, I don't know what I mean.

784
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:44,263
I came here to tell you
that I thought it over...

785
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:46,993
...and if it was the only way
we could stay together...

786
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,160
...I was gonna say yes.

787
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,306
And now...

788
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:55,035
- Sometimes you're very confusing.
- That makes two of us.

789
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:58,305
So, what do you say?

790
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:01,774
Can we start to see each other again?

791
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:04,886
Maybe put things back
the way they were?

792
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:07,812
I'd like to try.

793
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:23,561
I can't believe it was over so quickly.

794
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:26,833
- Disappointed?
- Well, yeah.

795
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:30,001
After all that anticipation, why bother?

796
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,674
Yeah.

797
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:37,178
Twenty bucks for a fight
that's over in two rounds.

798
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,257
Barry.

799
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,765
- The Thai food.
- The what?

800
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:54,596
The Thai food was ready 10 minutes ago.

801
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,767
I should go. I'll go.

802
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,273
- You will?
- Yeah.

803
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:05,378
No complaining?

804
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,880
No. No.

805
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,009
I'll just go get...

806
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,214
I'm gonna go.

807
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,451
Going.

808
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,289
- I'll hurry.
- Okay.

809
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:29,636
- Thai food, coming up.
- Barry, how did you get back here so fast?

810
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:32,365
You were only gone a couple seconds.

811
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,009
- You must have fallen asleep.
- I didn't fall asleep.

812
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,236
- Here, have a shrimp.
- I didn't fall asleep.

813
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:40,007
Well, maybe those blackouts
I was having are contagious.

814
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:42,582
- I don't think so. I don't think...
- I think they are.

815
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:46,346
...it has anything to do with
falling asleep.

816
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,110
- Petrolli, I never step on your toes.
- Out of the question.

817
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:18,219
- Let me talk to her.
- I don't know anything about interrogation?

818
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,912
- Five minutes.
- Allen, I don't come up to your lab...

819
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,923
...and play with your microscope.
- What have you got to lose?

820
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:27,028
We've been around and around with her.
She's got nothing to say.

821
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:30,859
- You going in isn't gonna change a thing.
- You know this is important to me.

822
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,126
Your brother was a good cop.
We all liked him.

823
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:36,237
Well, he taught me a few things
about interrogation too.

824
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:40,967
- I really shouldn't do this.
- Petrolli, they murdered Jay.

825
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:46,513
Okay, you've got five minutes.

826
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,343
Wait!

827
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:52,977
Go ahead.

828
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,288
It's okay. Let him in.

829
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:02,595
- Lila, right?
- Yeah, so?

830
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:07,199
Pretty frightening how you
and your friends were caught.

831
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:10,202
What was it again, a demon?

832
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,773
The guys around the station think
you're all on drugs, you know.

833
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,776
Or crazy.

834
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:21,806
But I know better.

835
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:27,145
I know you really did see a demon.
He was as red as blood, wasn't he?

836
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:31,690
And fast. Like a flash.

837
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:36,095
So if you care about Pike,
you'll tell us where he is.

838
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,165
Because, Lila...

839
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:41,735
...if we don't find him,
the Flash will.

840
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,072
Now, I know you really wanna tell me.

841
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:49,240
Where is he?

842
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:58,042
I can't.

843
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,383
I can't tell you. I can't.

844
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,718
Take off her clothes.

845
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,693
Send them to the crime lab.

846
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,270
- <i>and six of the suspects were arrested.</i>

847
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:25,111
None of us is free
while Lila rots in their prison!

848
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:28,616
Tonight...

849
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:32,447
...we open the gates of hell!
- Yeah!

850
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,049
Barry? I got the topo that you wanted.

851
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,124
- Great. Talk to me.
- All right.

852
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:14,922
The areas marked in yellow match
the soil samples found at the crime scenes.

853
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:16,928
Thanks, Julio.

854
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,997
Come on.

855
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:22,864
Yes!

856
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,339
Bring me that map, will you?

857
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,315
- We got it.
- What?

858
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:45,290
Pike's hideout. There's only one area
where that plant appears with that soil.

859
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:48,396
Yeah, Devil's Gate Dam.
That reservoir's been closed for a year.

860
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:50,725
We gotta tell the chief.

861
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,517
What are you doing, Tyrone?

862
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,486
Turning it down. Want the whole world
to know where we are?

863
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:18,683
What does it matter? After tonight,
with every psycho punk loose...

864
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:20,852
...we can do whatever we want, right?

865
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:24,988
Yeah, well, until then keep it down,
because you're blowing my head off.

866
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,533
"Keep it down,
you're blowing my head off."

867
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,998
- I told you, Scott!
- Hey, I didn't do anything, man.

868
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:38,840
- Don't mess with me, man, all right?
- All right. Fine.

869
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,725
That was real funny, huh?

870
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,951
Yeah, that's pretty funny. I think that's...

871
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:05,195
I realize how an unhappy childhood
probably led you to all this...

872
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,535
...but that's really no excuse.

873
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,360
Vacuum later, Gus. I'm still working.

874
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,293
Chief Cooper?
Sir, I need to speak with you.

875
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:11,666
- Barry Allen, Crime Lab.
- I know who you are.

876
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:17,168
- It's about Pike.
- Yeah, what do you make of this, Allen?

877
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:22,374
We chase these hoodlums for weeks, and
then we find six of them lying in the road.

878
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,315
You know, there may be
a rival gang out there.

879
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:28,945
Good theory, sir.
Chief, I've located Pike's home base.

880
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:31,854
- What? Where?
- Devil's Gate Dam.

881
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,585
- You sure?
- I've been there.

882
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:35,286
- You've been...?
- Yes, sir.

883
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:39,059
- We'll hit them with everything we got.
- They're not at the dam right now.

884
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:45,002
Allen, you're confusing the hell out of me.
And what do you mean, going out alone?

885
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:48,540
- You're not authorized.
- Pike and his men are headed for the jail.

886
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,873
They mean to break out friends
and anyone else who wants to come.

887
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:55,483
That's a pretty wild story. You know,
you've been under a lot of stress.

888
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:58,251
Sir, I know I'm just another
fingerprint duster here.

889
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,581
But if you don't trust me, trust this.

890
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:04,317
I found it at the dam.
It was my brother's.

891
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:13,291
Tina, I need help.

892
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,824
I can't...

893
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:19,193
...move.

894
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:30,864
Keep it moving!
Keep it moving!

895
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,215
Pike!

896
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,189
- I knew you'd come.
- You're all right?

897
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,988
- Yeah.
- Come on.

898
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,323
Farnsworth.

899
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:27,360
Get on the radio. Deploy the cars coming
from the south to the rear of the building.

900
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:32,091
- Anderson. Patch me into the prison PA.
- Right.

901
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:40,098
- <i>Unit 13. Baker Two, on our way to the jail.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

902
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:43,802
- How does it look up there?
- That's the main cellblock. All the nuts.

903
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:47,938
- Serial killers, hit men, you name it.
- Chief, we're tapped into the prison.

904
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,880
Pike, this is Chief Cooper.

905
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:53,714
I'm giving you 60 seconds
to come out of there...

906
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:58,258
...or we'll fill that building with so much tear
gas, you'll be crying for the rest of your life.

907
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:02,760
Who does he think he's dealing with,
some punk robbing his first liquor store?

908
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,398
Give me that.

909
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,052
What the hell do they have up there,
an army?

910
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:44,699
- You feeling better?
- Yeah.

911
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:48,269
Your blood's fully oxygenated,
and the glucose should help.

912
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:49,569
What happened to me?

913
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:52,941
A recurrence of the metabolic failure
suffered at the testing ground.

914
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:56,743
I've gotta get to the jail to stop Pike.
Is this gonna happen again?

915
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,182
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

916
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:02,346
You're the expert here.
I thought my system was adjusting.

917
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,322
Well, maybe I was wrong.
Maybe it takes time.

918
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:08,828
Look, you're one of a kind, Barry,
and I'm only human.

919
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,397
But I can't let you go after Pike.
Not now.

920
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:13,898
You could be killed.
I can't let that happen again.

921
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,537
Don't you think I know
why you follow me around?

922
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:20,698
Why you hook me up to these monitors?
I'm not your husband, Tina.

923
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:23,067
It's not happening again.

924
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:32,579
You're in extreme danger
every time you use your speed.

925
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:35,848
There's five squads of cops
about to meet a mob of armed convicts.

926
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,015
- You need my help.
- Not this time.

927
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:51,862
Oh, come on.

928
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:56,133
Come on!

929
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:59,543
Damn it!

930
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:14,526
They've got us pinned, sir. We can't get
close enough to launch tear gas.

931
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:18,097
- I advise that we fall back out of range.
- Fall back?

932
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:22,100
Captain, if Pike gets past us with 100 men,
he'll burn the city to the ground.

933
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,637
Yes, sir. But with the kind of firepower
they've got in there...

934
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,469
...I don't know how much longer
we can last.

935
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:52,731
Sorry, boys.
Shooting gallery is closed.

936
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:26,264
All right, listen up.

937
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:27,867
- We're pulling out.
- What?

938
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:30,937
Riders will drive a wedge
through the police line...

939
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:33,165
...and the rest of you will follow.
- Yeah!

940
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,673
Once we're past these walls...

941
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:39,610
...the city that locked you away
is yours!

942
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:41,840
Yeah!

943
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:46,179
All right, mount up!

944
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,850
What's that smell?

945
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:57,528
Let's go. Let's go!

946
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:04,335
Hurry, get out this way.

947
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:09,199
No! You're not gonna leave me?!

948
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:20,481
That's tear gas. How did someone
get close enough to launch it?

949
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:29,019
Attention, all units.
Prepare to move into the main building.

950
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:31,926
- Come on, let's move!
- Move! Move!

951
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:41,406
Hey, Murph, I saw it. The thing.
The red ghost.

952
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:43,908
Sure you did, Bellows.
And I'm Marie-Antoinette.

953
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,242
No, I'm serious.
He was standing right there.

954
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:52,381
Come on, what do I have to do,
check you for head wounds? Jeez.

955
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,751
What are you?
And where did you come from?

956
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,655
I came from you, Pike.

957
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:38,959
You made me
when you killed my brother.

958
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:42,297
I killed a lot of men's brothers.

959
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,162
His name was...

960
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,741
His name was...

961
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:57,278
Was...

962
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:38,612
Pike!

963
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,415
Remember me?

964
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:11,972
Thank you.

965
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:18,679
Hi.

966
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:21,778
That was a dirty trick,
stealing my distributor cap.

967
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:24,447
- I'm trying to help you.
- I got Pike.

968
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:27,317
We sail. It's over.

969
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:32,497
I'm sorry I didn't let you follow me.
I was afraid you'd get hurt.

970
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:36,159
I can take care of myself, Barry.
I've been doing it a long time.

971
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:41,772
I can care about you too, you know.
It's no crime.

972
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:44,738
Course not.

973
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,972
I was watching the monitor. You had
a slowdown, didn't you? Another seizure?

974
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:52,847
We gotta eliminate that. If I'm gonna
use my speed to its full advantage...

975
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,488
I was afraid of this.

976
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:56,987
Why should it end now?

977
01:29:57,492 --> 01:30:01,087
What about side effects, complications,
things we don't know about?

978
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:05,255
You'll figure it out.
I have faith in you.

979
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,560
And if I refuse,
you'll do it anyway, right?

980
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:17,175
Well, the truth is,
I have faith in you too.

981
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,683
I hope it wasn't too much trouble
having us over.

982
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:33,725
No, I love having a house full of people.

983
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:35,886
Especially now.

984
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:38,963
Hey, Julio, I heard a rumor
that you and Barry...

985
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:41,966
...were up for a citation
for tracking down Pike's hideout.

986
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:47,130
Well, the chief's big on parchment
and gold seals. What I could use is a raise.

987
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:49,936
Hey, talk about rumors.
What about this Flash character?

988
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:51,840
The red ghost? The phantom?

989
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:54,481
You get tear-gassed,
you'd be seeing demons too.

990
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:59,086
Yeah, but a cop at the station saw him.
I'm starting to think there is something.

991
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:01,881
Oh, look, Barry hasn't touched
his breakfast.

992
01:31:02,056 --> 01:31:06,959
- Where's he gotten to?
- He's outside. With Shawn.

993
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:10,723
Your dad ran anchor
on the relay team, see?

994
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:13,992
And our school made all-city finals.

995
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:18,537
When Jay got the baton that day,
we were dead last, right?

996
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:24,201
But Jay wouldn't give up. I mean, he kept
going until he passed every man but one.

997
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:28,342
And he won the silver medal.

998
01:31:31,552 --> 01:31:36,387
But if that race had been 10 yards longer,
man, he would have won the gold.

999
01:31:37,592 --> 01:31:40,083
Because Jay didn't really get beaten.

1000
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:43,627
He just ran out of track.

1001
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,656
Uncle Barry...

1002
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:49,926
...I miss my dad.

1003
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:52,966
Yeah.

1004
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:56,233
I miss him too.

1005
01:31:58,379 --> 01:32:00,210
Shawn...

1006
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:03,206
...I want you to know something.

1007
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:08,552
Any time you need me,
I'll be there for you.

1008
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:11,953
I couldn't run like your dad...

1009
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:15,455
...but I'll be there in a flash.

1010
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:46,543
