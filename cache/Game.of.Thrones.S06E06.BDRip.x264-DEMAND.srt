1
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,444
Burn them all!

2
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,926
Where's my sister?

3
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,651
Burn them all!

4
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,446
Please.

5
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,365
Burn them. Burn them all!

6
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,329
Burn them all!

7
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,926
Meera.

8
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,485
They found us.

9
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,324
I'm so sorry.

10
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,090
Come with me, now.

11
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,367
The dead don't rest.

12
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,002
It's so green.

13
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,004
Oh, yes.

14
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,881
Once you get south of the Riverlands, very
different sorts of trees start to take over.

15
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,362
Maple, elm, beech, poplar.

16
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,050
The odd willow.

17
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,648
And, of course,
now that summer's over,

18
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,122
you'll start seeing
the autumn colors coming in.

19
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,125
Still, you'll find more green here
than anywhere else.

20
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,044
You're nervous.
You're a nervous talker.

21
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,041
That's not any better,
being a nervous mute.

22
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,480
I didn't think
I'd ever come back here,

23
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,764
after my father made me renounce
my title and inheritance

24
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,050
and, well, threatened
to kill me if I didn't.

25
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,248
A person just doesn't
feel welcome at that point.

26
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,689
And I certainly didn't expect
to be introducing him to my family.

27
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,050
So you know what to tell them.

28
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,531
That little Sam is your baby.

29
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,443
Yes, now that's very important.

30
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,967
If he thinks that little Sam is his
grandchild, he'll take you in.

31
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,602
He'll get an education.
He'll learn to read.

32
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,286
And you can help teach him.

33
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,760
What did you tell your family
about me?

34
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,247
I told them I met you in the North.

35
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,364
Did you tell them how far north?

36
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,125
Well, it wasn't
a very large piece of parchment.

37
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,202
You didn't tell them
where I'm really from?

38
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,964
You didn't tell them
I'm a wildling?

39
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,166
The thing is...

40
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,050
My father doesn't like wildlings.

41
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,209
He hoped I'd make a man of myself
by killing some bloody wildlings,

42
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,608
so it's probably a good subject
to avoid if at all possible.

43
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,885
I think we're here.

44
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,841
Sam.

45
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,206
Oh, Sam.

46
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,685
Oh, hello, Mother.

47
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,204
I never thought I'd see you again.

48
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,566
You look wonderful.

49
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,001
Talla?

50
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,767
Gods, you're a woman now.

51
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,411
Father says I have to marry
Symun Fossoway.

52
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,450
- He has yellow teeth...
- That's enough, Talla.

53
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,766
Mother, this is Gilly.

54
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,281
Oh, my...

55
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,610
You are lovely.

56
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,087
I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

57
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,681
Oh, and...

58
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,370
And this,

59
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,727
this is our son Samwell.

60
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,322
Hello, little one.

61
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,960
It's me, your grandmother.

62
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,490
May I hold him?

63
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,486
Yes, of course.

64
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,608
You have a curious mind, I can tell.

65
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,411
You'll be a scholar like your father.

66
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,529
Where is Father? And Dickon?

67
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,490
They're on a hunt.

68
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,648
They'll join us for dinner.

69
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,281
Come inside. Such a journey.

70
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,124
You must be exhausted.

71
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,046
Come, you'll be wanting a bath
after all that travel.

72
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,724
And a dress for dinner.

73
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,450
You can wear one of mine.

74
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,124
What's your color?

75
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,601
Midnight blue or silver?

76
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,286
Silver, maybe. Come.

77
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,362
You can choose
one in my bedroom if you want.

78
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
Is there no other way?

79
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,731
You're afraid for her?

80
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,646
Of course I'm afraid for her!

81
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,721
It just seems very dangerous.

82
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,724
She'll be protected the entire way.

83
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,328
The Faith Militant are very stern
with those who overstep their bounds.

84
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,962
And Queen Margaery
isn't your mother.

85
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,010
I suspect the gods will
predispose the common people

86
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,401
to gentleness on her behalf.

87
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,723
She's truly opened her heart to them.

88
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,009
She's always been very devoted
to the poor and the unfortunate.

89
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,924
And now she's devoted to the gods as well.

90
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,125
Would you like to see her?

91
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,601
Have they hurt you?

92
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,211
Have they mistreated you?

93
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,568
- No, Your Grace.
- I've missed you.

94
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,051
More than you could know.

95
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,691
We'll be together again soon,

96
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,161
and everything
will be better than it was before.

97
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,290
Better how?

98
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,566
Soon the...

99
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,891
Walk of atonement.

100
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,283
He says there's no other way.

101
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,727
Have you spoken to him at all,
the High Sparrow?

102
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,010
Yes, a few times.

103
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,361
- Have you?
- Yes, I have.

104
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,006
He's not quite what we
thought he was, is he?

105
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,326
You think I'm mad. I sound mad.

106
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,570
No. No, you don't.

107
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,605
You could never.

108
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,330
You're right, he's not.

109
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,481
He's a lot more...

110
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,128
He is.

111
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,202
There's something about him.

112
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,282
His way of looking at the world.

113
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,807
It's not an easy thing,
admitting to yourself what you really are.

114
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,803
It's taken me a while.

115
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,844
He's helped me.

116
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,205
What are you talking about?

117
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,488
You're a good person.

118
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,324
You've always been a good person.

119
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,888
You're the best person I know.

120
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,571
I was just telling him
about your devotion to the poor.

121
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,722
Yes, I visited their hovels,

122
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,009
and I fed them soup,
and I made sure I was seen doing it.

123
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,360
I never gave them
what they really needed though.

124
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,163
I've had lots of time to think about
how good I was at seeming good.

125
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,805
All those stories I told myself about who
I was and why I did the things I did.

126
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,486
There were so many lies
in those stories.

127
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,971
I don't understand.

128
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,486
It's all right. It really is.

129
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,607
It's such a relief
to let go of those lies.

130
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,924
What about Loras?

131
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,480
I love my brother.

132
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,082
I will always love my brother.

133
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,771
His soul is pure and perfect.

134
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,803
His sins don't erase that purity,
they only obscure it.

135
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,125
He just needs to atone for them.

136
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,611
We all do.

137
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,482
Sooner or later, one way or another.

138
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,329
The gods have a plan for us all.

139
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,208
It's hard to walk in this.

140
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,002
It's beautiful.

141
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,090
You're beautiful.

142
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,207
This venison, it's very tasty.

143
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,841
Is it from today's hunt?

144
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,931
Well, no. We haven't been able
to cure that one yet.

145
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,849
This is last week's.

146
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,682
Of course. Sorry.

147
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,649
Long journey.

148
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,804
Brought it down from 70 yards.

149
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,001
One shot.

150
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,524
That's a fair distance.

151
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,364
So do you do much hunting
up at the Wall?

152
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,844
Oh, yes. Yes.

153
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,767
A good amount.

154
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,527
North of the Wall,
you don't hunt, you don't eat.

155
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
Mostly deer, or is it elk as well?

156
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,681
Rabbits.

157
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,364
Sometimes squirrels.

158
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,246
I say we, it's my friend Jon mostly.

159
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,084
Sometimes Edd.

160
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,161
And Gilly.

161
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,164
She's quite a good hunter as well.

162
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,721
Huntress.

163
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,968
I imagine
it's common where you're from.

164
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,408
We once met a man, Lord Umber
from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll?

165
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,801
Who said he taught all his daughters
how to hunt.

166
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,282
Your father taught you to hunt?

167
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,450
Our father would never teach us.

168
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,248
I think our father could learn a
thing or two from your father.

169
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,651
That's enough of that.

170
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,770
Samwell, would you care
for more bread?

171
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,084
Yes. Yes, please.
Thank you, Mother.

172
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,886
Not fat enough already?

173
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,531
I traveled south under orders
from the Lord Commander.

174
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,807
- He wants me to...
- I read your letter.

175
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,529
You're to be a maester.

176
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,961
Yes.

177
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,762
And once I have my chain,
I'll return to Castle Black.

178
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,923
I thought the Night's Watch
might make a man of you.

179
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,563
Something resembling a man at least.

180
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,647
You managed to stay soft and fat.

181
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,883
Your nose buried in books.

182
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,005
Spending your life reading
about the achievements of better men.

183
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,243
I'll wager you still can't sit a horse
or wield a sword.

184
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,403
Randyll, to be Maester of the Night's Watch
is a great honor.

185
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,721
He can wield a sword.

186
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,125
He killed a Thenn.

187
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,645
He killed a White Walker.

188
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,011
There's no such thing.

189
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,289
I saw it with my own eyes
on our way down to Castle Black.

190
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,004
He drove a dagger
into the Walker's heart.

191
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,766
He risked his own life
to save mine more than once.

192
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,083
He's a greater warrior
than either of you will ever be.

193
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,451
Your way down to Castle Black?

194
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,802
Where did he kill a White Walker?

195
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,244
Where are you from?

196
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,721
How'd you come to meet my son?

197
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,249
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

198
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,449
- Where?
- Gilly.

199
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,568
- North of the Wall.
- North of the Wall?

200
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,804
You're a wildling.

201
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,481
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war
against these savages for centuries,

202
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,167
and here I sit,
hosting one in my hall,

203
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,091
thanks to my son.

204
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,081
See that sword?

205
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,684
It's called Heartsbane.

206
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,683
It's been in our family for 500 years.

207
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,206
It's Valyrian steel.

208
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,681
Only a handful of them left
in the world.

209
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,970
It's supposed to go to
my firstborn son after I die.

210
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,087
To him.

211
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,001
He will never wield that sword.

212
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,891
If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn
Hill, it would be the end of this house.

213
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,886
I took you for a Mole's Town whore
when I saw you,

214
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,724
and I made my peace with that.

215
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,524
Who else would have him?

216
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,165
But I overestimated him.

217
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,641
No.

218
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,042
It was a wildling whore
that seduced my son.

219
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,528
This you getting back at me, boy?

220
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,964
Bringing that to my table
and making me dine with it?

221
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,888
And you got what you
were after, didn't you?

222
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,371
A bastard.

223
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,489
A half-breed bastard.

224
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,051
Your invitation into our home.

225
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,928
Come, my dear. Talla.

226
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,169
I've lost my appetite.

227
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,801
He dishonors us.

228
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,890
You dishonor yourself.

229
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,043
Your mother's a fine woman.
You're not worthy of her.

230
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,410
To please her, I'll take the wildling in.
She can work in the kitchens.

231
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,211
The bastard will be raised here.

232
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,962
But this will be the last night
you ever spend at Horn Hill.

233
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,887
I'm sorry
I let him treat you that way.

234
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,203
I was afraid he'd turn
you and little Sam away.

235
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,571
I'm not angry at you.

236
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,409
I'm angry that horrible people

237
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,767
can treat good people that way
and get away with it.

238
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,410
When do you have to go?

239
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,289
First light.

240
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,760
Say good-bye to him for me.

241
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,569
You're not what he thinks
you are, Sam.

242
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,648
He doesn't know what you are.

243
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,288
Good-bye, Gilly.

244
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,530
- Sam?
- We're leaving.

245
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,329
- What?
- Get your things.

246
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,527
I don't have any things.

247
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,602
- What are you doing?
- We belong together.

248
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,328
All of us.

249
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,089
What about your mother and sister?

250
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,208
Oh, they'll understand.

251
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,566
Your sister's dress.

252
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,608
She won't mind.

253
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,369
Looks better on you anyway.

254
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,605
Sam.

255
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,849
That's your father's sword.

256
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,890
It's my family's sword.

257
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,405
Sam.

258
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,726
Won't he come for it?

259
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,886
He can bloody well try.

260
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,084
The lion and the rose are one.

261
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,487
I thank the gods above.

262
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,847
And to you, my beauteous bride,

263
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,366
I pledge undying love.

264
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,811
Hail King Joffrey.
Hail Queen Margaery.

265
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,287
I'll drink a toast to my new queen,

266
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,089
for there is no one fairer.

267
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,124
Dear Uncle, will you share my joy
and be my royal cupbearer?

268
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,806
Drink long and deep, my noble king,

269
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,451
from this cup of sweet wine.

270
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,927
The last drink he shall ever take.

271
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,082
And vengeance shall be mine.

272
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,804
Poison!

273
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,325
Murder!

274
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,165
I gasp. I die.

275
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,367
I limp.

276
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,283
And it was he

277
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,444
that poisoned me.

278
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,406
My evil Uncle Imp.

279
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,689
My firstborn son.

280
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,367
My golden lion

281
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,568
foully, falsely slain.

282
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,410
I pray you found a lasting peace,

283
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,289
free from strife and pain.

284
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,047
Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.

285
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,202
Take my life instead.

286
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,762
For I cannot face another day
when my sweet boy is dead.

287
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,646
O woe.

288
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,406
O grief.

289
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,683
O darkest day,
my heart is full of sorrow.

290
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,125
All hope is lost.

291
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,804
All joy is gone.

292
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,402
And there is no tomorrow.

293
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,731
What is that I hear and smell?

294
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,451
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

295
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,091
It's time to see if truth they told,

296
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,881
who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

297
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,122
You beast. You beast.

298
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,127
You killed my wife,
and now you've taken your father's life.

299
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,771
No worse child ever stained this land.

300
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,248
Curse the day I named you.

301
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,524
My greatest crime.

302
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,648
Now I must flee,

303
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,200
and sail across the Narrow Sea

304
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,569
to do unto you more treachery.

305
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,842
Don't fear winter.

306
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,365
Fear me!

307
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,440
Thank you.

308
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,127
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Bianca,

309
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,884
Clarenzo.

310
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,962
I give you Bobono.

311
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,644
I give you Camello.

312
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,325
And last but not least,

313
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,721
sweet Lady Crane.

314
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,689
Give this a good beating.
Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.

315
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,770
That crowd was shit.

316
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,091
Girl.

317
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,330
What are you doing back here?

318
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,447
Nothing.

319
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,930
I saw you the other day
in the audience.

320
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,685
How many times
have you seen this stupid play?

321
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,761
Three times.

322
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,486
Did you pay?

323
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,926
No.

324
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,648
I remember when the players
came to my village.

325
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,371
I didn't have any money,
so I snuck in.

326
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,886
Just like you.

327
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,567
Saw the painted faces, the costumes,
listened to the songs,

328
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,201
cried when the young lovers
died in each other's arms.

329
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,647
I ran off and joined them the next day,
never looked back.

330
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,766
You're very good.

331
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,729
My final speech is shit.

332
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,891
But to be fair to myself,
which I always like to be,

333
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,566
the writing's no good.

334
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,801
So change it.

335
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,851
It would all just be farting,
belching, and slapping without you.

336
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,931
How would you change it?

337
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,920
The queen loves her son more than anything.

338
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,241
And he was taken from her
before she could say good-bye.

339
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,322
She wouldn't just cry.

340
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,969
She would be angry.

341
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,727
She would want to kill the person
who did this to her.

342
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,841
What's your name?

343
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,291
Mercy.

344
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,522
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

345
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,124
Wonderful eyebrows.

346
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,362
Do you like pretending
to be other people?

347
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,527
I have to go.
My father's waiting for me.

348
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,124
Lady Crane, they loved you.

349
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,488
They were sweet. Or drunk.

350
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,806
Drunkenly sweet.

351
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,644
No laugh for Ned's death.

352
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,091
These people are worse than animals.

353
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,610
But they loved her.
They all love her.

354
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,724
Yes, you are adored
by people and animals alike.

355
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,970
I do what I can with what I'm given.

356
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,769
With what you're given?

357
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,369
- Well, I was thinking...
- We're all thinkers now, are we?

358
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,360
Full to the tits with ideas.

359
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,921
I didn't mean...

360
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,561
You have ideas, I have ideas,
he has ideas.

361
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,644
Why should my ideas
have any more value than yours

362
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,003
simply because I've been doing this
my whole life?

363
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,128
Who is anyone to judge my work?

364
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,170
This is my profession.
I know what I'm doing.

365
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,844
You have no right to an opinion.

366
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,925
Careful of that one.

367
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,331
She wants you dead.

368
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,370
And?

369
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,488
As I expected.

370
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,845
A shame.

371
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,962
A girl had many gifts.

372
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,771
You promised me.

373
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,009
Don't let her suffer.

374
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,405
Company, halt!

375
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,247
My lord.

376
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,047
My lord.

377
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,885
My friends, the hour has come.

378
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,808
Madness has overtaken this city

379
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,448
and grasped in its claws
my children.

380
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,564
But now we must drive it back
under the rocks whence it came.

381
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,246
Madness has had its day!

382
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,764
Forward, march!

383
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,284
Rich or poor, noble or common,

384
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,289
if we sin, we must atone.

385
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,131
Margaery of House Tyrell
came to us a sinner.

386
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,171
She stood before the gods
in the holy Sept and lied.

387
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,171
She turned a blind eye
to her brother's sins.

388
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,282
She disgraced her house,
her king, and herself.

389
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,723
Company, halt!

390
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,003
Face front!

391
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,846
Turn!

392
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,161
Lord Tyrell.

393
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,361
Ser Jaime.

394
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,211
Sorry to interrupt.

395
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,210
We're here for Queen Margaery
and Ser Loras Tyrell.

396
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,363
Give them to us,
and we'll be on our way.

397
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,528
I don't have the authority
to give them to you.

398
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,291
And you don't have the
authority to take them.

399
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,203
That's right.

400
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,841
Lock spears!

401
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,281
I speak for King Tommen
of House Baratheon, First of His Name.

402
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,565
The gods don't recognize
his authority in this matter.

403
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,208
You've already insulted one great house.

404
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,246
It won't happen twice.

405
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,290
Every last Sparrow will die

406
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,250
before Margaery Tyrell
walks down that street.

407
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,045
To die in the service of the gods
would please each and every one of us.

408
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,523
We yearn for it.

409
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,684
But there is no call for it today.

410
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,964
There will be no walk of atonement.

411
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,329
Order up.

412
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,490
Queen Margaery has already
atoned for her sins

413
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,608
by bringing another

414
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,728
into the true light of the Seven.

415
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,811
Together we announce a new
age of harmony.

416
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,925
A holy alliance

417
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,121
between the Crown and the Faith.

418
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,243
Long live King Tommen
and bless you, Queen Margaery!

419
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,766
The Crown and the Faith

420
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,890
are the twin pillars
upon which the world rests.

421
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,762
Together we will restore
the Seven Kingdoms to glory.

422
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,330
What's happening?

423
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,801
He's beaten us.
That's what's happening.

424
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,570
When you attack the Faith,
you attack the Crown.

425
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,448
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit

426
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,251
to serve as Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

427
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,921
I've been a member of the Kingsguard
since before you were born.

428
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,130
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do anything.

429
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,490
I have to answer to the gods.

430
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,722
Not when you're sitting in that chair.

431
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,368
The Crown's decision on
this matter is final.

432
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,725
Will I be walking naked in the streets?

433
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,201
Or will I spend a few months
in the Sept dungeons first

434
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,362
to teach me about the gods' mercy?

435
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,363
You have served your house
and your king faithfully for many years.

436
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,204
And you will continue to do so.

437
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,770
But not in this city.

438
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,284
You've lost it?

439
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,681
Yes, Father.

440
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,809
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

441
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,805
Presumably you still know where it is.

442
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,042
You didn't lose Riverrun.

443
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,122
You let the Blackfish take it from you.

444
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,363
He surprised us.
He knows the castle better than anyone.

445
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,649
You did lose the Blackfish
after the Red Wedding.

446
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,810
You had him right here in this hall,
and you let him leave.

447
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,928
And when I told you
to hunt him down and kill him,

448
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,764
you couldn't find him.

449
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,969
That's what it means to lose something.

450
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,369
Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.

451
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,731
I don't think it's fair to blame us...

452
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,883
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

453
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,931
swore oaths to them
and their stinking fish banners.

454
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,646
Not again. Riverrun is ours.

455
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,927
Take it back.

456
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,445
We don't have the men.

457
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,922
We've got 10 times as many men
as the damn Blackfish.

458
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,049
The Mallisters have risen
against us. And the Blackwoods.

459
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,283
The Brotherhood Without Banners
is rallying the commoners against us,

460
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,408
raiding our supply trains and camps.

461
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,484
Riverrun can withstand
a siege for a year.

462
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,005
If I want excuses,
I'll put her in charge.

463
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,844
They're laughing at us.

464
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,607
All across the Riverlands,
right down to King's Landing,

465
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,170
they're laughing at us.

466
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,370
I hear it in my sleep!

467
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,727
I'm not dead yet,
unfortunately for you.

468
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,203
And I'll not leave this world
until they all choke on that laughter.

469
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,044
Take that castle back.

470
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,282
He'll never yield, Father.

471
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,886
He'll yield.

472
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,405
You'll show him the knife you used

473
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,166
to kill Robb Stark's child
in its whore mother's belly,

474
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,322
and you'll show him
the knife you used

475
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,681
to open his niece's throat.

476
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,967
And you'll remind him who it was

477
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,125
that got married
at the Red Wedding in the first place.

478
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,526
His nephew.

479
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,402
Cheer up, Lord Edmure.

480
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,763
You're going home.

481
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,687
I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.

482
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,127
Apparently Walder Frey
can't manage it on his own

483
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,248
because he's 400 years old.

484
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,645
Sent me with an army to the Riverlands
and a siege that could last months.

485
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,964
Better you're elsewhere at the head
of an army than in the Sept dungeons.

486
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,924
I'm not going to the Riverlands.

487
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,171
What then?

488
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,086
I'm going to give Bronn the largest
bag of gold anyone's ever seen

489
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,449
and have him gather
the best killers he knows.

490
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,683
I'll take them to the Sept,
and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head

491
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,683
and every other Sparrow head
I can find.

492
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,886
You can't.

493
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,361
He has our son!
He stole our son!

494
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,524
He's torn our family apart.

495
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,887
How should we treat people
who tear us apart?

496
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,642
We should treat them without mercy,
and we will.

497
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,007
But if you kill the High Sparrow,
you won't leave the Sept alive.

498
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,447
And without you,
this is all for nothing.

499
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,843
Stand at the head of our army
where you belong,

500
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,241
where Father wanted you.

501
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,561
Show our men
where their loyalties belong.

502
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,563
Show them what Lannisters are,

503
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,849
what we do to our enemies.

504
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,642
And take that stupid little castle back
because it's ours and because you can.

505
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,803
You'll stand trial soon.
I need to be here for you.

506
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,322
It will be a trial by combat.

507
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,921
I have the Mountain.

508
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,166
They've made us both stronger,
all of them.

509
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,843
They have no idea how strong we are.

510
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,210
No idea what we're going to do to them.

511
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,607
We've always been together.

512
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,286
We'll always be together.

513
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,681
We're the only two people in the world.

514
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,609
Why did you help us?

515
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,091
The three-eyed raven sent for me.

516
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,321
The three-eyed raven's dead.

517
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,721
Now he lives again.

518
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,411
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

519
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,524
A fearless boy.

520
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,570
Loved to climb the castle walls,
frighten his mother.

521
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,927
Who are you?

522
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,320
Uncle Benjen.

523
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,129
The last letter Jon wrote me
said you had been lost beyond the Wall.

524
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,121
I led a ranging party deep into the North
to find White Walkers.

525
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,281
They found us.

526
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,882
A White Walker stabbed me in the gut
with a sword of ice.

527
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,370
Left me there to die.

528
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,726
To turn.

529
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,205
The Children found me.

530
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,646
Stopped the Walker's magic
from taking hold.

531
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,006
How?

532
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,401
The same way they made the Walkers
in the first place.

533
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,811
You saw it yourself.

534
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,971
Dragonglass.

535
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,723
A shard of dragonglass
plunged into your heart.

536
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,971
You are the three-eyed raven now.

537
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,801
I didn't have time to learn.
I can't control anything.

538
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,851
You must learn to control it
before the Night King comes.

539
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,851
Drink.

540
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,729
One way or another,

541
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,201
he will find his way
to the world of men.

542
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,889
When he does,

543
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,850
you will be there waiting for him.

544
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,529
And you will be ready.

545
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,202
Everything all right?

546
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,288
How many days' ride to Meereen?

547
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,363
A week at best.

548
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,730
How many ships will I need
to bring my khalasar to Westeros?

549
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,722
Dothraki and all their horses,
the Unsullied, the Second Sons...

550
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,450
1,000 ships easily.

551
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,563
- Probably more.
- And who has that many?

552
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,126
Nobody.

553
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,371
Nobody yet.

554
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,081
So we ride for Meereen,
and after that we sail for Westeros.

555
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,406
And what then?

556
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,604
I take what is mine.

557
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,286
You weren't made to sit
on a chair in a palace.

558
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,762
What was I made for?

559
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,401
You're a conqueror,
Daenerys Stormborn.

560
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,084
Wait here.

561
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,891
I'm going after her.

562
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,405
Wait for me here.

563
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,162
Every khal who ever lived
chose three blood riders

564
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,764
to fight beside him and guard his way.

565
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,567
But I am not a khal.

566
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,001
I will not choose three blood riders.

567
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,328
I choose you all.

568
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,921
I will ask more of you than any khal

569
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,887
has ever asked of his khalassar!

570
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,088
Will you ride the wooden horses
across the black salt sea?

571
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,930
Will you kill my enemies
in their iron suits

572
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,562
and tear down their stone houses?

573
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,970
Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms,

574
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,563
the gift Khal Drogo promised me

575
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,961
before the Mother of Mountains?

576
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,321
Are you with me?

577
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,407
Now

578
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,324
and always?
