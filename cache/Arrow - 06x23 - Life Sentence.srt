1
00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:02,192
<i>Previously on</i>
"Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:03,794
Diaz has people
everywhere.

3
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:05,442
He controls
Star City's government,

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,543
its infrastructure,
and its police force.

5
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:11,306
Diaz went after this
instead of going after Curtis.

6
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:12,760
What if these are all
of Diaz's books,

7
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:14,142
everyone he has
on his payroll?

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,351
We could liberate
the city.

9
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,006
Your digital sniffer,
can it read the drive?

10
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:18,243
If you get me close enough,
for sure.

11
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,563
Diaz's base of operations
is too secure.

12
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:23,200
We can't move on it
without losing people.

13
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:24,624
You want my help?

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,687
I'm gonna need you
to say the words.

15
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,624
I am the Green Arrow.

16
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:38,987
Sentries
are not responding.

17
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:41,114
You know, somebody want to
tell me why I got to do

18
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:42,681
everything
in this place mysel...

19
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:45,436
Why don't you watch
where you...

20
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,544
You got to be
a special kind of stupid

21
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:49,819
to be coming back
here alone.

22
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:51,690
I'm not alone.

23
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:21,487
- Move! - Move!
- Move!

24
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:05,210
- Clear!
- Clear!

25
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:06,306
Clear.

26
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:07,754
Where's Diaz?

27
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,171
Where is Diaz?

28
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:13,407
No sign of Diaz.

29
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,091
- What about Knyazev?
- Same.

30
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:17,335
Precinct reported
he's not there either.

31
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,727
This isn't over yet.

32
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:28,703
<font color=#FF00FF>*ARROW*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 06  Episode 23</font>

33
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,755
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Life Sentence"</font>

34
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:35,428
Diaz clearly has
a third base of operations

35
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:36,598
we don't know about.

36
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,196
Yo, Hoss. Mask?

37
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,175
Mr. Queen and I have come
to an understanding.

38
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:42,348
Even if we didn't,
your identity is hardly

39
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:44,535
a well-kept secret,
Mr. Ramirez.

40
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,101
So you're done
trying to throw us in jail?

41
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:49,605
Everyone has immunity
from prosecution, Rene.

42
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:52,917
The FBI recognizes that
Diaz is the clear and present danger.

43
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:55,175
Better late
than never, I suppose.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,172
That immunity
deal does include me, right,

45
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:58,586
because I'd really
like to not spend

46
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:01,566
the rest of my life
in prison if I can avoid it.

47
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:04,498
How did Diaz know
we were moving in on him tonight?

48
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:06,017
We've rounded up
the SCPD,

49
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:08,045
but Diaz still controls
dozens of city officials.

50
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,352
Diaz has a list
of all of them.

51
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:10,438
He keeps it
on his person.

52
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,121
Once we take, Diaz,
we won't need a list.

53
00:03:12,198 --> 00:03:14,019
We need to interrogate
all the people we rounded up,

54
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:16,372
see if we can get one of them
to give up Diaz's location.

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,520
Oh. They won't
give it up.

56
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,489
They're more afraid of
them than they are of us.

57
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:21,012
They also know
without corroboration,

58
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,302
Diaz or this list
of his,

59
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,238
we'll have to kick
them in 48 hours.

60
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,057
Where's he going?

61
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:30,370
Probably to go talk
to his guy on the inside.

62
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:38,402
- Zdrahstvuyte.
- Anatoly.

63
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:40,721
Big night for you,
kapiushon.

64
00:03:40,798 --> 00:03:43,581
How you turn FBI
from foe to friend, huh?

65
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:45,368
Same way you did me?

66
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:46,549
Where's Diaz?

67
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,454
Eh, he's been on the move
ever since he heard

68
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:49,925
FBI coming to town.

69
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:52,462
When he settles,
I want to know where.

70
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:55,010
Hmm. I'll try my best,
but... he's not

71
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:57,238
in very trusting mood
these days.

72
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,765
What?

73
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:06,860
Ok. Poka. Phew.

74
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:08,975
My sister.

75
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:12,150
What you Americans
call high maintenance. Heh.

76
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:17,462
You avoided the raid.

77
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:23,126
Yeah. I got hungry,
therefore lucky. Heh.

78
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:25,235
Got dinner.

79
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:27,548
When I got back here,

80
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:31,501
FBI all over place like
ants at picnic.

81
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:37,827
So what is your
next move?

82
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,725
You lost your army.

83
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,608
I made some new friends.

84
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,741
New friends?

85
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:48,491
The Longbow Hunters.

86
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,429
Thought those
were a myth.

87
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:54,538
They're very real.

88
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,257
We're going somewhere
to mount our counterattack.

89
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,327
Be there in an hour.

90
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:14,489
Yeah. I love
you, sweetie. Ok. Bye-bye.

91
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:16,554
- Lyla?
- Yeah.

92
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,930
Yeah. She, J.J., and William are
at the NORAD bunker,

93
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:22,721
but she would
much rather be here.

94
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:24,429
We have
enough backup.

95
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:25,761
A son needs
his parents.

96
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:27,222
And yours doesn't?

97
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:29,304
I'm gonna see
this through, Oliver.

98
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:31,679
Thought you might
say that,

99
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,280
so I think you
should dress the part.

100
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,234
I had a spare
made up.

101
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:46,858
There's no rule saying there can't
be more than one Green Arrow.

102
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:51,037
I should have done this
from the beginning.

103
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:53,197
Oliver, our disagreement
was never about the uniform.

104
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:54,655
I know that.

105
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:59,319
I'd like to apologize
for any part that I played in it.

106
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,741
I really thought
I wanted this mantle.

107
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,632
It means something.

108
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,499
You've made it
mean something.

109
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:16,616
When our city looks at it,
it gives them hope, Oliver,

110
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,390
and it would be diminished
if there was more than one.

111
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:26,757
For everything along
the way, thank you.

112
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:39,552
Hello!
Uh, excuse me.

113
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,647
Hello, everybody. Heh.

114
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,186
My name is Anatoly Knyazev,

115
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:46,618
and I'm here
to turn myself in.

116
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:48,309
Tch.

117
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:51,683
We... we also have, uh,
costume parties in Russia.

118
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,950
It's always great fun.

119
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:54,526
What do you have,
Anatoly?

120
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:56,000
Address for Diaz.

121
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,774
He said to meet him there
in one hour,

122
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,584
but he's not
going to be alone.

123
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,438
He's bringing
Longbow Hunters.

124
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,532
Long-what, now?

125
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:05,717
3 assassins that even
the League is afraid of.

126
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:08,693
Or they were because the last one
died out in the 1950s.

127
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,448
Or that's what
they wanted people to think.

128
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:11,618
We got the FBI
backing us.

129
00:07:11,695 --> 00:07:13,548
Please tell me we're
not afraid of 3 guys.

130
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,667
Hell, no.

131
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:15,948
All right.
Let's get ready to move.

132
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:17,599
I'll go tell
Agent Watson.

133
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,244
Wow. It's funny.
Everything always comes down

134
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,187
to a signature
on a piece of paper.

135
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:28,035
Diaz's crimes are local,

136
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,058
which means the bureau
needs municipal authority

137
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:31,157
to operate in Star City.

138
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:33,848
Well, now you got it.

139
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:38,675
- Heh.
- What is it?

140
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:40,428
Got a location
on Diaz.

141
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:42,102
This'll be
over tonight.

142
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:43,192
Excuse me.

143
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:45,248
Hey, honey.

144
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:46,850
Hey, daddy.

145
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,826
So the relationship
between me and your daughter,

146
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,245
it took a turn.

147
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:54,967
I don't think she's, uh...
She's into me anymore.

148
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:57,014
- Listen to me.
- No!

149
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:58,858
You listen to me,

150
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:01,459
or Laurel dies
a second time!

151
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:04,431
What do you want?

152
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:08,092
For the mayor to kick
the FBI out of my city.

153
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:11,186
Do it tonight...

154
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:14,100
or Laurel's dead.

155
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,990
Go to hell.

156
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:23,418
What was that?

157
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:28,271
Nothing. You said you're ready
to move on Diaz tonight.

158
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:31,803
I'm ready to come down
on him like God's own righteous fury.

159
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:33,675
Do it.

160
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:38,557
I don't think your daddy
loves you anymore.

161
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:41,350
I think if you were
the real Laurel,

162
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:44,232
he'd already be here.

163
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:45,582
Go to hell.

164
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,468
That's a witty response.

165
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:49,526
I was expecting better.

166
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,373
Do you know what
the funny thing is?

167
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,795
You moved on me
because of him.

168
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,466
You got yourself
in this situation

169
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,870
because of him!

170
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:01,803
You could have
skipped town,

171
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:04,053
but you came
after me!

172
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,636
Was you afraid of
what I was gonna do

173
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,819
to your daddy
when you were gone?

174
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:16,483
Huh? Come on, baby.
Talk to me.

175
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:18,688
Talk to me!

176
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,216
We're on site.

177
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:23,240
The FBI has graciously
given me control

178
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,435
of their keyhole satellites,
which I got to say

179
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,925
are a lot easier to operate
when they aren't being hacked.

180
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,529
All right. Listen up.

181
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:31,770
Diaz may have lost
his police force,

182
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,089
but we believe he still
has his personal security

183
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,876
and Quadrant muscle
backing him up.

184
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:37,881
No warning shots.

185
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:39,819
Let's move out.

186
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,282
If this is where Diaz is planning
on making his last stand,

187
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,493
I would have expected
more guys with guns.

188
00:09:57,672 --> 00:09:58,933
Not seeing
anything.

189
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,580
I'm getting a big thermal reading from
inside the northwest corner.

190
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,933
That's where we're
headed. Stand by.

191
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,299
Son of a bitch.

192
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:27,433
What is it?

193
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:29,044
Laser tripwires.

194
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,117
Tripwires to what?

195
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:38,269
Triacetone triperoxide.

196
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,566
It's the thermal source.

197
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:43,179
Diaz was never here.
It's a trap.

198
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,131
Hang tight. We're
almost at your position.

199
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,712
Negative. If you go in
there, if anybody moves,

200
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:51,987
the whole place
will go up.

201
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:53,422
If we can't move,
we can't get to the bombs.

202
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:54,540
How are we supposed
to disarm them?

203
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:57,112
I am working on that.
Everyone else, just get clear.

204
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,237
We can't leave Rene.

205
00:10:58,314 --> 00:10:59,760
No. There might be
more explosives rigged.

206
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:00,963
Just please get away
from the building.

207
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,454
You heard her.
Let's go.

208
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:04,362
Talk to me,
Blondie.

209
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:06,469
I'm tracing a radio signal
to the explosives.

210
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:08,130
In case Diaz gets impatient,

211
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:09,786
wants to set off
bomb himself.

212
00:11:09,863 --> 00:11:11,182
If I can piggyback
off the signal,

213
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:13,641
I might be able
to fool the triggers

214
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,086
into thinking that
you're not moving.

215
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:17,505
Might?
You can't see this,

216
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:18,826
but there's enough
explosives in here

217
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:19,834
to send us
into orbit.

218
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,893
Pressure is not
helping, Rene.

219
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:25,255
If the bombs can be
triggered remotely,

220
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,673
Diaz can kill us
anytime.

221
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,493
We're not making it out
of here, are we?

222
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,767
Hey, Peanut. It's daddy.

223
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:45,998
Nope. Everything's fine.
I'm safe.

224
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:48,121
I just wanted to hear
your voice...

225
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:52,683
And tell you
that I love you...

226
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,519
And I'm so proud of you.

227
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:59,150
You give my life meaning
every single day.

228
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:04,017
Yeah. You're
my everything, Peanut,

229
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:07,260
and I need you
to know that.

230
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,105
Daddy's got to go.

231
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:13,308
I love you.

232
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:20,095
I'll see you soon.
Ok. Bye.

233
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,756
Can we get in
through the roof?

234
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,780
Negative. Blowing
the roof will set off the TATP.

235
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:30,548
Stand by while I clone
the trigger frequency.

236
00:12:35,124 --> 00:12:36,920
- Hello.
- So I'm curious.

237
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,337
How many did I get?

238
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:41,263
- You suhkin syn.
- You betray me,

239
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,156
and I'm
the son of a bitch?

240
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,776
The ones trapped
in there with those explosives,

241
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:47,744
they're gonna die
in a blink,

242
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:49,978
but you, Anatoly...

243
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:55,470
I'm gonna make it
last for days with you.

244
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:58,725
He triggered
the explosives,

245
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:00,727
but I'm bouncing the signal
off a bunch of satellites.

246
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:01,905
You have 7 seconds!

247
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,484
Move!

248
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,710
Come on!

249
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,429
You ok?

250
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,907
Thought I'd check in
on you.

251
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,704
I'm fine, Hoss.

252
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,720
Agent Watson told me
about your call with Zoe.

253
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:57,821
I thought I was gonna
die in that room.

254
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:01,704
I just wanted
to say good-bye.

255
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,854
Tell her how proud
you are of her?

256
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:06,173
There's not enough words
to say how much.

257
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:11,610
I feel the same way
about you, Rene.

258
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,769
When I first met you,
I... I didn't think

259
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:19,904
that you were much more
than a... thug

260
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:24,650
in a... heh...
In a ridiculous costume.

261
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:27,228
You're no prize
yourself, Hoss.

262
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,759
I judged you.

263
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:34,061
For far too long,
I judged you,

264
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:37,572
and...
that was a mistake.

265
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:40,582
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:45,189
I think that you're
a good man, Rene.

267
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:51,496
I think that you're the type of man
that this... this city deserves.

268
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:54,194
I know it seems like
I don't give a crap

269
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:56,332
about what anyone
thinks,

270
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,746
but this means a lot.

271
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:00,994
Good.

272
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,680
Guys!

273
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:09,159
We have another problem.

274
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:12,408
I told Diaz
to go to hell

275
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:14,048
because you were about
to move on him.

276
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,437
It was deception.

277
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,704
He learned I was
helping you,

278
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,007
and he
manipulated me.

279
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,515
Means we're right
back to square one,

280
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:21,307
not knowing
where Diaz is.

281
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,315
But now we
have a way to find out.

282
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:27,518
You tell Diaz you want to
see Laurel, proof of life.

283
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,398
We follow you to her,
her to Diaz.

284
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:31,704
You go in there guns blazing,
my daughter takes the first bullet.

285
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:34,190
From what Oliver tells me, she's not
actually your daughter,

286
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:36,768
and she's a criminal
that made her own bed.

287
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:38,648
This isn't
a hostage situation.

288
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:40,187
Our objective
hasn't changed.

289
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:42,182
- Oliver, please.
- We can keep her safe.

290
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:44,066
How? The first thing
he'll do when he sees you coming

291
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,461
- is kill her!
- I think this is

292
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:46,693
a risk we need to take.

293
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,537
Yeah? Would you be taking
that risk if this was our Laurel,

294
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,429
or is that the kind
of risk that got her killed

295
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:54,138
in the first damn place?

296
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,497
What the hell
do you want?

297
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:05,214
To give you
a second chance.

298
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:07,593
When you told me
to go to hell,

299
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:10,627
you know, I figured
that you figured

300
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,874
your buddies were
about to take me down.

301
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,425
Well, it didn't
work out that way,

302
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,454
so now we're back
to where we started...

303
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:21,448
You kicking the FBI out of here
in exchange for Laurel's life.

304
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:24,952
I'd need to see her first,
proof of life.

305
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:26,632
I'll send you
the address.

306
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:29,608
Listen. You better
come alone

307
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:32,979
because if something
happens that I don't like

308
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:36,573
something's gonna happen
to Laurel that you don't like.

309
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,425
Anyone ever tell you
it's rude to sneak up on people?

310
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:56,837
Diaz?

311
00:16:58,665 --> 00:16:59,883
He's gonna kill her.

312
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,760
I won't let that
happen, Quentin.

313
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,486
What about Watson, huh?

314
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:06,453
Doesn't seem
so important to her.

315
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,495
Just let me worry
about Samanda Watson

316
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:11,979
and let me try to
keep Laurel safe.

317
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:13,474
I don't see
how you can, Oliver.

318
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:17,518
You can start
by trusting me, please.

319
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:21,361
I mean, I've earned it.
We've known each other

320
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:22,976
for a very long time,
Quentin.

321
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,893
Heh. A lifetime.

322
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:27,173
Yeah.

323
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:29,883
We've come a long way,
you and me.

324
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,190
It's been getting better
since the first time you arrested me.

325
00:17:34,157 --> 00:17:36,143
You know, I've always
been curious...

326
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,801
How'd you beat
that lie detector anyway?

327
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:44,213
It-It just comes down to...
keeping a regular heart rate.

328
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,830
I got a pacemaker
that does that.

329
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:47,306
I didn't know you
had a pacemaker.

330
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:50,244
I got it after that Mirakuru business
a few years back.

331
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:52,242
The old ticker couldn't
take that pounding. Heh.

332
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,496
Yeah.

333
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,825
Truth be told, I don't know if
I could take it now.

334
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:59,923
Yes, it can, ok,
because you're tough.

335
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:04,956
Laurel is tough, too,
so trust me...

336
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:09,346
And this
will all work out.

337
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:36,307
You were supposed
to bring Laurel.

338
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:37,951
I give the orders.

339
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:39,054
He's clean.

340
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:41,175
And you're gonna give
an order as mayor

341
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:43,416
to get the FBI out of here,

342
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:45,947
and you're gonna do it
at a press conference.

343
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,458
Satellite track is clean.
Audio signal is 5 by 5.

344
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:49,796
Everyone get ready
to move!

345
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:52,088
Not going anywhere until we know
where he's keeping Laurel.

346
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:53,560
Not our objective.

347
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,369
You want me to
hold a press conference

348
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,523
before you even let me
see my daughter?

349
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,393
You have a problem
with that?

350
00:18:59,675 --> 00:19:02,085
I'm not doing anything
until I see her alive.

351
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:04,206
What the hell is he doing?

352
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,377
The FBI is tracking
me by satellite.

353
00:19:07,454 --> 00:19:09,922
They're gonna move on you
unless we move right now.

354
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:11,437
Now take me
to my daughter.

355
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,034
Son of a bitch!

356
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:15,628
Get him in the car.

357
00:19:16,462 --> 00:19:18,995
All units,
move now! Go!

358
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:26,470
Can your satellite
track him?

359
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:28,086
- I've lost him.
- Your friend just

360
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:29,263
blew this whole operation

361
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,005
and our best chance
to get Diaz,

362
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,307
and his daughter's
still gonna die.

363
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:42,360
When this is over,

364
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,278
I'm bringing your friend Quentin up
on obstruction.

365
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:46,315
Our immunity arrangement
doesn't extend to him.

366
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,470
He was trying to
save Laurel.

367
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:48,898
Well, I'm trying to
save this city,

368
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,695
the city your friend's supposed
to be the mayor of.

369
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,690
I can't believe
he'd do something so reckless.

370
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:55,166
Or stupid. He knows Diaz
will kill him and Laurel.

371
00:19:55,243 --> 00:19:56,325
What the hell
was he thinking?

372
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,467
He wasn't.
That's the problem.

373
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,176
Before Quentin went
to see Diaz,

374
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:05,658
he went out of his way to tell me that
he had a pacemaker.

375
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,486
Yeah, and he's never
told us that before.

376
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:09,747
So why would he
say something now?

377
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,971
- You can track a pacemaker.
- You know I can.

378
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:16,124
Quentin knew that Diaz's man
was gonna frisk him for a tracker

379
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:18,613
just like he knew that Diaz
wasn't going to actually bring

380
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,833
Laurel to the meet,

381
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,091
so Quentin had Diaz
bring him to her,

382
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:25,850
knowing that we
could track him.

383
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:27,927
How long will it take you
to find him?

384
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:30,067
Give me a high-speed
connection and a few minutes.

385
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,136
Agh!

386
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:34,467
You wanted to see her,
now you see her.

387
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:36,779
I'm a man of my word.

388
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:39,951
Great. Now let her go.

389
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:42,368
I just promised
proof of life.

390
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,897
We'll see how long
that lasts.

391
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:53,216
Hey. Felicity has
Quentin's location.

392
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,515
It's an abandoned
chemical plant

393
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:55,544
on the border
of Pennytown.

394
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,807
We're gonna move out
in 5 minutes.

395
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:59,635
- I'll be ready.
- The FBI's only objective is Diaz.

396
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:01,472
They're gonna do
their best to keep Quentin safe,

397
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:04,139
but they don't care if Black Siren is
collateral damage.

398
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:05,670
Your point?

399
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:10,704
My point, Dinah, is that it's up to us
to keep her safe.

400
00:21:12,627 --> 00:21:15,553
I know that you have
put your vendetta aside

401
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,618
for the sake
of the mission.

402
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,349
And you want to make sure
I keep it that way.

403
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,115
I want to say
thank you.

404
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,071
It takes
a very big person

405
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:28,451
to not... seek vengeance
for someone they love.

406
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:32,217
If I haven't always
been sensitive to that,

407
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,935
I'm truly sorry.

408
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,826
I'm sorry I was
so hard on you.

409
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:42,584
You know, the truth is

410
00:21:43,573 --> 00:21:46,367
I respect you more
than you could ever know.

411
00:21:47,895 --> 00:21:50,982
You put together
a team of heroes.

412
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,006
That's no small thing.

413
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:00,576
- I'm gonna go get ready.
- All right.

414
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:04,383
- Hey.
- What is going on?

415
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,412
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you've been giving

416
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,355
the Oliver farewell tour
all around this place,

417
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:10,274
including giving John
the hood.

418
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:13,050
You know, everyone's
wondering what did you

419
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:16,118
have to give Watson
to get her to give us immunity,

420
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:18,594
and I'm just gonna go
out on a limb here

421
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:23,368
and guess that it was
giving up being the Green Arrow.

422
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:27,086
- Sort of.
- You can't be serious.

423
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,412
What happened to becoming
your best self?

424
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:31,748
I don't know if I
believe that anymore.

425
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:33,883
Oliver, this is
who you are.

426
00:22:34,444 --> 00:22:36,641
You can't let Watson get
in the middle of that.

427
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:37,944
She's not.

428
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:39,991
It was my idea.

429
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,263
What do you mean,
it was your idea?

430
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,513
Ahem.

431
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:45,840
Uh, sorry to interrupt
what looks like

432
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,425
a pretty serious
marital moment,

433
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:49,243
but everyone's
ready to go.

434
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,602
To be continued. Ok?

435
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,663
Showtime!

436
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:03,180
You're gonna get
in front of the camera,

437
00:23:03,324 --> 00:23:06,115
and you're gonna get
the FBI to leave Star City,

438
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:09,166
or your baby girl
grows a third eye.

439
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,499
He's not gonna
shoot me.

440
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:12,162
You willing to bet
your life?!

441
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:13,388
- Yes.
- Laurel.

442
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:14,556
Yes, I am!

443
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:16,563
You got 5 seconds!

444
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,005
5...

445
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,672
Don't let him
take this city.

446
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:20,759
4...

447
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:23,078
He's bluffing.
He's lying!

448
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,897
3...

449
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:27,205
2...

450
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,347
1!

451
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:30,252
No! Agh!

452
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,907
Gaah!

453
00:23:32,048 --> 00:23:33,224
Daaaahhh!

454
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:36,895
- No! Dad? Daddy.
- Ohh!

455
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,207
Stay with me.
Stay with me, daddy.

456
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:41,814
- Ohh!
- Stay with me!

457
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:43,256
Look at me,
look at me.

458
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,925
- Ugh.
- Stay with me.

459
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:46,619
Errrgh!

460
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:48,821
Hey. Don't waste
your tears.

461
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:50,456
Where I shot him,
it'll take

462
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,709
a good chunk of time
for him to bleed out.

463
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:54,291
Gaaaah!

464
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:57,610
Laurel, you need
to get your dad

465
00:23:57,924 --> 00:23:59,679
to get on the phone

466
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:03,035
and get the feds to go back
to their swamp.

467
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,894
I'll show him
some mercy.

468
00:24:06,297 --> 00:24:07,542
Tss. Aah!

469
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,092
Huh? Like the end
of the movie

470
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:10,887
with the little dog.

471
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:14,215
What's it called?

472
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:16,652
I'm gonna kill you.

473
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:19,972
I'm not
doing anything. Ugh.

474
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,477
All right. We're
gonna do this another way.

475
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,565
Ohh!

476
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,340
Because I'm not
gonna count.

477
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:29,027
Your daughter's
brains

478
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:32,900
are gonna be splattered
on your face!

479
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:35,777
Don't you. Don't you!

480
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:43,098
It'll be all right.

481
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,993
FBI!

482
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:09,799
Quentin!

483
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:12,887
I got him!
Get Diaz!

484
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:23,971
It's ok. Stay...

485
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:25,523
Laurel.

486
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:29,627
Ohh! No.

487
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:35,814
We got to get him
to a hospital.

488
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:09,174
Come on.

489
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,641
I got you.

490
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:11,953
Errrrgh!

491
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,762
I need a chopper!

492
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,298
I don't have 5 minutes!

493
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,531
I agree!

494
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:22,548
You want to shoot me?

495
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:25,812
Do it!

496
00:26:26,203 --> 00:26:28,001
Right here!

497
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:32,860
See, that's your problem.

498
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:35,805
It's always been
your problem!

499
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:42,906
Ugh!

500
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:20,231
He needs
a doctor immediately!

501
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,875
Yes, ma'am.

502
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:28,272
Agh!

503
00:27:29,373 --> 00:27:31,006
Enough!

504
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,310
Hyah!

505
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:36,857
Ugh!

506
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:40,107
Aaagh!

507
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:42,568
Aah!

508
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:47,335
This is my city!

509
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:50,156
You want to stop me,

510
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,359
you're gonna have to
kill me!

511
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:54,076
He's right, Oliver.

512
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:56,514
The movie
with the dog,

513
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:57,819
it's called
"Old Yeller."

514
00:27:57,896 --> 00:27:58,896
No!

515
00:28:06,777 --> 00:28:08,409
What did you do?!

516
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,151
I had to!
I had to end it.

517
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,429
Yeah? You think that fall's
gonna kill him?

518
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:16,301
A girl can only hope.

519
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:19,010
I had him!

520
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,237
We scoured
every inch of this city

521
00:28:22,314 --> 00:28:24,253
and trolled Starling bay.

522
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:27,188
He can't have
gotten far.

523
00:28:27,265 --> 00:28:29,050
He was launched
off a rooftop.

524
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:30,990
He shouldn't have been able
to go anywhere at all.

525
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:32,878
Diaz doesn't go
down easy.

526
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:35,456
You seem pretty sanguine
about it.

527
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,683
It wasn't
a total loss.

528
00:28:39,236 --> 00:28:42,112
Felicity reprogrammed this
with a digital sniffer.

529
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:44,152
I was able to get
close enough to Diaz

530
00:28:44,229 --> 00:28:46,236
to clone the drive
that he wears around his neck.

531
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:49,167
I got government officials,
city employees.

532
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:52,917
We can give you everyone
on his payroll.

533
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:56,831
Huh. We can give you
your city back,

534
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:59,526
but the fact that Diaz
is in the wind,

535
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,534
it doesn't alter
our agreement.

536
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:04,626
I know.

537
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:10,877
- How is he?
- He's septic.

538
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:12,425
They're getting him
ready for surgery.

539
00:29:12,498 --> 00:29:14,059
Rene's in there
with him right now.

540
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:15,642
What about Diaz?

541
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:18,934
You're gonna
be fine, Hoss.

542
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:20,489
These docs are gonna
fix you up.

543
00:29:20,566 --> 00:29:23,215
Yeah. Do me a favor.

544
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,759
Anything, Hoss.

545
00:29:24,882 --> 00:29:28,025
If this thing goes the wrong way
and I don't make it,

546
00:29:28,218 --> 00:29:30,870
d-d-don't call me Hoss
at my funeral.

547
00:29:32,514 --> 00:29:34,142
You're gonna make it.

548
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:36,250
Yeah.

549
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,634
How's he doing?

550
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:45,666
Kind of macabre,
actually.

551
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:47,422
I'll give you guys
a minute.

552
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:49,191
Mm-hmm.

553
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,603
- Hi.
- Ahem.

554
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:56,262
What's the latest
on Diaz?

555
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:00,142
Diaz... ahem...
He got away.

556
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:01,664
How?

557
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:05,071
Doesn't matter.
We'll get him.

558
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:09,548
We do have a list of
everyone that he's been controlling.

559
00:30:10,046 --> 00:30:12,463
FBI is rounding them
up as we speak.

560
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:15,736
- So we can take our city back.
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:18,150
You did good, Oliver.

562
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:21,134
Thank you.
It's not over yet.

563
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:23,658
It is for you.

564
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,970
Am I wrong?

565
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:31,030
I've been dealing
with Samanda Watson for months.

566
00:30:31,107 --> 00:30:35,150
There's no way she was gonna
help you without strings attached,

567
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:39,994
but those strings,
Oliver, that's a hell of a sacrifice.

568
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:44,713
I had to look at the way that I've
been doing things.

569
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,564
It's not working.

570
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:53,452
I lost my city,
I lost my team.

571
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,822
There's a penance
for that.

572
00:30:58,531 --> 00:31:00,572
It just seems
a little drastic.

573
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:04,657
Coming from the guy
who just took a bullet for his daughter.

574
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,640
Quentin, I hope
I took the time to tell you, uh...

575
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:16,103
You're a really
good father.

576
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,525
So are you.

577
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:22,048
I had a good example.

578
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:24,853
Yeah. Your dad was
a good man.

579
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,994
I'm not talking
about my dad.

580
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:42,228
I'm sorry, but we have to
take him to the O.R. now.

581
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:46,720
Well, um, when you
get out,

582
00:31:46,797 --> 00:31:48,486
everyone will be here
waiting for you.

583
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:54,752
Thanks, Oliver.

584
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:01,080
For everything.

585
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,418
Thank you for coming.

586
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:33,315
How is he?

587
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:34,809
In surgery.

588
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:38,496
The doctors, they're
optimistic, but...

589
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:42,090
But I thought you
should probably be here.

590
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:43,979
Thank you.

591
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,660
This is probably really strange
for you, right?

592
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,955
A little.

593
00:32:57,352 --> 00:33:03,340
Are you, um...
Are you like my Laurel?

594
00:33:05,408 --> 00:33:07,098
Hardly at all.

595
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:09,965
How long is this
gonna take?

596
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:13,065
How many times
are you gonna ask that?

597
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:15,200
As many times as it takes
to find out

598
00:33:15,277 --> 00:33:17,121
how long it's
gonna take.

599
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,197
Mr. Queen.

600
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:26,270
- It's time.
- Time for what?

601
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:30,434
What is she talking about?

602
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:38,832
I'm sorry
that I haven't ex...

603
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:41,348
Explained this
to everyone.

604
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,902
Hasn't been any time.

605
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,973
There wasn't time
to explain what?

606
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,912
- You're arresting us?
- What the hell are you doing?

607
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:55,340
I thought you said
we had immunity!

608
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:58,453
You do... Thanks to him.

609
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:00,277
Oh, my God.

610
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,464
It was the only way.

611
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,671
No, it was not
the only way.

612
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:05,997
There are a million
other ways.

613
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:07,460
The judge threw
out his case.

614
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:08,538
You can't do this.

615
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:11,973
- I can. It's federal.
- Federal.

616
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,079
The bureau's going to
stay in Star City

617
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:15,871
until Diaz is
brought in,

618
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,859
but only if Oliver agreed
to turn himself in.

619
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,371
What the hell is
going on here?

620
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:27,957
Wait a minute.
Just wait.

621
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:29,885
Ahem.

622
00:34:36,184 --> 00:34:37,490
How's Quentin?

623
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,052
Mayor Lance seized
during the procedure.

624
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:43,950
The surgeons worked
to revive him.

625
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:45,990
They did everything
they could,

626
00:34:46,478 --> 00:34:50,013
but his brain was deprived
of oxygen for 7 minutes.

627
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:53,371
He's gone.

628
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,724
I'm very sorry.

629
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:07,764
Unfortunately, this
doesn't change our arrangement.

630
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:09,266
Mm-hmm.

631
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:16,818
I'm so sorry, Sara.

632
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:24,685
All of you, please take care
of each other.

633
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:29,176
Ollie.

634
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:55,280
Transport's delayed.

635
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:58,147
We'll be transferring
you in a half-hour.

636
00:36:12,351 --> 00:36:15,734
Ok. I talked to John.
We have a plan.

637
00:36:15,803 --> 00:36:17,004
We're gonna get
you out.

638
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:18,195
- No, you can't.
- Yes, we can.

639
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:20,182
We've done it before.
We got John out of...

640
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:22,008
We broke him out
of Langham Penitentiary.

641
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:23,633
Yes, we did.

642
00:36:24,756 --> 00:36:27,398
They're transferring me
to a Supermax, Felicity,

643
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:30,281
and even if I wanted
to break out,

644
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:34,281
they would just
arrest everyone,

645
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:36,391
including you.

646
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:41,742
I think that William
deserves at least one parent.

647
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:46,633
During your trial,
you said you didn't want to go public

648
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,732
because you wanted a life
after the Green Arrow.

649
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:50,077
This is that life.
You could...

650
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:51,961
I wanted to stop Diaz,

651
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:56,117
and I wanted to save
you and William more.

652
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:01,249
Not everything
went our way.

653
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:05,891
Quentin and...

654
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:12,826
That protective custody
that we talked about

655
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:15,633
for the two of you
during my trial...

656
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:18,382
- No.
- Lyla's gonna handle everything.

657
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:19,967
Uh...

658
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,274
I promise just until
Diaz is off the board.

659
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:25,911
No. I refuse to believe that
this is the only option.

660
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:27,969
We won back the city.

661
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:31,578
We got it back.

662
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:36,229
Thought I had
lost it.

663
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:37,998
Oliver...

664
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:41,316
You didn't do that alone.

665
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:42,789
I know.

666
00:37:44,602 --> 00:37:47,548
Diaz tried to kill
everybody close to me.

667
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:51,697
I had to find a way
to protect everybody.

668
00:37:57,514 --> 00:37:59,119
This was the way.

669
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,150
Is William here?

670
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:09,228
Yeah, he's outside. He's...

671
00:38:12,747 --> 00:38:16,483
He's scared.
He's confused.

672
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:20,201
He's wondering how the woman
that he's known for less than a year

673
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:22,334
is suddenly
his only parent.

674
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:25,709
Would you please
go get him.

675
00:38:26,677 --> 00:38:28,661
Yeah.

676
00:38:51,654 --> 00:38:53,577
Buddy, how you doing?

677
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:59,796
I don't understand...
What's happening.

678
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:08,827
I'm gonna explain
everything to you.

679
00:39:25,747 --> 00:39:27,866
<i>Mr. Queen,
why are you being arrested again?</i>

680
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:29,418
I have voluntarily,

681
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:31,131
uh, handed myself over
to the FBI.

682
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,345
Can you comment
any further?

683
00:39:32,422 --> 00:39:33,866
Yes, I can.

684
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:39,546
I am the Green Arrow.

685
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,283
I realize that
I've denied that claim

686
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,077
with the same conviction
with which I'm speaking now.

687
00:39:45,923 --> 00:39:48,270
I have let good people
stand accused

688
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:50,116
of things that I've done.

689
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:54,397
Roy Harper
is not the Green Arrow.

690
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:59,421
Tommy Merlyn is most certainly
not the Green Arrow.

691
00:40:00,182 --> 00:40:03,624
These are two names
on a long list of people

692
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,162
who have given so much

693
00:40:06,706 --> 00:40:09,709
and sacrificed everything

694
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,709
in the name of my crusade.

695
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:15,576
Some of them gave
their lives

696
00:40:16,168 --> 00:40:19,216
in the pursuit of one
simple objective...

697
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:21,154
To save our city.

698
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:23,748
Star City still needs saving.

699
00:40:24,895 --> 00:40:27,428
Last night, we dealt our enemy
a critical blow,

700
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:31,052
but there is still work
to be done,

701
00:40:31,835 --> 00:40:34,443
so I'm looking
to the people of this city,

702
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:39,446
I'm looking to
my allies, to my friends,

703
00:40:40,056 --> 00:40:42,274
to my partners...

704
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:45,875
and I'm asking them to continue,

705
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,235
to keep fighting.

706
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,469
I'm asking them
to complete our mission...

707
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:56,162
To save our city.

708
00:41:07,538 --> 00:41:09,874
I know you, Oliver Queen.

709
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:11,640
<i>I know...</i>

710
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:14,027
You're gonna die in here,
sucker! You're gonna...

711
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:15,918
back the hell off!
