00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,790
Jules Verne once wrote

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,660
Put two ships in the open sea

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,730
without wind or tide,
it will come together.

7
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,820
That's how my parents met.

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,730
Like two ships destined for each other.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,870
Hey, it's ok.

10
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,590
Easy, easy, easy.

11
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,780
You weren't breathing.

12
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,830
They were from different worlds.

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,670
But life, like the sea,
has a way of bringing people together.

14
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,690
I was gonna make you some eggs.

15
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,850
Just don't eat my dog, ok?

16
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,860
It's ok. It's ok. I made tea.

17
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,600
Come, try it. It'll
make you better.

18
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,700
So, who are you?

19
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,770
Atlantian.

20
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,770
Queen of Atlantis.

21
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,870
Wow. I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

22
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,770
She had fled an arranged marriage,
left her whole world behind.

23
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,950
But in my father's lighthouse,
she found something

24
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,920
unexpected.

25
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,750
And my father, found
the love of his life.

26
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,810
How about Arthur?

27
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,870
After the hurricane.

28
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,940
Afterall, he's a king, no?

29
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,810
He's more than that.

30
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,720
He's living proof our people
can co-exist.

31
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,850
He could unite our worlds
one day.

32
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,760
And the Trident could only be wielded
by the strongest Atlantean.

33
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,830
And it gave the king mastery
of the seven seas.

34
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,680
Made him so powerful.
the ocean became so jealous,

35
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,770
and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.

36
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,780
Down it fell to the bottom of the ocean.

37
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,910
But legend has it that one day

38
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,910
a new king will come

39
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,980
who will use the power of the Trident

40
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,790
to put Atlantis back together again.

41
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,700
Tom, take him!

42
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,690
Queen Atlanna.

43
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,950
By the authority of King Orvax,

44
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,960
You re ordered to return to Atlantis.

45
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,860
Atlanna!

46
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,640
Tom! Here!

47
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,700
The two worlds were never meant to meet

48
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,510
and I was a product of a love that
never should have been.

49
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,640
You don't have to do this,
Atlantean. Please.

50
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,710
Tom. They will always find me.
Next time they will send an army.

51
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,580
I have to go back.

52
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,560
It's the only way to save him.

53
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,690
To save you.

54
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,670
Where I come from,

55
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,630
the sea carries our tears away.

56
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,720
Not here. You'd feel it.

57
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,500
I will return to you
when it's safe.

58
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,760
One day.

59
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,770
Right here. At sunrise.

60
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,570
We'll be together again.

61
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,710
You stay strong, my little prince.
I'll always be with you.

62
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,650
Don't let him forget me.

63
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,690
Now today, we have better maps of Mars
than our own sea floor.

64
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,530
Come on. Come over here.
Boys, stop.

65
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,730
Hi, fishy.

66
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,640
My name's Arthur. What's yours?

67
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,580
You guys hungry?

68
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,710
Check it out. Arthur is
talking to the fish.

69
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,620
You're such a prick, Arthur.

70
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,520
Stop! Stop it!

71
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,620
Stop! Let me go!

72
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:10,050
Move it! Come on, hurry up!

73
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,010
Sir, we've secured the captain.

74
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,150
Distress signal disabled.
We're running dark in here.

75
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,190
Well they heard it, you can count on it.

76
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,220
I'll make you a deal.

77
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,100
I won't tell you how to captain,

78
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,230
and you don't tell me how to pirate.

79
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,120
Where's the rest of the crew? They've
sealed themselves up in the torpedo bay.

80
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,250
Our reputation precedes us.

81
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,120
Your reputation. This is your win.

82
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,060
Here.

83
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,100
You take this piece of junk,
this is part of your life.

84
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,260
I never told you the story behind it.

85
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,140
This was your grandfather's.

86
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,170
He was one of the navy first
fought in World War 2.

87
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,200
He was so stealthy in the water.

88
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,120
His unit nicknamed him Manta.

89
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,090
But after the war, his country
forgot about him

90
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,990
So he went back to the seas,
scavenging and surviving with his wit.

91
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:36,160
And this knife, he gave it to me
when I was your age.

92
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,190
And now, it's yours, son.

93
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,100
We just hit something.

94
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,130
- No. Something hit us.
- Sir, there's something out there.

95
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,170
- Another submarine?
- No. I think it's a man.

96
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,080
That's not a man.

97
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,260
Stopper, to the right.
Bravo team, clear the passageway.

98
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,230
Permission to come on board.

99
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,240
I've waited a long time for this.

100
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,120
Am I supposed to know who you are?

101
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,100
I scavenge the high seas.

102
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,230
You're the Aquaman.

103
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,000
We're about to meet at some point.

104
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,240
Let's not make it happen.

105
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,070
Ow!

106
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,270
Dad!

107
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,280
Dad.

108
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,180
That's your kid?

109
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,290
Shame on you.

110
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,290
You get yourself into this mess,
get yourself out of this.

111
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,100
Bastard!

112
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,090
Wait! Help me he's trapped!

113
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,190
You can't leave him like this!

114
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,030
Please!

115
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,060
You killed innocent people.

116
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,230
You ask the sea for mercy.

117
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,080
Get out of here!

118
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,080
I'll never leave you.

119
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,250
You need to live so that you can kill
that son of a bitch.

120
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,250
Now, go!

121
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,200
Go!

122
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,060
Damn you!

123
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,030
Go.

124
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,100
I'll always know where to find you.

125
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,100
Old habits.

126
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,280
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

127
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,080
You want me to hand it
in a sippy cup for you.

128
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,230
How is it that I could breathe underwater
and lose the drink on the table with you.

129
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,000
That's my superpower.

130
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,800
The same pirate who are suspected

131
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,550
in connection with the
disappearance of the Navy's

132
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,080
high classified prototype
stealth submarine.

133
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,280
And in further development, we
now have unconfirmed reports

134
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,190
that the meta-human dubbed by social media
as the Aquaman

135
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,020
was responsible for this daring rescue…

136
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,180
It's not me.

137
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,130
Oh shit. You're doing it, aren't you?

138
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,060
What Vulco trained you to do.

139
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,000
I knew you couldn't stand
on the sidelines forever.

140
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,500
Your mother always
knew you were special.

141
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,200
Don't even start.

142
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,110
She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds.

143
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,080
Please, stop.

144
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,050
Whatever Atlantis's problem
are, you're bigger than them.

145
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,110
Atlantis murdered my mother.

146
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,050
- You didn't know that for sure.
- Yes, I do.

147
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,030
They took her, for loving
you and having me.

148
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,020
And you know it.

149
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,100
Son, one day you'd have
to stop blaming yourself.

150
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,130
Hey buddy.

151
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:25,010
You'd that fish boy from the TV?

152
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,080
Oh, great.

153
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,150
Hey fish man. What'd you want?

154
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,250
I'll tell you what I want.

155
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,130
Can I get a picture with you?

156
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,160
You're like our local hero, man.

157
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,010
It'll be quick.

158
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,500
- Whatever.
- Alright. Let's do this.

159
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,250
Dont' touch me.

160
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,180
Right, that's exactly what
I'd want to do down here.

161
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,240
Here we go.
Everybody smile.

162
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,130
He understands the
significance of this meeting.

163
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,110
He'll hear you out.

164
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,070
King Orm.
- King Nereus.

165
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,090
You pick a meeting place too close to the
surface to my liking.

166
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,090
You don't recognise the
council of the kings?

167
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,170
At the site where the seven kings were
one. Our ancestors gathered here.

168
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,280
…Sat here at the head of the table.

169
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,750
Xebel were always by his side.

170
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,250
Brine, Fishermen,

171
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,770
Deserters and Trench had not yet followed.
Lost nations had not yet vanished.

172
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,850
Together we were the greatest
empire the world had ever seen.

173
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,700
But now, several long wars shattered
by archaic laws and politics

174
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,760
While the threat above
us grows undeniable.

175
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,860
Violence has always plagued the surface.

176
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
They will destroy themselves.

177
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,830
Not before destroying us first.

178
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,740
We have been hiding long enough.

179
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,740
The time has come for
Atlantis to rise again.

180
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,750
We honour you King Nereus…

181
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,980
by inviting Xebel to be the first kingdom
to join King Orm's alliance.

182
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,750
As if you have a choice, Vulko.

183
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,890
By law you need four to seven
kingdoms to send an attack.

184
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,800
The lost nations and the
Deserters have long perished.

185
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,890
The Trench were nothing but anglers.

186
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,840
The Brine wouldn't join you, and
the Fishermen are cowards.

187
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,900
With only my army to convince them,

188
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,770
your plans are still burnt.

189
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,940
But I know what you really want.

190
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,810
Once you'd obtained the
pledge of the four kingdoms,

191
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,840
you will be deemed

192
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,850
Ocean Master.

193
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,950
That's merely a title.- I'm
not a fool King Orm.

194
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,690
As Ocean Master you'll be commander of the
greatest military might on this planet.

195
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,720
I'm the natural choice to lead it.

196
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,700
Are you?

197
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,730
What about the rumours there is another?

198
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,760
An Atlantian living on the surface

199
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,710
One of royal blood.

200
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,700
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis.

201
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,060
But your claim is just weak. How can
you possibly hope to unite the empire?

202
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,410
My mother's bastard has never
even been to Atlantis.

203
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,480
His loyalty is to the…

204
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,460
Surface dwellers! Move out!

205
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,350
The king is injured!

206
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,420
I'm not trying to start a war.

207
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,320
The war has already begun.

208
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,350
Then it's time to send them
a message that we're here.

209
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,320
Here's the key.- Thank you.

210
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,390
Let's go home.

211
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,000
If your grandpa's still alive,

212
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,380
he'd be banging our heads
when we're not finishing it.

213
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,240
Tell you what. There's still
plenty of time for that.

214
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,300
Got to get you to bed.

215
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,340
Got it.

216
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,450
I've been looking for you.-
Oh no. No. No.

217
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,220
I need you to come with
me to Atlantis.- Listen.

218
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,290
I'm going to tell you the same thing
I told that rusty starfish Vulko.

219
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,200
It's been nice meeting you, lady.

220
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,430
No, thank you. I'm not interested.

221
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,300
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

222
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,200
That had nothing to do with Atlantis.

223
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,300
Your half brother, Raja Orm,
is about to declare war

224
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,310
with the surface world.
Billions will die.

225
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,370
Your people and mine.

226
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,280
We must stop him.

227
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,380
And how do you propose we do that?

228
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,380
You re the first born son of
Queen Atlanna.

229
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,220
The throne is yours by birthright.

230
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,390
The only way to stop this war

231
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,330
and save both worlds

232
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,430
is for you to take your rightful
place as King.

233
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,240
You think if I just show up,
Orm will give up the throne?

234
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,240
I'm the bastard son of a
queen your people executed.

235
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,440
Trust me. I'm no king.
I agree.

236
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,450
That's awesome. Go.

237
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,180
But, Vulko seems to believe
in you for some reason.

238
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,220
And that's why I'm here.
Vulko has learnt of the location of

239
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,280
the lost trident of
Atlantis.- Ooh, Fairy tales.

240
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,230
It's a myth.- It's not a myth.

241
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,420
With the sacred trident,
people will listen to you.

242
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,260
You can then claim your birthright

243
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,430
and dethrone Orm.

244
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,200
My birthright? It died with my mother.

245
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,260
But I'll promise you this.

246
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,300
If Orm attacks, I'll
treat him the same way

247
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,400
your people treated her.

248
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,210
With no mercy.

249
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,210
That submarine was barely operational.
But it served its purpose.

250
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,340
One of your kind intervened.

251
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,340
He is not one of us.- He killed my father.

252
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,380
Our transaction has ended.

253
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,230
Keep the money.

254
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,420
I want Aquaman.

255
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,330
Dad!

256
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,430
Dad!

257
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,380
He;s not breathing.- Move! Let me help.

258
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,190
You know I don't even know your name.

259
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,320
You may call me Mera.

260
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,320
Thank you, Mera.

261
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,250
My god.

262
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,380
This was Orm's doing.

263
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:54,260
The worst has yet to come.

264
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,340
There's a flash flood…
- Building has been destroyed…

265
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,500
….unprecedented sites from
all over the world today…

266
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:12,380
we're seeing warships and trash washed up
by massive waves.

267
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Garbage in multiple counties.

268
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,420
Decades of pollution has
been thrown back to land.

269
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,220
Question,
was this a natural disaster

270
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,320
or something else.

271
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,230
No. This was no natural disaster.

272
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,390
They threw out our garbage and warships.

273
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,460
This was our first contact with the
people of Atlantis.

274
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:35,300
Here you go again, with your
insane Atlantean theory.

275
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,270
You have absolutely no proof of this.

276
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,300
Open your eyes.

277
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,170
We already have an Atlantean
living among us

278
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,440
and his name is Aquaman.

279
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,480
What is it?

280
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,290
This is the exact spot that Vulko gave me
my first formal lesson.

281
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,280
You have to forgot all the
teachings of the surface world.

282
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:03,260
Go deeper, to uncover
your Atlantean instinct.

283
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,460
But I already know how to swim.

284
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,330
Not even close.

285
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,400
So, we're clear.

286
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,320
Help you stop this war, then I'm done.
Maybe that's for the best.

287
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,460
The ocean is more than our life soul.
It's who we are.

288
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,340
Wait. You can talk underwater?

289
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,280
Hey, I can talk underwater too!

290
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,400
This is awesome!

291
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,380
No. We can do more than just talk.

292
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,450
Being an Atlantean means being more
than just able to breathe in water.

293
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,430
Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold, and pressure.

294
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,270
And your eyes adjust to see in the dark.

295
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,250
This is awesome!

296
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,450
SO Vulko, when can I meet my mother?

297
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,320
Soon, my young prince.

298
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:19,320
When you're ready, I will take you to
Atlantis to meet the Queen.

299
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,210
I hid my ship in here.

300
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,350
Listen. I'm not getting in that thing.

301
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,350
Well to get to where we're going,
you're gonna have to.

302
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:40,310
Your fish ship has been marinated in chump
butter. I might come out like small bud.

303
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,320
That's be an improvement.

304
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,420
Yup.

305
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,070
Welcome home.

306
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,050
There is a safe house
down in the old city.

307
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,220
The high ones never
ventured to the sea floor.

308
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,250
We're here.

309
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,380
What is this?

310
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,250
These are air pockets we used as
natural air precaution.

311
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,310
Only the high ones can breathe on air.

312
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,090
Plus, it keeps the animals out.

313
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,150
They get kind of messy.

314
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,130
Vulko. Here I am old man.

315
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,190
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

316
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,230
Arthur, I wish it was under
better circumstances.

317
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,340
I can't believe Orm attacked.

318
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,210
It wasn't an attack.
Legally, he's not allowed to yet.

319
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,280
What he did to your surface warships

320
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,080
was merely a warning.-
What provoked him?

321
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,000
King Orm and your father were
ambushed by the surface.

322
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,150
The surface? I don't think so.

323
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,500
I'd still think that's
Atlantis fairytale.

324
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,320
I was there.

325
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:59,160
A surface warship fired at us.

326
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,130
Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis.

327
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,370
Giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

328
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:11,140
If we're gonna prevent this war,
you must dethrone him now.

329
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,270
How many times do I have to tell you,
I don;t want to be king.

330
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,780
Once he's named Ocean Master,
that'll be too late.

331
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,780
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you've ever seen.

332
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,790
I'm from the surface. No one's
gonna take me seriously.

333
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:25,930
Heck, I'd don't even know where to begin.

334
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,890
By winning the hearts
and minds of the people

335
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,760
by proving to them that you're worthy.

336
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,920
By retrieving this.

337
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,830
I already got one of those.

338
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,970
Not like this one you don't.

339
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,910
This is the lost Trident of Atlantis.

340
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,710
Oh, I know the story.-
It's more than a story.

341
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,940
It's real.

342
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,980
It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history.

343
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,860
Crafted from Poseidon's steel.

344
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,790
For King Atlan,
the first ruler of Atlantis.

345
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,890
Legend says, the Trident
was build with the power

346
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,770
to command the sea.

347
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,760
So what happened to it?

348
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,930
To know that, is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall.

349
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,940
When King Atlan ruler over all that was,

350
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,880
the Kingdoms of Atlantis were one.

351
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:31,810
It was a time of great prosperity and
technological advancement.

352
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,790
We've unlocked the secret
to unlimited energy

353
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,700
when the rest of the world still thought
the earth was flat.

354
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,800
But we became too ambitious,

355
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,930
too hungry for power.

356
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,710
…Swallowed us and Atlantis sank.

357
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,800
But the very power that
collapsed our civilisation

358
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,930
also paved the way
to our future.

359
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:18,770
It gave us ability to breathe underwater.

360
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,900
And so, we evolved.

361
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:22,930
Others regressed.

362
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,740
Became savage.

363
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:31,710
And the king lived out the remainder of
his days in self imposed exile.

364
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,950
Neither he, nor the Trident
were ever seen again.

365
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,690
One of our archeological team
uncovered this a few months ago.

366
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,750
It's an ancient recording dating
back to the first dynasty.

367
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,930
I believe it contained Atlan's
final message to it's people

368
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,800
and the whereabouts of the sacred
Trident.- So what does it say?

369
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,860
We don't know.

370
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,770
The technology's too old.

371
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,800
The cylinder bears the marking of the
Deserter Kingdom.

372
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,870
You must take it there
to retrieve the message.

373
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:05,970
The clue to Atlan's final resting
place is inside this.

374
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,870
You're under arrest for
illegal entry.- Go.

375
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,870
You must be seen here.

376
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,730
I don't suppose you want to
talk about this, do you?

377
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:34,860
Neither do I.

378
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,780
In the name of His Highness King Orm,
I place you under arrest.

379
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,700
Welcome to Atlantis,

380
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,870
Brother.

381
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,840
I can't believe you're finally here.

382
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,820
I've heard so many stories about you.

383
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:07,860
All these years, I'm ashamed of
my mother's surface brother.

384
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:14,900
Ashamed of the fact that I have a half breed
brother I want to run my Trident through.

385
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,810
But now that you're
finally here before me,

386
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,870
I must admit…

387
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,910
I'm conflicted.

388
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,860
You want conflict, will you take
these chains off little brother?

389
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,760
And we'll see what we can run through.

390
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,760
Yes. I see you brought our mothers weapon.

391
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,830
Is that why you've come
here after all this time?

392
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,900
To kill me?

393
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:51,770
I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying my world.

394
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,710
I see.

395
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:58,740
And how do you plan to stop the
atrocities by the surface to commit

396
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,820
over centuries polluted our waters

397
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,760
and poisoned our children.

398
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,890
Now the skies are burning our oceans

399
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,860
You've come all this way to take
side against your own people?

400
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,960
There are no sides I don't want this.

401
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,870
You've clearly chosen a side to
come here to challenge the throne

402
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,740
Thats to stop your war.

403
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,840
Are you invoking the combat of the Kings?

404
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,940
Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass whooping.

405
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,750
Well then perhaps that's how we'll proceed

406
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:36,840
Your majesty!- Orm please.

407
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,720
Don't you see?

408
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,950
If I defeat the first born son
of Atlanna in front of everyone.

409
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,990
Then all seven kingdoms
will have to concede that

410
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,690
I, am the one true king.

411
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,900
Your majesty. There is no victory
in feeding the ignorant.

412
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,800
Your brother is clearly an imbecile.

413
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,970
Your Highness. He doesn't know our ways.

414
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,770
Then he'll about to get an education.

415
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,910
Are you officially challenging me?-
Hell yes, I'll challenge you.

416
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,710
And when I win, if you win.

417
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,850
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

418
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,880
But if I win,

419
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,750
you're over.

420
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,820
Good.- So be it.

421
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,970
Challenge has been made,
and I accept.

422
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,030
Prepare him for the ring of fire!

423
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,060
Wait. What?

424
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,020
How can you be so foolish to
let Orm bait you into a fight?

425
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,790
It seems to me that'll
solve all our problems.

426
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,820
I beat him in battle. War's over.
I'm getting home.

427
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,860
You're a formidable fighter on land.

428
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,960
But here, you're out of
your element literally.

429
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,940
Orm has spent his entire life underwater.

430
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,810
Training to be a warrior.
Training to be the best.

431
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,070
You taught me how to fight.

432
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,840
Let's see if you remember anything

433
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,010
What's with the big fork?
- That's a Trident.

434
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:18,850
Now defend!

435
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,980
The hell is this?- I'll teach you the
movement to master the Trident.

436
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,060
It;s not fair.

437
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,870
This thing is too big.
Why can't I use a sword?

438
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,030
That's your mother's Trident.

439
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,910
A traditional weapon of royalty.

440
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:16,810
You'll never be a King
until you mastered it.

441
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,840
Why she never come to see me, ha?

442
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:22,050
I told you, when you're ready…-
Stop lying to me!

443
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,920
I've done everything you've asked.

444
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,860
And everytime I passed a
test, you make another one.

445
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:28,990
When am I ever gonna be good enough?

446
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,830
Did she not love me?

447
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:38,890
Your mother loved you more than
anything in the world.

448
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,030
But she had to return to Atlantis
to keep you safe.

449
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,000
Her marriage to
King Orvax was arranged a long time ago

450
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,880
so she had to marry him and bear him

451
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,850
a son, Prince Orm.

452
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,870
But Orvax eventually found out about you,

453
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:00,980
He became overwhelmed with jealousy and
sacrificed her to the creatures of the Trench

454
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:05,890
Are you saying they executed her

455
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:09,830
because she had me?

456
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,850
I remember, everything.

457
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:34,850
I have something for you.
It belonged to my mother.

458
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:43,970
Tell me, do you think she would enjoy
watching her sons murder each other?

459
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,910
I understand your fear,
your reluctance, Mera.

460
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,840
I surely do.

461
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,810
I don't want war.

462
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,070
Don't patronise me. I know you.

463
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:58,950
What you're doing is against every advise
your mother gave us when we were children.

464
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:03,850
If she were her…- But
she's not here, is she.

465
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:07,020
What my mother taught us was treason.

466
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,930
Don't follow her ways.

467
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,590
Alright, the feared ring of fire, huh?

468
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:17,590
How it works…
Let's keep your ass right here.

469
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:26,480
Vulko, will you escort my
betrothed to the royal box.

470
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,520
Let's go, Lady Mera.

471
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:49,400
Down here we have a
legend called Karathen.

472
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:53,460
An ancient sea monster so powerful
that King Atlan himself feared it.

473
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,410
So he imprisoned it.-
In the depths of the ocean.

474
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,610
And it that abyss, the creature
buys time waiting to rise again.

475
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,510
Atlantis has been lying and wait.

476
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,610
And now the beast has awaken.

477
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,390
You know, there was a time

478
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,560
when I wanted to meet
you more than anything.

479
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,590
To get to know my little brother.

480
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,470
To let him know that he wasn't alone.

481
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,500
Then we run into together.

482
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:34,410
For me I know what a dick
you turned out to be.

483
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,450
You're the reason our mother was executed.

484
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,420
And I've hated you since the beginning

485
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,590
But I do not want to kill you, Arthur.

486
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,460
I'm going to give you one chance.

487
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:59,130
Go home. Do not ever
come back to Atlantis.

488
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,000
You re not going to win it.

489
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,910
The war is coming to the surface,
whether you like it or not.

490
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,880
And I'm bringing the wrath
of the seven seas with me.

491
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,850
You know I can't let that happen.

492
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,870
I know.

493
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,790
What the hell is that?

494
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:24,720
The ring of fire.

495
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,920
Shit.

496
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:53,680
People of Atlantis, hear me. My
brother has come from the surface

497
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,950
to challenge me for the throne!

498
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,830
Let us settle this in the ancient way.

499
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:03,860
By bloodshed to the gods…

500
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,770
Never thought I'd see the
day when my own father

501
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,860
would bow to the King of Atlantis.

502
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,930
The surface dweller drew first blood.

503
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:48,740
What would you have us do?
Beg them for mercy?

504
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,740
I detest the surface as much as you do.

505
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,940
But don't you find the timing of
all of this a bit convenient?

506
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:01,790
You wouldn't be that gullible, would you?

507
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:05,850
You want this war too, don't you?

508
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:08,760
It's past time the surface dweller
earn their place in the world.

509
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,860
If this is what must be
done, then so be it.

510
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:22,870
That's my mother's Trident,
powerful but flawed like her.

511
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,750
I wield my father's.

512
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,720
And it has never known defeat!

513
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,930
I promised Atlanna I'll protect him.

514
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:30,710
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

515
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,800
I am the one true king!

516
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:16,000
You waiting for an invitation? Get in!

517
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,790
Mera!

518
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:35,850
So what's the plan?- The plan was to recover
Atlan's Trident. Then challenge Orm.

519
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,800
Ok. So we do things not in order.
Shit happens.

520
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:47,710
Heads up. We got a bogey on our six.-
What does that even mean?

521
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,770
Bad guys behind us.- We just did that.

522
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,940
Bad guys behind us.

523
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:01,750
Woah, woah, wait. You said we
shouldn't go over these walls-I did.

524
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,810
We shouldn't hide these things.-
I did! Now shut up!

525
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,780
We are not dead yet!

526
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,920
Jump!

527
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,730
Here, hold this.

528
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,740
What are you doing?-
We're gonna follow Pinnochio.

529
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,970
Who?- Never mind, come here.
Get in. Come on.

530
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:03,940
Great. So we are getting eaten.

531
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,960
How'd you even doing this
anyway?- I don't know.

532
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:34,840
I can hear them sometimes. They can hear me-
Right. We're both is some animal stomach.

533
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,900
Hey, I just saved your life.

534
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,710
I saved yours first.

535
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,720
He said, coast is clear.
So, where to now?

536
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,780
To the ocean of sand, your
people called the Sahara.

537
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:53,720
Right.

538
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,810
Thanks for the ride buddy.

539
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,760
Are you ok?

540
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,830
I've never been so high up.

541
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:33,930
We're so far from home.

542
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,960
At least you have a home.

543
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:40,770
Not anymore. I can never go back.

544
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:43,870
I betrayed everything when I
saved you at the Coliseum.

545
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:50,940
Kalau begitu, I have to take you back.

546
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,960
Atlantis is many wonderful things.

547
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:56,960
But forgiving does not.-
But you're royalty.

548
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:58,930
So is your mother.

549
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:02,750
If I go back now, I would be sacrificed
for the Trench.

550
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,730
Even my own father wouldn't take me back.

551
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:13,930
Look on the bright side. You don't have
to marry someone you're obligated.

552
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:16,780
Obligation isn't love.

553
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:19,840
This is my family and my nation.

554
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,940
And I've turned my back on both.

555
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,950
Sometimes we have to do what's right,

556
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:30,890
even if your heart aches against it.

557
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:48,770
Your Highness.

558
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,800
The tracking puts Princess Mera here.

559
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:53,940
In the desert.

560
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:58,720
You aid she was dead.- Apparently not.

561
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:02,760
Does your brother still lives as well?-
Not for long.

562
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,820
Captain Murk, assemble the
strike force immediately.- No!

563
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,960
Mira is to be arrested
and she returned to me.

564
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,730
She betrayed the throne…

565
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:12,720
She's the daughter of Xebel.

566
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:16,670
If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over.

567
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:20,940
Your Highness, we are now entering
the waters of the Fisherman Kingdom.

568
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:27,750
Securing the alliance of the other two
kingdoms should be our immediate concern.

569
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,820
My vizier is correct.

570
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,750
As usual.

571
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:43,750
Arrest them and bring back King Nereus's
daughter unharmed.

572
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:07,110
We're here.

573
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:11,990
Hey, is there anything nearby?

574
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:14,960
Nothing but deserts for hundreds
of… mate.- Nothing but deserts…

575
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,990
He's wrong!

576
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,120
Mera, no!

577
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,060
She just jumped without a parachute.

578
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:27,040
Redhead. You gotta love 'em.

579
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,100
You're crazier than I thought.

580
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:01,970
This way.

581
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:27,100
You were defeated the last time because
your surface weapons failed you.

582
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:29,160
Ours will not.

583
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:36,030
It's prototype armour for the next
generation Atlantean soldier.

584
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:39,940
Revenge is something we
Atlantean understand.

585
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:43,080
You will lead my finest
commandoes as your personal army,

586
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,140
to hunt the half breed abomination.

587
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:48,050
I can't touch them but you can.

588
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:49,990
He's fled to your world.

589
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,980
Kill him and the woman he's with

590
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:53,150
and you will be rewarded.

591
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:56,030
Killing him is my reward.

592
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:02,900
The crown jewel is too experimental.

593
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:06,100
Converge water into beams
of energised plasma.

594
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:21,750
Hmm, I think we're gonna
need a bigger helmet.

595
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:26,390
One of the tribes of Atlantis broke off and settled
here when the region was still an inland sea.

596
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,360
When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.

597
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,320
Perished? Yeah that's great.

598
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:33,390
We're getting close now.-
Yeah, close to what?

599
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,450
Dying of thirst?- I'm close
to punching your face.

600
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,360
A fight club? I didn't know you knew
how things work up here.

601
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,300
Why don;t you look around, we are lost.

602
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:43,330
You see that over there.
What is that? Na-da.

603
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,360
This place's a wasteland.

604
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:47,340
You're the one who call this
'wasteland' a home.

605
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:48,570
This isn't my home.

606
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:51,310
The whole shore doesn't look like this.

607
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,440
Oh, no. Of course not.

608
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,320
You also got disgusting cities with sewers
emptying out into our ocean

609
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:57,580
and whole mountains made out of thrash.

610
01:14:57,590 --> 01:15:01,550
You got great factories, and…

611
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,520
Ok, ok, ok. Point taken. Listen.

612
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,430
Yeah, we got some idiots running the show.
But there are good things too right.

613
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:08,420
We got green forest, big mountains,

614
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:09,400
and beautiful lakes.

615
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:13,330
You'd love them. There are like baby
oceans.- Are you trying to provoke me?

616
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:15,530
I'm just trying to say don't judge
a place before you even see it.

617
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,560
You judged Atlantis on far less.

618
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,440
No, no, no. Will you
just stop it with that.

619
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,540
No.

620
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:28,540
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just told you to
jump out of an airplane

621
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:31,450
over the middle of the desert.
And now we are stranded.

622
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,460
If you are the next
true king we're doomed.

623
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,450
That was awesome.

624
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,330
Look what I found.

625
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:18,300
What you found?- Yeah.

626
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:29,570
Check this place out.

627
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:33,350
This is badass!

628
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:39,380
This is the hall of armoury where the legend
says where Atlann's Trident was forged.

629
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,380
I don't think they are a legend anymore.

630
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,490
I was right.

631
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:55,360
It's real.

632
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,480
Nothing.

633
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,570
Of course it's not working.
It's been sitting here

634
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:40,340
collecting dust since before
the Sahara was a desert.

635
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:47,390
Man.- Since before the Sahara
was a desert.

636
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,450
Thank you for repeating what I just said.

637
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:51,480
It's completely dried out.

638
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,450
You do the best thinking when
you're not thinking at all.

639
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:58,490
Now hold still.

640
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,400
What are you doing?- We need water.

641
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:05,560
You are the closest source.
Now hold still.

642
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,480
We could've just peed on it.

643
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:57,390
King Atlann.

644
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:04,330
In this Trident resides
the power of Atlantis.

645
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:08,500
In the wrong hands, it
would bring destruction.

646
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,440
In the hands of the true heir,
it will unite all our

647
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:14,470
kingdoms above and below.

648
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,350
If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.

649
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,280
Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the hidden sea.

650
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:26,380
Look inside the bottle
for the chartered path.

651
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:29,380
Only in the hands of the true king,

652
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:32,420
can he truly see.

653
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:49,570
We can't let Orm find this.

654
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:53,380
Hey, wait! No…

655
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,470
What?

656
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:57,450
Shouldn't we have written it down first?

657
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,420
I memorised it. Didn't you?

658
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,320
Oh, yeah.

659
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,530
What did it just said?

660
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:10,360
Something something Trident.

661
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,320
It's our next stop.

662
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,510
I'm starting to think you actually
like the surface dwellers.

663
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,450
It'd be wrong to judge a place
I've never seen before.

664
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,380
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

665
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:41,580
Well, apparently she's right up on the
hill in the old castle.

666
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:44,520
I've just learnt something
very interesting.

667
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,290
Pinocchio.

668
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,450
You risk our lives on something you read
on a children's book?

669
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:55,290
Wait it's a book? How about that.

670
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:59,330
We have to go.

671
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:07,530
King Nereus, I had hoped
that our people had evolved

672
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:10,570
that war with the surface is inevitable.

673
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:16,410
It is the position of the Fishermen that
when the time comes to make ourselves known

674
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:17,480
to the lands men.

675
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,420
It shall be to educate them,

676
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:21,560
not destroy them.

677
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:25,520
I admire your lofty aspirations King…

678
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:33,590
But I suspect they are a cloud of
ink hiding the heart of coward

679
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,470
How dare you!

680
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:40,560
Please, I implore you.

681
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:44,600
Your kingdom's bloated
philosophers and flaccid moments

682
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:48,410
whose waters have gone
stagnant and it sickens me.

683
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,580
My king!

684
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,460
The king is dead.

685
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,460
Long live the heir.

686
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:08,590
Princess. Prepare your
armies, Your Highness.

687
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,400
We move against the Brine kingdom at once.

688
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:21,640
What are the records saying again?

689
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,580
Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the hidden sea.

690
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:27,580
Look into the bottle for
the chartered path.

691
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:29,610
Only in the hands of the true king,

692
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,590
can he truly see.

693
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:36,620
Look into the bottle for
the chartered path.

694
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:44,660
Oh man.- What?

695
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:53,480
But how do you know where
to point it…- Let me see.

696
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,570
What's the last line?

697
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:57,380
Only in the hands of the true king,

698
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:58,540
can he truly see.

699
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,650
He was a great General,
but he wasn't a king.

700
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,560
How do you know all this stuff?- My pops.
He make sure I know my history.

701
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:19,670
None of these guys are
kings, except this guy.

702
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:22,580
Romulos, first king of Rome.

703
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,570
Only in the hands of the true king,

704
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:28,510
can he truly see.

705
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:41,590
There it is. That's where we're heading.-
What? Let me see.

706
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:50,560
Not bad, for an imbecile huh?

707
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:54,470
Not bad at all.

708
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:58,280
Go!

709
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,360
I'll show you the same mercy
you showed my father.

710
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,330
And cut you like the fish you are.

711
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:12,370
Arthur!

712
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:19,310
Mera. They are tracking you.- What?

713
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,230
They are tracking you.

714
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:35,430
Arthur! Stay with me.

715
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,310
Arthur, wake up.

716
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:32,290
Did you steal a boat?

717
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:35,270
Are the boats at the
marina not for public use?

718
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,430
No. Those belong to people.

719
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,240
Those are Orm's elite commandoes.
The one who lead them

720
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:50,380
isn't Atlantean. I've never
seen him before.- Yeah, I have.

721
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,180
He and his father were pirates.

722
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:57,420
He blames me for his father's death.

723
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:02,450
He pick a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.

724
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:06,260
It's not how I feels.

725
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,320
It was up to me, I let him die,

726
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,340
I could save him but I didn't.

727
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:19,370
I know I made an enemy. And he could
hurt you, knowing it's my fault.

728
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,470
Well he's behind us now.

729
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:27,410
It's what lies ahead
that should concerns us.

730
01:35:28,350 --> 01:35:32,310
The chartered path leads to
the kingdom of the Trench.

731
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:36,390
That's the same creatures
that killed my mother.

732
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:40,230
Yes. She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

733
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:42,330
It has become a place of death.

734
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:45,270
I know next to nothing
about what's down there.

735
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:50,360
We should turn back.

736
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:53,440
We can still warn the surface, try to
prepare them for what's coming.

737
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,470
Turn back?
- Look. I learn from a young age

738
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:59,210
about not to show weakness.

739
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:02,220
Hey, it's not a problem
with my anger and my fist.

740
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:05,190
I'm a blunt instrument
and I'm damn good at it.

741
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:08,280
I've done nothing.
Getting my ass kicked

742
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:09,450
this whole trip.

743
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:13,260
I'm no leader. I'm not a king.

744
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,430
I do not work or play well with others.

745
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,290
And I”m not going to let you die

746
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,430
trying to turn me into something I'm not.

747
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:26,010
You think you're unworthy to lead because
we're from two different worlds.

748
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:30,100
But that is exactly why you are worthy.

749
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:33,980
You are the bridge between land and sea.

750
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,180
I can see that now.

751
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:42,130
The only question is, can you?

752
01:36:56,940 --> 01:37:00,970
The tracking on Lady Mera is still
dark, Your Highness.

753
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:05,880
Vulko, my trusted vizier.

754
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:09,750
You stood by the throne since my father.

755
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:14,790
Have you any advise for
me since this war begins

756
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:17,660
I've already given it, my king.

757
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:20,890
That I will stand by
your decision as always.

758
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:23,920
My decision…

759
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:27,870
To protect it…

760
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:30,930
While you betray it.

761
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:35,680
You think I do not know of your treachery.

762
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:39,980
That you ever made loyal to
my mother's bastard son.

763
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:46,690
That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me.

764
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,890
Do not deny it.

765
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:56,830
I do not.- Why?

766
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,970
I am a pure blood.

767
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:03,930
I have devoted my life to Atlantis.

768
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:05,880
You wanted nothing to do with it.

769
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:07,740
You swore to serve the throne.

770
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:08,770
I do serve it.

771
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:10,840
Arthur may only be half Atlantean,

772
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:15,750
but he is already twice
the king you'll ever be.

773
01:38:20,990 --> 01:38:22,860
Take him.

774
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,990
But make sure he has a view.

775
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:11,310
What the hell are these
things?- The Trench! We're here!

776
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:15,550
There's too many of them!- Come on inside!

777
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:27,650
They re from the depths.
They are afraid of lights.

778
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:47,590
Get ready to jump.

779
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:57,590
Over there!

780
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:36,590
That thing will tear us apart.
- We don't have a choice.

781
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:58,620
Arthur!

782
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:02,690
Mera!

783
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:37,490
Mera! Mera!

784
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:00,750
Mera!

785
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:51,530
Arthur.- Mom.

786
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:32,700
They sacrificed me to the Trench.

787
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:36,650
But I survived, fought my
way through like you did,

788
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:39,710
and I ended up here.- You've been here
alone for twenty years?

789
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:43,690
Yes. Come, sit here.

790
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:51,650
You must forgive me.
Forgive me for everything.

791
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,670
This happened because you had me.

792
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,570
Not for having you.

793
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,570
None of this is your fault.

794
01:46:00,570 --> 01:46:01,730
I made a choice.

795
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:05,470
I had to leave to say you.

796
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,780
To save your father.

797
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:13,710
Tell me, tell me about him. Is he….

798
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:20,520
He still walks to the end of the dock…

799
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,750
Every morning.

800
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,630
…Every day.

801
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:32,700
Waiting for you.

802
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:41,700
Why didn't you ever come back?

803
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:50,550
Because the portal that brought you here
will never let us return.

804
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,620
The Trident is the only way back.

805
01:46:54,630 --> 01:46:59,530
But it is guarded by the Karathen.

806
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:03,590
The creature from our legend is real.

807
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,660
It lies beyond the waterfall.

808
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:14,510
We'll go with you. We fight it together.
- No.

809
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:16,670
Its; too powerful.

810
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:19,680
I've tried many times over the years.

811
01:47:20,590 --> 01:47:23,650
The creature will only allow
the true king to pass.

812
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,580
You're afraid.

813
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,550
Yes.

814
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,490
Good.

815
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,790
You're ready.

816
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:41,640
Atlantis had always had a king.

817
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:44,510
Now it needs something more.

818
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:46,600
What could be greater than a king?

819
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:50,550
A hero.

820
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:52,550
A king only fights for its nation.

821
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:56,720
You fight for everyone.

822
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:30,510
You do not belong here.

823
01:49:31,550 --> 01:49:39,550
I have guarded the Trident against false kings
since the beginning and for a thousand years.

824
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:45,490
I have seen the greatest champion tried,

825
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:46,660
and failed.

826
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:52,640
But never have I sense
one as unworthy as you.

827
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:59,600
You dare to come here with your tainted
mongrel blood

828
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:03,640
to claim Atlantis's greatest treasure?

829
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:07,640
So be it.

830
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,550
Half breed.

831
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:32,630
You thought yourself worthy?

832
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:35,610
You thought yourself a king?

833
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:40,640
You dishonour this place
with your presence.

834
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:52,650
You're right. I am a half breed
mongrel.

835
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:57,660
But I did not come here because I
thought I was worthy. I know I'm not.

836
01:50:57,700 --> 01:51:04,510
You understand me.-
I do.

837
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:11,540
No mortal has conversed
with me since King Atlan.

838
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:15,720
Who are you?

839
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:17,720
I'm nobody.

840
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:22,490
I came because I have no choice.

841
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:26,630
I came to save my home,

842
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:28,660
and the people that I love.

843
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:34,970
I came because the Trident
is our only hope.

844
01:51:34,970 --> 01:51:37,870
And if that's not good enough,

845
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:41,840
then screw you.

846
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:50,750
No man has ever freed the
Trident from Atlann's grip.

847
01:51:50,790 --> 01:51:54,920
Should he deemed you unworthy,

848
01:51:54,930 --> 01:52:00,760
Well I haven't insisted in yours

849
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,860
and I am damaged

850
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:35,720
The one true king.

851
01:53:48,710 --> 01:53:55,940
Remember, the Brine are a powerful savage group It will sweep
us all and declare their leadership will turn the tide.

852
01:53:55,950 --> 01:54:01,680
Defeat the Brine king and you will command
the greatest military might on this planet.

853
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:04,950
Today we unite our kingdoms.

854
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:08,820
Tomorrow we scorch the surface!

855
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:15,760
Rise, Atlantians!

856
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:39,720
Go!

857
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,560
No, we need him.

858
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:03,630
You expect me to address
you as Your Highness?

859
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,540
Not Your Highness

860
01:56:05,740 --> 01:56:10,680
Call me Ocean Master.

861
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:15,550
You can take my army,
you sub belly slut,

862
01:56:15,590 --> 01:56:18,680
You will never have my allegiance!

863
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:19,710
So be it!

864
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:29,720
The King has risen.

865
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,660
Attack!

866
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:40,520
There's too many casualties.
We have to stop fighting now.

867
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:43,650
I'll find my father.
You must defeat Orm.

868
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:48,700
And what if I can't?-
Last time you was in his element.

869
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:52,860
This time, make him fight in yours.

870
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:24,830
What's the plan again?-
Plan is not to get killed.

871
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:28,740
Ya. Good plan. Not get killed.

872
02:01:01,670 --> 02:01:04,700
The Trident. He has the
Trident.- Impossible!

873
02:01:21,630 --> 02:01:23,750
Stand down! Let her pass.

874
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,690
Please, father.

875
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:26,790
He has the Trident.

876
02:01:26,830 --> 02:01:28,860
I know you think this was necessary.

877
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:31,830
But Arthur is king by our most sacred law.

878
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,860
And if you turn your back on that now

879
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:36,810
then the Atlantis you're fighting
for is already dead.- It's true.

880
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:40,610
The half breed wields King
Atlan's Trident.- He …the sea.

881
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:44,640
Then the half breed is your king.

882
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:03,920
Vulko! Come on, he needs our help.

883
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:05,930
We can't. Look.

884
02:03:05,930 --> 02:03:08,960
The people must bear witness.

885
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:16,670
The Trident doesn't change what you are.

886
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:19,740
Half breed bastard.

887
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:24,810
Atlantis will never
accept you as it's King.

888
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:29,720
Well then my blood shed

889
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,950
will the gods make on your will.

890
02:04:02,750 --> 02:04:03,810
Yield the throne.

891
02:05:39,950 --> 02:05:42,750
Finish it.- Yield the throne.

892
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:44,850
Mercy is not our way.

893
02:05:45,890 --> 02:05:48,830
Maybe you don't know this brother.

894
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:55,890
But I'm not one of you.- Do it!

895
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:01,860
Kill me!- No!

896
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:05,930
That is enough killing!

897
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:13,980
Mother.

898
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:17,720
Orm, my son.

899
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:28,890
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

900
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:31,770
Come on.

901
02:06:37,940 --> 02:06:44,940
I don't understand. We thought…-
I know. Arthur saved me.

902
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:51,810
You're with him?- I am.

903
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:57,690
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

904
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:01,800
But you have been misguided.

905
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:06,930
Your father taught you that there
were two worlds. He was wrong.

906
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:14,670
The land and the sea are one.

907
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:35,730
My Queen.

908
02:07:37,730 --> 02:07:38,790
Vulko.

909
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:45,930
Take him. But make sure he has a view.

910
02:07:52,850 --> 02:07:56,910
When you're ready… let's talk.

911
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:18,870
People of Atlantis, today
we gather in bloodshed.

912
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:23,840
I give you, King
Arthur, of Atlantis.

913
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:28,780
Hail to the King!

914
02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:41,830
So what do I do now?-
Be their king.

915
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:46,830
This is gonna be fun.

916
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:39,310
I love you.-
I love you too.

917
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:41,420
You're back.- Yes.

918
02:09:49,230 --> 02:09:51,290
My father was my housekeeper.

919
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:55,240
My mother was a queen.

920
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,430
They were never meant to meet.

921
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:04,300
But their love saved the world.

922
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:08,220
They made me what I am.

923
02:10:08,250 --> 02:10:12,280
A son of the land, a king of the seas.

924
02:10:14,190 --> 02:10:18,180
I am the protector of the deep.

925
02:10:18,190 --> 02:10:21,180
I am Aquaman.
